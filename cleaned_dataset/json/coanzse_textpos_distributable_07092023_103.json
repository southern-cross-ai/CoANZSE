    "text": "we 'll get underway again and we 've got gin zero up first with trans Francesca Bradley Kristensen and Sean we would like to present the city school [Music] [Laughter] good I got a good score for my exit extracurricular activities climate change is being identified in the infrastructure strategy as one of the four most significant issues impacting the infrastructure planning and delivery however your current thirty-year infrastructure strategy does not include specific climate mitigation and adaptation projects such as identifying areas to defend and which ones to retreat from it is proposed that these projects will be delayed until the 2021 infrastructure strategy so this means that in the structural renewals will continue to be undertaken across the city at the risk of newly replaced infrastructure eventually being abandoned and at the cost of other in yours being not being carried out so to address the impacts of climate change the class of 2018 needs to identify mitigating and edit ativ pathways to inform decisions of future efficient investments and resilient infrastructure the class is taking a step in this direction through the land drainage recovery program and but to improve this achievement standard from an a to an e we recommend prioritizing the protection of our city 's infrastructure from natural hazards in the 2018 30-year infrastructure strategy alternative sources of funding Christchurch City School has expressed a willingness to explore implementing a regional fuel tax this will be a difficult challenge for the students as it will not be a simple solution and will require some thorough research skills a local fuel tax is not a fair option as flat tax that will disproportionately affect those of low social socioeconomic status and does not ensure an equitable economic transition towards a carbon-neutral future to arrive at the best outcome we recommend investigating all options available first such as improving our public transport system to provide a viable alternative to driving a toll road system for commuters from the northern and western reaches of Canterbury and analyzing the measured effects of imposing a regional fuel tax and overseas examples we would also advise that using a fuel tax to accelerate repairs to earthquake damaged roads will not help is the current and future congestion of the city long-term plan regarding the delayed funding to our cycleway Network raises serious concerns about this class 's behavior and honesty the completion of our cycle a network cannot be delayed to 2028 this delay does not align with the classes leadership boards a carbon-neutral City and neglects a modal shift our city needs for future resilience it is also counter to the long term plans proposal to see an increase in the use of active transport and improvements in road safety the current proposed work in the plan will only meet the needs of the 5% cycling portion of our commuting population the truth 2000 2013 census shows that our cycling population is that 7% and so this person in turn is likely to increase since then so delaying the completion of this cycle a network will fail not only to meet a current commuting demand but in no way who meet the increased future demand to just achieve this achievement standard we advise the class of 2018 to commit to completing the major cycle routes and the local cycle way networks by 2022 is a green industry long term is showing exemplary leadership in addressing climate change future generations would like to commend the class for making climate change leadership a strategic direction by signing the global covenant mayors for climate and energy late last year the class committed to targeting ambitious measurable climate and energy initiatives that lead to an inclusive just lower mission and climate resilient future we look forward to seeing the strategic action plan to deliver on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through mitigation and adaptation one of the immediate requirements of this covenant is to understand how this plan will impact on infrastructure planning and delivery over the next thirty years so again we would like to remind the class of the importance of prioritizing the protection of our city 's infrastructure in the 30 year infrastructure strategy the class has also set its own target of becoming carbon neutral by 2030 and there is also looking at developing strategies that would enable Christchurch as a city to become carbon neutral by 2050 we look forward to seeing innovation and sustainable development committee strategies and framework to achieve these targets and are hopeful that this efforts are already underway with the 100 percent battery electric car sharing scheme the long-term plans proposal to replace street lighting with LEDs and an energy efficiency program of work so in summary to improve on these achievement standards we recommend the following actions Wow fast-track your climate resilience approach by including climate action and the 2018 30-year infrastructure strategy to thoroughly investigate all transfer Improvement options available and the possible implications of introducing original fuel tax and three commits to completing the major cycle roads and local cycleway Network by 2022 yes thank you very much I 'm the Tim thank you very much for this I have never received an a little own two eyes of my life Davidson you mentioned in your states that 7% of the city years cycleways the city 's population new cycle ways in terms of allocating our resources to transport needs what sort of level of participation on cycle ways would you see as being reflective of a good investment and soar towards targets that they want to meet any improvement is a good improvement obviously you 'd need to balance in that there is huge return on the southwest so thank you very much I just want to start asking you about the petrol tax because you made the point that in fact it 's a flat tax and would penalize people poorer so I 'm just wondering Oh a toll presumably that would have to be weird was an alternate route for people that also wouldn 't isn 't it also a fairly flat rate at all my other question to you too is going to be can you piay chess about some evidence from other countries we we 're told on roads work well we haven 't fully explored the toll road but we 're saying it should be on the table as a possible option in terms of we just see in Canterbury there is a major disconnect between we have so many people coming from northern Canterbury and out from Rolleston and we don 't see this knee being addressed toll road may not be the answer but you coming in from other councils that rights that they are fitting the infrastructure of the Christchurch City Council your submission much appreciated _"

    "text": "and next we have Michael Esposito from the wood scenic line welcome Michael I think you merely angeas oh and cancellous thinking for the opportunities or willingly speak to my submission it 's like to reiterate Joanna 's comments for on the importance of tourism to the local industry with a local community and just a few other facts which I 'm probably sure all aware of but Torrez employs one and ten workers the area according to destination 2025 and contribute 1.8 billion dollars to the local economy and it 's interesting interesting to note the drop down effect so with tourism every dollar spent a further three dollars 20 is generated in the wider community and that 's more than any other industry and I 've put on my submissions see some research papers on there I 'd like to speak on a number of issues I know I have a little time of walking questions so I 'll be brief I applaud the council for the affirmative commitment financial commitment to a cruise booth at Littleton reasons for the latest delays Hill Weaver a farcical they asked neighborhood crews booth opening by the start of the summer 2020 every other city in New Zealand that has cruise booths are crowing about the importance to the local economy but it 's been long overdue for our city to joining I would go as far to introduce an incentive scheme for management at the port based on meeting this deadline was less importance the next two years anyway on freight volumes they 'll get the job done enough has already been said about the state of the square I wonder whether it would be more palatable for the council to treat each section of the square as a separate project and saying this agreeing on overall concept to the square which I believe were pretty close and achieve but then each section having a detailed design and a detail funding I see actually the southern part of the square at the moment so if we 're talking about the og Bilbo GB building the Stinson Hotel new spec building be ready by the end of next year the Ritson building across the road be ready for the next year overall concept for the square we 're going into a detailed design yep [Music] combo Street then we could look at the library next year next section and then the part in front of the Convention Center when we think that 's really quite common about additional security lighting the CBD I endorse CCP a submission on introducing in the base of the program but also here that we probably that we would need additional police we just need to look at the ongoing Kofi t and the vandalism to the newly opened Victoria Street to see the problem that were Victoria Square to see the problem that we have there under the trends how this significance of tourism the importance to locals the benefit of central city can not be underestimated I 've got an article here actually from 2015 2016 when the tram could no longer go up to new Regent Street due to the dangerous buildings after the vent ones are quite quite here from rocks sorry from Ross oxen them trade on Thursday was down about 50% because the trim was no longer passing through so retail well first a quest I 'm glad to the trans is that when the cathedral is restored that is impeccable impeccable imperative it 's a period of that the transit hit operating throughout this entire project to achieve this the project needs to contain within the current Cathedral footprint seeking lastly I 'd like to talk about the high street extension for the tramway understand the councillors put aside three million for this we have a ongoing and great relationship with us with the council and we looking at various options like to voice my preferred option though and that is to complete the loop that was first proposed before the earthquake just the benefits of completing the loop it makes it rains more efficient prepared to stop start a fear that we can 't have at Litchfield Street what we 've noticed is that with the longer the route the list demand there is some customers it 's not dramatic but certainly visitors want to see as much as I can one day so we need to be as efficient as possible when we 're operating the tramway instead of visitors swapping seats at the end of Litchfield so they 're not travelling backwards they were no longer need to do this we would be able to introduce trailers once again to the circuit and also the possibility of introducing double-decker trams we have had safety concerns of changing the poles that looks good Street so drivers forgetting to change poles so it 's causing damage to trams and blackouts to the second we believe that the placement loop can be pleated completed within the budgeted program of three month again somebody look at soon and it does not move let options of further extensions if we think is necessary and the yeast camel so just briefly first pages the pre-earthquake approved route and if you see the arrow that 's where we currently stopping what I 'm proposing is that the loop is completed there goes down let 's field poplar Lane and back out through High Street if we 're tuned to that second page what some pink is already in place so the tracks are really there we just need to put in tracks where little tail there which if we think in 10 20 years time we need to extend the tracks as possible so any questions how does that Lincoln with the high street but that we 've already confirmed if we don 't do the rest of stage 2 so what so what we 're saying is that would go through the first block allostery but not the second block that would be very upsetting to the people down high street I don 't think so because what we 're doing is we 're proposing that we have a stop there on the corner so we 're promoting high street as well so like voting the shops down they do we already approved it and you know people like Richard Peebles and that came along and support of the the High Street extension being done who 's we the council it 's the three million yeah no I wasn 't sticking up in Litchfield it was but the section between Sherman 's and Jessa we 've already approved it 's the three million sorry the the chair money goes to let 's down there is what I 'm saying it 's not achieving along no no but but what the bit that you 've congratulated us for approving is the charm street it 's an S of Street section because you asked us to do it before the shops opened Richard people 's asked us to do it over the shop so no other job yep done yeah I didn 't approve it so I didn 't ask for that okay so so others others wanted there you know I give you but yeah and even I 've heard discussions of council kata which is not yarn that people 's isn 't what I understand they 're not unhappy that the trim won 't go down there but if the tracks have to go and they want to get the tricks to go in before they get so what you 're saying is is that that you 'd want to trade out the three million that 's on budget for that section and do the connector connecting loop that 's six in the high street some of those simple wire to complete okay right well I 'm obviously confused and I will need to take some food there advice so that 's fine so D and then Yannick I just on the tram thing you 're saying these benefits of doing the loop rather than just doing the high street weather have to swap over and then go backwards is a lot of benefits for you it 's a time constraint think so because you think you can have you do another block of going through another one to another to Caesar traffic law what I mean is no no you 're going through a hundred traffic law I think no what I mean is the actual operation of the trend you can 't use sample Dicker 's or you can 't have like train train trailers before the quote you said trailers to travel trailers and you can only do that if you 've got a full loop not not a few having to swap um you know it 's interesting I didn 't realize that at all that is quite important yeah Yanni a lot of time today but you just very high level feedback around it 's staged to now with all the roadworks and cycle lanes and things that we 've done on that in their area is that now completely sort of off the table because it just the monies being spent it doesn 't make any practical sense in you that 's right counselor Stage two was recently playing for really the stadium so X is long-term exist in the stadium so will the stadium there something and with what 's happened in that area station to use off the table yeah thank you very much for that there 's obviously just a little bit of questioning that I 've got to do online but I think we 'll include it in our report back as to you know what is done but we may have to consider talking to a few other people as well about about the issue but thank you very much for bringing this to the table much appreciated and on that yes and thank you for what you do I do I saw the tram the other night and it was people when people having a great time so great great way to get around okay everyone we 're up to the adjournment for for lunch and _"

    "text": "could I invite you in an Oregon crash it shins it good morning got a good morning madam Rea thank you for the opportunity to be here to speak to our LTP submission I have with me Robin Andrews who is our GM of corporate services for Christchurch in ZD I want to start by saying that like all of you we are committed to a vision of Christchurch as a city of opportunity we we all explore our lives with impact but to achieve this all of us in this room need to be courageous we need to make decisions that make Christchurch not only resilient strong and complete but also exciting vibrant and socially cohesive if we all in this room are to achieve our ambitions for this region we simply must attract more people and our agency has part of the responsibility for that as you all know over the past six years investment has flowed from the private sector and local and central government to rebuild our city at its simplest we now have an incredible new city we have new retail space acres of office and restaurants in fact more than we had pre-crack we need people to fill those so without a significant increase in demand the continued regeneration of our city could easily stall and we must front up to their reality we would be left with a partially complete Central City empty buildings and falling property yields closing this gap requires new economic activity into the city more visitors more population and new business investment and relying on grow on existing economic growth as we know is simply not sufficient it will not close the gap as you are all aware Christchurch in zeod has requested an additional 1.4 million through the LTP to support activity to support closing first gap those funds would allow us to support international education attract and bid for major events and conjunction with vbase to establish a film us to capture in the national film industry I want to speak briefly to the impact of major events the the benefit is clear and demonstrated they bring social benefit social cohesion and also clear and demonstrated economic benefit for every council dollar that you spend you will benefit and other cities gets this they are aggressive in bidding for events on behalf of their communities I don 't need to remind any of us in this room of the massive economic benefit that each year has brought to debating to show just how successful this could be those three concerts that were held over Easter weekend attracted 68,000 people into Dunedin and with an estimated economic benefit of 34 million dollars one third of those tickets were sold here in Christchurch that was money that was sucked out of our community and spent in another city over Easter weekend and and its surplus needing successful entertaining those events because it 's successfully bid for them and they outbid Christchurch the All Blacks are playing a Nelson for the same reason Nelson was able to provide a guaranteed financial return to New Zealand rugby in a way that Christchurch was not we simply could not compete over the past few years vbase has bid for a great many events and missed out on those and every basis to mates that 's worth I lost hundred million dollars to disadvantaged Christchurch and it will diminish our ambition to be vibrant attractive to residents and attractive to visitors we are growing at Christ 's futures need our capability to attract sponsorship funding that 's an important part of our model going forward but the seed fund that we 've been for through the LTP is important to kick starting that process on turn quickly to the business events aspect of our funding application we 've good for 300 thousand to support a major business event I 'm thrilled to be absolute you know that we have successfully bid for trends and 2020 which is a wonderful opportunity for us to showcase the region to a global audience I was down in Dunedin earlier this week which has successfully bid for this year 's event and the benefit of the hundreds of international buyers in the global stage that sporting dunedin was clear and evident down in that city we need to realize that same ambition international education we have been for 60,000 for international education we estimate that for every dollar that you spend on international education there is a for the region when Christchurch indeed was formed this council directed us to undertake international education activity you did not fund us to do that we 've been funding that from our reserves and those are now exhausted we will not be able to support international education at current levels without this additional funding but so for a small investment there you can have a big impact and finally the film office our funding request includes one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to establish the film office excuse me and that would help Christchurch share allowed to gain a larger share of a 3.2 billion dollar film economy and to put that into context Christchurch currently gets just 1% of that 1% of a 3.2 billion dollar industry and the South Island only 3 percent again we have a chance with a very small investment to but make big impact so to conclude and to support our written submission if Christchurch NZ is not successful in its application we will be unable to compete with other regions for major events we will not be able to support the film industry we will lose an opportunity that you have on the table for social cohesion and economic benefit we are I believe at a crossroads as a city we can see a low bar we can see a conservative position or we can follow a bold and ambitious path and realize the benefit that the post great rebuild has created for all of us but to do this we need to be committed to a path of vibrancy energy and growth we need to retain our brightest young people we need to create social cohesion by bringing people together and attracting interest from around the world let 's not leave courage vision and positivity to other cities let 's 11 live the legacy of the city of explorers and city makers who have gone before us and let 's truly create Christchurch as an opportunity as a city of opportunity for all I urge you today to invest wisely I understand that you have a great many competing priorities the investment that we are asking you to make as important for the well-being of our city invest in growth invest in succeed on your behalf thank you I would like to start off by congratulating you I 'm one of the 2020 but for trends that 's huge for Christchurch and I mean obviously with the convention center confirmed for that time it 's it 's going to be really showcasing something new and spectacular I think 2020 one 's going to be a pretty major year for us as well for a number of reasons so so congratulations on that and second I 'm going to take personal responsibility for the International Education there was absolutely a no-brainer for me the international education had to be in your brief but of course I didn 't understand the nature of the relationship between Christchurch educated and education New Zealand so it is something that we do need to take on board so thank you very much for your submission I 'll start with down just a very quick question is our city ready for what for what you 're proposing like all the major events all the stuff are we ready no I think it 's a great question countless works the funding education recovery so we we have the space we have activated our central city and we know that dimension of those people within it and Sarah thank you it 's a follow-on from it we 've hit some submitters say specifically on the attracting major events portion of the funding which is the majority of it that potentially we could leave that parcel of funding for a couple of years until closer time to when the stadium might be really and that we don 't have the venue 's potentially right now to be able to cope with something yeah so the nature of major events and business event bidding is that happens several years in advance so we 're betting now for 2020 2021 so now it 's not an option to leave it but as I say it 's our capability around sponsorship and commercial revenue grows and that 's a deliberate part of our strategy we intend to off see at the investment by the right path Jamie it was exactly my questions I 'm fine very good Mike so you 're requesters for the only additional money you need for that long-term plan direction I know our requesters every year obviously but we would like to have the capacity to modify our requests as time goes on and out okay so it 's 1.4 million dollars every year the next 10 years Jimmy regarding to the trends will be held in projects 2020 modulation my understanding a moment have been in Tunisian but we got into a funding allocation lost you know in 2020 we have this way the catechol is formed Toula ni TK their category is a major event upon the 300k in a business event and Convention which which which which which have the trains would be funded from the 300,000 application and a business events does that answer question thank you time 's up so thank you very much for your presentation thank you _"

choice for our whole combined areas the areas we represented Bromley Wilson Phillips town you 've got enough isn 't real person Sumner and that consultation was unique successful and very well committed by both in estate in the expect Christensen the importance of the consultations we fell that confirmed that people wanted to go to local and they they wanted to be in the max their wider community accurate ribs continue to engage with lemon college beyond the research project as we share a common passion interest in the well-being of our area of well-being of children youth of our shared areas the live important project there 's another real opportunity to bring all our communities together somewhere we were we were that will offer people from many neighborhoods to have full enjoyment of the company of one another this project will have under great all our family and a really healthy way the terms of work for or long to have a facility of any kind so the need is right through that whole a broad area so we can amend the council for putting in this LTP that you will finally address that long silence as this long-standing disparity in allocate 21 million to build and the facility and it 's currently title of the month Boston Paul as in past years because it has been on budget wow-whee and for the council not to delay this project any further we know the nurse at mission last year we endorsed the draft plan which stated Paul Paul facility would commence in April 2018 and be complete by the end of next year after submission the Paul was delayed to a completion date of 2021 this was disappointing and does not really serve our community as well to have this project delayed in terms of the location that 's being identified for the poll we think it 's fabulous we think it 's you know it 's a good location at Central these amazing transport routes on both sides of that very easily and just 's been put on which people from all along that transport route will be able to access the new port we just turn to the scope of the project I know you 've caught up an awesome haul and it 's been talked about this being a particular small area but regardless of their people from out the whole of the area that we represent are going to use this for so so you just I just want you to be fully cognizant of the fact that this port is going to be a very well used facility and it 's going to have the budget summary thank you for the allocation of the 21 million on this plan as I said that we think the size is fabulous please remember the pool will be very humanely used so don 't wait well I 'll start with D on Mike Aaron thanks for the presentation I mean there 's a lot of aquatics facilities gonna sort of happen in the city so we need to sort of start thinking smart about how we operate them I think have you had potentially we could operate this and a bit more of a partnership so that it doesn 't sort of all the operating costs don 't necessarily land on the council or have you had any thoughts around this and hold it up so yeah their history is that we have here partnerships and I believe we could do again the community is amazing and doesn 't matter whether it 's low socio-economic high socio-economic things like 21 million dollars worth oh do you think their budgets enough before it actually span right across the summer well since that was weird this whole project that game for the whole area I would hope that 's always been in the planners mind when rod Donal as I 'd say it came to the last you talk to Donald okay that 's where this project so we believe people are gonna use that porkers of the transport routes so even if you think you 're going to be able to keep it confined we know they can do the community pull for five million dollars why do you know that because we 've they 're community designed that actually puts it personally built community Paula you once a boob precisely in so obviously we have Bloomwood Woolston and we 've got 21 million dollar port just sounds gonna stretch all the way subnet at the same time we 're building obviously quite a significant poner part of the city for for a lot more and I 'm just wondering if if you 're in Sumner potentially if if the pools right you would actually travel those few extra K 's and go into the heart of the city and use that facility which is probably going to be a lot bigger then the little bit poor I 'm happy to have a little bit Paul Austin Paul but it 's actually meeting the needs of the community bionaire I 'm hearing the community actually stretches from Lynnwood right out to Sumner which is a huge area it 's it 's always develop the needles there people sometimes people will take these tutorial and go to the midrib it 's like it 's been Wiccans but as you 're traveling back from work or so yeah I do not believe you could build a 5 million dollars to do errand yes so mindset see my follow on from mics around fit for purpose facility the the area that this Paul represents is where I grew up I grew up in st. John Street went illuminant immediate winter Bromley primary and the type of kids that lived in that area quite different to other areas so the needs I think are different and what attracts them to a pole is quite quite it is obvious that I 'm different and in so I look at the indoor facility that goes at st. Albans which is the learn to swim pole but for the kids that are I grew up with in number than Woolston they liked jumping off things that 's why we went to Centennial rather than other poles cause real add a jump off the boards so for me this the the cost is irrelevant it 's more around the scope that would you be open to a conversation with the community about what they actually want as the facility not necessarily say but get the best result for the community because I see a big community facility there like with a hall as well as the Lentz Wimpole and then a big outdoor Pacific staff pole where his jumping clips and all sorts of things into a lagoon style rather than a traditional pole that you get more like over my side of town now which is the ground condom which is pretty boring to take kids to be honest um I think everyone would like the selection of course all then offered anything cold I don 't think thank you clean good question if you 've been part of any needs analyses turn away similar to Aaron 's question I think for your community you know identifying specific needs for yes yeah well through any any recent survey needs analysis working in that community no we our work was really done in relation to the school well so we we know what the needs are but we haven 't done any research on their documents to go to either these are the needs for Lynwood or excuse me to participate in to that but look if we can ask staff to provide that background information that has been collated over the years it 's a very long-standing issue so well thank you very much for your submission I 'm sorry but I do need to move along and if I don 't move along to the next submitter then we 'll get behind so thank you very much for coming in thank you could I invite _"

    "text": "we have the Canterbury agricultural and pastoral Association just bone welcome [Music] by T minutes I 'll keep it quick listen um the first thing I want to make clear is that I 'm not here looking for money for the Kenya Brio empathy Association we I think it 's important for council that 's good I think what we are what I 'm here to talk about is the jewel of the southwest it 's the Canterbury Agricultural Park which is obviously owned by the city from one corner of the bottom corner it 's 2,000 meters and from the bottom corner to Hagley Park is another 2,000 meters so you 've got this extraordinary asset 128 hectares which compares to Hagler parks 164 hectares and literally within the city bounds my presentation today is simply to explain why allocating fifty thousand dollars a year for ten years is a good use of funds as I mentioned not a request of funds for the cambrian peer so she Asian I have a deep appreciation ladies and gentlemen for the very complex series of decisions you 're making regarding the so why should you choose to allocate spending on this park over the next 10 years return so far purchased a park in 2004 circuit 2 million off the A&P Association who at the time were in financial difficulty lift them with an 800,000 de an unsold the strip of the park to NZTA for 6 million in recently mind a significant portion of the park for gravel so you could save 2 or 3 million in building Annapoorna why so during your time in that time at 20 yard years we 've built a sports pavilion changing room for 700,000 of rugby league and that 's the only investment we 've made in it so possibly you 're up by six million circa which might make the park the most profitable park purchase in recent history your ongoing cubics budget for the park for the past 10 years beside this besides that changing room complex is zero you purchased a pristine park off the Canterbury OMP Association with significant roading infrastructure and fencing infrastructure and power underground and have not spent any money on capital improvements to this investment magnificent asset that the council owns we really need to maintain that roading Network gates fencing and that 's why I 'm proposing the 50,000 a year in capex related spending to be controlled by counsels Park Division but allocated in cooperation with the Canterbury OMP Association who have a long-standing management contract to run the park so why will it benefit the city this is a really important book right so you have tasks Christchurch indeed with delivering major events and amongst other things your submission document clearly asks if the city sees in additional 1.4 million dollars of funding is appropriate use of funds I 'm not sure what this major event looks like but I know for a fact that you currently don 't have a stadium hosted and hectic park is heavily used and doesn 't have an underground power network with millions of dollars in the red zone although appealing as a potential of inter destination would require 20 times the amount of funding that I am requesting to build the necessary infrastructure here 's the thing right if you want to build you can 's village that for example feeds the noonim point of why sports hub that you 've built I can pitch a thousand tents or put a thousand camper vans on site I can power the entire system with existing infrastructure I can build showers I can build toilets that all feed into an existing established drainage and sewage system and I can host a banquet for nine hundred people on the writing for disabled building that 's already near on soil Croce 's ed as in many ways based on the 80 model and 18 in Auckland which is the economic development organization identified the gem strategy for major events right Golf equine and maroon they focused on these three areas because it enabled them to attract highly worth individuals to the city to invest in the city and spend cash with local businesses here 's the thing no other city in New Zealand has a facility the size and scale of Canterbury agricultural park that has 200 stables an indoor equestrian arena and an outdoor equestrian arena in the center of the city surrounded by parkland with the underground Christian event you can imagine take from me the only guy in town that runs a major event you have a gift staring you in the face and the Canterbury Agricultural pay the cost of setting up an event of scale at this site is significantly lower than anywhere else in New Zealand because it 's designed for major events and the 50 grand a year that you spend would pale into comparison when measured against if the 1.4 million you 're going to give to croce teams need to activate major events somewhere else in the city if you activate a big event somewhere else simply the cost of hiring toilets putting power in place will draw for the 50,000 a year that I 'm suggesting use and beast and a fully functioning event space public space then there 's the show three-day showcase of what Canterbury has to offer it 's a shopfront for the city hundred thousand people stroll through it thus alone should be enough reason for us to be continually investing and then look in the field of that part and then these the community I see every day I see kids learning to ride their bikes I see kids learning to race on their bikes I see people sailing land yachts I have guy who practices speed skating became the world champion motor car shows truck shows a Christian events rugby league community dog walkers running events this park is getting busier and busier and where the Canterbury OMP Association want to encourage more and more community groups to use it but there 's a cost to using it things we are out so the community through its rates I believe and the Association believes should have the chance to reinvest in their own se priorities with that funding Canterbury identified a requirement for electronic gates that gives both public access and security to the park now the total for three sets of gates was Serkis 70,000 there 's about partnerships right we 've already raised 45 grand of it but literally that money is sitting in a bank account so we 've done the hard work what we 're looking for is the extra 25 from the council and that 's one of application to the parks division and they said come and make an application here because there 's no capex funding for your Park roading repairs when you purchase this site 20 years ago 25 years ago it had perfect roading nothing has been done to maintain that rating in 25 years it 's an asset that continually needs to be updated you currently have heavy traffic movements through as you accessing the point of white site behind it and you 're excavating the flood retention Basin across the road computers so you are putting a lot of here be traffic through that site for the record I 've done my time right I go to Bunnings every year my credit card I buy the a she felt repair cuts I take them back to the park I put them out in the Sun so they heat up pull them out of the bag and then I smash all the potholes well no if you 're good at it and I 'm suggesting we get some professionals and do it properly over an organized period of time here 's the thing a beautiful park and there 's a dump with old rubble and rubbish you know that 's been identified as having a special center and there 's no budget to clean that out we should look at this 50,000 a year as a way of going right what are the priorities roading dump gates and a happy for the council parks team to have control over there as long as they engage with us and take our suggestions future development capital development opportunities I think the community that uses the park needs to have an opportunity to come up with ideas and put it to those council staff and then of course these the economic value of your park had like 15 million dollars of economic value from the show alone the Canterbury Sale yards company the central and largest buying and selling of livestock in the South autumn that gives farmers a clear reason to come into the city every Wednesday to do business a question of each play look we 've already got the most prestigious feet in the on the Canterbury show before so got the South means and finally writing for the disabled charity with its enormous indoor facility I mean how could anybody put a value or a number on giving disabled children the freedom to ride a horse and live so partnerships is a really key part of this the Canterbury OMP Association partnered with everybody on the site to help them and work with them we partnered with parks division the leasing division and then of course Christchurch in said I work closely with Christchurch in seed and evolving the brain for the show and the strategic direction so it maps with what they 're looking to do but I 've also talking having Heba conversations with all of these groups about how do we create websites that demonstrate the value of this park and show community groups how they can activate it and how crocheting Zeid can push out to event organizers throughout the world that they can come in and access this extraordinary opportunity so I also mentioned the gates as a simple solution we knew we had to get money from the other users of the park because some of party with the forty five thousand dollars so we do know that and looking for money we 've got an opportunity to get money from our elsewhere as well so in summary let 's just finish it up because I can see I got 53 seconds ladies and gentleman this site is the only site in the South Island 128 hectares of open ground and a multi-million dollar Paolini work underground to feed any imagine any major event you can imagine it 's trees in our 24 years old and beginning to mature and we know that the magical ingredient of Hagley Park is its trees and its open spaces Canterbury Agricultural Park has both and as they are maturing the true scale and beauty of this park is becoming apparent it 's a gift to the city and not only returned a cash profit to you and its first 20 years but will continue to give a profit and give back to the community in the same way that Hagley Park has over the last hundred plus years invite any questions well we 've run out of time for one and but look think huge if that was I mean it was a very powerful submission I don 't think that questions are going to you know draw out anything further from you you made a really powerful presentation so nothing thanks very much for coming thank you very much _"

    "text": "right could I have the crash you children 's Christmas parade just please [Music] please morning Mia New Zealander fellow cancellous my name is Colonel Yurchenko and I 'm an officer in the New Zealand ketosis and I 've been us here to speak on behalf of the trust because of my involvement with the parade not only as a volunteering brain but also organize each year a whole lot of volunteers to help Marshall on the parade and I 've also provided operational support for the parade for the last 25 years I 'm sure we 'll have a copy of an up-to-date background of the trust in its workings it was attached to a submission Peter Townsend spoke to you last year on your behalf and so all I 'm doing is pretty much speaking on what he spoke on last year and so we 're not repeating ourselves too much I 'm here to ask for funding assistance of 35,000 the trust was told last year it would have to make application again this year to you all for a top-up through the 65,000 that we already parade and at the time people spoke to you last year we did not know where the parade would proceed because of insufficient funding you then committed support and also late August last year the event secured and naming rights sponsor for three years so this is multimedia communication limited and basically they state that because is local business and is in the community obviously we leaked to the media last year about the lack of funding and they didn 't want see the parade not heaven so they came in and have taken up naming rights for this year next year so these support couldn 't have come at a bit of time in trust is greatly it 's really grateful to the commitment obviously Multimedia 's involvement does not eliminate the complete financial cost of the event which is the running costs of the event so the rates the insurance floats storage and of course the continuing ongoing cost of the traffic management plan for example this year will be eighteen thousand dollars to run the parade also we have just had a notification from the current landlord so the trustees met to discuss that issue last night and the main concerns for the trust is that the landlord is asking basically for six year lease renewal which were there insufficient funding in the state and also the pending possible move to a new building create other issues for the trust as well to try and work through a budget was at each sorry a budget for this year 's parade is 235,000 last year it was slightly dearer at 237 thousand dollars and we should break even from last year so we 're looking at trying to do the same for this year thanks greatly to your financial support last year of their additional 35,000 they 're enabled the parade to continue otherwise it would have not been able to run and obviously and we don 't want me to heaven the parade is loved and well attended event for the ratepayers of Christchurch and personally speaking for myself I 'd take my children to the parade and I think for us to lose the centre parade when we 've lost so many other things over the we don 't want it to be another victim of the earthquake in in financial support and I think they continue attendance by you know if the of people to the parade shows that people enjoy the prey they take their children along here and you know I think it 's an iconic event all going to plan the trust will be able to move on from hopefully these funding anxieties from the 2019 2020 year hopefully if we can secure this new premise that allow us to obviously concentrate on what the trust was set up to do really and it 's to you know signify the beginning of the festive season and to provide the mums dads and children of Christchurch in Canberra in its environment with them ninety minutes of fun excitement and joy for all and obviously you can see over the years of the parade the parade 's growing outs and they 're a multi-cultural parade with so many different groups all involved we have over two and a half thousand participants in the parade in five hundred people that volunteer their time to get work all the truck drivers that you know donate their time and their trucks to take all these groups to the parade the other thing we 're also working on is that fer new premises come to fruition and hopefully we see no reason why it shouldn 't a vision for the future is to instigate a program that the community can be more actively involved in the parade on an ongoing basis through the year and there we hopefully with the new building if it comes to fruition that will be have to set that up as an area where people can come and have a look at all the center probe floats and things throughout the year and get school groups along and make it and another area or another activity for people to actually come and see during the year this hopefully will encourage us to bring a younger generation and be more involved in the parade in Alera us our future volunteers to keep the parade going as you know the praise has been going for 72 years so it 's also the Shh planned to move from the city and we had to go out to record and Road so ideally we 're currently obviously working with the council to bring the braid back into the city so to sort of reinvigorate hopefully bring a lot more people back into the sea and that 's working hopefully to go down and do a street in finish it Margaret may he so what a bit of place to finish then one of their show pieces of the city all those children afterwards could all go to yeah it will be cast but again those areas and we also we were talking this morning about looking at whether or not we can tie something and with later mass square as well we 've got that facility the earlier the parade 's going to go past so if we can get try and look at getting more about festive afterwards people don 't necessarily just all disperse from the parade but you know when we used to finish at Hagley Park we had all the vendors set up in the air and there was a bit of a be able to reinvigorate that sort of area as well so that 's so in conclusion the christchurch children 's christmas petrus i see you give consideration to supporting this year 's parade by allocating thirty-five thousand dollars in this year 's ltp is requested thank you for your consideration thank you just a question on the you say and the submission that in addition to the rent rates and insurance council agreed to make traffic management costs for some reason this commitment seems to have dissipated the trust is that a loss to know why without any consultation but now here 's another substantial financial burden to meet each year when did that happen when did we when did we agree to meet the traffic management costs and and when was that stopped so it 's not a recent thing right so crack the council four years ago until four years ago always meet the costs of the traffic management plan but they started charging those to you as an organization four years ago though thank you I still go to the st. afraid with my now my grandchildren you any interest that you are talking about having the community being involved and this position in the future with it and I 'm just wondering like currently I 'm like do you do surveys of sort of opinion about Hell the paraders and do you get some feedback that way okay one of the things I 've noticed is that like and it 's in your submission that overall the parade can be take it and say up to four airs so I 'm just wondering like have you had feedback on the length of the parade and especially say for families and children [Music] [Music] thank you original parade from start to finish this only one hour 30 from the toilet starter and two o 'clock only center across the railway line a trickle in it 337 it 's any other people get the you know probably at one o 'clock because they want a good seat you know just going going through the budget and it was a boy what a tight budget but it 's just it 's a shame in the world we live in year and the wardrobe budgets 500 a year and yet we spend 18 mm on traffic management what and yet it 's afraid to show floats and costumes and stuff like that I think this has got a little bit backwards maybe you do need attribute management plan I mean it would be a desire all the kids being run over when I was the one that the one that upsets me is the rental and I 'm really upset that their Assunta that there 's been a delay you know that and in terms of taking over some premises so anyway well that 's something that we 'll have to take on board so thank you very much for your submission much appreciated thank you I _"

    "text": "the next submission is the Canterbury international education leadership Accord stiff us free we 've got Beth Knowles with Sigrid a cigarette know what coming as well yes good morning thief it 's a hard act to follow [Laughter] put a nice a nice segue into a slightly related issue yeah my name is Moses and I 'm the international director at era Institute of Canterbury thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Canterbury International Education Leadership Award this consists of senior leadership from the two universities University of Canterbury and Lincoln University era and secondary intermediate and primary schools involved in international education from a strategic perspective with Christchurch New Zealand firstly I would like to commend the city on the forming of Christchurch New Zealand this really leads other cities and their economic development strategies by bringing together tourism international education and business our biggest competitors in New Zealand for the attraction of international students are Auckland Wellington and Dunedin these and other cities invest heavily in regional promotion because they see the value from a visitor and talent perspective to be effective Christchurch proven they can do this to really support and help us to recover our market share of the international students choosing to come and study in New Zealand only and attracts more international students than Christchurch did you know that prior to the earthquakes one and five international students coming to study in New Zealand chose Christchurch sadly the statistic is now only one in ten students although as student numbers are coming back we still need investment and support to return to our former market share every dollar you invest will return 23 economic value my question to you is not should you invest that 's actually can you afford not to invest to very innovative initiative launched launched through Christchurch New Zealand are the job really program and the International Student Ambassador Program by 2031 the city will face a shortage of 73,000 workers the job ready program is already helping to fill the skill shortages in the city with some of our international graduates did you know that 43 43 percent of skilled migrant category principle applicants in New Zealand were previously on a student visa the welcome but perhaps more importantly ensuring they add value and feel a sense of belonging in our community they are contribute in so many ways including volunteering social media marketing of the city and bringing youthful diversity and colorful events into the city the total economic value add of international students to Christchurch City is 310 million dollars please help us to grow this to our target of 1 billion by 2025 we are really on the way to achieve that we know we can achieve this with your help this export education sector also provides 5000 high value jobs and Christchurch in the Canterbury region and it provides opportunities for our local youth population to take part in language and cultural experiences that increases their employability at a time when cultural competencies will be one of the most important skills for the next generation of New Zealanders International Education connects Christchurch to the world without city investment much of the current activity undertaken by Christchurch New Zealand in partnership with the education providers will cease we need to take full advantage of the opportunity that the new organization brings and support from the City Council thank you again for this opportunity to speak on behalf of Christchurch New Zealand submission and the International thank you thank you Sigrid speaking as well with Stuart might as well come to the table as well because you 're representing crashy educated as the NIP following submission so we 'll just deal with them all together thank you good morning come on Amir counselors to executives my name is Jerome I 'm Scottish I 'm also chair of Christchurch educated to sector party representing the primary the intermediate secondary Polytechnic the universities and the private training establishments here in the city I 'm here today to support the proposed 1.4 million dollar investment in Christchurch NZ set out on page 11 of the LTP Christchurch New Zealand has been charged with igniting a bold ambition connecting changemakers stimulating the economic activity and attracting visitors to Christchurch a key tenant to that strategy is the continued support for and growth in international education so let me paint a picture of the sector Canterbury has over 11,000 international students spending on average 44 thousand dollars New Zealand post study and contribute to the region through high-value employment of those 20% will gain residency over time and that 's likely to grow in the coming years as long term skills shortages effect Canterbury in 2016 the OECD stated that New Zealand emigration population is one of the most skilled and proficient as Beth noted Christchurch New Zealand estimate that for every one dollar invested in international education there 's a 23 economic value our international education is a sizeable industry supporting 5,000 high-value jobs in the region and contributing over 310 million dollars to the region and the city directly and we want to see that rise to 1 billion by 2025 with your help and support the advantage for you of such growth is that in one regard you would achieve a father two hundred and fifty million dollars in attributed rate value from student accommodation based on the current 2018 rating values but it 's not just about the students themselves there 's a wider visitor economy and there 's a wider economic landscape sixty percent of all international students will be visited by will spend 3,600 each per visit and that will bring seventeen million dollars to the Christchurch in Canterbury economy this year alone there 's already commented on the role the International Education plays and weight of tourism and skills development and I commander for such comments the case for targeted investment is compelling and there are external risks we are in a highly competitive market both globally and nationally as Beth mentioned Wellington will toggle in my home city of Hamilton are aggressive in promoting themselves as an international study destination we cannot afford to lag behind our competitors in this significant economy market Christchurch needs to promote itself to an international youth market and to make them feel connected and welcomed to the city first and to the institution 's second to do that we need a cohesive and bold education value proposition that focuses on this city first and foremost and to align and connect to the industry to amplify that message Christchurch New Zealand should be charged with promoting Christchurch as a 21st century education hub connecting into and supporting local and regional business needs there is and articulates the value of Christchurch as a study and lifestyle destination they should promote offshore events in Burma motions and government delegations and provide intelligence and support to their education providers as and where appropriate councillors over the last few days you 've had many submissions asking for investments talking about priorities and why this and why that should happen so I 'll finish if I made by professing what the mayor said and our LTP document we can achieve so much more when we work together Christchurch New Zealand has an outstanding opportunity to take the proposed investments and to work together with a range of stakeholders including International Education to make a real difference to the culture social youth and economic transformation of this proud city with solid independent and consistent and consistent economic facts to bike the case I commend the proposal to council hello my name is Sigrid yeah me and I 'll be talking about my experiences throughout my undergraduate years I was involved with the International Student Association and I was inducted as an ambassador last 2014 by Leanne herself and I 'm from then on I became the association 's president and was involved in so many City activities got to meet so many people from around the world and was able to widen my horizon and my networks basically being an ambassador was a momentous achievement as I was able to represent my city be a city ambassador and it has changed my life through my involvement I improved my soft skills my cultural competence my leadership skills and I was able to feel so connected to my city and so passionate about it this was the same for my friends who were also a part of the ambassador and internship programs ran by Christchurch and Zed through the networks I have developed I was able to get a full-time job and I decided to stay in Christchurch and call this my home for ever more programs like this represent what Christchurch is truly about it is a welcoming city of opportunities that we celebrate our city 's rich diversity and we encourage young people like me to be involved to be Christchurch to the ambassadors to help people feel connected with our city and to proudly call Christchurch our home thank you so much and greatly appreciate their time thank you very much for your presentations I want to ask you it was a comment made in an earlier submission you might have been here that in fact New Zealand in Christchurch we 're good at bringing people to air country we 're not so great sometimes looking after them so I just really want to ask you about support that your organization 's might be able to offer in terms of your structures for the readers for young people who come because they can help the communities of the older generations that come different and you 've chosen to come as an international student so I think we do have a lot of support services and the Student Ambassador Program there 's a lot of volunteer work that happens in the communities so I think that 's a thank you just on a weight of aspect I think New Zealand 's well served by the court of practice for the pastoral care of international students which is a legislative explicit way in terms of care of students I think the Christchurch educated as a incorporated body one of the primary goals is to support the the membership to understand those obligations and to work together so what we find is through Christ just educated we 've got a lot of opportunities to discuss how we do things how we support students it 's not perfect but certainly there is a there 's a legislative framework and there is an intent by the memberships and within Christchurch to support the students as best we can and we would want to see that continue thank you I 've reviewed the Canterbury and international education destination 2025 one of six Yoko is the wipin inclusive multi-college community we 're still don 't feel welcome radio for their positive social impact also council we launched you know multiple strategy are you aware yes okay that 's good let 's go also one of course very close so how to strengthen this communication its most important to integrate all those resources and regarding review those the strategy for the further implementation formation when most much more careful with the way we reason with things and to leverage off each other and I think the city is very forward-thinking in forming that organization and I mean the Student Ambassador Program is a program where the multicultural community we can link into that program and take advantage thank you can I just say secret you mentioned that some organizations would not you said would not mark it off sure if the City Council didn 't invest who would they be I think it 's been particularly difficult since the earthquakes for the school sector and we have a huge reduction in the number of English providers in the city they have but there 's new ones coming in they 're trying to establish themselves we want those businesses to be successful it has a flow-on effect when people learn the English language they go on to higher levels of learning so it 's important I think it 's more likely to be the schools it would find it difficulties yeah I would think the feedback we 've had is that the smaller schools who are wanting the critical mass that are looking for the city for support and an overarching strategy those are the people that would be reticent to go forward because they just don 't have the experience and the knowledge base that they can draw upon and they would feel is that investment there against something else so that as there is a tension their behalf their trace working with tourism it stops all the duplication of resources it 's really really good after my speak of them thank you very much for your submission today very much appreciated thank you right we 've got _"

    "text": "carried and we have a fantastic presentation I believe to start us off with Hagley colleague and we have might fail us or undertand on sorry my haven 't_''_16.59 got my glasses on earlier of Sally and come forward please good morning welcome Jenica dodgy cousin Ian oh oh oh tacky Couture money you wrongly Coco Oh Tara tena koutou tena koutou tena title card oh well you know Salam me Howie Prive konnichiwa never studied good morning I 'm on principle of heavy presenting with me today dr. surrender tendon who is the president of the Christchurch modern Cultural Council highly enough Sally representing the Afghani community Taipan who is the Headlee diversity manager and I 'd also like to acknowledge our supporters many of them colorful they 're with us here today and and we are speaking on behalf of Headley of communities and organizations who support a multicultural center being developed at Headley for refugee and migrant people across our city I 'd like to begin if I call it bastard secondary school would it be one of the most diverse in the country but 65 different Community College held a day of celebration with darts and displays and of course great food and if you 're still hungry after the food runs out you can eat the plates heckling College diversity Support Manager Taipan says the International Day was a chance for students from different nationalities to celebrate their culture Vietnam China Korea and Japan Philippines or someone Tongan and you can name it after this time Kurdish yeah so many so therefore you see there as we have ten different classes classroom is open to welcome and to show all these things and you can see that it 's not only a physical space but also that the place that they send belonging to and and that is they own the place so therefore in each classroom here you can see that they really highlight the same belongings they say this is Filipinos Kona this is the someone corner so so the sense of belonging is very important start out Kiwi reported in January hairy College has put food plans for a new purpose-built Multicultural Center and is vying to get some funding from the center in place and this is in the right track we are now submitting a proposal and so that is the feedback the concentrations are from the community to the City Council and we whoever we can raise our voice and our project to the long term plan of the City Council and we hope that it will have a bigger place so that it 's only people from different countries and when they come here they can also have a place because you know that we that is more than 200 students and plus people from the public also campaign so what more than with 500 people to die estimated [Applause] Bridget Rutherford CTV News look I think I wanted us to just cheer that video because I think it gives us a strong sense of why we 're here today and our role with refugee and migrant people in Christchurch and I 'd like if I could to talk briefly to the points that sit up here and this really is a once only opportunity and I need to paint a picture around Canterbury schools redevelopment and Hilary occur inside that redevelopment we have said with our long history of linking with refugee and migrant communities of core communities we have told our acid '_''_299.12 to have master planners building a multicultural centre to support a range of work that my colleagues will talk about today is something that should sit with this master plan that 17 million dollars must go towards teaching and learning spaces it is to replace what we have in a pretty unsatisfactory form in many cases with classrooms and learning areas that are new and purpose-built so that that 's the focus there what we want to do and I think that the equation is a really important one here is there it 's a once only opportunity because innocence we have lobbied very strongly for this we have seen a prime corner of the higly college site facing Headley Park is to be set aside for the development of the center and there that must be fected and right from the get-go it 's really important to to understand how our board sees this as as a as an emotive what we it for a typo there initial curious exercise on this place the costing of a baby million on a full center with teaching and learning spaces we are seeking 7 million dollars from the council to support the building of the center multi-agency spaces that 's it with this we put around there one way of thinking about it is seventeen million dollars of redevelopment money this doesn 't sit as an isolated space this absolutely complements that Center the land is free and in fact they 're out there are precedents for ministry land I 've sought assurances from child director of education Canterbury I have a letter from Education Minister Chris Hopkins supporting the development in principle and acknowledging what a fantastic step dust would be so the other part of this and again this may well be attractive for council is while this is a council person it 's a center for called communities we need to make that very clear this the operational and maintenance costs of this building will be taken over by Higley they will be that will become part of our operation in then we have looked inside it I speak for our board of trustees and the things I have said today I need to add that too so let me just make one more point in terms of that there if we looked at our the place of new of Christchurch in New Zealand and if you like a super diverse and increasingly and super diverse country in City it 's really really important to to note that we are moving our city is moving and it 's noted in the multicultural strategy very clearly there the shape of our city is changing immensely and continues to change and in fact toy if you could move that on one further ditch reflected in our culturally England worst the diverse populations and Christchurch um I I note with caution though one of the findings in our in the feasibility study and I think the council for the apart funding of the study last year a feasibility study into the center which though in the brief of that study wants to look at the engagement of agencies in communities but there was a and look we only have to look at it I 'll pick leading demographer professor Paul spoon these words who talks about the music 's elements very good at bringing people into the country but pretty poor looking after them and with new arrivals refugee arrivals shadows for Christchurch for 2019 I would suggest the center is a very timely investment in a citywide council funded community facility and of course for our existing called communities already in crisis so a little more about Hagley just just to finish we have we 've been a regional hub for refugees and migrants in for education for learning for family support since 1979 and we are a home to 65 different ethnicities in terms of our school and our bilingual liaison workers which work across the city are based there and many counselors sitting around and the council chambers not today no they 're in a senior in a power we of course have day and night and weekend classes for called communities we are genuinely a school for the city we are not here advocating for central Christchurch we are advocating character status officially draws our role from throughout the city there is reflected in this application I 'd like to pause affirm that I can 't wait a mere and introduce dr. cylinder and I surrender telling so I 'm tell them to to continue with their presentation today thank you thank you Mike for inviting me on behalf of the military council to speak in support of your submission for the development of Multicultural Center honorable mayor councillors council staff and fellow supporters of the multicultural sector tena koutou tena koutou tena koutou katoa marina namaste and I 'm sure my friend Mike has already greeted in many languages which are represented in Christchurch by over 180 ethnicities and at this stage I would like to remind you all and us that Chrysler City Council had actually helped establish Christchurch multi-culture council Chrysler ethnic Council formally in 1988 and that time the Auckland Wellington and Kaito multi-culti councils were set up so we acknowledge the support of Chrysler City Council for supporting multicultural communities ethnic council and also running forums like intercultural assembly inform meetings there which is the like to acknowledge the support given by City Council for over last three decades to culture to ethnic and multi-ethnic events and other activities so this is nothing new for City Council you know we acknowledge that you know that you have you know support you have supported the ethnic communities and agencies and the I would also like to acknowledge the development and the adoption of the multi culture strategy by the City Council and multicultural cancel as well as the other agencies working in the ethnic sector space are here to support the implementation of that so we we have come here to speak in support of the submission for the development of Multicultural Center as just before the earthquake in 2010-11 you know there used to be a refugee and migrant center and but that closed down and number of services offered by many ethnic sector agencies you know had to keep on shifting from one place to other and there is no central place for you know the new migrants or the refugees or their families or the settled migrants to go to you know seek center which is not just an office space it also would have hall and other facilities for running activities events meetings forums workshops not only by the ethnic communities but also by the agencies and also by the City Council our government you know the Hekla college and other much council and other agencies continue the running you know various capacity-building programs for the new migrants and refugees and settle migrants we we see that very important program and we would like to see that happening at a central place like multicultural center where people can you know feel they you know there is a place they belong to and we are also you know for example you know very keen to run cultural competency programs not just for the you know Palkia Kiwis or the natives to learn about the the migrants culture but vice versa as well we want you know the the new migrants in the settlements and refugees to learn the key viana thing as well to learn the te reo Maori and the Maori protocols you know the Pacific Island countries protocols and culture so looking for a multicultural centre which is going to be suitable for all age groups for both male and female for you know as I said all age groups children adult senior citizens elderlies female people from different cultures and different faith groups so the the the the facilities will be there which you know take care of cultural sensitivity you know also faith sensitivity gender sensitivity where girls can feel safe to gather and also boys to learn the key way of learning and also bring their own sports and other you know country games like Kabaddi and other things you know so it 's a place for learning for everybody you know for wider community members as well you know so it 's not just for migrants and refugees for the wider community and the the the you know the big advantage of this place is going to be that the elderly people you know will have a place to get together you know to learn life skills to learn English and share their own life stories with the wider community or with people from other cultures and experience they are here to contribute to the society so in summary multicultural council you know as I mentioned earlier acknowledge the continued support from the City Council for multicultural communities and for agencies and we look forward to your support for developing and building you know Center which is you know a platform facility to be able to run the activities to meet the goals as stated in the current medical study document which is of course working document and we are all here to support City Council thank you very much good morning my name is alia from a constant community thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today at the hearing of the submissions to the longtail of the city I will speak for myself and for many other woman 's from culture and linguistically diverse communities like Bouton 's Nepal Somalia a little in Styria it would be a China in Korea wouldn 't that I have the privilege to work with them help them and meet them but they cannot be here today to speak up and raise their voice because of the living in isolation not confident enough to step up and step out to ask for what we deserve as we are residents of the city where we should feel belong to the K and care about always about just we want applies that we could use for many different purposes responsive to the needs of our ethnic groups today I am advocate for others those are my words but not my voice they are the voice are stuffed in the truth of many woman 's in our communities we [Applause] need a place to go because we live in a solution with nowhere to go especially we are worried about children and elderly people our entry woman just sit at home lonely as they living in white a living environment is different to Afghanistan where we all will work that all houses was close and near by each other so they can gather in visit easily so we need applies for any people to get out of their home we don 't have a place for our different events our culture our difference to European we don 't meet friends have for special dice which is matter ties in Renaissance celebration after we could eat this is our young people want to go in our community house because they don 't want to the Aryan people don 't want to go the community house which we have in the past have done because they don 't want to be judged with by other people they are pointing always the girls and boys will take whatever for their hairstyle whatever for their clothes and everything we have a special salvation like eat mini to over we need to spend overnight here but no place to go and have a separation one of the most important metal for us which we are need applies to maintain our language in cultures for young new zealand-born children for example I teach for 10 years in farsi school as a volunteer worker and today i am very proud that those students I helped them in learned they their own language like Farsi they are very successful at the moment in the society they are very good and I 'm pleased which I tend and also seek support it hardly and for first years we was at Peto but when they moved and we seek for help to Hadley likewise many another language schools like Russian Bhutanese Iran and also six similar support because renting place is very expensive in another things I would like to share with you who we are a woman not free as a man especially in our culture is completely different we are owned by her husband it 's truly yeah just I 'm worried about young girls they are talented energetic but they aren 't deep in the boundaries which controls them they can express themselves as they should and they deserve they have not placed that they feel safe to share their ideas their dreams and their wishes they are young but live in our solution and suffering from mental health problems even when they are suffer mental hit problems they can 't share their problems because there is no safe place for them to talk and share and express your feelings unfortunately in our prevalence mental illness is considered a frenzy we cannot share our feelings because we our culture 's and to fluidly show our cultures we have a community house but I think yes we have a community house but the angles not going there I would like to give example today initially we invited four girls to dance today and share our culture with you but but they refused because they don 't feel safe to dance outside ugly as their homes they feel connected therefore they don 't their which we had in 2012 of a plane we had international days the our girls had a good performance at Hagley and not anywhere else they don 't feel safe so that is the reason they refused instead we have we will have some boys to dance today and hope you will enjoy him in the dance the dance of the boy is the end of our presentation there 's another important things applies for all to learn we need a place to learn the ways we learn to meet each other learn from each other and share advices with each other all aids needs a place to learn most of us especially women 's from others damage the pride of our husbands that 's true it makes our husband Andy living in New Zealand is complete completely different from Afghanistan like we need a place where we meet each other to learn basic life skills in New Zealand like cooking in New Zealand West London driving and love computers so that we can participate in New Zealand society we need a place that whenever we have a problem and need help and need help we can go we need a place that whatever we have problems and need help with it we can go we wish we could have a central hub for refugee and migrant like middle so that we can access services even after many years resettlement we still can go back to seek information help and services whenever we need applies for us and belong to us like we have a reward in our language it says if the beggar was like a sultan in his country like the most important things in at the moment is like not me just all the community concern about will beings we have a woman living in anti-depression for many many years because they are like me which were not example I 'm just standing the high dose of tablets in medication they can access the social services because we are human not free as a main we are isolated in even in our homes we stuck in our culture and living our solution we can 't participate in society therefore amid the medication effect badly in our body and we need in we end up with high dose and high the high cost of the miracle this is very costly to the governmental therefore we need help in term of domestic violence we don 't know where to go and where to seek help for example I am working as a liaison sorry as a helper motion PTI CRS but I found really hard very hard to type the domestic violence topic to their homes because I had very bad reaction from their means yeah if we have a spice to have gather the old woman 's and we can share they can share with us and we can share with them they when we don 't know where to go and where to seek help if we know the place we can 't access the services because the gender problems this is another matter in issues we are not free as a man men can sit in the room but as a woman we should sit in somewhere else as a woman we are not into men we are owned by the main this is part of our culture many elderly people can drive and can ask for help because of husband anger we can help each other if we have a safe place to meet safe place to meet in secret waves seek help as a part of the school services like during the school and after school most of the ladies disability NEET Afghan head because they are alone and isolated another issues we have a huge problems in accessing social services but we need help once our buildings improved we can participate more actively actively in the society and help develop international relation with our home countries across the border we have energetic and talented young people but we to the society government 's wants to have economic capital this cannot happen without positive will being among us our will being is a big social capital to the city investment in our well-being is investment in social cultural and economic capitals for the city where we are portable here are some voices that the residents of the city rise we deserve a decent investment because we paid the rate to the City Council we understand that the financial means the scare unlimited means scary and limited but their priority for will be in by improving accessibility to social and cultural services of the utmost important because it 's help helps bring and benefits from the all aspects social culture and economics and it helps to build the city inclusive for everyone not just for one other places culture this is another big challenge yes I understand it 's a big challenge for all of us big communities like Chinese that they have many people supporting them but they still find it difficult we are smaller groups such a harder because we don 't have money and don 't have small ethnic groups like us like Bhutanese Iranian Nepalese edit area it will be a core dish that we need help from the City Council that should deserve and finally sorted hope I have meant to take your time thank you for your attention I would like to invite TOI diversity manager she will present some key idea about the center thank you thank you thank you alia and good morning everyone and I will be very quick because I don 't want to I would prefer to visit some minute so that is we can ask questions to our team so the key idea here that is that I would like to just place Tom put some very initial key features of the design of the Multicultural Center I 'm so based on the needs of the communities and other big communities or small communities so that we all reflected based on that through our facilities study so we think that is should have a place that is cater for all the purposes of the communities and the agency so a hot seat arrangements for agency so that is also comes in and to say and to learn and what they think that is important so that they can learn and also strengthen the communities among themselves through our own the services that we just already available here in Napoli and we think that it 's a very good model very good model of operations a very very good model of partnership between the central government and local governments and with the participation and involvement of a community so we see that it 's a really good investment for social capital and cultural capital so which is where we can build crachit City become a very cultural inclusive and also a place of for all of us so that we can feel that we belong to either that we come from majority or we come from ethnic minorities so so that is and we see that there 's a very good opportunity because why because that is disease actually redevelopment so then we have the money and we have a support from a central government and what we need here that is very small part of our repayment and so you can see there that it 's it the crisis it occurs on input that we 're looking between a six or seven million not in one one-shot payment but also over in the years starting next year 2019 across a couple of years and the place that we look for that is just a recession and welcome area so there 's this all community can feel such a place and belonging so that they feel safe like even the girls example that are just saying so that they can dance and happily they can dance they can perform and happily but they cannot be there here even that is they know that is the City Council as the that is their place as well but they they don 't feel safe so that is the reception we 're coming every is very important and so smooth smooth meeting place because in our country we don 't go too bad we don 't go yeah so that is the that is some idea oh good you like to have a damn cyst or we can also yeah yeah we [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] these young men are renowned as 17 to 21 there are full-time a recent program maybe learning English and maths and other areas for the last two years Sofia who is a full-time adult student as in our foundation course Sofia [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that concludes the presentation thank you okay but we 've really only got a couple minutes for questions but I want to invite cancer Jimmy chin I can assure you that he has been an extremely strong advocate for this particular submission so thank you so much group for the summation with comprehending the information about two questions okay first one based on your mic and also Toyota hesitation seeking the phantom from the council is one nation particularly no type of mistake seven million dollars Korea Thai you are placed for six to seven years on a to do you seeking is a six or seven million dollars to me the the constant ear is based on out on acuity exercise that we did initially to scope the facility clearly the as a top figure to develop the cinder as we 've described today second questions that I reviewed a heist written estimation but you on page 20 we got into the lost estate holders particular in refugee migrant suppose sector the list some of the you know the the key person has been changed where the new ones near fully support its new multi culture center built in agriculture we have extensive consultations with all those agencies so we have in the list that we will see that is 116 are as 162 responses that is including all thousand 33 different agency all in the whole sector so what we also presented in an informative so that is the interagency meeting who are active even Oh even knew the members of the medical community is representing over 180 ethnicities as well as the agencies you know everybody support the need for the multi culture center not just an office space but also a place where people can get that so individuals may you know move from one office to other office or agency but the you know the support is you and there is definitely a need for a space like this within the city it was a couple of questions you 've mentioned that you 'd cover the operational and maintenance kind of side of things does that cover the so that the old migrant center for example head sex paid staff members that helped coordinate activities and those kind of things how does that work within this space yeah yeah operationally in terms of our operational funding within the school we we look at that in quite a different fashion for example type n whose diversity manager and as part of their operational staffing we just see that it 's a really pretty critical important part of our operation and we in our costumes of this education funds as generously did we put them differently it 's based on our we believe our staffing working within the center to maintenance it 's great and what happens if we 're not able to contribute the whole sort of six to seven million even over several years what happens to this kind of plan line so either if we decide whether it was sort of half the amount what would happen to this current plan look I think you always used to be compromising from something clearly there was a preferred position here I can make no bones about that but I hope today you 've got a sense of their long-term commitment and what we 're trying to do so we will not be able to make anything work but equally I have to say we recessed strongly preferred position okay thank you very much there was yeah no sorry that 's one of the very big cost for the operations that is the staff and human resource to manage that and such my position already and also that is a key important here that is bilingual community liaison Booker which is we have you team there already available exactly so that is the key things that is we also have very key you know hard-working volunteers from the ethnic sector you know happy to work there to opportunity to you know you you use the facility for hot desk you know go there twice a week you know and batteries also being approached we 've in many respects we we 're bringing in maintenance operational end the benefit of a 17 million dollar rebuild which sits around there so this the users of this facility and will be richly used seven days a week this isn 't Stan at three o 'clock this is concurrent I need to make that really clear in the benefit of working with in and recreation spaces in the new so that 's why essential that the indication that we 're getting from you as what the the extent of the need is how that is put together is something that you 're asking the council to to look at yes know that thank you very much it 's been an incredibly powerful presentation very well researched and and and organized can I thank our performers for entertaining us we don 't normally have entertainment at our council meetings but thank you very much it 's been very that 's that 's usually initiated from around the table and it doesn 't and it doesn 't always enjoyable that was all so thank surrender tied but I particularly wanted to thank alia for an incredibly powerful and moving presentation to us this morning and please offer reassurance to the women dancers who would have come if they 'd felt safe that that they are entitled to feel safe in their City so thank you very much for presenting today thank you _"

    "text": "um Danijela sorry my brains are not functioning properly you 've got two submissions Danielle outdo yep okay thank you I 'll just bring you a few words from the Canterbury WEA and I 'm sorry none of my colleagues were able to come along and a few words for myself and some of my neighbors and I laid some ain 't gonna ask a couple of neighbors if they wanted to come along and be support people and they say they 're silly thinking that anybody would want to listen to what we have to say that we 're a little bit but you know I still think it 's worth coming here and speaking to you and I know that you take submissions seriously and I know that you listen well from the WEA I want to say first of all week we applaud the decision to the city 's decision to become carbon carbon neutral by I forgotten but yeah and also your decision some time ago to oppose deep-sea oil drilling we 're very proud of you for doing that now the point we want to the long-term plan there 's got to be a section in it that addresses climate change mitigation whatever you can do because without addressing there there is no long-term plan there 's no long-term plan for lots of parts of Christchurch and perhaps for bigger sections of the side of the world end of the world many so we need to have maybe a special section that just deals with that we also want to remind you about the importance of having public transport improving public transport for the central city area we used to be great fans of the electric shuttle that we had before the earthquake and we find that we have a number of them quite a number of able-bodied people who currently drive and some of them can afford the parking buildings fees and they 're happy to pay some try to park but further away and walk a little bit so they say are we getting exercise but they 're still driving all the way into the city and quite a number of them we find would be quite happy to switch to public transport also we want to remind you of the importance of clean drinking water we think it 's a top priority and we need to address whatever it is that 's causing the problem the other thing we want to remind you of is that we think every item of expenditure every major decision needs to be scrutinized carefully for its impact on climate change its impact on the health of the natural environment within the city in the area but also the social the health and well-being of people for example when you consider putting additional funding to attract major events to the city we ask that you consider what is this going to do in terms of attracting large numbers of people traffic congestion large number of people 's to put pressure on the on the infrastructure and on the resources and if you decide to go ahead with some of those projects that you are very clear on how the possible negative effects can be mitigated from myself and some neighbors I support all of those points of the Canterbury w.a I wanted to make and in addition but I 'm more of a cyclist than a driver and to come here today for example I cycle down a section of here foot street that I 'm sure has been narrowed since some Public Works recently and I feel that I 'm taking my life in my own hands when I cycle down the streets I have noticed and other people have noticed that a number of streets have been narrowed recently we don 't understand why in some places a wider footpath it that has been built and there 's just simply no give for any car making a tiny mistake or any cyclists need making a tiny mistake there 's not enough space for two cars to go past each other safely and if there 's a cycle inside with it we just don 't feel safe along those roads anymore it 's great to have cycle ways and we definitely support those if they 're not going to disrupt whole neighborhoods if they 're not going to disrupt nature reserves obviously you build them with with wisdom but we don 't understand why the other there should be narrowed to the point that we find them unsafe we 've said enough about that I also want to take the opportunity to speak in support of another proposal which is a proposal from Community Action on youth and drugs an especial targeted rate of licensed establishments and I want to take the opportunity to speak against some alcohol bands and some neighborhoods and a few other comments related to all there now first of all community action on youth and drugs I understand his head my understanding I 'm sorry and may be limited understanding they 've put forward this proposal that we should have a special targeted rate that would increase the rates paid by bottle shots and that 's a recognition of the fact that a lot of communities are up against the sale and supply of alcohol Act that really makes their resistance to alcohol outlets almost impossible I 've been told that this council tried to get a local alcohol policy that would deal with a lot of those concerns but these situation as regards the egged and the resources of the been such that those those attempts were frustrated now when I say this I have to tell you that I 'm the daughter and granddaughter and I can 't remember how many generations are winemakers and I 'm not a teetotaler and myself and I have no personal opposition to our couple in any form at all I just I 'm just the witness to major this ask that social disasters really that are taking place all around us because of the promotion of alcohol and the availability of cheap and nasty alcohol especially in the poorer poorer neighborhoods of the city when I live in one of them a targeted rate I think Community Action and youth and drugs suggested perhaps 15 percent would put pressure on the off-licence profit margins we understand that were an increase in the retail prices that would be a consequences that would be in would have an effect it would be a way of reducing how and we understand that the main driver of consumption is the cheap seem to be outlets near every cluster of social housing or income but also it making money from what they do they should be paying more now in contrast to this we 've had in our neighborhood for example we 've had an alcohol ban which has seen people who can hardly understand that this is an alcohol ban and where it applies faced with a two hundred and fifty dollar fine I 've been sport peaceful one peaceful for example now the 250 is more than double the weekly budget for this person this person 's view sensible careful and will manage to pay back the loan in his paid their know through loan and he will handle it but two hundred and fifty dollars for someone who 's on and invalids benefit who has mental health issues head injury issues can 't even didn 't even know that there was an alcohol ban in that area why not put an extra a targeted levy on the off licenses that are profiting from the sale of alcohol to such people so that 's where my supporters now I have to say in our neighborhood that that I call been there was put in place were very good but from here from what I 've observed and hearing from various people who work alongside the homeless in people with addictions individual drinkers from that area now they understand that the earlier alcohol bans from the central city had pushed those habitual drinkers further out into the east and they it really hasn 't succeeded that they 've moved to different areas there that sometimes they 're hiding in different areas and in addition they now feel targeted unless able to interact with the helping agencies around them and it hasn 't really helped much with anecdotal one of our neighbors will keep walking her dog just very recently I felt really intimidated by a group of men who were obsolete drunk but she suspected also high on synthetic drugs when she was able to call the police safely the police said there was nothing they could do about it they weren 't gonna come around there was no alcohol ban there they couldn 't do anything about it and a number of people in our area have now reported feeling more nervous about what 's alcohol ban I mean they have no choice if there 's a ban they have to enforce it I 'm sorry to interrupt but can we just flick into the should I just switch the clock back on for the other five minutes okay yeah because I mean you 've gone over the teens so right but I want to give you time to complete what you 're saying yeah although you know it 's strictly it 's not I mean the alcohol ban might be a policy issue in terms of the LTP but that they are going through different processes and I 'm just I 'm just oh you know a few comments I 'm linking it to the long-term plan because what I want to say is that our long-term plan has to include continuing to support the initiatives that have had a positive effect and for example restricting the number of a cheap alcohol but that that 's what that wasn 't in our local alcohol plan we 're not doing the local alcohol plan either yeah you know in also to come back to the focusing on the initiatives were very positive for us we have a small council subsidy that allowed the local community to have free Zumba for a period of time which is a way of us reclaiming a space that was previously used by habitual drinkers and the enormous amount of work that a lot of the community workers from our areas have been doing and volunteers in local residents volunteers cleaning up the street befriending some of the street people and involving some of the street people regular drinkers as well in meaningful opportunities to participate in local project projects some of them to do with greening the rubble and other things like that and the outreach facilities that have the the outreach there 's actually helped people to access alcohol and drug services and I understand that now there 's some thought in the neighborhood to involve Maori wardens again to continue with this it 's really think informations what I 'll do is I 'll now open it up for questions so we 've got a couple of minutes left Sarah and then Yanni thank you for that you talked about the climate change mitigation and how important that is and you 've also expressed some concern about how the major cycle ways are being implemented but were you aware that the cycle waste program itself has been deferred so it 's been pushed out in the long term plan I was wondering if you wanted that brought back in because of the mitigation for transport importance of things yeah well we think it 's important that you continue with a program that facilitates cycling in whatever way and in that local communities are consulted properly about that and our community for example was consulted there was major opposition to a particular piece of the cycle way that disrupted in his creator there 's now created an obstacle course for bicycles as well we have to go I think I know that you 're doing the program because it 's important it 's important to help us use cycling as much as possible thanks as opposed to facilitating more roads and more traffic congestion yeah I mean just a quick comment of clarification one is that the council ban in the area and that will include an opportunity for people to make submissions so I just encourage you and we 'll make sure we let you know so because it would be really useful to get you your feedback yeah and the second thing is that we also talked to the place when we agreed to the temporary ban that they do have some discretion until now they enforce it and so we were given reassurances that they would certainly be using it only as a last resort where there were serious issues so I think you know again that feedbacks really useful for the other process that we 're going through so that we can address the issues that you 've raised which are important but just not part of use please do it I mean I mean thank you for it and the only thing I have to say is that I 'm sure that they mean well but the fact of the matter is they 're mostly not the escalation of being confronted yeah often it 's it 's a whole lot of things that reason for not not not the drinking itself but there has to be a better way and I actually wonder you know given that you 're working in this space I wonder whether it might be useful to facilitate a meeting with the superintendent or place because I know that they were very clear that they didn 't want they don 't want to punish people who are not capable of learning the lesson as it were but actually are going through a bit of a during time so that would be quite good on budget issue that I think we should consider is whether there 's adequate resourcing going into awareness of the temporary alcohol been in the area if people are not aware of it and I know when we do permanent ones we have quite strict requirements in terms of what we need to put out I don 't know if that applies to temporary and wither if people aren 't aware of it then that is a budget issue that we may need to put some signage down there I saw one little sign yeah sort things were said and so I asked around and see what people say don 't know they didn 't see anything yeah okay well look that it might be quite good to sort of connect you up with with somebody from one of the one of the community board teams perhaps they could facilitate a meeting with the police yeah all right well thank you very much thank you very much for your time and for your work mmm thank you all right we 'll look thank you everyone Oh oh my my thing doesn 't tell me I hereby adjourn the meeting until 30 tomorrow morning _"

    "text": "Ian 's Lockheed hi hello good afternoon everybody and I 'm here to speak about the provincial council buildings and I do acknowledge the City Council 's investment in historic heritage both publicly and privately owned and I want this investment to continue and in particular in relation to the provincial council buildings it 's the oldest building in our city it 's the oldest documented building certainly surviving in our city and I 'm not really here to talk about the stone council chamber or the Bellamy 's block but the two timber wings along Durham Street and Armour Street in their respective stone towers I think it 's extremely unfortunate that the funding for the restoration of that section of the buildings was withdrawn from the city plan and I submitted on their turn a year ago and I think we need to see the provincial council buildings in its wider context not just in that of Christchurch it is the city 's earliest surviving building but it 's the oldest surviving building associated with representative parliamentary democracy in New Zealand it 's the fourth oldest after New it 's the second purpose second oldest purpose-built parliamentary building in Australasia it 's internationally recognized as a significant example of the Gothic Revival and as a parliamentary complex along with the Canadian Parliament building it 's the first of these internationally to follow the style of the Palace of Westminster in and rebuilt between 1840 and 1865 the same year in which the Canterbury provincial buildings were completed it 's also the most significant secular design of Benjamin Mountford the architect who did most to establish the Gothic Revival character of Victorian Christchurch and councillors were probably not aware when funding for the provincial buildings was withdrawn from the city plan that 2025 will be this bicentennial of Mount foots birth something which I hope the city will celebrate and commemorate in a suitable way and I think it 's inconceivable that at that time the most significant building of Mount fess should be sitting empty mothballed and unrestored can you imagine London making the marking the future sorry marking the 400th anniversary of Sir Christopher Wren 's birth in 2032 without ensuring that his most significant buildings are the [Music] Convention Center currently under construction is also I think very significant for the way in which the city is perceived do we want visitors to our convention centre looking across the river to buildings that are effectively abandoned it would be so much better for the image of the city for conference delegates to witness the provincial buildings either restored or moving in that direction now I realise the city received a global payment for its insurance but the world 's thirty-five million of insurance cover identified for the provincial buildings and the work contemplated nine twenty four point nine million yeah well the insured value was thirty-six point but the actual seturam settlement amount without the global settlement ratcheting it even further was twenty four point nine which would be significant and sufficient to cover the cost of the restoration of the timber wings and the stone turns in addition to that of course there 's the three point five million from the earthquake fund and from the ministry of culture and heritage for the restoration of the stone towers it seems to me it 's a level by not spending it on the project for which its intended the other point that I think is very important is that if work on the provincial buildings is deferred until 2029 the knowledge experience and expertise of the engineers heritage architects and heritage professionals who have decades of experience working on the buildings will effectively be lost to the project they will all be retired by that point it 's going to simply add to the cost of the project when it 's eventually undertaken I don 't see this as a project that the city needs to fund on its own it should be aiming to partner with government to secure funding internationally for buildings that are of international significance so I would urge you to return sufficient funding to the long-term plan to allow work to get underway on the timber sections and the stone look thank you very much he and I don 't have the numbers in front of me of how much that particular part of the project as would cost but I do have an estimated reinstatement cost for the whole facility point four million yeah my understanding is that the the QBs estimate was in the vicinity of twenty to twenty five million for the timber sections in the stone tears right so the entire insurance proceeds would only reinstate that well that would be a very good start and it would be a way of leveraging the restoration funding for belamis and ultimately the stone council chamber I think without dealing with those timber sections it 's going to be much harder to approach the more difficult and complex part of the complex yeah I mean the challenging thing for for the city is that it may it is actually a building of national significance and that 's international well yes I know but in terms of it was the regional building it was the only provincial building left and it 's now down to the city and it wasn 't insured sufficiently well I shall be continuing my library with thank you thank you very much okay _"

    "text": "Connie Kristensen welcome enjoyable from this angle so and it 's suffer more difficult for the people down there in streaming so you way way above and beyond what you can is providing they seem to be struggling to even be able to post on the website a list of those speakers for the day so so I have a few comments and things that I would like to reiterate first of all I would say with the long term plan when looking at the whole thing I 'm not quite sure how all the money is divided out but it comes across to me sometimes there 's just to be down a little bit instead of actually having a big overview I 'm saying this because I know that there 's probably a lot of work going on in the background and I only know a little bit of it that I 'm just as made when I see things like water and piping there should be no question that that has to be done and it has to be number one I don 't care how many holes yeah drinking water we can live with holes in the roads it 's not very nice we can live without buses we can live without cycle waves and all these other things but we can 't live without clean drinking water so it shouldn 't be a question here that has to be number one everything else is secondary to that so that 's the first point in that that really has to whatever money needs to be coming into that if we have to raise the rates well so be it because we can 't afford not to have clean drinking water that 's the the other thing is in terms of priority quite a few of you will know that I 'm involved in the Kosaku class which and other cycle projects and I cycle a lot and I know that looking at your own smart views app which i think is great as well so you go in there and you can see you there 's lots of people cycling every single day to and from work and school and to just cycle around town and of of the pitons the amount of cycling that is really going on and it is known it 's not actually fiction or someone 's guesswork anymore there any money that has put into things like cycle safe cycle routes is paying back to the rate of of seven or eight even up to 21 is what I 've but seven wait I don 't think you will find maybe the water you 'll find that there is a rate of return that is greater than that but otherwise I would like to know if any of you can name any other investment that you do that has that kind of rate of return so again if you 're looking to save money this is a long-term plan if you 're looking to save money put some money in cycle ways and get people on bikes there 's a lot of people still waiting in the wings to actually find that they can cycle and that they find this safe to cycle from A to B to school I don 't know how many teams of thousands of people deliver their avoided last majority of them if kids could cycle to school and they want a cycle in school so if you 're looking for money to build roads or bilities will then invest in some cycling in five years ten years down the line you 'll have plenty of money to spend for all this other stuff so yeah long-term plan you need to look long to him and what the rate of return is for the investments you do so yeah the other thing in terms of transport one of the major things for me is I I just don 't get why you would even think of putting any money into widening and enabling more cars going down train for Street for example and where these cars gonna go if they 're just going through town they should really be on qe2 Road I think that 's what the Ring Road was built for so I don 't get this there is they 're talking about 50 thousand cars going down Francis Street where are we gonna pass are you gonna build that I know fifteen 50 40 park I think it 's the rate for car park in the CBD it just makes no sense at all bring in some some proper bathrooms I know that you are not in charge of those but then work with you can collapse at some point hopefully you will actually be doing the boss in Christchurch so I think that 's main things for me I think thank you thank you very much and much appreciated and it 's great when people just basically come in and speak their mind and it 's very healthy thank you _"

    "text": "Connie Kristensen she 's not here yet jeanette Kristensen and I think Don bail-in possibly Ellen 's olive is that right or you 're all here together Friends of Christchurch Botanic Gardens two of you okay sorry it 's janeshia and Don Evans gonna be kept quiet he 's a support it 's wonderful you can bring them to the table if you want to but you know it 's okay thank you for giving us this opportunity everybody I know you 'll be just about blinded by submissions but we feel we 've got something to do excuse me I 'll just do a quick introduction of who we are and what we do is Friends of the Botanic Gardens and then I 'd like to speaking to the submission I 'd like to and try and convince you of why we think you should spend the higher option finance is a great investment and then once I 've done that I would like to give you a few examples of what we think are really important for our beautiful Botanic Gardens thank you so I don 't know Botanic Gardens are right yes you do those Friends of all sorts of things around Christchurch so we are the only organization that just support the Botanic Gardens and in our way we support the monetary and physically and as volunteers and we provide extra funding options for things that the council cannot do in that time we 've been established now for about 27 28 years at 1989 was when we first put the society together and we are one of the major interfaces I guess with the public for the patina gardens we share the vision of the gardens which is multifunctional research conservation education in display and we look for a revitalized 20th century garden with diverse plant collections in the particular relationship that the gardens have with people of question in our support we have propagating teams that grow plants from the gardens and elsewhere to sell and raise revenue for the gardens and we have two teams working every on a Tuesday and Thursday and at the moment we are making over a thousand dollars a month for them to put towards their funds to guides who steadfastly show up every day at the museum entrance to guide and that is Happiness between September and April and then they stop in the winter they also raise some money for the gardens and particularly with their tours of groups we also have volunteers that do a range of things so there 's help with the visitors experience team and putting projects together like the Mission Impossible Project the bringing diversity back to your gardens as a current one underway that we 're helping with the lobster no heaven we gave money to the herbarium and we have annual grants twice a year that we put out for the garden staff and offer them to go to conferences and things that 's contestable funding at the moment so we quite happy with how that 's going we put out a month 4 for monthly newsletter and that is we 're combining that with garden stuff so that goes mainly to our friends to inform them what 's happening but our relationship but the gardens has been made on a more permanent basis with our MOU which was on a more formal footing we also provide talks a series of talks every month once a month we have people coming and experts coming in to speak so you 're going to ask me why we think as Friends of the gardens that you should provide lots of money to help these wonderful this wonderful ASIC well over the last two years at least the gardens have been on hold quite frankly there 's been hardly any development at all there 's been a lack of management and there 's lots of reasons why I won 't go into that that 's probably you 're aware of that already in that time staff have been wonderful they 've stepped up into higher positions to keep the gardens running there has been some public criticism as you probably know over the past years but we think that the people that have stepped up to manage the gardens have done a good job we don 't want to look back we want to look forward and but sometimes to look forward you have to look back for just a few minutes think it 's exciting because there 's a new manager being appointed right now and that manager will be the have overall vision of the gardens with his crew Botanic and gun parks he has been charged and challenged actually to revitalize and restore our public space and the gardens it 's number one rated number one on TripAdvisor but we believe if there 's not some money spent there it 's not going to hold that position because of what 's not possible with that something behind to support it during the time in this holding period and I 'm going to call it a holding period because there hasn 't been a lot of development there has been some exciting things happened there 's been an internal review and there has been a spatial play input interaction with a vision for the next 50 years so this means that we have now got something that 's planned and met to go forward with it so this is a chance to do something really of world-class significant soggies and the gardens I think the funding needs to just support hold some examples of why what we would like to see happen at the moment the Gardens Botanic Gardens have three trainees and we believe it is very important although it is not as down as a funded option these trainees we need to bring back youth in this area to actually train them up so that they are there for our future support of the curators of the gardens the section curators and get more younger people interested yes it 's said that it 's only subject to funding and not funded so we 'd like you to consider that it 's something that needs to happen for the future of the gardens as you come into the gardens from the our mouth Street entrance I don 't know how many of you have been over the last months if it 's raining you need gum boots it 's not a particularly good entrance to have to this wonderful public space car parking car parking is haphazard and there 's need for development in that area and over the ARMA Street Bridge to come into the gardens it really that there 's a wonderful opportunity for council to increase that parking space knowing there 's no more of Hagley Park allowed to be used there is an opportunity in the old bowling green site and it is I think empty at the moment there 's a building being demolished and I know that in the garden show that we had the horticultural society put on that wonderful garden show a couple of weeks ago we were able to use that as extra power parking for the exhibitors so it is available so please consider that to extend the car park on the street entrance it 's always full you can never get in I we go early to get a park there 's queues and I believe and I think it 's right that some of the people parked there to go to the hospital and also now with less parking on the street along Harper Avenue for the sports sports people actually packing it and like a streetcar track as well so we competing and we need visitors to come to the gardens and they want to come proposed in the parks operation Penn things like Wi-Fi throughout the gardens to bring it up to date and move it into the 21st century a lot of people use apps on their phones now they want to Google things to find out what plants are etc so we need you to consider the Wi-Fi and that is done on the plant I realize for the next three years if you don 't cut the funding so we hope that 's that 's what happens pathways and interpretive signs if you did if you visit dunedin public Botanic Gardens you 'll find that these signage is quite expensive Don you were I was very impressed with the standard of maintenance and the interpretive signs they had thanks Don he 's end yeah heating I believe is on the agenda and that would be a wonderful asset to have the infrastructure needs to be put in place before we can move forward I think I don 't know if any of you have walked past the old key and the old information seems lately but there 's a terrible smell comes we believe and would like to see us keep the Botanic part in the gardens and with some of the new wording that the parts people have proposed to put in there they 're looking at not just a place where the public can visit but a place where they can go to learn to see plant collections to see what 's available in parts of the world and we would like to see that absolutely and included in the next few years in the development by keeping that science and in the botanic and the gardens because it 's very important some people just go there as you know for relaxation others go there to eat but a lot of people come to learn and see what 's available in other parts of the world and in our southern hemisphere we 're very pleased that there is provision coming up for the refit for purpose for the old information center that is in the budget and we urge that to heaven because I believe it 's going to be a seed bank and a place where visitors can come in the gardens which by the way the friends contributed a lot of and a lot of equipment that took quite a few thousand dollars the cabinets and fridges and things like that so we sit to go I think as a scientific interesting place to be as well as just a recreational space so that 's why we would like really like council to yep keep that funding there at least but increase it if you can that 's great look thank you very much it 's um we 've gone over the ten minutes I 'm afraid and okay to be fair to everyone else who 's come to make admittance I 'm gonna have to move on to the next session thank you very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "Thank You Manny Kent yes please sorry thank you um first I 'd like to thank all the counselors and the council staff for all the effort you put behind making this happen and giving the public an opportunity to have a speak before head safe so thank you for things I think are really important if I thought about if I put my head on about the whole city I think it 's really important we spent funding on providing services and venues for youth when I think about adults we work we earn money we can do things we want if you think about young children parents look after them full-time and they pay for everything but we 're gonna get to that adolescent age parents kind of over it you know go make your own money go sort yourself out and for them to get from A to B they don 't have a license to drive so I 'm always thinking of what is it where the city can do to support young people that makes getting transport to that location and easy access so if be a public bus it takes them on a trip there because parents don 't always have time to do that sort of thing and young people need places to bump like Jim Dee 's would say bumping places and they need places to hang and and just be themselves so if we can think about providing that sort of service and having young people at a table when you make decisions have them there with you being part of that process if I was to put my Sunday hat on and I look at the in the long-term plan you mentioned certain parts about some there 's some things that I do strongly agree that we need to face and I know a lot of money 's been spent on try new Glee but when you think about the link from Littleton through Sumner a lot of that was because of economic gains so for example the port company wanted to send the trucks over the hills to us to do that we had to repair the roads we had to make that corridor safe and that 's why that I know a lot of money has been spent but we still got other things that we need to repair and fix and get back together and that 's the main village road is pretty crappy it 's if trucks are gonna come back through that village again we need to make that road safe a lot of young children have grown up what how long 's it been since the earthquake seven years so a lot of young ones growing up having experienced trucks going through some now so it 's important we make that villager it 's a hanging place a lot of young people adults everyone hangs in that place so we do need to make that part of the village safe of cycling and car parking and forecast traffic so please do consider funding that sort of project I know it might you might think it 's enhancing summer but that 's part of safety for me I think that 's important now they have a daughter does cycling she 's pretty good at it I really want to make sure our roads are safe someone 's got to let since garber Park and at the surf club and there 's two toilets that are in the middle of Scarborough and Cove Rock now several times I 've walked past those toilets there 's always keys outside several changes without going to use them they 're discussing my duty I don 't know two toilets is enough for that middle area it 's quite popular the other issue we have with those toilets is when you 've got the learn to surf project going on there 's to learn to surf classes there 's people who change into their surfing gear POG up the toilets just to get changed so maybe there could be a very cheap option to build some little changing facilities that don 't have to be an enclosed building just posts with some thing around it where you can still see the feet and you still got privacy but they 're little changing quarters so it might eliminate the hogging up the toilets or we might just need to increase those toilets or clean them more regularly I don 't know they get cleaned enough litters also an issue I think of people like you guys I see ordinary people you put yourselves out there you consider it your Extra Ordinary extraordinary but most people are just ordinary people they don 't think so even though we had the philosophy of don 't put many bins because encourage people take their rubbish home not everyone 's extraordinary they don 't think that way so if we can have a few more bins lying around that would be really good Youth is important definitely the village green or the village and the other thing I really like is 2024 Nayland Street I know it was a it 's part of the red zone land we have an opportunity to save Captain Scott 's Hut and we need somewhere to put it and if we don 't find a permanent home for it we lose it and it goes up to a private home in the Corolla we were able to stop it leaving Sumner it 's sitting somewhere it 's deteriorating we 've got the ballast that came in the the Terranova a rock wall with all the historic information of the link so if we could think about that section as well I 'd really like to say that thank you thank you well it 's um perfect timing thank you very much thank you yeah I want to know a little bit more about their cape and Scot hat so but we 'll take some advice so you don 't you might do one day right _"

    "text": "holy Hollander ocurro district promotions welcome over the hill and Andrew welcome Bonjour I won 't break out into the national anthem I 've been likened recently to a Mirabel wife but mostly we feel like a struggling solo mother on a benefit oh if it was so glamorous there 's a Mirabel wife I 'm afraid that 's not the reality yes we 've had a good summer for that 65 cruise ships I 've had 200,000 cruise passengers and crew coming into our harbor and we 've got a thriving tourism industry there we 've got lots of domestic visitors well lots of international visitors but I 'm afraid the toilet complaints that we 've received over the summer are abysmal and our facilities are really lacking and we know that it canceled know that already because I think the tourism infrastructure funders yes the toilets are definitely integrated and have been a number of complaints from our visitors so yes a corona is booming and buzzing and we 've had a good summer but we 're not as glamorous at all as all that and we 're one of the best ports in Australasia we have had those complaints about the toilets in not just the toilets but you know we 're not asking for much we really aren 't we have been trying for 20 years to get a cold water shower on our beach how many towns in New Zealand have a cold water tower on their Beach Minnie Minnie Minnie we 're not asking for much at all we just want a bit more help with our facilities we in like a Mirabel wife we want to put our lipstick on and look good we want to feel proud of our town and look at paint doesn 't do any harm and also you know it just seems easier for the council to close the tracks and to repair them or take the rubbish bins down rather than to empty them just seems very strange so we need more rubbish bins a drinking fountain here or there would be great to some picnic tables look you know we with a thriving over there but we just need a little bit more help with our grateful absolutely to Council for the support we do get both for our district promotions and for our town we know that with helping funding us and doing your best we ask for a little bit more we ask to be recognized a bit more we ask for more power to our community boards and we also really support the village plan idea that the council has presented recently we would like to be a part of that plan and we think that 's a really good idea to look at a plan for our are moving forward and how we can work together with different organisations in the village to support Koons from seed on the whole thing but it really does emphasize here how we come across we 're either an orphan that got dropped at the city 's doorstep with a luggage label on that collar courtesy Bob Parker or with the jewel in the crown on the backdrop of a car as far as you budgeting and the money that you invest and the peninsula we 're always going to school badly we simply do not receive and what you 're spending on top of that this income from the cruise ship Anchorage which we understand you jimjo account and we 're not sure that is the Saru 8 and then this the the money and the I guess the product that we contribute to Christchurch in the Canterbury economy as whole you said last you were voted top cruise ship destination for Australasia that 's purely the passion of the people that sell the product and go down and make sure everything goes the best weekend it 's a beautiful place as well we 've got boutique producers here in our tourism operators continually put up national award-winning performances but we really after just some basic staff within the submission near there 's a hold of stuff about the wharf you 've got funding in there there 's a big fish sculpture out by the airport that I know is not a navigation assistance it doesn 't help people flying in and out of the airport but the second biggest international arrivals destination for Canterbury is place called Agora the wharf is terrible we 've community board meetings about trip hazards on the wharf about the capacity not being up to scratch you 've got the funding there but it just keeps getting pushed out please can we get some first world solutions to something that 's really really special and this is for the long term plan we 're talking toilets we 're talking rubbish but you know what does it take to get something to happen please things thank you very much so do we get some questions if people knew that they were supporting something like any incomes great I mean cancel tunas very familiar with the proposal to put a levy on cruise ship visitors for the hospital SystemVue live Council attached to it I mean it 's that 's a real gnarly cheesenut yes the money you 'd be great but as soon as you do that the cruise ship companies again all like this is paying the meek and all the rest of it they pay too much it would be nice but I think it 's way too hard one of our suggestions is that that we put facilities for them but actually having a donation box we know from surveys is there today are prepared to pay 10 a night to be provided some facilities and gives something back to the community so that is our suggestion also that there is a donation box for the freedom campers that thing goes back into environmental projects in the village the seasonality of running businesses in a Koror is something that I 'm certainly very aware of and you know those that run businesses a kuroh or a often painfully aware of I 'm interested in the part of your submission that talks about ADP 's willingness to work with Council on a village plan or some sort of development plan for air kuroh and possibly using the resource that we 've got there as the banks peninsula main site to develop some kind of year-round attraction is there something there that you 're able to expand on a little bit more as to how you would envisage such partnership working or what sort of outcomes you would be looking for there well I think Community Trust and it working party and other groups in akaroa that represent in a part of that village plan like the Civic Trust and lobby groups would be very important that would be a plan that would lots of different organizations so you would see council perhaps been the catalyst for that but most of the work actually been done within the akaroa community yes please I think the village plan would would just give that a figure he 'd you know this time last year there was quite a good spirit and the media between ourselves and the Civic Trust the we would like for my era for tourism the Civic trust would have you believe that people only go to work or our to see the historic buildings and the other soul people that preserve those I mean I 'm embellishing that of course but we all live in a place we 're very proud of we she ain 't you be seen to the same vision and all the rest of it I think having a village plan as a catalyst would get those parties around the table and and know it 's a civil year job but yes I think it would be a great start any other questions oh sorry Aaron I was just just to please I take patient from you you should his date from last week 's photo was that and I won 't be mentioning that but my comics arena grow is that it is one of the best-looking places in the world thanks peninsula we 've seen through the submissions the photos it is truly a stunning place so if you got the wrong end of the stick I certainly wasn 't saying anything negative about either of the areas of Christchurch I 'm very proud of both how 'd you feel bitter but it doesn 't make me feel any happier about what you see so we hit a submission earlier on from a group of communities who putting together well they 've lodged an expression of interest for a Banks Peninsula Geopark which obviously you 're familiar with yes it it does seem to me to have an incredible amount of opportunity associated with it in terms of their whole ecotourism well you 've got to marine reserves the world so it just gets better bi yeah I mean you guys told me about it when I went over there so I was already familiar with it but it 's it 's just such an enormous opportunity all right thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "grace we need hello welcome kill Rococo thank you very much nice to be here I 'm not gonna you 've got a family what I 've said but the three main points I want to make is I believe that we need to prioritize the poorest suburb so I live in a very well-off will voiceover in the base and I think while it 's good for community boards to put their priorities out there I think it 's really important for you to decide how that spread equitably that 's that 's one of my things strongly so I cycled here today strongly support the cycleway expansion I continue to be terrified that I 'm going to be knocked off like a friend of mine with a car door and I believe there should be money allocated towards capacity building for planning the redzone of the port hills and this should be part of a national carbon-capture goals of planning a million trees and we need to be part of this by strategically replanting of eco source native trees in the port hills in the red zone and funding it I 'm on an air B&B I worked in the tourism business in muslin before coming here I ran a lodge before everybody was around a lot of options have been talked about around Airbnb I think a lot of them are very heavy in the way that we call this money in I believe there should be an Airbnb tax simply for Airbnb and not for hotels and motels for two reasons one is that hotels and motels already pay a lot of money towards destination advertising Oasis sell advertising for a travel and I know how much those people contribute to that and Airbnb at present benefits from what happens in christchurch and upping what across uses as a destination but at present um contributes nothing and you 've seen white figures there are ear DNA says how much how many ear be me but nights we have for my suggestion is two dollars a night and that would net approximately 1.5 million dollars I think that should go towards the Christ 's utility directly it should be targeted for that and they 've that money building because although we have great visions for the Green Zone and planning the red the hills replanting we don 't have any money for it at present as I can see and no capacity building for training my points on the last page around about how do we train more landscapers how do we take one more get more people trained in a whole horticultural area with Tara and my Tahu and others strategies around eco sourcing enough trees seeds for planting and growing those seeds in the larger system there are people already doing that but we need to up the level and I think of course we need to be brilliant it 's an easy text to collect you know it 's it 's only it 's one provider yeah anyway look we 're not gonna make a decision on it right the second Sara and then Erin I don 't know that we 'll get beyond that but we 'll try thanks rose right I 'm just gonna go back today the crisis in seed funding in the tree funding I don 't if you were the document but the the additional funding Christ returns either one point four would be new money if that 's not currently in the budget already okay so we can 't just train I do yeah so would there be a priority between those two things the tree planting in there in the evenings so we 'd all be new funding so if we were going to get the Airbnb to X do you need any to go towards the tree plant or the questions it 's done sorry it should go to time to take money from them it has to go to destination marketing I suppose I 'm asking for that the money should go with the with the marketing Aaron it was just kind of cleared up but when she made the point that it would be very simple to collect because it 's just an threw thing I just like to know if we can talk to our legals about is this actually an option we can follow up but we will follow up on all of these submitting Rosemarie an interesting view on prioritization and the way that we 've traditionally looked at these things where if there 's a project to be prioritized we do that within Ward boundaries that we should look at reprioritizing to the poorer areas of the city and maybe not focus so much on the ward boundaries as we do that take a more citywide approach no it 's both of course we need to be informed locally but it worries me that people in places like where I live we have a lot of resources we know how to come to submissions like this we can ask for money and I can see lots of money being spent in our area and I just think that there are obvious gaps across the city that need to and that 's where the council as a whole comes in I think thank you great look thank you very much thank you very much much appreciated _"

wondrous lasting in the South Armagh you should all appreciate that and taste the lamentable state of the water we are planning to come so we 're just looking for a date to bring the whole council and we 're gonna have a bonding session on the bus on the way out there so in fact 30 years ago and the Reserve Board as a time we started putting a year away for a replacement of the hall which I ve got up to 400 and this through running a camping ground as well so but I 'm torment ago the council I believe we used to manage all and many fans everything 12 months ago the council decided that they money saw it and we 're very concerned about this fund and 400,000 that we actually had put aside for a replacement but been concerned that there 's are people on the council quite keen to see it 's going on other directions residence you know pretty keen to see it actually kept for we 're also working with Peter here and now quite came cos are the landowners Council only owns all the buildings that are quite keen to build as well so the whole thing we are actually looking for funds as well certainly not going to do it and we 're probably looking at say you know two to three hundred thousand on top of that on top of that yeah yeah it 's just asbestos yeah you know quite a lot of money just to get get rid of the old building so Peter of Georgia so they don 't what I probably you keep on it demands we have to pay her respects to soak us party these guys would put premature people into the fray take a check on your text take as long Kate Kate me I 've got a nose the building and then and in the grounds but considering how if it 's nighttime I 'm not quite sure where address said quite simply I was speaking on behalf of theory along or cocoa auditor and my two we the KP grams of my total and this is the land that a community hall is entitled but what it gives us a responsibility to the community I said correctly pointed out the water as a major issue there and it has to be addressed my toe who will not support any building program is support until the issue of potable water this is dealt with you have a school with children you have a whole community and how they pull up I 've got no idea and I prefer to chew their water than drink it it 's a it 's an issue that needs to be addressed as can 't_''_320.62 be grounded we are the land of the camp agree on asana beg your pardon it 's an issue that needs to be twisted in just free totally support what Marty meant to be able to host his tea come at the mines with a little funny there and for the client and and of course the toilet facilities as well which means we can we can move the activities which currently take place in the museum on tamari made well they should be healed which supports no less their commitment to the museum because also that museum is very much us anybody here it 's associated history simple in simple words their steps as far as we 're concerned they need to be taken first and that is healthy water for our children and their community to drink your at okay to me I think just just what further things I know comes from then isolated camping grams kind of scenario they just run I think it 's way past that period in time now it 's only an hour 's drive from Christchurch get over there kid there 's issues that need to be addressed and then just pretty quickly two things if I may um my understanding is that there is some risk that that camping ground and if the water supply was not upgraded to a potable standard and that we 've been operating on an exemption that Leone Kane 's Bay camping ground and that exemption could in fact be be withdrawn unless we do something about the water supply it would that be correct and the current water supply as it stands that 's drawn from a stream and it 's untreated water are you able to describe to me the activities that go on around that stream that the water is drawn from properly install from protected from stock either at the source or so that there is always the risk of contamination in that source let alone the turbidity that gets into it when we have heavy rain events and that 's why when you run a bath you because you can 't see the bottom of your bath so do the people of o Kings Bay drink that water some of us do yep some of us have filters on the lines the cap occupants boil every drop of water as I understand it some guts get used to it and run the risk one of the problems is the resource 0.10 for taking the water ran out some years back and this seems to be one of the major concerns and the meant were drawing from the stream is parking that 's but the my food is he 's you know taking the creek border it 's plenty of it has main creek entertaining they don 't which the cancer sort of you know talking those 2.6 million dollars to do it you know I 've been to the meetings because of the reserve Gordon honestly I look at the young Fergus yeah just spec Aviva like sir budgets and I 400,000 would clean it up real good Jonnie help thank you I understand it from the media that will cost 30,000 for a study into the the water and there 's no money to do that but given that you 've what 's been done here okay so given that you 're asking for something in two things which which seemed fairly reasonable have you looked at other things in our budget that you would say actually you know would those things that you would possibly consider that we should think about making a lower priority to do the things that are important to you once we order everything else will trickle on after that all right we don 't find the submitters that 's I need the counselors to keep fine for that we might have to review it anything in our budget you know we 've had submissions on things like naval yacht club 10 million the stadium people have mentioned previous things people control they have you considered anything that we could deep prioritize to deal with your priority in a bit it 's about community outcomes for community the simple said the very children can they have safe safe water to drink couldn 't speak we got a few questions to ask of ourselves that brings us to the conclusion of the time available for the submission so thank you very much for making the submission I think it 's been received loud and clear we 'll obviously got quite a bit of work to do well thank you hopefully you can secure area thank you _"

    "text": "and could we invite karinabrown to come forward from etude now I should say that I 'm a member of a so does that make me I 'm conflicted and terms of hearing but I 've just I 'm just nominating the fact that I am a member it 's fully paid-up right right right okay so thank you for hearing a submission today I 'll assume it either on his read the submissions and I won 't use introduced to joe mcclane and from the-- runanga o ngai tahu he will also be speaking to you today I 'd like to thank you for adopting the living wage last year for all you 're directly employed council staff I know that it 's made a difference as enabling them to be more involved in their communities in terrified the necessities of life without the same struggles as they previously had for this to continue this rate needs to be linked to the current living wage rate whatever that may be to ensure that they continue to be paid a wage that they can divide I asked the council require rate of twenty dollars 55 from the 1st of September your subsidiary companies also need to pay a living wage to their workers for the same reasons as the directly employed council staff we 've paid a living wage and this can be done via their statement of intent the stay 2015 should also require all workers to be paid the current living wage rate whatever that may be so they are also able to get the new rates of 2055 from the 1st of September it is vital that council look at all the wages being paid by contractors that supply your core services procurement policies must include social responsibility to ensure a contract to workers are paid a living wage cleaners we can every part of your organization but the biggest increase in wages this group of workers mainly woman gets is when the minimum wage goes up and it 's not just the cleaners it too negotiates with several security companies who supply security guards throughout New Zealand one of these companies is offering a zero percent increase because their members all got a nice fries when another one both eetu in living wage Christchurch steering group agree that there needs to be a minimum wage safety net and it needs to be much higher than this current 1650 however to rely solely on the minimum wage to deliver people out of poverty is reliant on the ideological and philosophical position of the government and power at the time and this has not been successful so far your organization can make a difference by adding social responsibility to your procurement policies and by saying to contractors done less they pay all their workers a fair wage they can live on they will not get a contract for services with the City Council we know this is a difficult move but as one that needs to occur so these contracted workers are able to live and engage within our society and thank you and I will now hand over to join MacLean I came to me he knew anything I thought that Kaltura um look I 'm here today really just to support the co papa but I 'm here really to support the corridor that Karina has currently doing with regard to their social responsibility around so we 're a family we consider ourselves to be a family business and as a result of that we 've had a number of conversations in our board table with regard to how we can assist staff I know for them to be able to reach the potential in one of the ways that we 've identified that we could potentially do that is through supporting living wage concept so is a table we have agreed it betters something that we do wish to support and we have advised Holdings company that there is that we have and have asked them to go away and consider how that might impact on the core business and what they do as a result of this they have they have done this they 've come back and they 've advised us that while it is going to be it is going to mean that we will need to consider a different form of return we believe that we will still get that return so while it might not always be and the financial terms of that in the the impact that that will have on our phone oh but not just a fun night it 's also the wider community so whatever goes into our fund those pockets will go back into the wider community benefiting everybody as well so I guess why our organization that 's a bit of a no-brainer in terms of ensuring that we 're able to support our own people but also those communities that they live in by taking the approach and as a courageous approach it has taken a number of courageous conversations that we 've had to have with regard to that but it 's very difficult not to see the wider and broader benefits that people breath and there are some areas that we know are going to be really difficult where as you may be aware we have a number of businesses and tourism and there has traditionally been an area that is low page however we are making a commitment to move this business toward a living wage it may not happen straight away it may be a stick to move but we believe that by doing that that will also change the lives not just for our people who work for us in our Ferno but those in that whole industry as well um Carina mentioned about contractors we are also not going to take make a move where we are contracting that it will be one of the tick box requirements that when we are moving together or partnering with other they will have their commitment as well and we believe so strongly that there is going to make such a difference and so our subsidiaries as I see it will be aligning that as well it 's an organization it 's a follow as an e we we totally support it can bring Erin yeah I just like to if you could explain or hopefully dispel a myth around people that work for minimum wage and hopefully more for for the living wage because you see this pop up with the when it turns up online and the stories and the comments that can often be quite nasty around people that work for an amendment and wage should only not a career option the idea to get educated but these plenty of people that choose to do particular jobs in society where they may stay there for their whole life would you like to speak to that and the value of those people and so one of the issues we have in specially in the security guard issues with is that the the training is where the problem can be those people want to be trained they actually would like to be trained that the employers don 't offer the training and it 's the same with cleaning of a page there is there is some certificates that they can get to actually improve the amount but even they improve it I mean the reality is the supervisors for some of the cleaning companies are only getting a dollar more than what the actual work the minimum wages of the pain to the actual workers and they 're still getting increases and they 're losing the relativity as the minimum wage goes up and it 's the fact that you know especially for our migrant amaldi at Pacifica which as the problem is actually getting the jobs because there is an unconditional unconscious bias it occurs when people rate you and even they have people side by side they don 't necessarily employ the Maori or the Pacifica person because they have a view of what society means that they 're going to be waving light which is really wrong but they do I mean you said to look in the courts when you can see two people were Maori in a and and a white person issue with the same charge often the white person will actually get home detention and the multi person we end up getting prison sentence we do actually without meaning to and conditionally bias and actually that in the wages of Maori Pacifica are so much lower you looking at the average wage the you know no matter how and it is really creating a way to inequity in our society that we really need to address and the minimum wage is not doing that that 's it 's there 's an Ignis of a safety net but it 's not actually a want the in a good wage but someone still has to clean our buildings someone still has to look after our yes to guard our places even if it could mean is in the case and count down we 're going to get King hurt and killed for the minimum wage idea and all that and it 's a real big issue and it 's one that we 're trying to address fear through there again for the certification but there 's also a problem within our own rules yet they still actually have the ability within an hour law to pay someone on disability lower than a normal evening the minimum wage and then it 's just wrong and it 's actually discriminatory clean yeah pre enjoy thank you can you tell us how they 're living wage benefits the whole community not only those who receive it I think he 's a lot of curiosity up here and but also a bit of a kind of a knowledge gap over this well the problem is that yeah if you look about the wages people based on the low on rent on food on power so they actually tend to give most their income back into the into the living whereas people who earn a higher income stated to save the money they go at overseas trips so they take the money or sure you know they 'll buy but the lower wage they actually have to buy they buy from the local stores they buy from the local supermarket if they get a care the body buying buy it from the local shoot stuff then actually don 't tend to they 're not gonna bring the import and themselves so they tend to put the money back into the community and they put it all back in and because even on a living wage and there 's a little bit of a buffer the people on the minimum wage I mean though they 're being done over by own sharks by those companies which we when they actually have if a vehicle breaks down and they can 't get money because I working they actually have to you know get an advance on their wages and they 've that 's really not fair and so they do teach people with your money in this it 's this we are we talk about it being a social responsibility and a social good because that 's money that 's going back into the community that 's helping that local dairy that 's hopefully helping the local supermarket that 's hopefully helping the local stationary store the family 's pharmacy because it 's where they tend to spend their money because often they can 't_``_653.11 go long distances so they don 't enzymatic take the money outside of your community but thank you very much alright but actually by not moving continue to perpetuate the view that it 's okay right and you know and we 're a low waged economy unless we start taking chances or taking risks in relation to moving it nothing is going to change the inequity for Marty within the current income gap is something like forty six million dollars a year that 's significant if that was going back into the economy that is going to have a huge change and make a huge shift think that 's fundamental that we you know we seriously consider these things you might be able to buy it but actually the the consequences of it and the longer-term are much greater otherwise way are simply sitting here supportin continued poverty in this country and we need to move past it okay thank you very much can _"

    "text": "right the next one is Sam Hampton Mohini Jo park and I think are you being supported by Nigel Hampton and Mark Rivington you are welcome good afternoon thanks for letting us talk to us admission today primarily we 're here to kind of talk to us of mission but also raise awareness of the Geopark concept within New Zealand and also the Geopark concept that that we 've got an a concept working with my Tahu and the explanation in terms of a platform to create a gateway for further development on Banks Peninsula and so these we hand out that we 've got floating around background information and ultimately that 's just an outline of what we see is the vision for be expansions to have being a nice dog Geopark and ultimately want to talk to you about how the council I guess in terms of directives and outputs can closely aligned with what a gia part can offer and how it can both communities and so I guess I 'm just going to talk to a few points in terms of within a submission that we do we currently set ourselves within the stages of disaster recovery I can say that there 's a great focus that 's been on the central business district but also the communities of Banks Peninsula including Sumner and Red Cliffs also had some significant damages from the earthquake and the the Geopark could be a framework to bring something back to those communities that have also been affected by these significant events and in some respects bring a effective Geotourism in terms of significant changes in our landscape that 's occurred and recognize what has gone on so ultimately a Geopark would be a game changer for the region which seems like constitutio investment to end Canterbury and ultimately I 'd be looking at a way of instead of having Christchurch there 's a gateway to the South Island bringing something that 's on our doorstep and really bring it and showcasing what we 've actually got it 's also a way of bringing communities together of really similar interests and strategies that can provide a mechanism of branding for the region and and highlight what the attractions that we produced by the rural communities farming community in terms of the benefits that a Deer Park could offer that provides an international significance and platform for branding and it also has a UNESCO status so it 's a quality that some existing at the moment is 135 tier parks worldwide this would be looking at becoming one of New Zealand 's first Geoparks significance what a Geopark actually does or what our vision for a Deer Park is to bring together aspects of our rich cultural historical heritage and looking at our landscape values and our recreational values biodiversity values that exist on vaccinations and then looking at those as educational platforms that we can wrap around and both inform a local population what 's special and significant about Beck 's Mutchler and also international visitors and national visitors that can come to our banks mantra and see what 's going on with another and so ultimately looking at turning Christchurch from a gateway city in South Island to more of a destination we 've got something in our backyard create valued economic benefits we 've already got some really develop this greater recognition of mana for network values that we 've got but also provide a kind of a coordinating strategy for everything that 's going on Beck 's motion across and bringing those entities together and a really important aspect in terms of the proposal of a Geopark it also looks at conservation and preservation by education so it 's not a strategy where you 're imposing regulations on land use and as excellences of rural community you 're not going to be imposing any restrictions on the farming community or and that 's a really significant difference in terms of the National Park Springs and curettage land uses that you can look at in terms of talking to some of the points that were raised with a nice mission it provides a platform that we could look at bigger pools of money developing a park it 's got educational aspects it 's got development ass because it 's got a huge broad avenues that we continue to look at contributing to these existing and great facilities that are in existence on Banks Peninsula in terms of tracts Deer Park needs and context exponentially is already operating as a defect of Geo par with the existing attributes ecotourism networks that are already and and in current use also see that in the concepts of of the council in terms of the Heritage would like to also see that heritage within the context of that it 's more than just the built environment that 's around us there 's also these these distinct landscape lands forms archaeological sites heritage sites and ecological sites which also our heritage and what makes us and so juror park would be a way of bringing those aspects to get together and providing an educational platform that we can actually contribute and educate people about what is special and what we 've got no that 's guard to highlight in terms of the educational tangent the City Council has a strong Network and tend to the environmental education and the outreach plans and in terms that the both the range of teams and also the internal environmental education teams work with and this is another strategy platform that they could also use work collaborative community groups to actually use that to engage what 's going on in that environment and helping to achieve what the council delivery deliveries are so it 's really an and we thank you for letting us talk today and we really look forward in terms of working with the council in terms of what the concept of Geopark on being so much like this concept Thank You Vicki thank you very much indeed what a lovely submission and but I just want to know what I understand that you have to apply to to get registration as a Geo pack but what beyond that actually needs to happen um so this there 's some on ground operational aspects and so Geoparks made up of a series of geo points and geo sites so areas or sites of significance and that could be geological significance historical significance archaeological significance so the physical and ground implementation and what we 've been looking at in the sites that we 've got I 'm highlighted on that pamphlet kind of the 12 kind of easy easy first up sites that we could look existing tracks and them structures walkways and so therefore you just be putting a layer on top of there so to get this under way really all you need is sign posting on those twelve sites yep and it 's on the ground but there 's also behind the scenes as well particularly this Geopark concept is being unique great yeah yeah thank you for the presentation really exciting project um just in the handout that you 've given us the expressions of interest closed on the 3rd of April 2018 and I say it 's done once every two years so have the important expression and or are we looking for two years time we did put an expression of interest in in terms of with the community board and presented at the community board at April and we have had ongoing who is in terms of discussions about the platform very much it 's the first step towards the Deer Park and the Deer Park mechanism with the New Zealand we really wanted to put their application and both to show that we have got a strong case of journey towards Geoparks so if we were supportive we can basically fit into the current round of consideration Emma went on about six months time with a expression of interest has been taken up six months down the tree yeah but is that the next day it 's the next stage that you really need us yeah put the expression of interest in that comes back and very much we still want to see in track but the project yeah now we won 't move now well well we 'll take we 'll take advice on it it doesn 't have to be done right now so we 'll just we 'll just calm down everyone I know it 's fantastic Nate she ties them with some other projects that I 've been considering I 'm already aware of this I got briefed when I went to a Corolla everyone 's very excited well I don 't know I 'm gonna take some advice if that 's okay because I 'm just not going to do it off the top of a submission that 's here on the LTP to raise awareness on this important project thank you very much _"

    "text": "okay now the next is the navel point Club and we have dinner smoke ray Emily Riley and John Burroughs Burstyn is that Thurston thank you Andrew thank you for giving us time today what we 'd like to do is speak in support on behalf of naval point which is a club of clubs so I just explained it to you a little bit more in the sense that navel point Club which is has been or could well be defined as a boating club actually has a range of other member clubs that belong to it so we have two Walker Armour clubs we have a surf lifesaving Club we have a Rugby Club we have Sea Scouts who use our facilities we have swimmers we have kayakers we have jet boaters we have some commercial members that use our club as well as that obviously we have a range of other people have used our facilities so the City Council community hearings the harbor board he can and a whole range of other community user groups use us on a regular basis so when we talk about community in its larger range of users but also the wider metropolitan area of Christchurch so we 're here today to talk and support project 357 which is defined in the LTP not necessarily as development of the recreational boating space but as the space at Naval point and recreational and Byron 's around that so we 're here to talk about that and support it and what I 'd like to do is just take a few moments to talk to that and then open it up for questions in case you have any so as mentioned we are a club with clubs we have been in one form or another in this since 1905 we were there before navel point was reclaimed and so we believe that we have a right to suggest that as time some stuff was done in that area it 's been 18 years since the marina that was on a development at navel point was smashed by a southern storm since that time there has been nothing done not a thing and in fact the water safety in that area has been has that area eg the piles that were left there from the marina are still there to this day and cause significant angst for boaters kayakers wind surfers and everybody else trying to exit the area the importance of the area for us is that it is the only the only all tide access for boating open water boating and recreational use in the greater Christchurch slash Canterbury region there is nowhere else to go so if you want to vote outside of high tide anywhere Littleton and Naval point is the only place to do that so it is not only important to bodies it 's a critical asset and the recreational infrastructure that makes up the greater Christchurch area so the things that are important to us since the earthquake so another eight years on as a club we 're living within the exclusion zone around the cliff face so there 's a 60 meter exclusion zone rockfall zone our building is currently in there we can 't move we can 't make plans even though we are in the process of doing that we can 't make anything go we have formed a joint venture or a trust with Canterbury coastguard to build a building we used to make that when we finally do have a lease in somewhere to go that we will be in the vicinity of seven to ten million dollars spend in that space by the time we do all those other things so as a partner with Council we are looking to understand and get this project three five seven moving and in fact an option three you have another eleven million dollars set aside for work at navel point and we would suggest although I 'm sure you 've had others suggest the same thing that if you have any spare money that that should be moved across to that area as well and put in there for development so the other element as I see it as the amount that we 're spending and that includes areas such as storage facilities for boats a new clubhouse or a new club building which will be managed by the Naval Point marine rescue center trust which as I said as an amalgamation of so we are truly trying to develop that community facility and that joint venture within the navel point area so we would commend that three five seven project to you and suggest that that as the minimum is the amount that should be spent in that area after eighteen plus years of neglect and that 's what I 'd like to say and a little under five minutes left for questions so thank you you don 't have a lease currently but I 'm looking at it so the Google Earth of the area and there 's a lot of for example boat parking and those kind of things that 's yeah what sort of rates are charged for those type of activities and we charge quite a lot of money and in town for people to store their cars so storage and those sorts of things are done with as part of club membership in that area and there 's some storage outside of that outside of the club area as well so for example if you want to store a boat there for the year it might cost okay and so then with that money the club pays its leased to Council for land as the land owned privately or neither the land is owned by Council yeah and since the wind the marina was first put into place then all of the leases became we 're tired up and moved across to the marina development when the marina development went into liquidation Oh far my recollection is correct they all went back to Council again and so council picked up the liquidated assets of the marine or any everything else so council now as is the owner and could be the property we currently do not have a lease okay so currently the club 's collecting the money for the boat storage no only within the area that we and they said we had a submission earlier and today that suggested that the the ramp safety and the all-weather access was the the key the most important project for that area would you agree with it I was I would suggest without wanting to to get into other people 's submissions that if we are going to in as part of the overall project rather than individually because one part does not make a safe environment for boating just as the earlier speakers speaking about cycling one part doesn 't make safe environments for cycling so it 's a collaborative and total effect rather than individual elements so I would unsure who the presenter or the submission was but I would suggest that it should come in as part of the overall project for the development of that area a lot of the development the area could be self-funded well I think that goes back to the partnership element that we would like to talk about and and we recognize that funding is difficult especially for recreational elements when you have rugby who don 't want to play anything but want a new stadium compared to us I mean we we are able to self-fund to a large extent and that would be through trusts and fundraising and those types of things and so that 's we are a large part of the the money that we will use for our building etc will come from and you talk to a funder for example and you tell them that within the organization you have rugby clubs surf clubs Walker clubs and then associated to that you have Coast Guard and all those other elements that becomes attractive because of the fact that they see the greater community good rather than you know the local cricket club for example without trying to put down cricket that 's wrong thank you and I 'm good to see you this afternoon there 's some good to have you here with the team we received at early establishment from James Ensor in fact this morning around boat safety and I guess what you might call spatial planning parking and vehicle movements and so on you 'd be familiar with the content of that submission on sure but what you seem to have brought to us this afternoon is an opportunity for a partnership project with the club and Coastguard great and what I 'm hearing reading between the lines it 's not called out clearly in the submission is that what you 'd want us to do would be to prioritize the club and the post card Coast Guard so that we could give effect to that partnership project are you suggesting that within the naval point plan and development plan that the spatial planning elements and some security of space for the club would be one of the key issues that we need to be looking at sooner rather than later absolutely we can Coast Guard need a new home we need to move because otherwise what we 're doing in our building needs are appearing because it was the earthquake damage significantly and we can well we can repair it but to use an analogy it 's you know 50 notes and a shower because we can 't take it with us we can 't do anything when we leave and we do have to leave because we 're in that exclusion zone when we leave their space we have to take the building down and what you 're suggesting is that you 've got a 7 to 10 million dollar opportunity for partnership great and we just need to get some spatial planning work underway and give effect so that we can jointly in partnership access that funding that you 'll have available brick if nothing else that would be a have a mean to step towards ensuring the longer term viability of all of those organizations within that space absolutely thank you I 'm gonna have to move on to the next submitter but thank you very much for making the presentation that 's much appreciated we would be happy to receive any of the other questions via email if the councillors want to send that to us so that they even if they gave them to Andrew I 'm also Elizabeth who 's normally here I 'm just gonna say to council if you 've got questions that you want the staff to follow up on then just flip them through to Elizabeth please don 't a nun date here or if she 'll never either offer to do it again and she 's not here at the moment so I can make the offer I knew your absence and but we 'll sort of triage them yeah and see if we can break them so thank you very much thanks councillors _"

    "text": "it 's good yeah okay so the next one is Ian Chesterman welcome number three four five on your agenda the page three four five good good afternoon good afternoon madam mayor and councillors my name is Ian Chesterton I live in Christ Church reading the draft long term planner I don 't envy you your job sis there 's some very difficult decisions to make and I would like to focus on cycleways if I can I believe it is a shame when a mistake to delay the following implementation of the major cycle routes as the draft long-term plan is proposing to do I think there has never been a better time to build cycleways in New Zealand the current government is as friendly as you 're likely to find towards investment in cycleways and will reimburse fifty to sixty six percent of the cost of building them so I think it is a mistake to delay building them as the money saved is relatively small and this political environment may not last forever I 'm sure you 've all heard people say to you why are we not Copenhagen those cities weren 't always cycle friendly either 50 years ago they were jammed with cars and their road tolls on the rise but they made the decisions change but let 's aim for an intermediate target first let 's aim to be better than Vancouver Vancouver is not ideal for cycling it 's Hillier colder and wetter than Christchurch but they started building a protected cycling Network they started in 2010 the results have been pretty good some residents opposed the plan the downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association opposed the plan but since they started the cycling Moe share is more than doubled from 4% in 2011 to 10% in 2015 and the miles traveled by private car I 've shown a concurrent fall even more significantly the downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association is now the cycleway Network many cities have built cycleways I 've chosen to highlight Vancouver because there are lots of data about the effects of these investment on cycling numbers and more relevantly to this discussion about the effects connecting up the network of cycleways has had building one cycle is pointless it build a network so people can get from where they are to where they want to go feeling safe closer to home Auckland is seeing similar effects as they slowly connect up their network and is happening here in Christchurch too but the longer we take to finish the network the longer will be the perception that they are underused our bike Caesar though largely on the route of the sunlight cycle way the finished parts that they serve joy I lock my bike up in the bike park in the Litchfield Street parking building which is excellent I regularly cycle on the Southern Lights and unique cycle ways and I like that you see all sorts of cyclists using them school kids students commuters shoppers families there are some great cycling facilities in Christchurch Church but without a finish network they risk being underused because people can 't connect safely to them please prioritize finishing the network and include the coastal pathway to someone that in that network most of the network will be useful transport infrastructure but the coastal pathway when completed will be that as well but city much like similar paths in New Plymouth and elsewhere Christchurch doesn 't make the best use of its miles of waterfront but I think the coastal pathway will go a long way to addressing that our kids walk on about the many benefits of cycling the health social environmental gains and the safety numbers effects for the more people you get cycling the safer it is for everyone but instead I 'd rather tell you why I felt strongly enough about this to turn up here today despite my fairly obvious dislike at public speaking I 'm now proud kiwi and an even prouder dad I want to be able to safely take my daughter to the park to swimming lessons to preschool etc by bike I want her to grow up thinking cycling is normal and for us to be I let her cycle to school and Beyond without worrying unduly about her safety please delay prioritize Fukushima Network thank you thank you very much you wouldn 't know need to be nervous it 'll get some really really compelling story there is anyone got any questions Sarah 's the network and getting the network up and running but do you feel like we 're doing enough as accounts or to sort of sell those benefits that you were talking about to the wider community I mean talk about that at all judging by some of the comments you read on stuff that 's oh no it 's hard to judge I think the people that use them know of the benefits but maybe they 're there isn 't this understanding that cycling benefits everyone you know every cyclist you see on a cycle wears one less car chasing you know causing congestion or fighting you for a park and and also the cost benefits you know that cycling reduces the maintenance cost on roads thank you I 'm just tweeting a reply about your presentation so I 'm giving you a really high high rating your partner 's tweeted about your submission I 'm just gonna tweet a bit with your photo right thank you very much for your time it 's much appreciated thank you thank you _"

    "text": "going to be a phone conference so we 've got William open as a oh boy oh boy hello Polly bitter hello yeah it 's the end ourselves speaking you 've got a full council sitting around the table and we 're all ready to hear your submission thank you the end just feel strongly enough about this submission Dixie do it in person although I have got this on a federated Farmers templated it is pretty much wrong the white lines of what I think so we live at the end of lighthouse road and the road is four kilometers of gravel from most of its global from the era and developed here most my life apart from traveling and working overseas we pay a certain little amount of rates with few services but the road is one for services that we appreciate end into this presentation so the skin of the road has dropped significantly in my opinion over the last 15 years with minimal upkeep or input apparent from grading so there 's been less shingle and less maintenance of the water table and while the road an adequate when it gets wet because the road surface is now cutting through the basin into the clay so it 's fine when it 's dry but so would a deer track be fine when it 's dry to all drives to come up the road because it 's a popular tourist route to go and see the lighthouse and they do get stuck at times normally when they veer off the road but with this driver error or because of the stage road debatable hey the Nick makes part of my commission really goes on to the echo a compound at the ebony question so do you want to well I mean your submissions very very plain on their dude Andrew Turner counselor and red tuna William good afternoon thanks for joining us by phone and return a counsel of a Banks Peninsula I 'm interested in your submission on roading we heard from another submitter early in the earlier in the day who suggested to us that not only was it possibly that the the funding for banks peninsula roading was insufficient but the way that we maybe we got the priorities wrong or we should be doing different work to better look after the roads would you have a view on on this they just keep the water off the road they they can get away with not a lot of input but that 's the part that 's been missing over the years and when water gets down the road it washes the gravel wall and that 's happened in the past its money has been wasted because of put gravel on but not the water table so the gravel justice is an significant rain event so I think thank you thank you yep Jonnie Jonnie Johansson counsel Jonnie Jonnie our heed since the next question oh great thank you thanks for the taking the tone of phone and just wanted to chair we 've had a number of similar to come and talk about the lack of maintenance on the peninsula just I 'm not sure how long you 've been where you currently are but is interested if it 's gotten worse since the amalgamation or or if it 's improved or if some my opinion in my opinion because I 've been here rights my life it is got worse and less input has been made on to our in terms of hours or dollars on maintaining our Road they used to spend a fair bit of effort the dance minister council on putting gravel on working the water table but there 's been minimal in the last well but they need that they in relations that has it been because there 's a different contractor I couldn 't really comment okay thank you I wonder whether the large storm events that we 've had over the last year or so have had a real impact on the road and I don 't believe so I think it 's just because they haven 't done the preventative maintenance if they they have header certainly from their feet but only because the water runs down the road rather than off the road right and like recently they did do quite a big effort on some culverts and that was great but when they 've cleaned all the bran out the culvert no one out of the Digi brock culvert so that it never got finished in my opinion they needed a bigger there at the same time is the guys they 've cleaned out the culverts they did blow them out and got them running not not perfectly but running but then the job has never finished the gravel has lived at the end of the culvert so that just brought to the game overtime right okay well thank you very much it 's been an incredibly helpful submission so thanks for going to all of the trouble one to make the submission but also to personally follow it up with your personal representations that 's much appreciated yeah can I just make a quick comment on the air about compound sure I have a shear in a boat I 'm lucky enough to hear and it is stored in the compound because we can 't bring it up our Road and because it 's a sheared boat last year the propeller was stolen off the boat which you know that does happen but I believe that there is a need for a of investment sitting there but there 's not a lot protecting it and you know someone can cut the Warren crunch up and there in five seconds but a camera would be a significant deterrent and there is I don 't know 40 odd boats and they 're all playing 800 each I don 't think it 's a large outlay to to secure is it and second point on that submission is that the washdown facilities are not up to standard understand DEKRA does have a shortage of water but if you take a boat into the sea you need to wash it in because I 'm throwing it in the compound I have nowhere else to wash it and that facility hasn 't be maintained for the last couple of years the washing facilities it is so given that we are paying a fairly significant amount to use it I think we should get a little bit more for our money thank you thank you very much you know obviously that you 're not the only person to braise there is an issue as well so we 'll you very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "Joe Rowley from Laban 's Bay reserve management committee good afternoon pretty much maintenance issues which seems to be the theme around the council is when is maintenance best course of action we have put in for painting of the levonne 's babe reserve who a few times now and have been advised by staff that they think that perhaps we should have a new roof we feel that it 's more financially prudent just to paint the roof at this stage the building was built by the locals and has been maintained by the locals and up until now we 've been able to apply from the roof and paint it but with the new regulations the upper part of the building plus the roof is out of balance without some sort of scaffolding it 's one of those jobs like whether you put metal on the road at the right time or graded at the right time that if you don 't do it you end up with a bigger problem in the long run it 's the domain is quite close to the sea possibly 150 metres 't be of the quality that we 've already got in the way of the roof that exists now we had the same trouble with the soffits one thing leads to another the Mississippi turnout falling down because moistures got into them and they weren 't really made of the right material in first instance the topping of the poplars we 've done that in the past and it 's time for it to be done again it may well be that and the cost of topping the poppers or keeping the populous should be something that 's looked at but in between times we have had in the past had to react because the tapas are falling over the tennis court and smash the meeting and the roots have come up frozen the tarmac on the tennis court so what we 've done is we 've put some tin in the air to stop the roots from protruding into the tennis court which is what very successfully but the poplars continued to grow at a rate that means constant maintenance and the the toilet louvers there that 's an then we 'll just will it movers assume this method should probably have been dealt with as an insurance thing however we 've had no and feedback on that to follow up on what 's happening that 's it okay thank you very much I 've got some time left Deon have you do you know how much it would cost to do the painting on the roof to get the scaffolding little bit for yourselves depending on how long the quiet for but about three maybe it 's health and safety is really sort of and it 's oppressing our community 's big time and I mean we 're the ones ended up having to sort of support a lot of that yes it 's actually it 's a revolving kind of thing that 's coming up it 's quite bad yes sometimes I wish I 'd applied at home having watched my husband fall off us later on on Facebook not good but no it does raise an issue though about providing appropriate levels of support for Health and Safety I mean there are risks associated with roofs you know the management committee it 's another reserved management committees doing such a lot of voluntary work and you know offering so much of a commitment it just sort of seems to me that it 's not a huge asked to find a way through this but do you ever yep Andrew thank you just looking and thanks for making the effort to come in and talk to us today as well certainly appreciating the distances that people from the peninsula travel to be here with us today just looking at your written submission towards the end of the submission we 're pleased to advise that the water test found the water at the hall to meet the New Zealand drinking standards and also the barbecue appears to have a life in it for a few more years had there been suggestions from council staff or from the committee that those things might need replacing and now your or them might need work and now you 're acknowledging that they don 't all that we should even though we 've got boiled notices on our water and in which to bring it up to today 's expectations of having at least one system that had quality drinking water and as a result of our testing of our own water we 've found that the spring water actually meets 100% he was even drinking water standard so we 're very fortunate that was 150 investment instead of you know quite possibly thousands to put the celebration fountain all right thank you any other questions no no thank you very much for making the effort to make the submission today thank you _"

    "text": "that Marie Kylie or Kili Kylie good afternoon yep Marie Kylie um I 'm a fisherman commercial fisherman from a car ah I 've been associated with the wharf for about 40 years but like John the wharf is steeped in a lot of history it 's about 130 years old I think it 's certainly showing a fair bit of wear and tear Nair and we 're looking ahead we 're looking at something far more than a job on it there is some back up John as a commercial fisherman we have actually taken a back step now really to our timeframe of when we can come and use the facilities on the hall which are very minimal and we now will we don 't have any chillers on the wharf where we used to we don 't have any facility at all as a commercial fisherman on the wharf other than a train which we unload a efficient to their trucks we compete pretty heavily with the tourism side of things now to be fair they seem to come first which is I suppose fear enough to back though we had played our way on that Wharf all the way many years ago when we first started fishing in director of what had happened to fund using a wolf we 'd pay case money and that money accumulated and the 80s into the 90s there was thousands of cases taken off that wharf and accumulated a lot of money it was a big gap there we 're not much money went back on to the wharf and unfortunately that is paid this way to the state of the war now and in part of what we want to do is let 's join us here to be part of the planning process going forward because there 's commercial use of we may have a different angle on there we would like to see something that would be in place not solely for but also for the public does that Wharf is probably the main feature of a Corrado that most people come to they 'll walk down that Wharf and to be able to use it and for them to come down and actually work on it well same could be had we 've got any questions yeah so just trying to get clear what appreciate and maintenances have been done properly and we 've you may have heard of I think lack of maintenance slicker moments I think there was money generated from that walk to be fair that went to other projects and that Wharf for a period of time was neglected we 've tried to play catch-up but unfortunately they 're losing a battle so if we improve the maintenance would that be sufficient in the short term while we work through the medium term future I think you 'd spend a lot of money to try and get it back to where it should be is that the polls on that Wharf if you went down and a really low spring tide you 'd be a standard of what was left there 's a lot of movement and I think you 'd have to spend some serious money to educate debate to some sort of and the other thing that I 'm really still struggling to understand is like if we 've got upgrade that 's Jay how is it that other developments are happening on the wharf some buildings on the wolf yeah like is it I mean can anyone just go on put stuff on they even build next to it no they have to put their own piles under the seabed and they should not be actually attached to the wharf right okay but they can use the wharf using wolf so but if we were going to upgrade the war it should we be considering like a moratorium on development adjacent to it until we 'd upgraded it so that we don 't cause for us so if you 've actually seen a draft plan that we come up with is is Wharf users the ideal was to actually build something solid alongside that Wharf not to the length of the wolf more to we the buildings are and would actually stay lit up and then time maybe retain that old Wharf as pedestrian use but it then slowly as you 're suggesting slowly sort of maybe get it back to where does but all comes the underfunding on would benefit thank you very much we again making the effort to come and and also very supportive of the previous submission so thinking thank you thank you _"

    "text": "known again could I invite John right from the uh karora fisherman 's Association welcome I will read your submission so please sir highlight your main points and at this time available for questions then we 'll move on to those so thank you thank you you 're the main main point of my submission is that we feel that the echo wharf is somewhat neglected it 's an actually a disgusting state particularly health and safety laws we note that there 's quite some money ten million dollars allocated to the long term plan for the echo war we would like to see it spent on the war for northern consultants and the such and the echo fishermen 's association would dearly like to be involved in the planning of the wharf as you know we have the cruise ships come to occur it 's very competitive at that stage we as fishermen we have to travel some distance now to parking and servicing their vessels I think that 's the main point definitely that the wharf is in a very bad state of repair and that there 's 's accidents nothing totally serious but it 's waiting to happen thank you thank you very much and it 's really good that you 've highlight at that point you 're not the only one to do so I hasten to add so but you 've lived plenty of time for questions so Tim Yanni thank you I really like your suggestions regards of you guys being involved in the designers and you 're the commercial users of it as has it been most of the folks start that 's it we brought up with staff to discuss well it 's Association president we 've discussed this in length and we 've actually submitted a plan to the community board in Accra of what we would like and like I say if the council come to the point where they are going to spend some serious money on the wolf we definitely like to be able to get around the table with you know the likes of the Christchurch City Council the the engineers that build it and have some input into it because after all we 're at the a wolf in Accra is a functional you know it 's a it 's a place where most people come to Eckert they walk along the wolf thank you they 've got Yanni and then Aaron yeah two points in your submission when you talk about the wars poor maintenance the uneven surface and the deteriorating condition my understanding from the council Commission report it 's got five to ten years of good life lived in it yeah so I guess I 'd bench any response to that and the second point question will point on your submission that her question on was you talked about the black cap getting a building extension and then stage one being built I just wanted to know if you were if you guys were consulted over the black kept building extension because it wasn 't just a little bit unclear from the submission about whether they 've been in the community engagement or discussion with you over there thank you first point I can tell you of a repair job that was done on the wharf over a hole that have rotted away 's you know that sort of disaster waiting to happen a local guy Tony Mirra took photos presented on the community board of holes right next to the wharf where an elderly person perhaps could step in that hole and go straight up onto the deck of a boat it is a serious concern point to the black cat we have had a lot of issues with the black cat we understand from anger Smurf council member that none of the furniture so-called furniture on the agro wolf has got consent and we have problems with ambulances fire engines and that sort of thing getting down the wharf past a vehicle like two vehicles can 't pass on the wharf now and they used to be able to years ago there was tons and tons of fish taken off the wharf and in big trucks and I mean big trucks that can no longer happen and yes we have a really serious concern over the black cat princess we 've I 've been to several community board members where in return has been prison and Andrew Turner has admitted that Landing that 's a public space was a council era and so as an association we would have liked to have thought that the council would be very proactive and rectifying the matter we have had from Jeff Woodham a meeting Monday night fishermen 's Association in a Carrera and he submitted a plan of a part way removal of the of the fruit so-called furniture I 've been using the wolf commercially for nearly 50 years and I know when red and Dobby built their black cat premises as a Cray factory they were not allowed to have they were led to a but to the wolf but they were not allowed to have a footprint on the wharf Kim Paulin was the district engineer and he was adamant about that and so how its evolved to get to the present point where they 're quite some distance out onto the wharf and I 'm talking meters we have ramps poles supporting advertising that sort of thing and it 's it 's a serious issue thank you thank you Erin here this question isn 't as serious as they related to the Christchurch famous chef Darren right here 's my son oz it of congratulations thank you soon the New Zealand always in the New Zealand Olympic cooking team and it runs Chillingworth ride for those at him to be and he will be at a fundraiser in a couple of weeks for the demo for the Dingle foundation thanks John and for taking the trouble to come from a car over today to to present this submission I mean I 'm as aware as you are of some of the difficulties that have been with some of the issues that you raised in the submission I 'm also aware of work that 's going on between the community board and staff to resolve some of those issues and the length of time some of that is taken so we will get to a resolution of some of the issues that you 've raised having said that the final resolution of some of those issues will be in the development the redevelopment of the wharf so and that 's where you submissions particularly helpful now there 's a tendency ocurro Wharf has been predominantly about tourism and visitors and the cruise ship passengers and so on I 'm very aware of someone that 's close to a Corot that there 's a whole fishing industry operates from there and there are other activities take place on that Wharf as well do you want to talk to us a little bit about you know the way that a fishing operation works on that Wharf and perhaps the number of fishing vessels and some of the other activities that take place on there other than just tourism related activities there 's certainly injury thank you but the fishing has taken a secondary role near to the tourism I can remember in the 90s and that sort of thing we 'd have 40 or 50 fishermen prison at local meetings we were affiliated to the commercial Federation of fishermen the entry of the quota system was the main point in the reduction and fishing effort a lot of guys were at a point of retiring they took the golden handshake and exit the the industry since then tourism has really evolved we that the setting up of the wharf in the latter stages and that was the introduction of the two pontoons that 's good but we have a situation where as you know that fisherman 's landing was built over that represents probably 20% of the of the landing so at the moment it 's very competitive for space at the wharf now I understand that the two major tourism black cat and eco dolphins have a time Sejal for the pontoon immediately adjacent to the black cat premises which is great but as a fisherman and other operators we we could arrive because of the weather the tides the time of day anything at all so we 're not we can 't_''_615.799 be locked into a time schedule for the use of the ward we have one other member Hamish Menzies who 's a mussel farmer and he is not only had to operate on a crucial day he cannot land his product unfortunately for her muscles don 't have a lifespan its water temperature it 's all sorts of all sorts of varieties of reasons control his effort his which is quite out of the question so he has a real problem that 's it sufficient Andrews yeah I mean certainly I think you 've demonstrated the you know the competition there is for space between the various different users of the Worf definitely thank you thank you very much and much appreciated that you came all this way to present much appreciated thank you thank you mean thank you cancels _"

    "text": "um Lindsey Castle around good afternoon over number of years count City Council have a complaints policy I can 't remember exactly when I first did that but probably about 15 years ago I note that in April 2016 the Christchurch City Council introduced a customer complaints management policy I discovered on your website but it appears that the council is yet to actually implement that policy flex policy needs to be easy to access needs to be user-friendly and transparent I do not believe that your existing policy that 's why you can transparency can 't_''_85.959 even find that really covers all these points now the reason I want you to have a proper complaints policy is because personal experiences I have had in dealing with the City Council some time back I had a leaky home I bought a unit and when we cover the years where thus covered water was coming into it I could make complaints to the council though I came out for clipboard looked at the problem it 's a bit of Correspondence phone calls I 've got absolutely nowhere weather and I have was treated it was appalling absolutely appalling of a stonewalled at any moves I made but I 've seen similar behavior and other issues I 've been involved with the the recent district plan saving the the city 's notable trees so I spend a lot of time on that and money and also it 's been a lot of time over the head the opal project and those are two recent examples where I find that summer behavior here is not what I would expect the point from an organization like does happen so what I want you to do is to have a complaint process and I wanted to put some features that needs to have it should be prominently displayed there 's a notice in all public areas of the council you go to the hospital they have forms up there so what your rights are well that 's what you need here that 's just one part of a function there needs to be a section on the council 's webpage which is easy to access right in front of you there it is where complaints 's web page through its already sit down puppy complaints need to be handled quite independent part of the council it 's no good going back to the people where the complaint has come week where you 're complaining about putting it to the head or back department it goes nowhere they 'll cover it up they 'll say everything is fine what you 're complaining about complies with Building Code or whatever and the reason they do then is that staff are in a very good when unique position when dealing with complaints and they can take advantage of that position staff have of knowledge and understanding of the law Building Code district plan requirements or whatever the complaint covers person making the complaint does not have those skills and this creates an imbalance of power between a council and the complainer and I found quite often you get the letter back saying it complies and you 've got to go around and dig out does it comply or not takes a lot of time I can do that because I 've learned now it is essential that complaints obtain external advice complaints need to be collated and reported on this will allow trains to be to be recognized and acted on already want to say but you people as counselors in its tail on board a problem exists nothing will change until you take on board that problem thank you thank you very much and that 's exactly ten minutes our five minutes so you 've just come to the end and look like I recall your experience of the Leakey home I knew you back then different role was the Member of Parliament but you know it 's it is a serious issue and thank you very much for bringing it to our attention right ok we 're on a break now until 30 p.m. so look _"

ability to complete the rebuild council would contribute a further some they would equate to a dollar for every dollar the trust raised the trust is that confidence of its ability to complete the job and ask Council to increases the contribution from 555 to one point five million half the funds required to rebuild the jetty three years ago when the trustees that was two engineers a server a project manager a businessman a technical communications expert in the lawyer always loved putting up a plain English person next to a lawyer said they would do all I couldn 't see the GT rebuilt they never imagined the extent of that effort and what they could achieve at basically it 's been a token mode every week it 's providing professional skills design engineering survey quantity surveying mark illegal for credit a book there 's been multiple fundraising events you 'll see those in the earliest missions and consolation prizes including dance night at the pub and now an art auction create to construct when 18 artists have been commissioned to paint works of the GT fronting up to residents this is a hard task asking for financial contributions and we 've received support from us from 20,000 down to ten thousand thirteen dollars and now that we 're developing a sponsor a plank project where the shorts pay a period of time we 've got hundred twenty-five flakes and these sponsor to 5 each our fundraising Bishop is really only getting underway now because we want to get all that that 's all right to know what we 're doing and that you 'll see why because the major difficulty the trust has faced and raising its contribution of 1.5 million rests on three simple questions to have now been answered what will it cost to rebuild the GT afterward we Rembert the council zip predictions were would cost simply 8 million dollars that was going to be out of our reach they are no they are less than three million dollars here 's the trust the ability to distinguish and here 's the trust ability carrot the rebuild itself we are confident that we have the skills and prices in place we 're very confident of that and will the council contribute this house year the first five thirty five thousand gave us level of confidence that allowed us to get to the stage now its case and completing the job so the trust has completed survey and developed engineering solutions solutions about the project Katsina we came up with the relatively novel solutions we 've had them testified both contractors and they 've approved the process which we were recommending related to contractors well-versed in this field but both very experienced and peers and genies and obtain detailed and cost-effective teams of contract both offered slightly different ways here but both were very competitive the trust is completing geotech investigations determining the leak the piles to reduce risk of fun and finaliters pricing we could actually use it a scruple concept which doesn 't require a necessary so much emotional park concept well we 're just working up the solution here both we hasten to add we can do significant lists we can do less than million dollars and with resources concealed application environment can bring god that 's awful drugs the trust is confident you know it 's another story the trust is confident and we will select the best contractor for the job the best process to get the job done and for the best price and for some less than three million dollars the only wish now being our far short fall short of that figure and then as remember a far cry from counsels costing that to rebuild the genie will cost the order 7.8 million and demolition the cost of eight hundred thousand now that similar like many it wasn 't just plucked out of the air they shown a detailed process by which they arrived to their finger and and by some terms of materials and labor content and their way and we started and deeply over their period of time and we 've come up with we believe any bit of solution and actually engineer to the original costing the Trust says a good understanding of what funds that can raise and where they be obtained from once we have commitment from counsel we can proceed with applications to the lottery rather and other philosophic trusts to raising the order of seven hundred thousand dollars and we will continue to gauge motor will fundraising efforts raising the profile of the project and obtaining funds the order of eight hundred thousand dollars from individuals businesses income from Vincent sponsorship links we 've raised in the order of about hundred and sixty thousand dollars in the initial guess keep money in the normal course of events of all funds were available we can commence construction within six months there are a number of options to extend them without adversely impacting the project we 're working with the contractors to do that if the funds already committed were released before the end of financial year 2018-19 the remaining nine at sixty-five could be contributed an equal part in the final she is following that 's 1920 and 2021 we 'll deal with the complexities surrounding that commitment makes it all possible and turns all the hard work into reality it 's a true partnership between counsel in the community while the trust seeks parity with Council by way of monetary contribution you should not lose sight of the efforts of the community when it delivers thoroughness Reconstructor genie it would have contributed in value far far more the cost of an expertise the time never taking of numerous events were normally random to hundreds of thousands of dollars I know that for a fact finally while the government 's major need to Lyttleton sorry while the governor 's by Gd coming to Littleton and the governor 's Bay Committee has as much the same significance as the Cathedral Estancia project it is more than a local attraction it 's 20 minutes for Christchurch it 's not a community college this doesn 't take half an hour equals no it is a metropolitan facility where people from all over Christchurch visit somebody to stroll across the water and annamaya views is to have weddings on it and is the place for all seasons and as I said go when you 're happy when you celebrate and also when you go when you 're sad we need to reflect this GD is a special place to conclude the trust efforts today to be helped by the knowledge that councils support descendants and recognise the importance of a partnership between the council and community council gives very good value for its money and nervously GDB to be rebuilt by council contribution 20% or whatever otherwise have cost and gets the job done five to ten years in of well it could have achieved and it sets the scene I believe for other community groups to make the contribution that we 've got a able-bodied men who retired and one retired in Governors Bay and there are other projects I can 't imagine especially here to head walkway where we could play a meaningful role as well as the main shared in Littleton and horsemen that grow so this is a community game this is a community outcome and we 're very proud of what we 've achieved today and we want to finish it finish the job lobby thank us for is a a fund match as we originally set out in your response to your submission in 2015 and you 've made very clear what we need to put on budget to create the certainty that you need to have those other quality funding conversations that you 've got lined up could that be expressed by Council as an underwrite for the project it could be and right yeah I 've thought of that basically also it could well be less than that 1.5 million if we can build it I mean I can 't give you the focus because they 're sensitive fingers with contracts we were to respect their their confidence and beginning was probably done but what there is a distinct possibility it could be less than three million dollars and it certainly might be more than that but and so they could be savings near as well as but it 's the rate for example lotteries we know that we can only go to lottery so if we 've got the backup from Council and come in from counts so that and lotteries where and we 're pretty confident we 've had an initial look at the approach discussions and when we 're confident we can raise that and so and other philanthropic trust but it 's that an underwriters certainly within my regional thinking as well as long as that commitment is made so that we can go about it we 're not going to be expecting council to give 1 more than we can then we won 't know we need because we 'd rather the community give it because at the end of the day this is a community asset we want to be able to say with pride that this is our GT that we 're going to do on at least GT what we want to do know is it 's not going to be something a place to people walk on it 's going to be a place for people to celebrate and do things on this chili it 's going to be a place of Education of a history of culture and and it 's a place where people gather for all types of events it 's gonna be a place of no interest FL thank you I 'm just wondering besides the GT like the certainty environment around at these lovely two in the walk walking Trek has been there for a long time I 'm just wondering in fact would does the trustee of it interest to preps in an assisting the enhancement of their walking track which I think those reliving his friends I think we looked at that early on 18 years ago we looked at that process because you know spinning a shingle that something I mean again just can I say about what the walkway which I 'm involved with as trustee of charitable trust and its really it 's good to have a plan when you 're going on a walk you want to go somewhere you want to go to you know traditionally you go to a good lighthouse or you go to a GT or something some invite place where you can go as part of the justification for the walk but the point is this is certainly we see the walkway being created here supported and labor that we would be prepared to get a volunteer group together to go from especially from the governor 's may GD through to Sandy Bay and beyond because it does require some some work there and you know we think we can do a lot cheaper I mean the reality is community groups are bloody good at spinning dollars wisely thank you thank you very much thank you very much Simon thanks we may be in touch on the other meter _"

    "text": "I 'm stiffened now I 'm not craving a reserved very close cloud burger a gallon of tan a reserve management committee please help me with us you know it is clubbing okay right thank you I 'm going here on behalf of the garden obtain a reserve management committee I 'm their secretary and this is also my first time for speaking in this sort of formal context so forgive me if I wander so I 'm going to talk through a little bit of a history or a short background of the committee first and what we 've done so the garden of Tana it 's located reasonably centrally in a Corolla it 's a community facility it 's also an exemplary Abbot areum and now since the last 3040 years it 's got some exemplary native restoration going on as well and natural restoration as well as a sister the the garden of Tana was set up as a reserve in 1986 I believe mmm 2010 was adopted with a reserve management plan and since then we 've been implementing that plan and extending upon it areas originally these are some photos out there of it included some tennis courts and it was quite a community facility for Victorian strolls we 've got the domain on the right-hand side and there 's a natural division now and what we refer to as the world would on the western side and that has essentially been overrun with natives in quite a appealing way so we 've made a natural division in the wood in the garden of tener which also caters to a bit of a split community opinion about the garden of honey and that one side is appreciated for those classical Victorian qualities in the other for the native qualities so just going to before the errands he started there were massive issues with Health and Safety there were some dislodged logs that have been dropped and just lift above tracks there was massively slippery tracks and issues for people walking through it there was massive drainage issues it still persisted today there 's a lack of visitor information huge infestation of pests and a massive infestation of invasive weeds also there was a lack of point for the local community so since then we have been dealing with that progressively so we 've implemented a massive amount of arborist work we consider about a third of their garden of town I completed the same with the tracks damaged dangerous logs and health and safety issues have been dealt to and we have a constant sort of watchdog engagement with it for any issues around that and we get a lot of feedback from the community and respond to that we 've implemented some drainage improvements entrance upgrades including interpretation and visitor information and also some restoration work as well as pest control and invasive weed control now in response to that we 've had a massive amount of positive feedback from the community and visitors as I 'm sure you all know of crucial visitors in a Corolla and we have a huge number of them go through the garden of tiny using these upgraded tracks that we have so that they can actually walk through without getting completely muddy and slipping over we 've also had schoolkids from their local school up there planting that front all in all it 's slow but very positive development on implementing the reserve management plan so moving through submission summary points that we support in the long term plan the allocated funds for 20 18 19 20 21 those of what we expected from the 2015 long term plan and so we have essentially been implementing our plan according to that 2015 long-term plan and our allocation so we support the three years of allocated funds that we have been given in the current proposed our second point is that we request that some drainage issues don 't work from traffic and rolling budget this is because the garden taani essentially sits at the base of a large catchment catchment of Ellmers valley and you 've got right up on the other side towards a nuclear valley road so you can imagine the garden of tiny it 's the last point before ahead speech wrote in the lower water front because of that you have essentially a discharge put into the garden of Tony and a lot of those issues that we 're having with things like we see coming from the surrounding water tables from the roads and overflow systems and there 's clear evidence that 's not essentially able to it doesn 't have the capacity for higher waterfalls and that 's all just running into government money and undermining so we would like to see some of those issues dealt with outside of the garden of Tony we 'd also like to reinstate some of those future budgets namely because we 're on a projectory to work with those budgets so as if here there 's a 2015 plan there and the 28th draft plan so this is looking forward I just note this is going from 21 and 22 forward so you miss in the first three years which are matched between the 2015 and 2018 draft plan and you can clearly see in the 2018 draft there 's a complete drop-off in funds and for us that 's a bit of a concern because we have upcoming projects that were mandated in the reserve management plan and indicated and we are on our way to working on those projects and a third around maintenance issues so a lot of the garden of Tommy funding budget and for us it 's so the community as well it 's a it 's a park and we would like to see that there 's a closer cooperation maintenance at the moment there 's no communication between and we 've tried hard and we have had help from our representative council remember that quite often comes along to our meetings but we just don 't have a good connection there and for example we 've done plantings in the garden of town twice now that have been cut down by Delta and maintenance and thrust those plants just sell us odd story but they have been planted by their by their school kids and I think that has a pretty big impact on the community and it 's really frustrating for the volunteer and management members that are putting them there if it so we would like to see a some improved structure around maintenance budget and a clear structure of communication where we can feed into what we 're doing and they 're aware of and we 've been doing some of that work as a capital budget but I think probably be better seen as a maintenance budget issue so our fourth point is that 's the point sorry is control of funding so there 's been information implementation that reserve management committees can no longer hold our own funds for us that 's frustrated us for small projects okay committees are a subcommittee of the community board now such they 're not an entity so they 're not a legal entity that is able to hold funds the community board can hold well the whole the reserve management committees can have budget but actually having a bank account in their own name and holding funds is something that isn 't possible so it 's something that the community governance team or bank spoons here have been working through for a very long time and we need to get a resolution to it came no longer when did she last hold funds we had to but it 'll be between six and six months in the year ago I 'll give you another minute wanted to understand there no that 's right sorry you know that yes so essentially that 's our issue and that 's a real issue for small days where we can 't buy cookies for example one tea so I 'll just go through there and thank you very much I 've got 39 seconds left to go I think I think you 've made a really powerful presentation Sarah I just what happens if you manage to do some fundraising would you put the money now we can 't and we did for example we had some money from a discretionary fund that we applied to and we had to essentially hardly get rid of that and now we don 't have any way to Erin it 's just around Delta doing any work there would not be a better investment or better leveraged if the council paid that money and obviously not to someone that can 't get it but that money went to the community board and then it was dispersed to fund you guys to do the same way would you get bit of value or 'm not a hundred percent sure of why this is but I 've been informed that we are not supposed to implement maintenance we 've been cautious of implementing maintenance work capital budget work and I 'm not sure why that is but I was but when the maintenance hasn 't done you just call it capital work and get on and do it anyway but look can I just say thank you I 've seen to the garden of Tony and I love it I think what you are doing here is extraordinary you have tuned what was you know quite degraded into an absolute asset for not only the community but for everyone who visits the earth so thank you very much for everything that you do that 's just try and make your life easier because I think with everyone around the table is nodding their heads that they want to do something to help you thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "Paul de Latour akaroa Community Health Trust fundraising committee welcome thank you don 't you trust him I mean that this particular question has excited quite a lot of interest from a wider public who who haven 't understood that this is something that the better a local community within the city has asked for well within there yeah so please tell us the story thank you for this opportunity and I 'm not surprised that people did get a bit misconstrued but especially that funding facilities not owned by the council hmm vet counselors this is a great opportunity for it for the council to have a consultation so that the council can help fund facilities not owned by the council and I stress this consultation is important funding that somebody 's not owned by the councilors not as a given right by individuals or community groups clubs turns to gate a rate that they see as a benefit for the committee are for the community or their clubs but having to consult with the community so that their wishes and desires of all the community will have the promoting a request to rate as they perceive for the penis of their community and if a community requests the council to consult with that community and has the support of a rate for the facility the burden of that rating cost is not shared by the Greater Council and I think that an important point that that people got to realize that and also see me with the financial constraints of the City Council and not only the City Council but the CHD be another regional organizations this method of funding smaller community facilities has a tremendous benefit not only to that community but the ability of the council to be proactive in helping these communities to continue to improve their facilities now I 'll give you an example that 's the reason I 'm here why the council should introduce this funding mechanism and you 're all well aware that the aircar hospital was damaged probably 2010 and 2011 earthquakes and subsequently demolished now an organization representing acara and the wider banks valincia a community called aircraft structure group now called the Acura Community Health Trust the Charitable a geographical spread of the people of the peninsula and Pam Richardson here who you all know was a member of that original structure group and is also a member of she 's a trust trustee this was formed and from the desires of residents to investigate before the forum for the desires of the residents to investigate the opportunity of rebuilding their car health facility now the structure group had numerous meetings with the residents of our own banks been insured and to inform them or progress including the desires of the community to build at a core health facility the overwhelming comments and feelings from these community meetings was to build a facility eventually an agreement was reached with the District Health Board and the structured group to build a health facility among providers of this agreement was that the community had to make a financial contribution a contribution 2.5 million towards the cost the building plus set up costs and the vicinity of 500,000 now the strategy to raise this money has developed in three main thrusts approaches to the community for direct donations approaches to regional crutch of City Council to instigate a rate to help fund the building now this rate would only be on the old acara county council area now I put this request and approximately 18 months ago and last year did submit also to the annual plan to date donations have total in excess of 1.2 million this is including donations from individuals banks permit banks peninsula community service groups eg the likes Alliance a whole range of fundraising from the wider community groups on the peninsula we do have pledges hoping for hundred thousands with the grants from national and regional organizations to be finalized now with the ability to strike a rate the target of 3 million is attainable it 's approximately if this is able to be done about a third of the costs now it 's been a long process understanding some of the legalities the council has to work through as to the reason why I 'm here today it 's a unique opportunity for the council to agree to funding facilities not owned by the council in the ways that communities can can approach the instigate a rate to help build that will benefit these communities now I urge the council to implement this new policy of consultation for funding facilities to enable a rate to be struck that is not owned and not maintained by the council thank you thank you very much and that was a really good summary of the waters you know being proposed and the consultation document does anyone have any questions Jamie is it essentially proposing or would you just this across all rating bases in that area just commercial just residential or both alright payers it 's different from a but a business a business improvement as directors so both the commercial rating base though okay thank you the interesting thing about about raising less as an issue is that one of the counters and councillor Dionne swags and I went to see a business association and it helped us sexually advised them about the Business Improvement District process which hasn 't been picked up by by some of the business districts that actually could take charge of their own sort of environment and and do some good yeah it 's good Andrew Paul thanks very much indeed for the presentation and you know for once again providing information on this project and I mean it 's clear that there 's been a huge amount of work done in the community do you believe one of the issues I think and one of the reasons we went out with the question that we did is around community support for these kind of projects I mean obviously there 's a high level of awareness in their community about this project do you also believe that there would be a high level of risk for rating for it in this way definitely I mean the the the wider community have been or should know that I 'm going through this process was a the other trustees of the Community Health Trust took every meeting I 've been to there was this call the whole time we want this facility we want it and plus with the ability of consultation they 've got the opportunity to to actually support it or not and I would be very surprised if as if it be fair to say that the community is actually waiting for council to come up with the process to achieve this I think so yes Aaron yeah this is the exact same system that quite could have got their health facility for those that aren 't aware they did the isn 't I 've got a fantastic facility up there which was likely finished just prior to the quakes so it was a extremely good timing and I was lucky enough to go up and be part of a fundraiser right at the start of that in their community really embraced it and it had a really good path because they would have been waiting years to get the money from government they took the bull by the horns facility yep I 'm aware of that Cara 's not the only council I think mister talk I 've done it and I 'm sure around and the government will good enough post-quake to be in tight they 're off-site picked up the tape so it was quite lucky for coca-cola yep Pauline 45 seconds the amount that we 're is 2.5 million towards the building and then to set up the the trust and and the operating company which is after our health limited is in the vicinity of half a million dollars and you 've got to also realized before there 's been a lot of money spent by the structural group in feasibility studies and such and at the moment we 've raised in the vicinity from donations about 1.2 million we have got cleared ISM the region of 1 thousand and we 're still working through the regional national grounds so if the national and regional grants a modern expectation obviously the amount that would be needed to rate would be reduced look thank you very much for your time and presentation this morning I think it 's been very helpful thank you _"

    "text": "Jason Higa good morning everybody good morning letting me speak pleasure I migrated from the US to join my Kiwi girlfriend I came to Christchurch in 2000 because that 's where she lived I gained permanent residency in 2003 and after that relationship had ended I had come to appreciate the unique charms of Christchurch including that it had the best facilities I had seen for a city of that size so to the point where when I met my wife I managed to convince her to come down from Auckland to Christchurch now of course the earthquakes happened she wondered what I had gotten her into but we both signed the pledge saying that we 'd stay around until Christchurch had been rebuilt and in fact we even we even bought a house which I think shows about a year after which shows some confidence we understand there 's been special circumstances for the last for the first two years after the earthquake with aftershock after after shock after aftershock and companies that had jumped in early after did the 2010 earthquakes getting burned by the 2011 earthquakes and that settled down but now in effect it 's been five years after the period of aftershocks and time is of the essence people 's patience especially the Filipinos my wife was Filipino and many of her friends our patience is running out we 're starting to elute projects and initiatives that don 't get underway pretty soon we 're gonna lose them we almost lost the Metro Sports Center I 'm worried the stadium will head the same way and we still have Manchester Street not completely open we still have Oxford Terrance around the river not completely open there is many signs and we 've got dirty 30 buildings which hopefully more emphasis is done on getting people to work on those buildings that are still scarce of the earthquake now I disagree with Aaron about the council items being over spec because these will last for 4050 years if we don 't code them to what we consider a higher back now we 're gonna regret it in about 10 to 20 years as we look at it we 're effectively the capital with the South Island the South Island even after the earthquakes and we need to retain the influx of all the people who have come in migrants from the Philippines migrants from India people who have come down and helped with the rebuild we want them to settle here we want a bigger rate space and one of the things we need to do is smash some of the misconceptions that still exist about the CBD such as lack of parking and we need to fix the roads get all the road works done by 2020 I say that 's about the point where the sorry I 'm very glad by the way that we did the Convention Center that that got underway because that was at political risk of being canceled what I thought there is no reason why we can 't compete with Auckland for example we got a better lifestyle if we do the Christchurch and said initiative of getting big events here then we can say we offer a better lifestyle much improved housing and for the money that you spend and yet you still have a good job down space or a higher rates increase temporarily but in in exchange the council must execute we must get the city to a state where outsiders and people coming into the convention centre and so on will appreciate the city and people coming down for long breaks over the weekend will want to stay in the city and maybe migrate here later on I 'd say we should be targeting getting about there 's a huge influx of people going to Auckland I 'd say try to get 5 to 10k of those people per year to instead settle in Christchurch so that 's my main emphasis I don 't think we should be financially choked we need time is of the essence if we build up our population now then rates increases won 't have to be large in the future one quick thing we should not be trying to do a local alcohol policy anymore many of my friends I heard they have the drink I maybe have a drink maybe once or twice a month or once every two months but I have many friends who like to seen them have problems they need to city needs to cater for responsible people who want to enjoy themselves thank you thank you very much has anyone got any questions no thank you and thank you for showing your confidence in Christchurch thank you _"

    "text": "David Hawk okay well thank you for the opportunity of presenting to you today so I spoke last evening with to you with John Bennett on behalf of Horseman residents Association so our associations sorry our submissions are always consensus documents and we always encourage our people to submit individually so this is my submission so the focus I 'm going to bring to you today is on cycleways and I 'm going to bring to you much more of a citywide perspective that goes beyond Hallsville so I work for a large central city employer we have about 700 people on-site in the central city and my employers made the commitment to encourage people to leave their cars at home mainly for cost so getting getting rid of the cost of running car parks and for having a healthy workforce so they 've put a lot of effort into providing secure covered bike parks they 've provided bike share and other such like incentives and so now what we 're seeing is a council that 's heading for postponement and I sort of wonder where that leaves employers like really keen to bike but they won 't consider riding on unprotected roads I guess as an individual my motivation is that the city provides the ability for the less well-off to forgo the burdens of car ownership and as well as providing the opportunity for the environmentally conscious to get out on their bikes I would say that the major cycle route program is fundamental to this although it obviously has a long way to go and I think again still on the southwest but if you think of Hornby so Hornby has no major cycle route program planned that I 'm aware of at least not at the level of that we have in other parts of the city and biking in Hornby is absolutely horrendous coming back to horse will my direct personal interest is Bowman 's trial so that has the potential to be transformative for horse wall which like horse will sorry which like Hornby I would see is drowning in the sea of cars so lots of people in horse will own bikes and they 'll ride their bikes but they actually need safe to be brought forward it 's the final thing that I 'd like to say is that you 've experienced there 's a council a lot of local pushback to particular projects and the major cycle route program can I say it won 't get any easier politically in fact it 'll probably get harder if we look at the government 's financial commitments it 's not going to get any better any easier there either so and so we said to me yesterday that I should have given him and the opportunity to ask a question around the Whitely Avenue bus priority so do you want to take that opportunity now thanks David 's just going back to what you 've told us on behalf of the Association yesterday just what will help me for clarification is your sounds like you were supporting a bus lane on Lincoln Road and that 's that 's fine there 's also though reference to four laning and I 'm just wondering what your view your associations view is around the four laning in the area I guess to the west like near four laning and starts yeah we would see it as bus priority all the way from horse walk okay that clarifies that absolutely thanks thanks David but the thing that I did to that is that it must be accompanied by steps on the likes of Whitely F to allow the buses to travel in my direction thank you Sarah thanks David I 'm just checking your colleagues in town where you work um so who would quite like to bike but don 't want to these are currently people who are driving into town in single occupancy cab so I so sentence and Albans and grant a no power anymore they 're the ones I deal with on a day-to-day basis thank you very short dearly for seconds thank you however you didn 't mention no well you know need to consider for repo our times men you suppose increase the reach reach so this my concern if the increase the risk in country 's aging population quite a few other the personnel against to increase the rate so in overall view in citywide repo our ties which kind next year cleaver 5.05 the rates increase yeah so I would say that no matter what the age group that you get people onto separated infrastructure and they are safer there they feel safer and they are safer focus on race a so-called understand that you have a priority setting process in place so one part of that is that I saw recently a quite a lot of support from Council for building a stadium so I would put cycleways before I would build a stadium I build a million cycle ways before I build a stadium and you 'll see in my submission to is that I 'm very strongly in supportive of a realistic rates program thank you yes it was an unusual element of your submission but really really well well put the way that you put it about the larger fish and the intergenerational duty that you apply yeah thank you no thank you very much for your time that 's much appreciated and I did I kind of recognized your face when you sat down but I didn 't realize that you come from _"

    "text": "Nicky Clarke and Anna scallion brains Intermediate School kyouda koto Carter my name is Nikki Clark I 'm proud to be the principal of brings Intermediate School I 've been principal since 2015 deputy principal for three years before that and have taught within the school since 2002 I 'd like to introduce in a Scullion emma is one of our Cudahy our Marty student leaders in a lives very close to this intersection and who and her family have used it for a long time and assets on a student leadership team it brings Anna and I thank you for the opportunity to present to you about the here would brings gardeners intersection and to represent the safety concerns of our school community Breen 's intermedia is situated on brings road and mere three hundred and fifty meters from the center section many of our staff use this intersection each day and over a third of our student population also pass through here to get to school in a home each day you and I are bringing to you the voice of our students and our staff I understand you yesterday and presented a perspective from our parent community things that the bring about the intersection some of my concerns about the intersection are that is very dangerous because other other than the island which is half already hard to cross it 's the only way to get across where there were lights didn 't be easy to cross in safer what 's worse about the intersection it 's it 's not normally the kids who are doing the wrong thing it 's the drivers going too fast or turning without looking so for those reasons I think the intersection is dangerous and it needs to be less I see lots of kids who run past cows really quickly sometimes cause pop and bad places so we can 't save cause of coming or not I 've seen I 've even seen kids go straight across the road without looking and ending with Mimas it 's hard to go across in the morning to get to school and is very busy I have I 've seen many young kids from other primary schools struggling to cross roads while walking is hot as a hesita to kids with little knowledge of the safety cars and roads traffic lights would be much safer to help us get to our schools and cross the Danish roads my concerns about the intersection is that there have been lots of close calls and lots of real accidents a few days ago my mum was driving round the corner from Bryn 's Road to hear wood road and I saw a large pile of glass and coppices I have crossed it a couple of times to get to my friend 's house and there have been so many close calls with cars and school kids trying to cross the road I saw I 'm sometimes scared to cross the road and being afraid of being hit by a car and when I was younger I do not want that to happen again my concerns for this intersection is that because it is a busy intersection lots of people not only in cars but pedestrians have to take some dangerous risks to be able to cross the road and the crossing to go straight through the it is really hard to cross with traffic sometimes cans with prints do not have a lot of time to get across so they have to wait even longer it 's super dangerous every time my mom does a u-turn to get into her house at 4-4 a humid Road she must get hit by cars coming up god is rude she looks but they don 't_''_244.7 I also see the same thing Crossing I have to run for dear life I don 't get hit by cars come on guys please install traffic lights to make things easier for cousin people there are always close calls people getting hit or crashing almost every day I see these when I 'm trying to cross this road in summary our students think that this intersection is scary dangerous and busy because of hitters speed up as we cross it 's hard to get across the speed limit seems too high these are concerned about their own safety there 's a staff we are united in our opinions we have noticed increased traffic flow increased speeds in plenty of near misses around daily examples of risky behavior by all kinds of road users at this intersection due to the difficulty to either cross it or to in right under the traffic flow the Lita that I have shared with you from melisma Clennon is a particularly good summary of our safety concerns and also highlights the risky behavior I have just mentioned as Liz mentioned mentions the kind of risky behavior that this intersection of lending itself to and we say each day our children taking risks running across and waiting in the middle of a busy four-lane road to get to the other side cars waiting in the middle of he would Road to get across the four lanes cyclists shooting the gear to try and get across in time before a car takes them down cars hitching into the intersection to try and each forward to find the best kept speeding across the intersection to get in time right to get across in time right tuning cars on he would road hitting the middle island and then jumping it cars tuning into the wrong lane and not speaking looking to running to get across all four lanes without a way of getting across safely increasingly we 've noticed drivers doing something else which is quite interesting they 're choosing to turn left at Bream 's road in he would Road heading towards the Airport instead of trying to get across here in fact all of my staff tell me they all do that and then they perform a u-turn on he would wrote this is now creating a new hazard because more and more drivers are doing this in order to avoid crossing or tuning right so what we see is now often a banked up line of cars all waiting to tune around and do a new tune with two lanes of traffic behind them outside what has now become a really busy bakery carpark there are two safe crossing areas along here Wood Road in the middle of the busy two lanes and we of course encourage our children to use these but the children tell us it 's difficult to cross safely with such heavy traffic flow and people are accelerating across and past this intersection so most recent observation of this close call at an intersection was just yesterday morning whilst I was driving to work a car speeding right across the intersection in front of me meant that a number of us all put on our brakes quickly to avoid an intersection and I watch that car speed down Bryn 's road toward it towards our school as a principal I 'd read that potential phone call to tell me that one of my students has been hurt down there I believe it 's only a matter of time before someone has injured always it will be so terribly sad when we know that we could have been proactive and done something to make it safer for our community no matter you know II know and I appreciate the time you have given us to be here this morning thank you very much I 'm having been in Parliament I 've become used to the the law of unintended consequences so we hit a submission yesterday from a group and and fendle ton who have had a set of traffic lights at it and it what it has done is it 's encouraged people to use that that road so you put traffic lights on here wood road then gardeners Road becomes a very easy ride that that then brings right past your school so is that a consequence that you 've thought through well in all honesty that 's what the road has become in recent years it 's become a fast way to get down to white Aki Road and then I believe why are we getting increased traffic slow yeah but there was a period of time when cars were directed that way yes when there was the work happening on the northern yes what I 'm worried about and I mean this is something that obviously will will will take into account is that you 'll get an increased flow of traffic past the school and maybe there 's another way of calming the road on here wood Road in reducing the number of lanes that actually travel down here Wood Road which would make it with an island in the middle but it said that all I 'm saying is yes yep yep Michael Lynton thank you you know I guess we need to use the example of that intersection to make sure when we design new intersections they 're done for the communities that use them in terms of that stretch of road here Wood Road there 's obviously there 's a cycle way that was planned to be done down there which has been pushed out another eight years would you be in favor of bringing that forward to actually get the work done on that intersection Center if it makes us address the safety agencies that to me just quickly with the rather than having to go to hundreds and thousands and with regards to cyclones etc just giving the priority to the pedestrians which is your students and their families so rather than having a fully alert intersection for vehicles that there is a set of lights that is totally for pedestrians so that the vehicles have to work around the pedestrians creating the opposite effect of the other community so motorists using their area know that they have to stop the lights for pedestrians and more than one one option but your priority as the safety that lead to safety and anything we can do to to avoid what I believe is just a matter of time yeah look thank you very much and thank you too for making the effort is this the first time you 've made a presentation to Council yeah well well done thank you _"

    "text": "Kristensen South brush and residents Association and if councillors go back to the Monday the 7th of May agenda on page 103 just repeat what I 've said before and that is is that we 've read your submission and if you could just highlight the points if we have time then we can get to questions thank you situation the city is dealing with we 've got a Tale of Two Cities the city is played in a way where planning takes place in areas which have a future in other areas they are neglected we added the damaged part of the cities have been subject to systematic negligence on part of the crown and council a comparison between the two halves of the city highlights the level of discrimination we have come across on in imaginary or theoretical seawall which which lives across along Bridge Street one side which is the northern side of Bridge Street it does not have hazard planning the New Zealand coastal policy statement has not been honored there we do not have updated flood flood predictions the resource consent requirement in general do flood protection high hazard areas questionable the risk-based planning according to the civil defense and Emergency Management Act has not taken place there and we do not have flood management floodplain management on the other side southern southern side of British Street we have areas which said lifted in the earthquake we have got a serb council has provided hassle planning there the New Zealand cost apology statement has been honored the updated flooding flood predictions have been put in place resource consent requirements are in place we are looking under the long-term plan that permanent engineered flood protection is planned to be put in place there and they do have a floodplain management now next slide good morning mr. Crompton I 'm secretary of the South Brighton residences Association so we 're only going to focus on the first two slides and leave you to read the rest because of the time constraints the second page here and we look at the cost-sharing agreement and the land drainage recovery program so the key to a sustainable recovery following a disaster like we had in 2010-2011 is a rapid recess motto of build back better that phrase has become a mockery in the Christchurch context because we 've seen nothing in indicating building back better instead we 've had no sustainable planning we 've drawn the council 's attention to this many many times in the past both to the mayor and to the council our last submission was at a public forum on the 5th of October last year we asked that the matter of Hazard Mitigation be addressed the deputy mayor told us that this would be addressed to refer to staff and since then we have heard absolutely nothing on the subjects that we raised at that our current submission our outlines what is arguably systematic negligence in regard to planning so everyone in Christchurch is well aware of the differences between the East and the West and what has been spent in the eastern suburbs and what has been spent in the western suburbs this is what you 're going to be deciding on with the long-term plan for the next 18 years if things continue as they do we 'll have areas of the city to live in where the housing is inadequate etc etc so some of the worst areas of Christchurch have been denied the protection of environmental law and community well-being has been ignored as we put in here so these areas our area in particular are facing difficulties with insurance cover we have insurance companies which are refusing to cover houses in certain areas in postal codes where nothing has been done to mitigate flood protection yeah flood hazard in particular people are having difficulty with their mortgages because if you don 't have insurance cover you can 't get a mortgage building permits have been issued without any mitigation this is a problem we brought up in the past as well where the council has issued permits to build houses 50 centimeters below the minimum required by the building code which is illegal and nothing has been done to compensate the people affected by this yeah they 're exposed to natural hazards which had not been mitigated and that slide lists all the relevant legislation and documents which we brought up many times in the past as well briefly on Gerry Brownlee established a land-use recovery program done by each end in that preliminary plan negation to deal with natural hazards in the final use final plant use recovery program this obligation was transferred over to Council and it was supposed to be completed by April 2016 in a document from Vienna science about governance issues in regards there is an outlining of of loopholes where it states that lobby groups have the ability to strongly influence outcomes often if if the council don 't does not stand up to them the outcome of coastal erosion management decisions are frequently dominated by a well-connected powerful lobby group at the expense of the wider community interests we look at the regulatory environment that we look at the research and and what council must give effective and the New Zealand costal policy statement is one of the very serious instruments that have been neglected north of Brits day but by some strange arrangement the minister and a group named questios coastal residents united reached an agreement to exclude coastal hazards from the district line this took place in 2015 before council was a you know amendment of the trashiest replacement district plan and basically leaves the coastal hazard at council discretion to be delayed as soon as reasonably practical practicable but no later than 30th of June 2021 this is as an expense of the wider community we do not have such sustainable planning in place for the whole city the 20 new tailored coastal hazard support you know they identified 6,000 properties that were exposed to erosion in 2016 and 15 and 16 but in 2017 this number was reduced to 1,000 properties and according to all the information that we 've got you know this appears to be still to an imaginary seawall or very mysterious any message essence delaying this hazard recognition and hazard mitigation has the potential to delay the next disaster like in Matata and ex-con experiences it 's also referred to in this report that EGC has outstanding obligations it 's couched counsel is involved with this ties into the cost-sharing agreement and the land trainers recovery program you just have a minute left here going okay we 've got this information about this mysterious evolve normal recognizes why this instrument is on questions no I 'm afraid not you 've come to your in two of your time but look thank you very much I mean people are very familiar with the the issues that you 've raised and and obviously there 's a little bit more of a follow-up that needs to occur so thank you very much for making a presentation one sentence you you would like to see engagement doesn 't work that 's why we give ten minutes to people so that they can they can choose whether they spend their time making their Beauford to staff and then people hear nothing for six months look um thank you very much for your presentation today and what I was trying to indicate to you that there 's obviously some further communication that needs to occur so but this is the LTP process so we 'll take your submission as an LT piece of mission so thank you _"

    "text": "thank you thank you Richard the circuit from the diamond have a community association welcome thank you a PowerPoint that I banged out this morning to cover the main points of our submission the submission was based using the online forum so I did make some comments this association did make some comments about the general matters there I think the only thing there I just like to say that in terms of rate rises the Association takes the view that there is a substantial under investment and infrastructure in the city so in terms of increasing rates they do need to keep going up and going up for a while not just tapering off necessarily after a few years because there 's an enormous backlog of roading and also particularly wastewater treatment that needs to be put in place anyway moving to our submission that that deals with points that are very parochial and we asked there 's about seven priorities we have in our submission the first one is in relation to the diamond hub of wharf which has been discussed by council staff and the community board got by over many years without substantial disaster happening but they 've been numerous near misses and this is the type this this these series of photographs in a short video I took on a relatively calm day but with a bit of a swell with the gap between the boat and the and actual rather slippery Wharf steps moving around a bit and you see people just lifting their children on and off the boat carrying bicycles other gear get moving in and out kind of lifting children right across the gap fishing lines etc kids amazingly trying to do that themselves and the other kid turns around and looks at the baby being carried across I mean you 'd think it 's funny but it 's not funny till somebody falls in between and somebody did fall in between a couple of years back luckily they weren 't injured on medication now the video if I can get this to go mmm-hmm I get it going okay well it doesn 't seem like it 's easy to get going and the that was just illustrating actually some elderly and struggling to get on and off the boat as well so moving on from there to the next and so the key point about the wharf there is we certainly support an upgrade in some kind of pontoon system as possible it 's not going to necessarily be easily easy technically in engineering wise but that 's certainly our first desired capital improvement because of the health and safety risk that quite clearly is there people can get on easily in littleton with a ramp that goes up and down and you get actually people who are infirm or disabled getting on littleton thinking they 're going to be able to get off with diamond-hard the same degree of ease and they quite often there 's some real trouble and carrying them on and off and there 's a long planning exercise that the community undertook would counsel staff and you 've been briefed on that before we are asking for commencement during this next few years of some implementation of it the key features of the the plan that produced an excellent concept plan is to improve the 's taken on a Saturday when it 's things are pretty quiet but you still have the same thing with people wandering both sides of the cars and not being able to eat on the footpath and cars backing haphazardly all over the place and other cars trying to get through down to the wharf and so on it 's not a great setup and we 'd like some traffic calming in there so there 's a variety of recommendations coming out of that report and we 'd certainly like the one to do with traffic calming effects be the first one to be exercised the next priority is in relation to the godly house site now I 've actually come and talk to the council previously about this in fact I before of years I 'd be mentioning it but it doesn 't seem to register any particular interest so we 'll repeat the story briefly there I don 't have the picture of godly house here with me I was a bit of a rush those people are not aware of it but most of you are we community meeting place and cafe and pub now we have two cafes well one store that got tuned in the cafe and a cafe that 's on a temporary site adjacent to two godly house grassed area anyway oh yeah that 's good anyway so it started off licking across we and godly house used to be an in this wonderful grassy lawn and so on we have the commute Association organizes summer concerts so far for the last six years using the grassy area but we still consider the building providing some all-weather indoor outdoor concert venue a permanent cafe because the current cafes and at least that 's been on only temporary and it 's consistent couple of containers locked together and possibly shift the library from the wheelers which is down the underneath the hall some some combined facility that the community can use and we recognize possibly why this hasn 't been a priority when you 've got things like the shirley community centered to rebuild that we would like to see as a first stage for the council to actually assign a planner to look private public partnership and for a replacement door for the community alright moving on to the next one the council has been very good to us as far as we 're concerned Timms of the community hall maintenance community sociation looks after the hall it 's very busily used by numerous groups in the community it said earthquake repairs its head some upgrade but there 's still some jobs to do to finish off we 're actually going to invest some Community Association Runyan pipes and grant funding to tidy up one room inside and get it realign so it can actually be then made available for use but there 's still some other tidying up work to be done on the hall the next item is to do was the diamond have a domain toilet there 's been a consultant engineering report done on that and pointing out that the septic tank system overflows regularly and does need work and to some degree that 's possibly been increased by the freedom campers that are using the domain carpet there as well and if you go down behind the this behind the the toilet you 'll see a the discharge pipe from the septic tank overflowing running down the hill that right hand slide is where the effluent crosses the coastal track and then it takes off down the hillside into the harbor so it 's probably not particularly good luck and it does need some work on it the last priority I just want to address is to do with the head to head walkway which we support and around there 's being excellent work being done by the regional parts people annexed singleton in particular and also the urban part people have been assisting the reserve management recently after a number of years of lobbying and started work on clearing an area of huge infestation and bone seed on Stoddard point in fallen trees but this picture just taken about four days ago is very recent example of the ongoing issues we have with maintaining that that walkway that 's actually never been fixed up since the earthquake and since the east of cyclones of about 2040 and the store huge amounts of broken track due to a days ago just for seeing the diamond Harbor Beach toilet but taking out probably what was left of the roof of the diamond harbor the beach changing shades there and there 's there 's need for an upgrade and this need for constant maintenance and today the urban and the regional parks teams haven 't really got its sorted who 's doing what so not much gets done and that sound the end of it really in terms of what I 'd like to talk to you some dis open for questions well look no we 've come to the conclusion of 13 minutes I 'm sorry but but it was a very comprehensive submission and we really value the work that that the community associations such as your owner just doing and and obviously you 've given us a lot of food for thought so thank you very much for making the presentation thank you _"

    "text": "without jiff mix will please you most certainly I 'm sure you don 't have to borrow I 'm sure she 's a willing supporter so welcome yeah I wish to bring to your attention the concerns of many residents of acara regarding freedom camping I 'm aware that there have been many complaints to counsel but most appear to have been brushed off and not acted on there is a perception that the seriousness of the issue is not really understood and that counsel is reluctant or unwilling to address the concerns the residents raised to help raise your awareness a small group of residents who recorded some of the activities of freedom campus that they experienced on a daily basis over summer I 've agreed to present the submission on their behalf I apologize for my spelling mistake but I didn 't actually prepare these slides there are a number of issues that arise from what you are seeing most of the smaller converted vans do not comply with the new regulations despite most proudly displaying the blue self-contained sticker on the area a port-a-potty tucked under the is not what the regulations specify yet they continue to camp in our town with impunity freedom campers are active on social media and are well aware that compliance officers are seldom to be seen freedom camping is currently permitted on land administered by counsel and specifically prohibited providing the van meets the self-contained requirements as a consequence we have campus parked in some of the most scenic locations in a Corral the decision to allow freedom camping in residential areas or shortsighted will considered and quite frankly offensive Council is under no obligation to provide locations for freedom campus to camp for free but it does have an application to residents and ratepayers who are fed up with their town being treated like a gypsy caravan camp it is our submission that freedom camping should not be permitted anywhere in a corral or it 's environments to ensure compliance Council needs budget for at least one inspector who is locally based able to get out and about early morning and late evening seven days a week it is my understanding there is currently only two enforcement officers with a work weekends although the submission is to the long term plan we need a short-term resolution we ask that council takes the necessary steps to ensure the regulations and bylaws are reviewed and are in place for next summer thank you thank you breath thanks very much for that I mean completely agree with you it seems nonsensical that we allow this to go on is that are there any examples that you 've seen around the country where compliance and fining and enforcement is working in a local area like this well the only one I 'm aware awaz I think Nelson that has a total ban on freedom camping within the city area I think it was an article in the paper yesterday they 're still having problems there was a person camped in a children 's park and there 's still camper vans parking it 's it 's really it 's it 's easy you can you can make change the regulation and reduce the bylaws but these people are smart they 're not dumb and they 're constantly been occasionally each other you have to have it is there an example of somebody basically going around and whacking these people with a fine ah well I 'm I don 't_''_270.639 personally know I know that quench town has got tough and we 're showing fine doesn 't change things pretty quick no they paid to change to clamping because the fines are an effective against not paying on what they don 't if they 've got a hired vane there 's no mechanism for collecting them after the you know work the vein companies to deal with that no no but that 's the problem there is one of the many problems with this this is this can be solved yes but the central government needs to solve that one sorry seem to government so thing to be yeah I know that that the retinal companies do have a responsibility I 'd much that I 've received a speeding ticket in France a couple years ago speeding tickets different from a bylaw so you can 't enforce the process it 's essential government the speeding tickets are not bylaws they 're central government fines and yes to me with a rental car but I think that you 've got a the bylaw is difficult because they can 't enforce them through the the the campaign being companies so it is a problem that 's been raised with central government and we 're hoping that yeah so there is a working party that 's looking at that but I mean the general issue is around around a karora and it is certainly something that I don 't know the timeframe for that I 'm looking at Andrew because he 's our sort of kind of go-to person you you 'll be aware of the Community Survey which has been done a Vacarro residents and I imagined that you and the people that you 're representing here today would have been part of that and I hope that you 've responded to that detail and the same kind of detail I 'll certainly make sure that your submission goes through into that piece of work as well but I mean the community board are absolutely determined that we make some further changes to ensure that we don 't this summer in the meantime there is some work going on between local government and central government there 's a working party which on a part of and the acarajé ex Ariane 's is one of the areas of focus for that working party but it 's become clear that what we 're experiencing a corona is by no means exclusive to a corona this problem is nationwide needs to be dealt with as a national issue there has been an explosion and the numbers it 's just unbelievable even during winter it was settled down but even still are getting in my the same numbers are pouring into town yeah so Nelson 's depreciated between self-contained and non self-contained so they do provide parks for a normative number to be experienced this self-contained it 's definitely deliver service there doesn 't panic yeah but if they 're not self-contained then they should be in a camping ground they should be absolutely they should be what world would breached our time so thank you very much for going to the trouble of making the submission that 's very much appreciated ahjumma now just briefly until 11 o 'clock so that 's just 10 minute break thank you _"

    "text": "Charles dress on behalf of 350 walk thank you did you please start the video and turn the sound up as high as it 'll go only the scientists know how desperate global warming has become and they are not being reported or listened to world temperatures above pre-industrial levels have doubled in the last eight years as a result Greenland glaciers and the Arctic ice sheet are melting so fast that the cold water is slowing the Atlantic Current moderate temperatures in Europe North America Africa and even New Zealand depend on the Atlantic Current Greenland melting has locked in already one foot of sea level rise by 2050 Arctic winter temperatures reach 36 degrees Fahrenheit above historical levels scientists are alarmed by how rapidly Antarctic ice is melting now as the warming ocean melts the ice sheets from underneath Antarctic melting is now locked in sea level rise of 10 feet by 2100 atmospheric co2 just Abbas Tuesday reached 412 parts per million the highest level in 70 million years 350 parts per million is the maximum sea level temperatures in the Middle East last summer reached 46 and gas for the electricity to run their air conditioners the hot weather is helping supercharged the wildfires what has really surprised scientist is how rapidly the feedback mechanisms have kicked in the rising temperatures result in more and bigger forest fires forest fires decreased carbon sequestration as well as increase co2 levels and airborne soot particulate increased soot blackens glaciers which make them absorb heat from the Sun faster and then thus melt faster melting glaciers create sea level rise and sea volume which increases the frequency and force of hurricanes melting Antarctic ice born as a seaborne ice sheets allow land glaciers to flow into the ocean and thus to melt melting Arctic ice helps create warmer Arctic waters which thaw frozen tundra melting Tundra releases co2 much of which turns into methane because of microbe activity our biggest carbon sink the ocean has just about reached maximum carbon absorption levels drought kills vegetation which not only sequestered carbon but also helped to soil retain rain water thus droughts resulting in more damaging floods the disasters we 've seen this past two years at 1 degree above pre-industrial 2 degree target is a treacherous nonsense and so our target the scientific debate now is whether we 've already passed the point of no return because of the feedback loops and the increasing carbon output around the world or whether we still have two to three years before we reach the point of no-return 40 countries around the world rely on oil and gas extraction to keep their economies going if they were to stop there would be mass revolts caused by the resulting economic depressions so we cannot count on very much voluntary reductions in extractions of fossil fuels therefore the reductions must come from consumers 350.org and other organizations have been relatively successful in getting banks and superannuation funds to divest from fossil fuel lending and investment many local governments have done the same Auckland was recently in the news about that a big challenge is getting consumers to whether they be local and national governments companies or individuals and families to reduce activities and consumption that use fossil fuels governments need to take the lead with regulations and by setting examples for citizens to follow what have realized this and are now leading the way towards carbon reduction and we applaud Christchurch City Council for your leadership in reducing the council 's greenhouse gas normally you can see the water language who wrote it on the hills I 'm along the dam and usually we fill up every year except when there 's a drought it 's the third year of a major drought but we submit that the City Council is not doing enough and it 's not doing it fast enough the situation is dire at this rate our grandchildren will not inherit a livable world it 's that serious so on behalf of all current and future populations around the world three fifty.org christchurch submits we submit that the current key proposals form only one part of the long-term plan the other part must be measurable goals and mechanisms to measure and evaluate progress towards those goals we submit that the top priority goals must be preparing for a hotter future and a much more dramatic program of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is necessary council needs to fast-track its climate resilience approach council city to defend from the effects of climate change and where to retreat from this will help inform decisions on future infrastructure investment and land use council infrastructure strategy needs to include specific climate mitigation and adaptation projects we commend the council on their target to become carbon neutral by 2030 and request that you measure and report on the carbon footprint of all new investments and all new activities we submit the council should not only follow the government 's look through of all policies through a climate lens but lead the government by also assessing all actions to determine whether they mitigate or contribute to global warming now this is the Port Hills fire a wind change would have devastated most of Kashmir maybe more questions anyone right thank you very powerful presentation clean Thank You Charles very telling obviously but just in terms of what we can do locally you know I 've got a personal view over the residential red zone there 's an opportunity over a carbon sink however small and proportion to the the whole question and problem if you got a view on is that as in a hotter temperature a lot of the plants that are that we and trees that we have in in Christchurch won 't survive a hotter temperatures though which when you 're developing carbon sinks worked with natives and do the research to make sure the natives can work with higher heat levels sorry Thank You Charles um one of the issues I see in terms of the conversation say that we need to have with our residents is that people prates who are going to be most directly affected a kind of like will hold on to the belief that in fact the impacts that you referred to like storm surge and in sea level rise and in fact they 're not going to affect them so guess my question is or will affect them less or much further out the question is how would you what would you suggest or what ways which is yes we have conversations with people to really engage with them so that in fact there 's a better understanding of the issues that you 've raised is difficult many people would be to start projects in those areas that are designed for resilience or mitigation and use those projects as a stepping stone to advertise within the community that it 's so bad you 're having to do something we 're having to do it right now and that way the community you 'll recognize that and then you can bring the community in to help I 'm sorry Vicki I can 't hear you have you read the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report on climate change that 's just coming I 've only just seen a review of it the reviewer I saw seemed to me to suggest that we can we can have a transmission period over a long period of time it 's actually very good and and plots the path towards achieving cabin Nick cabin neutrality by 2050 but beyond the recommendations that are here which which makes sense is there anything specific that you want the council to do I mean the the path towards the carbon neutrality for this for the City Council and the city will come to us in a couple you want to add to what 's being done no because you 've got such a good organization now in the you know in the climate area in the sustainable area you guys know much better than I do what you can do and how you can do it and and what your target should be we just want it to go faster because 2050 is far too late any any goal for 2050 Kennedy Graham told me that the reason that the globe Vivat globe report set 2050 as the goal to become carbon neutral was because that was the only way they could get national on board and they really needed to set it at 2030 and that 's why we 're so pleased you 've said it at 2030 because that 's realistic 2050 is not for the organization 2050 for the city it 's the plane yeah well maybe you should rethink that we can only influence the city we can 't to reach that I mean we can that the organization that they kept their bit of strict target but the city we have to achieve that it 's not something we can impose that 's not it 's not like an major city in the United States no but you can leave yes or no no that 's what I 'm saying we can influence so that 's why we 've chosen my theory that you didn 't mention that we are working on is the procurement because we spend a billion dollars yeah and it enables us to ensure that others also have a sustainability strategy brilliant well thank you very much Charles as usual very powerful presentation much appreciated thank you thank you _"

    "text": "James in saw boat safety ex-naval point Lamia cally need words counselors we welcome this opportunity that was really experience team page with oasl have been engaged with the port company for 50 years we also here Roger Allen he 's got history from 1945 of being a sailor and also done the survey work over there and we 've also got eaten husband who has a very good construction industry being involved in building bridges say an engineer and so we 're a very experienced team and also like to welcome Carl Edwards who 's here from City Council she 's been appointed to lead this projects and we thank you very much also just like the very quickly mention Andrew Wilde who supported our project only Hart and Joan Blackford and that team for the committee award the community board have been great supporters so just like the star the very start here we support Christine Beau 's project for 10 million dollars to support this project because we feel it 's absolutely imperative that the users and the ratepayers have a good facility which is very safe standard for the design of marinas states that boat rent from waves larger than point to the meter the Syria is subject to a significant wave height of one point one meter so it 's exposed to waves well above their design guidelines in order to protect the rent from those sort of waves only two types of breakwaters can you can shelter it either a rubble mound breakwater or floating wave attenuator which is commonly known as a floating breakwater consultations with the community have shown that they 're very opposed to through the Reclamation 's within the harbor and opposed to the construction of a rock breakwater only leaving the option of a floating breakwater for these to be successful they have to be very heavy weight with the deeper and because they 're commonly constructed out of concrete these are you successfully all around the world the citizens there 's an example of one in Turkey showing the effect of it and how instead of calm waves extremely well this type of construction is also hugely beneficial and that it can be used as a floating GT i just even here it shows that we are actually in a safe area that was stunned by super engaged companies and we 're in a safe distance of 250 meters from the jet fuel tanks this is just a few photos or similar structures this is the theory booth that little turn made of concrete breakwater units they would be suitable for the sort of construction the photo top writers just a gangway that would give access to the floating breakwater and then the bottom right is showing the congestion at the moment at the page nine this is a project identified by Portsmouth community board the previous committee board and it started with a process and the project is three five seven and we support this project which is now being undertaken by Christine bow and she 's a senior manager of the City Council and we 're wanting to see that ten million dollars set aside to actually carry out this development here 's a graph I produced the data for over twelve months from April to April April to 16 to 17 and it shows the so you 've got at the club slipped by two hundred and sixty eighteen percent and at the public slipped by 1585 but we 've got a large we 're the third largest province as far as trailer votes are concerned and we have over about nearly 17,000 trailer boats so if you start to put three people on each boat you 're getting around the 50,000 mark that 's a lot of ratepayers but in addition the and that 's from the Becker survey the City Council trade went out regarding kayakers in 2014 there are 30,000 people owning kayaks and when you compare this with say the Sierra study with the what we consider our major sports netball and rugby and this is Canterbury netball has 16,000 players in rugby 14,500 so I mean our boating public because just because they 're not involved in a an organization far outweigh most of the traditional sports so this really indicates that we need a decent parking place and slipway the greatest number in that year of launchings was over white hanging weekend and there were 345 launchings at the launchings at the club the one day I think it reached a hundred and fifty and a hundred and fifty trailers stretch right around past the recreation ground and into the fuel dump unfortunately half of that area is now taken up parking it is now taken up with a construction site so I don 't know what 's going to happen when summer comes included the community board meeting that was called at the club and I think it just shows the total support from the community it 's got the council it 's about everybody they are involved and I think it 's really important that was much 13 and five years later we 've gone through a consultation consultation we 're at the end of consultation because the community 's absolutely filled up with it and we just want to get on with this project so we totally support the ten million dollars for Christine Berry 's project we work on questions and thank you for your time thank you very much do we have questions Yanni Andrew um thank you and I know how much work thank you for the work that you 've done oh I 'm just struggling to understand previously when you 've come to counsel the costs have been about several hundred thousand we 're now talking about a facility of ten million dollars which I 'm sort of having a hard time getting my head around the need for ten million being spent in this area in terms of achieving the things that you 've asked for previously I can answer that the problem is all the pontoons we were going to use which we 're gonna refinish new standards and the City Council and their wisdom decided to let them all go to Cape belly so though for in conjunction with a port company they 're all being catered to kate belly and dumping charges of up to your time and there 's also the cabbage so we 've got a fair idea what the figure is because we know where the tenders are so that 's why the council decided they want to go new only and so that 's where it 's here so the scope is increased giving protection into the moat ring the development plane is looking further fielded developing the whole not entirely sure we approached their previously at 220,000 that was using the existing record eNOS we don 't have a cross for plate replacing those that 's approximately 300 pairs Andrew so noting that the 10 million is for the whole of the first phase of the navel point development plan and not just for this piece of work but also acknowledging and I mean the names on the list that you showed us on the back page and the position titles showed us how long you 've been working on this and we appreciate the amount of work that 's gone into it just to to really draw out what you 're saying I mean obviously you 're supporting the 10 million for the navel point development plan are you suggesting that our highest priorities within that 10 million should be the boat safety interventions and parking and movement issues I 'm certainly looking at the photos that you showed us there and then secondly do you just want to make some point development plan at least should be seen as a metropolitan facility rather than something local would probably generate a huge amount of the ink how much would be ongoing and it would have they all have funds to be able to provide for all those facilities and maintain and I think that 's really important there 's a large number of people want to use that that was identified that 's still identified in spite of the port company being nearly twice the charges of what that would be I think that 's really significant and I think also the facilities which we 've got here on the front page of your handout would make it safer and if you want to extend the ramp at a later stage it could be extended on the other side so you could have a ramp each side and this upon term would allow six boats at a time to access to and from where at the moment it 's very dangerous to even do one and I think the funding from the gate and from using it would fund it I regard I guess parati as towards safety world we feel priority should be given towards safety and what 's regard to the sort of being a metropolitan facility yeah there 's something that 's the Holy Cross which can enjoy I 'm just improving access onto the water we hit 5,000 25 people we surveyed can report recovery plan and they all totally support it we had no chicks in store at all say a whole ratepayer community which is the majority of users we 're totally in behind us and they think the job we 're doing we were set up with a community board in the community and asked to come up with a solution when we 're trying thank you very much I 'm obviously you know there 's a time limit on all of the presentations we 've got a number to get through so thank you very much for all of the effort that you 've gone to to present today and obviously we 've got a lot of thinking to do about our LTP thank you thank you _"

    "text": "Paul Milligan from the black cake group doing an acro a day today thanks much of the day hi welcome mayor de Tamir councillors thank you very much for your time today and as the mayor mentioned I 'm here on behalf of black hair cruises for an award-winning tourism business based here in Cape but hopefully most you 're already well aware of that and we submitted on three points and I 'll try and keep this as short as possible for you today firstly we submitted in support of Christchurch and ziens requests for additional seed funding tourism is New Zealand 's number one industry at the moment here we have a Christchurch is still lagging behind of course we 've got plenty of reasons why Christchurch NZ 's role in the next few years is going to be critical and helping to turn this around we desperately need visitors to stay in Christchurch longer than just one night which seems to be the average at the moment especially for those of us operating in remote areas such as ikura or the Canterbury region major events is one life that needs chanting fans walking down the street with a black and white facepaint because we 've just thrashed Australia to win the beer so cat it needs international music artists such as Yves hiren or pink who are currently bypassing Christchurch in favour of Dunedin even Nelson is giving an all black sticks teeth next year not Christchurch these sorts of events are not just good for tourism hospitality accommodation businesses etc but they 're also good for the local residents who can have something to look forward to visiting family and friends is a key market for tourism businesses around New Zealand international gifts come in to Christchurch seem to enjoy their time and they find plenty to do however it 's actually the local residents who are somewhat discouraging or actively discouraging visitors telling them there 's nothing to do here so given these local residents something to do and a reason to encourage others to come and visit can be good for everyone not to harp on about Dunedin but this week they 're hosting trends the annual tourism showcase we 're over 15 thousand tourism to promote itself to the world but also chance for that host region to really promote itself to those international buyers as well I was delighted last week to learn that in 2020 it 's going to be Christ futures too so that is really something that we need to strive for it 'll be our chance to really let the international tourism buyers know what we have to offer and that we are really we 've just got to make sure that we are actually ready the other two points we submitted on somewhat similar and the request and that is that is to bring forward some funding that has been allocated for upgrades of wards both in a Corolla and diamond harbour both of these as I said have had funding allocated but I strongly believe that the council is missing opportunity to save some money by bringing these projects forward and what I 'm referring to here is the expertise and equipment that has been in Littleton for the past six to 12 months building the new marina the speed and professionalism that that marina has all of that equipment and expertise is simply going to sail off into the sunset and then wind council does get around to looking to do this work not only is the cost of construction gonna have gone up but we 're going to be forking out to bring all of that equipment back down here you may say so what just because the equipment 's here we can 't go and do the work there might be an SQL truck outside but you 're not going to go and fix that pothole niks up next door to it but both of the projects that I 'm talking about have been identified as a needing attention for some time so I feel that we 're just missing the opportunity I 'm not sure when the diamond Harbor wolf was actually built but there 's been a public theory operating between Diamond Harbor and Littleton since 1888 just because the wharf was suitable for a ferry service in 1888 doesn 't mean that it 's suitable today blackcat identified the boarding and disembarking of passengers at this Wharf as one of a cane we conducted an external risk assessment and this assessment has backed up our concerns the theory is part of the public transport network public transport should be accessible to everyone currently the facilities are a barrier to many and these should be addressed the wharf has council owned and the responsibility for public transport infrastructure balls the council the solution is quite simple a floating pontoon rather than a wooden war structure this I believe was being discussed between Council weekend and ourselves back in 2010 we all know what happened in the following 12 months and why this was now shelved however I believe that it 's time to start having these conversations again the last point related to wards as well was the funding allocated to the akoroa wolf there has been much talk about the 11 million dollars that 's been allocated for a wolf upgrade in a Corral but to date there hasn 't been much action the current facilities that are over there were in place and deemed acceptable back in 2010 since then things have changed with the interaction of cruise ships the team does and the addition passengers but also the increase in business more tourism operators just more demand being put on the wharf at South I 'm not proposing you bring the 11 million dollars forward to this year but just that you look at perhaps a quick one alternative which once again would be to route an additional floating pontoon on the south side of the wharf this is not just the feeling of black cap with regards to a quick win over there for the council but at a recent Wharf users meeting everyone and attendance was an agreement tourism operators fishermen and even Victoria Andrews all agreed that this would be equipped when for the council now that must be first this additional pontoon would not be a waste of money if for wind cruise ships returned to Littleton and it would not be in conflict with any other future plans for the wharf itself it would however provide the community with the lasting asset I 've mentioned on toast about occasions to the community board the chance to link in with the port company to I feel unfortunately that we are probably about to miss that window I understand that the wheels of council move relatively slowly sometimes and that work in the in the marina is nearly completed but I still just felt it was worth highlighting today both the wharf and diamond Harbor and in a Corral are very high traffic areas we have over a hundred thousand Christchurch resident catching the diamond Harbor fury each day that year sorry that 's over a hundred thousand people stepping off the boat onto some slippery wooden stairs on the other side cruise ships alone bring over 150,000 passengers into air karela these are high numbers which are putting strain on the aging assets and there 's any chance I urge you to bring those forward thank you thank you when the you know the development at little turns completing the cruise that the cruise ships come back to Littleton do you think that there will be an ongoing desire for cruise ships to still go were the smaller ones in particular to go and to occur or because I mean it has been voted most popular destination of other passengers you know you know and that 's across Australasia yeah it 's it 's a ongoing conversation everyone 's got their thoughts on that and and you put it on the heel the other person just loved a Corral they like the scenery that I 've the port but if you talk to a larger shipping agents I 've got a wolf to tie up to that is what they were preferred to do it makes another operation easier yeah yeah I my feelings will get a split and everyone 's looking into the crystal ball I my personal opinion is probably about sixty siblings didn 't come to Littleton with leaving about thirty percent still going into a Corral he 's still a cruise industry coming through the town yep Phil Andrew thank you your comments about Diamond have a war for concerning of course so are you really and especially with people dropping an issue coming so are you re talking about that the should be leveled first as like the initial work that needs to be done and then a pontoon some photos would helped but at the diamond have a wolf you 've gots tears running down so depending on the time depends on where the boat ties up so that means that roughly half the time half those tears are underwater which means that then when the passenger is dipping off that 's that pretty so the council does a adequate job in trying to maintain those keeping them clean and not slippery but also it means that there 's a gap between and the wharf and the boat is moving up and down and when you can clear that to the floating pontoon we have in Littleton all the ones in a Corral with the boat sits flush with the lane and there 's actually no gap you could wheel a wheelchair on and off in Littleton that you wouldn 't have and diamond Harbor Andrew Thank You Phil asked exactly the question that I was going to ask but just as a follow on from there clearly there are some accessibility challenges with the current diamond have a wharf do you think that does affect people 's fact whether they choose to use the ferry only in certain weather conditions do you think people avoid using the public transport network as a result of the shortfalls of the diamond Harbor Wharf I think it 's a combination of things but I definitely think that that comes into it but then it 's it 's the Loon linking infrastructure as well so they 're getting from the theory to the bus and then into town I think also has a large path but yeah definitely obviously we we consider the water to be consumed good Bucky 25 seconds yes that 's also a good question I had some very high-level finger in the air type conversations with some people and they took place to make summer in the region of two to four hundred thousand to a rich one and Diamond Harbor I believe in council staff will probably have better figures that the two that were built in a Corral were back in 2010 cost considerably more than that to complete that that 's also just yeah that 's good thank you very much thank you for coming thank you _"

    "text": "could we have Matt Christensen and Amy Carter for the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust please trustees and firstly I 'd like to the trust grateful gratefully acknowledged this council has been giving the trust for now for quite some time that 's very much a baseline support for for us in for that and then we believe that the trust enjoys widespread community support amongst which is all of the thanks potentially area plus all of the court hills to the base of the hills we think that 's for two reasons one we work with landowners on a nonchalant and empowering way to provide them support to look after their properties and secondly we operate in a collaborative way in some ways a little bit of glue between landowners and agencies and other organizations so we think we have good standing within the community working with those landowners as you know we have a covenant in program we believe that we are the only organization in the country that has powers to covenant trust and in councils in the department in at the to that we have some 67 hectares we 've got 16 covenants actively being progressed so we think that covenant in is a good biodiversity being for the dollar in looking after high-priority areas provide boost and that fits them I think the work that the council has been doing on the sites of ecological significance so in the papers you 'll see that there are seven things that the the trust seeks from the council and through this long term claim the first is of course I continued in indeed strengthened through inflation-adjusted adjustment commitment to that ongoing protection work through the MOU that we have with the council currently 50,000 a year and we look forward to that continuing the second thing is that we very much in support of the proposal that the council hears in the long term plan for the biodiversity fund of 200,000 for landowners undertaking biodiversity protection it 's a great initiative which we support and and we look forward to working with you on that so the third thing relates to that one of the initiatives in the and that 's around a pest-free banks financial in Port the submission is a draft memorandum of understanding that the community conservation Trust is convened a working group to to work on how such a initiative might be delivered and we 'd be very much like the council to participate and look forward to working with the council on that so we 're hoping that the minister conservation will be other leaders maybe in August or September like the counselor join with us today so third thing the fourth thing and in terms of actually delivering the history initiative for banks financial know we need to develop an operational plan we have a strategic plan and strategic direction one of the first things we 'll need to do is how would we play that out in the next five years context and so we 're looking for a some funding for a minimum of 50,000 we need to get some consultants that 's the fourth thing the fact the fifth thing is that we would take a commitment from the city to ensure that your policy and operational decisions around pest control are aligned with the strategic direction and successfully dollars annually to take the first thing that we need to do which is to get rid of goats fewer goats we were already spent already we need to get rid of them so we 're needing some funding for that and then lastly with the council when scaling up the dissemination trips in training they have to contribute and participate so those are the seven things that we 're after thank you much thank you um do we have questions Yanni Andrew yeah just two questions one is has the memoranda of understanding being finalized and signed anticipated that that will come to council okay and the second question was and thank you for the work that you 're doing um you know it 's fantastic um have you had any involvement or any consideration of Tioga reserve not specifically although we one of their initiatives and the ecological business to here at least for large areas of regenerating forest in any way first we 're thinking about what initiative on the core bills do can might fit into that category as well so we 're very keen to that regard at the moment it isn 't it vast at all man thank you Andrew feral goats is one of the key planks of view your submission and clearly there 's a lot of good work has been done and and your trust has been a big supporter of their what damage do feral goats do to biodiversity like if this work wasn 't happening what would the result be so with five hot spots remaining the danger is that those hot spots you know I mean goat obviously breed quite prolifically the danger is that the goats would just spread out over the rest of the peninsula again from those hotspots if further eradication were didn 't occur yes I think one of the real difficulties of courses if you 've got to get absolutely eradicated point of eradication and this the people that are best from Murray gray who was the summit road society how much do you Lincoln with those we groups that are also doing some of the work yeah well particularly on this tree initiative we 've convened so we 're looking to to that yes we have been talking about that whole about how do we more effectively okay and you mentioned that strategy on getting rid of pests should align was the best free strategy you 're doing how does it not I don 't know what 's important is that we make sure that it continues to that okay um Aaron yeah I 've just I 'm a bit of a fan of goats but they don 't belong on banks financially or in any native bush so if you get one I 'll take a little one my place because since Trevor the goat died it 's been a bit lonely around home so I 'll take a baby but the rest peacefully recently muster thank you very much and thank you very much for what you 're doing as well and thank you for the vision that 's great thank you _"

recovery but there 's still a lot of damage most of us most of you be aware of Canterbury a loose group of very centrist parties and individuals committed to keeping public public assets public my name 's Stephen Howard and with me today is Murray Horton we need to congratulate you you 've held on to some assets but others are still under attack Carr has long seen democracy as one of the assets under attack after an and B such as IRS quakes a city is one Accord to attack by crisis capitalism decisions are often made for the people the city rather than by them we see this strongly in the case of the northern expressway which I 'll return to and he can 't still hasn 't recovered its democracy we do have hopes that the change in government will give the council of good opportunities to resist with a rift with the record daily announcements a bit hard to keep up sometimes we know that the council who sees holding on to City Care has reduced some funding opportunities but maybe there 's a guarantee of funding in the long term we actually can 't regulate you to holding on to sitting here Monday 's announcement that City care had been performing below par raises some questions as to whether a counselor an entity should be pursuing empire-building activities all over the country it would be better aligned with councils strategy we 're at a Works Department the alternative source of funding that the council should speak up more about and more often more loudly is of course they 're in negotiation of the co-ceo agreement the prism agreement look ton fear and mean when it was sick but even more so after Ken Kristen 's report on how much the central governor had taken from the city neat if the central government had spent the money he 's promised in a faster and higher quality recovery could have been achieved we realized that the council can government but we urge the council to pursue it hard and now that the draft plan doesn 't have a position on what the outcome may be kuroh supports the campaign for a special rate on off licensed premises as well as a small increase in income as well as a small increase in income this would have to suddenly cities has problems still with income but moving into homes currently means following the vancouver plan of increasing rates charges on empty homes and undeveloped blocks an empty home tax would mean a large number of ghost homes would be available to rent at a time when homes are desperately needed we 'd also like to see the council repair or replace replace those housing units damaged in the earthquake where the central government committed to fixing the housing crisis this is the city 's big opportunity to get it right in councilor owned public housing ensuring a supply of decent security nutsy secured and secured tenancy public regional homes is a core council function car welcomes the advance and the planning of the Metro sports facility but still opposes to be built for the rugby union so its professionalism the New Zealand rugby union is just another entertainment business if the stadium could pay for itself that business would be funding it and running the stadium from income the 250 million or so that the stadium for the stadium is money being used to complete an improvement sort of picture current circle function is to work for the people of Christchurch not build a nice to have like liability like a stadium housing transport of water are more important to the people Christchurch care is concerned that although building the convention centers to be funded by civil government it 's unclear who will fund the managing of it these centres are almost globally loss-making white elephants again if business sees a profit to be made from such a building let them find a manager running away they can 't see a profit so they you you will not see them asking to run it living wage and I 'm aware that one councillor city 's not committed to a living wage completely supports the council established Co completely supports out to all the council owned and controlled entities this should be funded by with a sinking lid on salaries above four times a living wage driving the wages down is a one motive of PPP 's and outsourcing the delivery of public services is one paid from Texas and rates transferring risks to the from the buck transferring risk to the public while insuring profits private profits is the other I 've seen relation to city care that the entities top series are very generous Christians must be asked as to why public services supports such an over overly generous salaries there Fokker Toki caught the PP refers to a thin end of the wedge and PPP 's are the thinly in which to drive the privatization of public assets the northern transport Express way was rejected more than once by the citizens of all to attain but it 's been pushed through now by NZTA while the people are distracted by recovery it 's a great example crisis capitalism car supports free public transport as it would be cheaper overall than building huge motorways for that sunset technology on good cycle ways footpaths and public transport the Copenhagen system of spending on these areas where we on those areas where you 'd like people to use public transport is a good option and just to finish on a personal note my daughter is a regular cyclist on a way to women 's hospital capital it was some of the city 's babies she lives in Wilson she calls it and uses the cycle ways around Ferry Road she makes a contrast between the flesh routes being developed for the focal and the hill and the sub some of the Sunday morning latte drinkers and the potholes and dangerously narrow lanes on the working commuters using Ferry Road and thank you very much for your time I just like to add on the stadium that I think that this is an area where we 're going to see pressure put on the council to actually several facets to raise the 253 million dollars for this white elephant I would look over the green Tony was the statement earlier this year by council Livingston that the council 's priority needs than putting quarter billion dollars into the most elephantine of white elephants and there is a myth going around about this stadium namely that quote if Christchurch had had a covered stadium or a new stadium then the Lions would have played here played the All Blacks here last year no they wouldn 't the rugby union and 2015 announced the itinerary for the 2017 lines tour or one thing that stood out was that for the first time in a century there would have been no all-black tests anywhere in the South Island the three tests in 2017 they said they would avoid Christchurch the rugby union not only beauty it was no stadium here suitable for them the one on two mopping up the stretch from their point of view but because the whole city was not up to the rugby union standards so did the all breaks play the Lions and Dunedin which has got the only covered Stadium in New Zealand the new stadium no they didn 't witness the New Zealand rugby union announced that the stadium was irrelevant to the deliberations of the entire 't big enough to handle the infrastructure required the number of fans travelling etc and it was pointed out in the media at the time that how long will it be before all all Blake tests at home are only played in Eden PAC in exactly the same way that all England rugby tears have played in Twickenham so if you want to put money into a stadium Christchurch City Council give the money to Auckland to put a roof on Eden Park because that 's where the rugby union will be playing the games it 's only a week ago that on television I watch the game played between Auckland the balloons and the haggle Ares and it was played an absolutely torrential rain when we go to the point where the commentators were saying their difficulty seeing what was going on on the field not one word of clamor and the media or in the Auckland local body deceit let 's put a roof over Eton pack they just played it because rugby 's an outdoor game if the red bean Union the circulator you came to have boasting now the enormous profit they made from the Lions tour and in terms of these events that we 're told we 're missing out on ed Sheeran and Kovac cetera all over the front page of the press the other day what 's one of the things that attracts those people there they 're paid incentives by the City Council or the City Council of in its body down there that 's a classic example of corporate welfare so if you want to attract events to Christ you just go and have that money to the bar keeper 's and to the entertainment providers that 's a direct way of doing it put a roof on Eton pack and out money to the pub owners in Christchurch that 's the way to do it stadiums are white elephant we 're not saying don 't have it but it doesn 't need to be stuck right up the priorities on the long term plan I speak as a rugby fan that regularly goes to the stadium anything tonight was there on the we just stormiest night last year when the so it 's perfectly adequate for the purposes thank you very much thank you well I 'm with 15 seconds to go it 's I 'm sorry there 's not really enough time for questions but look thank you very much for making the effort to come and we always appreciate the interest that you take in the long-term plan process so thank you very much _"

    "text": "and could we start with Jane white from our AC reserve management committee thank you good morning and welcome good morning thank you for your respect today um I am the chief person of the domain measurement committee and I 'm speaking on behalf of their committee to look at some funding capital funding options we 're currently very happy with the ongoing maintenance that the council is supplying to the domain and the way that the way to look after it 's no good stats right we don 't we don 't find submitted just councilors so so we 're looking at so we 've got three three capital funding options on the table dia that we 'd like to I 'd like to speak to in detail just a little bit of a background about the domain the domain is situated in Little River many of you would have know where it is on the way pass Rebecca right there 's very much a focal point of the Loire River community having the local rugby club rooms and all local banks miniature eggby home games played there it as well as the local river of school has a community center building attached to it which is not part of the reserve management committees functions also has some cricket wicket and also the coronation library in the corner which will speak to in detail further on with the domain and any one year we will host the bench monitor ANP show which I must think here we 're for coming out and supporting this year we have cricket for juniors Rugby Club as I said the law of a pumpkin festival held dear in April which the shield unit of you know the make success with thousands of people turning up to see the large pumpkins and the stores etc we hear vintage car rallies come to the the local banks furniture schools use it is for the ethics day football tournaments triathlon competitions in any summer 's day that we meaning many casual visitors picnic visitors coming into the into the domain so there 's very much a focal point of Loire River and certainly over the wider Bent 's peninsula area it 's very Horace historic domain planted deer in the early nineteen hundreds and as is very much used by the local many but also by the wide across each district we we have to make gestures I don 't know who you okay the first one is the tennis courts tennis courts were damaged in flooding in autumn of 2014 it has been an ongoing issue with the flooding in the domain we are currently working with he can and the council to mitigate the flooding damaged by installing a a Bund at the worst part of the entrance to the domain with the river breaks as Benson comes through so there 's a separate issue we 're working it through ourselves but once that bond is in place which we hope to have by sort of the end of this year we are really hoping that the tennis courts can be repaired the water has got underneath the edge felt and pretty much rendered them unusable the the closest other tennis courts are much carrara or acara 20 to 30 minutes away we have a growing population in the river a growing young population years with a lot of new families moving into the into the district those tennis courts are used for basic tennis but neat ball and the winter basketball there is a volleyball tennis volley or wall there and I used it for a lot of services we were enlarged ESPE surfaces required so we hope that this can be put into priority because we do see the community is missing out on recreational facilities by not having tennis courts available use the second area on a talk to is the restoration of the coronation library on the back side of the sheet you 'll see a picture of this lovely it 's a very historic building very unique in its back a teacher there is only possibly two surviving buildings of this architectural here at end of this particular active it 's built in 1913 to celebrate the coronation of King George as there is a lot of history behind it it was damaged in the Twinkie 18 2011 earthquakes not severely but enough to render it unusable but then unfortunately it has also been subject to two major floods building that 's gonna have users and we do see that the community is lacking in a central meeting area those of you who have attended any of the Laura warrior community board meetings know that that 's a very cramped area that we meet and for their but there is a lot of other community groups who require a suitable meeting room that will be used for that also been looking at use it for an arts studio for a music studio the local school have supported our application in terms of the music for music rooms practice music rooms and also would be available for individual hire we 're prepared to continue the ongoing the domain board and resume action can end the wider community are prepared to continue on with the ongoing maintenance once it 's restored as long as we are able to continue on using their own funding sources that we get received and thirdly the fitness station is as I said there 's a wonderful historic oak tree circular little domain and will be ideal to put some fitness stations around here again very utilized by individual group schools or groups or classes the reserve committee committee the lure of a winery or a Community Trust and locals are all prepared to picture in and help with any funding options in terms of these these capital works but obviously we need the support of the council thank you thank you very much and I mean I just going out there for the iamp show it was just I mean it was a stunning day but it was just a reminder what a jewel in the crown the entire banks peninsula area as to our city so thank you very much for all that you do the reserve committee structure is a fantastic structure and so thank you for everything that you do um does anyone have any questions Andrew thank you and thanks very much indeed for the presentation you you mentioned obviously the opportunity for contribution to the capital works or and that could either be financial or it could be with assistance from the reserve management committing operationally obviously once the Little River coronation library was reinstated once the tennis courts are an ongoing need for operational you know maintenance and care do you see the reserve management committee having a role in partnership with the council in in maintenance and taking responsibility for these facilities once they are reinstated yes we do we do have a source of funding from least block of land and we 'd put that towards the ongoing maintenance as well as any higher we received from the domain or from the coronation library we would put to the ongoing maintenance we don 't want that to become a burden on the council in terms of making that visible and you would see the higher arrangements and so on made locally as well through the committee um hire of the whole hire of the tennis courts and so on you 'd see that administered locally in partnership yes yes absolutely yeah yeah through the committee or through the local service center so we 've got a senior so people would hire they can hook it in excetra through that to any room okay currently it 's around about 933 and the actual Little River catchment oh that tell me this I heard the story when I was out there sorry for interrupting but the school population has increased exponentially so so and I can 't remember the numbers well my youngest child leaves school three years ago it was about 17 it 's up to 120 years yeah so it 's a big jump I personally would support it we would have to offer to get the community back in on that we 're currently have a target rate on the flooding issues which is done through weekend but I think if we put it to the community there would be support for that it 's great I 'm Pauline sixteen seconds and then the long-term plan I 've got a budget of two hundred thousand in there for the restoration of the tennis courts the repair of the tennis courts and 750 for the coronation library the the council have a contractor like Delta Delta look after the moments of that you can say yep thank you very much for coming on appreciate that it 's a bit of a travel to for people to come having you here so thank you very much thank you thank you _"

    "text": "and the last one for the evening as Kashmir residents association must erect Tindall lucky last thank you good evening madam mayor and councillors chief executive and council staff thank you for this opportunity to speak before you today shall I proceed yes please thank you I believe I 've we 've been here before on this issue I might have full on this matter of the upgrade of the path for the residents the end also neighboring emigrate Croft in Westmoreland the general area of Kashmiri Road on the other side of on the hillside where there 's no other access route for crossing in Kashmir road and coming to town is a pinch point created by the rush-hour traffic along that road in also against the historic architecture of the intersection we 've submitted on here and then your plan the long-term plan that 's proposed to delay that can upgrade of their intersection and of the year because I think I believe this has happened before in previous in your plan that was put making years so I 'm really here just to discuss with you the plan or a new plan of the council was going to see in other years delay on this or for how long into the future the urgency of doing this intersection upgrade was underlined by the Port Hills fires recently last year and the y-axis that the reasons in that area have in turn out for emergency services sometimes there 'll be a lot more access needed and a hurry in the safety of the actions required but also with the cycle park already constructed there that 's major traffic in that area which has never been catered for with the design of the under Section so we 're wanting to see some separated cycle way and better crossing for pedestrians appreciating that the council does have work under way for how cyclists will get off the escrow terrace route connector from two of the major cycle ways in the city one from Northwest I believe in one across the South that converge on that point which procuress didn 't get across the river and across Kashmir Road into the cycle path cycle Park so we really appreciate that the be done safely and as an efficient cycle transport route for recreational purposes in the meantime I guess Europe Road still as as it always was in with no actual design for cycle cyclists who are increasing in number all the time and used that as a recreational area anyway before the cycle Park was constructed so we can see that the demand is giddy in increasing steadily and the the reconstruction of the center section will be something very signal that the cyclists were being catered for that they would be keeps safe from the heavy traffic that is on that road it 's a secondary arterial route after Brahm Street for crossing the city towards a little tan port in heavy traffic trucks and other vehicles use that route regularly so the traffic lights as well as is helping cyclists get what they need to be keep safe at all times the lights themselves will address the traffic flow issues of Kashmir road which wind when it 's running heavy means that people trying to accept we small and in Croydon Kashmir here difficulty delays because of the reasons perceive that the traffic lights will help break up the traffic flow and allow more regular access or more even exiting from the hill suburbs in through the study in the morning in particular and we know this to be the case from when recent road works were done stops go signs we used it like Exxon Road when guys pass road was closed for repair that those stopped go signs had a beneficial effect right along those hills suburbs for breaking up that traffic flow in allowing easier exiting into the roughest rush-hour traffic so you know that 's kind of anecdotal evidence if you like from the reserve community that manage traffic flow in Kashmir Road really want help the use of the transport corridor well there may be more I can say in response to questions yep Tim thinks there 's no further delay as I 'm aware with Raquel we 're aware with regards to the hoenn how woolsley Kashmir intersection and as you pointed out and the the community are hoping for is that the pulsing will certainly help Shalimar and Bengal drives and the community boards the halls will form the record and community board also mentioned about their concern of the community 's concern regards to the growing traffic on Kashmir Road so they 're fully aware but so hopefully pin retic Drive will also get a bit of an advantage from their pulsing as well but you know that this remains to be seen but yeah there was no through the delays as far as well we thank you and council Skindred so another but as I understand what you see that it is the delay by one you postpone by one year because this work was to begin later this year to postpone it to later next year that will be the last time it 's postponed from saying zit cream well I 'm hoping Douglas there 's no it 's a pretty good abacus Kendra said in the pin rise intersection from we small there 's an issue now in the same way for congestion but it 's going to get a lot worse Windham bars road crossing off the motorway comes right across the cash from your own that about being cool and Shalimar and all the others so I mean it 's it 's all interconnected yeah and these lights can only do so much so yeah but is the question you asked that the answer is there 's no through the delay its planned so did you want to raise some issues around the drinking water I noticed you covered that off in your submission well I 'm sure all loving the taste of chlorine I haven 't heard anyone say that yet but there 's always room for a feast no don 't don 't know what I wasn 't trying to judge who 's the chair of the Kashmir residents association now good question I guess we 'll find out in due course so I just noticed that you 're here as a member of it not not the chair but the last time you came you with the chair I think yes from the Association there is an acting chair as I understand it but this ammeter of submission today is one of a starak standing and so that was already signed off been some we 've submitted on for a few years and I do appreciate that may be the last time I speak to you know but you 're submitting on behalf of the residents Association yes we 've got some long-standing resolutions of support with their neighboring suburbs in is a submission States the Krakoff residents of what they 're put in here for its inception of the area behind no that 's fine thank you very much all right look thank you very much for attending all the beasts just thank you all right team that 's the end of submissions and there I have to move a motion which is to know I don 't_''_572.45 I just need to adjourn the meeting to 30 tomorrow morning Tuesday the 8th of May 2018 look forward to seeing you all tomorrow thank you _"

    "text": "thank you everyone for an apology 's from the two counselors clean Livingston and David East Glen 's actually dashing back here to try and get here in time for the submission so if he if he runs in the door at the last minute you 'll know that he 's made it but otherwise you know he 's he 's he you know that he died in the team no no but he 's unfortunately there was a clash of meetings which and there are some that 's why I 'm mentioning it to you it 's nice fun yeah great so the main point of the submission we made was that we would like some money set aside for a community hub and the LTP for our community the the reason for this an needs assessment was commissioned by the community board that was completed in 2017 and they 're really clearly identified the need for this community hub so even before the earthquake sterlington was identified as having very little in the way of community facilities it has a predominantly older demographic and that has become more half of our area and because of that social isolation and lonliness are identified is a common problem amongst our residents and obviously one that we 're really concerned about developing a facility that builds social connectedness and well-being it seems really important I told that you additional or that you would die in the attempt so thank goodness you 're alive [Laughter] baby babies just started yes I 've just I 've just mentioned that the needs assessment that was done by Sara Wiley has identified the need for a facility in our area I 'm the community profile which they 're council done in 2014 also identified the lack of facilities in our area and the need for such facilities so there seems to be a very clear identification of the need for something in our area certainly myself I I 'm the recently become the chair of the Darlington residents Association and I 've been working to to hold public meetings in our area around the residential red zone and the future of our area we 're starting now to kind of come out of a period in doing that we find we have to go to other areas to hold our meetings because there is nowhere for our community to meet to discuss our community needs literally no we are we understand that the situation the council finds itself and you know a lot of money spent on infrastructure including in our area we 've got this amazing new pump house at the end of our street we know the money that got spent on infrastructure and we know that the council doesn 't have a lot of money to spare and we have been thinking long and hard about how we can provide for ourselves and what we can do to help ourselves but the reality is is that we are a small community and we 're not a wealthy community we it 's very hard to go to the residents of our community and ask for money to build them a we need help to achieve this goal so rather than asking for a facility for Darlington we 've joined together with Avondale and Billard residents associations and Cliff Lee thought about what our we have an affinity we are all adjacent to a red zone we 're close together we 're River communities and we can see how we could support each other to get ourselves a facility the next leap for us is to complete a feasibility study that will help us to identify how we 'd use a community facility what we need it for in in kind of in more detail at what that need is this will give us a better idea of what we need and how much money we need to spend on us I mean I 've gone and here to look at a range of different ones so I 've been to Mount Pleasant as a really lovely facility the new one I don 't know is awesome I went today to talk to renew Brighton and looked at the central New Brighton school and the facility they had there in the Phillips Town hub so we 've kind of I 've gone in here a bit of a canvass that all the different ways that you can do community hub and you know we we want I 'm aware that there there are some schools that are moving away from our area at the end of the year and maybe there 's facilities that will become available at that time also aware that the former Board school shifted off has been shifted off that site it 's now an empty site I was gutted to realize that I mean waited too long to try and hold the removal of the building really quickly and so the länder store the Eretz currently and the process of disposal from the email we 'd like to stop that process if we can because it 's a site that 's beside the boo and church it 's right the the hub community so it is it the center of horseshoe like bill would even Dale in Darlington it 's right by the bridge it 's because it 's a former school site it 's right on bus routes and now that 's really accessible for a range of different people and so at the very least we 'd like to look at that as a potential site for stop the disposal of that land from I assume it goes from MOA to lands and preventing limbs from disposing of it and would be great as I said we 're prepared to think creatively about how to keep what we want but we do need help and we 're disappointed to see that there was no money set aside for something that has been identified as a need in our communities and we would like you to reconsider this Bank save I mean that 's gonna relocate it 's just that we had a submission earlier on that didn 't didn 't match you with with Borden and Avondale it actually matched you with Richmond and some of Shirley and and they also had some similar challenges yeah but there was a discussion this morning about whether that 's actually on the right site for the wider greater good and I don 't know what Bank saves moves are but they 've not moved out of their site yet so I 'm not exactly sure okay so different different geography yeah yeah yeah lots of groups yeah Becky thank possibilities all border the redzone of putting a building that is able to be adapted into the redzone and using it for red zone tours and things as well as a community center yes definitely and also just thinking about the heritage a speech as well so and now read zone ten what 's your thinking on that you keen on it I am building something team pre all permanent and residential zone okay good claim you know it 's hard to ask a question because I know that you know we we 've have been having all these meetings between bill and David side Ellington and full credit I must say Natalie deli for organizing the group from council staff Thank You Natalie do you have a particular kind of build in mind if it you know for Ord Ellington when you well ideally we 'd like something similar to what other suburbs have got like what I don 't know he has but also you know I think we just we have a need for a facility in if that 's a relocated school building on us on it 's it 's a it 's a step up from nothing which is what we currently and put a note on reporting there 's an area just behind and there 's a bit of flat line just behind it which would be I think a nice spot for because 39 seconds um I 'll just the mayor 's comments banks at school and Burwood school so I 'm interested why you 've chosen Burwood versus banks there which is moving as well things it 's right in the middle of Darlington as well if it maybe maybe I mean as I said this morning when we were listening it was very much the connection between Richmond and Darlington which is a strong connection as well I mean it 's just there 's more than one connection in those areas but if we had existing buildings that we were allowed to keep at least for a period of time it would be such a relief and it 's a that 's an area that 's been read zone so you know again they 're looking at five year five year to really get things going but anyway but let 's have some conversations arising from this but thank you very much for your submission it 's certainly very very helpful and we want the issue was to look at the three communities you know that we 're affected by the read zoning so it was board Darlington and Avondale and you can see a connection but also see a connection with Aven side Darlington and Richmond even though there 's the rubber on between they 're actually quite similar communities yeah okay and you wouldn 't mind if your community center was used by other groups for tons of things no right answer all right thank you very much Cheers _"

    "text": "a david Hawk from the halls full residents association the Secretary of also residents Association and with me is John Bennett who 's our chairperson so thanks very much for the opportunity to present our submission to you today we 're going to spend most of the time that we 've got talking on the transport question and in part that 's a response to conversations both at last week 's ekayon long-term plan hearing and earlier presentations in your long-term plan hearing process but first off something we 've talked about often is skate parks and we want to reiterate our strong support for the completion of these two skate parks and we 're really pleased to see them that they 're finally on their way and community board played a huge role in getting those things done so anyway the transport question if you take an overview of the Canterbury region such as in GTA might take from Wellington and and then you go combine your long-term plan with Akane 's long-term plan what we have is two councils hitting in exactly the opposite direction to that of publicized last year so central government wants more public transport ekayon drives people away by putting up the fears and cutting routes central government wants more accessible transport options with environmental and social benefits and so this council proposes pulling back on its cycle ways so you 'd say from our viewpoint that if ever central government needed an excuse to send their money to Auckland then between you City Council and ekayon have surely provided that we think about some big-picture planning now at last year 's ant 's annual plan hearing councillor Scandrick surprised us with his trenchant opposition to the right school its bus priority project and I think we had a lot of support from around council table as well his opposition if I can paraphrase it was because he thought it would lead to four laning through Eddington village and that four laning would then destroy the community just as the four laning of Brian Street did well sir this really caught us by surprise as I said but we thought about councillor Scandrick salaat comments a lot first up we add early support the Eddington village we see the consequence every day of too many cars in our own community anyway one of the other things that we did was we went to see Megan woods when she was still an opposition MP she put us in contact with Carolyn Potter at the spread in Kashmir community board and with a local residence group and Eddington and we enormous Lee valued the opportunity to listen to their viewpoints we also went off and gathered some of our own data the Eddington folk have already seen some of us but other parts we shared with there he came hearing last week so one of the things we looked at was mode share of cars of vehicles traveling down Lincoln Road and going into Eddington village so not surprisingly the great majority of them were in vehicles so 78% 80% were single occupancy the thing that really caught our eye was 12% were on the buses and 9% were on bikes we were really surprised at that bus mode chair given the publicity about bus usage but we were also surprised that the buses were either ek and last night emphasizing that they really need to review the frequency of their services at peak times then we went and did some actual work on the buses themselves and we looked at both the orange line which runs from night stream through into the Central City down Lincoln Road and also the route 16 which stats and Wigram skies and goes to the same route and in the school term what we 're seeing is thirty five minute times or 35 or 36 minute times for both routes and going nearly 20 minutes over for the orange line and nearly 30 minutes over for the route 60 so you probably already know this but those travel times are the way they 're not sticking to their timetables it 's absolutely appalling so why certain the bus for nearly an hour when you can drive your car by yourself or ride a bike in half the time and it 's these delays that are under your control so what we think needs to happen so far City Council has really been our planning has been quite piecemeal so Council is going to deal both big-picture and in detail with the traffic volumes from the car davut car dependent suburban developments in the southwest if you go to the detail what 's going to happen on white the edge and Selwyn street to get the buses out of those out of the mire and out of their cars once the distant from Megan woods is to take the big picture question to the Joint Transport Committee to get a regional solution to getting people from the southwest of Christchurch and sulwon into town and that approach would actually be entirely consistent with the draft government policy statement and we would have thought the council 's would have thought of that too but maybe you have but there 's no sign of it in either Akane 's or the City Council 's long-term plans some folks in our area have taken the question into their own hands you got a long list on a weekday you 'll find cars packed up for the day next to a convenient bus stop they have their own Park Ride which just happens to in completion of the major cycle route program so safety with this list of some of the examples of the safety benefits and our submission community benefits we 've highlighted those as well and the crossing of Brown Street for people attending Eddington school is a really good example with the central government contribution it 's a great value for money one of the things that we did on your behalf and the run-up to last election is that we worked really hard with our local MPs both late labour and national on rolling over the government 's urban cycleway program so that quarry man 's trial could be funded to Hall 's wall we were persistent enough they took that issue to their front bench colleagues and reported back to us positively and now essentially by postponing this program their City Council are saying they don 't need the money so what we would like to see in your final long term plan is that we 'd like to see some system level transport and community planning that actually delivers on the ground and so some of the things by NZTA such as public transport fare pricing park-and-ride car sharing and so on a plan with a timeline with ek and NZTA to actually implement bus priority measures on key roads and early completion of sustainable safe community friendly alternative to the needs for single occupancy vehicles so for us that 's quirements trail and always that major cycle routes and if you do this you might actually managed to assuage some of the concerns vocalized by councillor Scandrick as well as meeting the needs of 4-cyl community and others in the southwest thank you i think i think i 'm gonna have to invite some face thank you very much you know when you were absolutely right at that time because there were no plans for the widening of eddington or the sensitivity of going through the eddington township which you 've acknowledged I do want an acknowledge all work though with Carolyn and others because it 's about getting the plan right that 's what it 's about because I think if we were going to use an exemplar of park-and-ride I think the halls will put start but when we first meet and I made those statements there had been absolutely no work done from between Whitely eV and Morehouse ed and I 've seen no point and four laning two white Liev Barrington Street Lincoln Road which is already gridlocked which is absolutely the pinch point the design between those points between the white Lee Barrington and Morehouse F that 's where we have to solve it once it 's solved with a safe cycle lanes and absolutely bus lanes without Christian then then we can really move forward and solve the problem but I might alley and I totally agree but I do think or could be the exemplar if we were going to do it properly because I think with the development further out there would be a perfect example a perfect time to do it there is a bit to me is what US would be a really good project to take to the transport agency because one of the things with when we talk to ekayon and we said you know like they want more public transport and they said bring said we went and they refused and we suspect that what they did is they went to the to Transport Agency and said we 'd run out of money can you put another check in the mail please and obviously they turned them down so Eric spirits so some of the people on our committee of some experience with weave from the Transport Agency and they don 't like requests for another check in the mail and what they want yeah yeah and so what they want is a project that will actually advance their priorities and so the sort of thing that you 're talking about would do exactly and that 's what then push the want to get that sense the vary between Whitely and more how serve in Eddington will give an emphasis to maybe push forward or we look further than others to get their project finished yeah thank you and I mean it 's just you know four seconds so thank you no but thank you very much and I think yeah I mean you 've made some excellent points which are you know in the cycleway route as well because I mean we 're very grateful for the work that you did in that regard so we 'll have to have a good look at that again thank you _"

there has been maintenance work done on them and so even the new millennium playground is not highly different and the reason that these playgrounds offer not much challenge to their age group is that they are very much on just you know fast movement zoom down the slide swing anything it 's not really a variety in there and what we are finding is that the children to seek opportunities to you know improve their balance and climbing and risk-taking are actually climbing over their equipment and the wrong sort of way right and also the larger bodies and making those play equipment thanks very you know crowded at times when there are preschool is there there are other parks in the area order acknowledged them back by they 've been up there all for preschoolers these you know so we never time I 've been and to discuss us with uni community board or Park or staff or so all the feedback is to get some money into the long-term plan so that 's why I 'm here so I 'm asking for some financial assistance in there one of the main questions I keep getting asked actually know how much it costs to buy ground and I don 't really know the process of finding that out myself but when I do talk to that Pat Summitt question that 's the question they ask me and I 'm hoping that there would be somebody who has expertise in that you know that would guide that for you to be able to decide how much to put in so there 's just a reminder of the very basic packs that we do have and just want to remind you of that sense of accomplishment for these children when they conquer the fees you know they 've had a lot of anxiety fears obviously and just to conquer their fears and the physical way in most of the folketing structures just lead them to their extra confidence and self-esteem for this age group isn 't that it 's normally competitive play which one can take appropriate rests enjoy the finto physical and mental mental challenges in succeed they 're also a prime place for a social group interaction and social development and we had cultural and social social very tired of being at a big funeral for three days and look at these things Wow look what is happening in the new generation equipment you know this is the sort of thing that we 're looking at one of those structures accomplishes many objects of you know physical play gross motor you know this is the sort of thing that we can just add onto one of those packs built into their environment where it 's really you know visual for children a lot of people say playgrounds only for the young but obviously as parents grandparents we all know that taking our children to the park is good and those open spaces they were the natural places that nature has makes that in not showing that damage today you know we we love being active and we just feel like at URI I would really benefit from these children being satisfied by some what may not be the the five perhaps but you know I love this last picture because you know you 're kind of highlighting that it doesn 't all have to be sort of whatever and made I mean you know your local rotary might be interested in partnering with the local community as well and building some things I mean I went to a seminar last week and one of the people that had a PowerPoint presentation that they were running an Early Childhood Center and and they actually had their local the local prisoners making all of these amazing wooden things for kids to climb on play on you know but that was but that was for the very young ones but you know you don 't actually have to have these don 't even we very very even you really use some meat there too so everything 's natural can be removed but I 'm struggling to get just at that point of support to keep the help to get people engaged yep it 's gonna be allowed can I apologize on behalf of your two counselors as while you were presenting I suddenly realized that you 're gonna plenty fit my two counselors weren 't here to hear the submission they will be playing it back so they both had had to choose between one of the others so thank you very much as it did anyone have any any other questions Aaron it 's just it 's a follow-on from the point Jonnie raised before about community board delegations and because every year there 's a number of playgrounds across the city that are rolled over there 's they have the staff we 've got a number they can do that it 'll be good if the community of all its got to put the map because I 'd be more than happy and in my ward to not take one next year and then one of the others it wouldn 't take one and say look someone else gets one this year yes sure between when we do the combined community board meetings we can decide where they go but put the power back to the boards and shuffle them around them but also some partnerships with the service clubs because I honestly that this is this is exactly what they love doing yeah all right but thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "Frank goodnight thank you well thank you for the opportunity to to speak to you all this evening I represent the recommend bush climatic residents Association and like everyone in Christchurch once upon a time there was an earthquake cause there 's all sorts of grief back in 2010 and 2011 and caused damage to infrastructure all over the city and those hope high-profile projects that needed attention have been dealt with and are being dealt with but some are not some projects are not and this little Street Bridge your Terrace is a small no exit street that runs off Strahan Road just north of wicket and Road it 's a residential street the residents fought long and hard for a long time to get much-needed work done in their Street back in 2011 it was included in the plan at that time for there to be replacement mains water sewage system storm water Kuban channeling footpath and continuously since then it 's been deferred much to our surprise it is about to be what the proposal isn 't it 's about to be deferred yet again in fact four years means these people who have been waiting for 11 years to have this work completed while other projects have forged ahead some of which I would suggest they 're not necessarily urgent a lot of which are nice to have this particular project is vitally important for the people of breach or Terrace and I find it hard to believe that after all the fighting that they went through to get this work on the plan Twitty eleven that they should be faced with a situation in 2018 where it 's about to be deferred for another four years so look all I can say is urge the council to consider what these people have been through the work has been done in part the sewage system I believe is being attended to the mains water has been attended to I suppose they 've dug their place up and refilled it and resealed it or patched it I should say a number of times and the work is still unfinished so basically I 'm just edging the council to get this work done so these people can can them thank you thank you you have any questions Jonnie yeah thank you for your submission I was just interested in what sort of communication you 've had back as a residents Association about the timing the delays etc generally we find out about them when they are deferred in the process of resetting the budget every every year or so there 's a history of deferment we don 't necessarily get consulted event we haven 't been far as I 'm aware we haven 't_''_245.07 been consulted I 've been chairman of the Association to be fair only for the last two years so but I do know that the we have a couple of people people who are actively working with the Association who are residents of that street and they tell me that this has been a fall on their side for some time and just related to that one of the questions we 've asked and the LT payers you know should we be considering giving more projects to community boards and that many years ago community boards would actually be able to prioritize renewals within associations on a regular basis is it good support in terms of giving them a budget I know that I 'm qualified to make a comment on that except to say that whatever works from from the perspective well it 's a I guess in your submit now you 've talked about other projects that 's well I 'm just I just lunges looking at the fact that the major cycleway projects which have not been in the plan until now suddenly got another two million dollars associated with them in this plan they were in the previous long-term plan and that two million dollars would go a long way towards towards meeting some of the diets of some of these other projects that have been deferred I do I also notice without wishing to you know go on about it there 's some some some road safety projects that have been deferred you know intersection safety projects which have been knocked off the plan and yet we 've got another three million dollars being spent on major cycle I just I 'm not criticizing the fact that we 're matter of priorities and I suppose it 's just a question of how the council seats as priorities Christian would have been very hard for the community board to explain to Rachel Harris residence that it had been deleted and deleted because they didn 't know was published yeah but there was no mention made in the discussion about branch or Terrace an effect quite the opposite we had for the last two or three years in fact they 've been and had been in the CEOs report to Council that it was going to be done 2018 community yeah I think that all of the proposals went through to the community boards before they were signed off from the draft okay yes okay I mean this is about it from from Helen Broughton about two days before I wrote this submission right I may change what told me as soon as she found out about it this is going to be so I think we can improve the communication but I don 't the point actually just want the work done which I support thank you I think that as a as a council as as this question of priority around work and you know I accept the point that you 're making about how long but the how long got reset when the earthquakes happened and you know I mean I can show you streets on the east of Christchurch which would which would make yours look a lot more you know sort of bearable then then they obviously are to you and and there has been a major reset because of the earthquakes the annual plan process and the LTP process when people come along and argue for their own Street and then it gets put back on it 's the first one that gets taken off when you do the reset so I mean I appreciate the fact that you 've come back and made the case yet again I mean I look at that Street and I agree with you it is that is not a good environment but as I say I could produce hundreds of photographs that would you know when you are weighing up priorities it wouldn 't stack up against some arguing that out there need is greater than some other streets that you 're talking about I think in the greater you 're saying speeding cross you were saying spending to get yeah people 's houses fixed and their roads fixed and their footpaths effect yeah as opposed to spending large amounts of money on other projects yes so what you 're saying is that in terms of the balancing act that we necessarily are doing that to take money off some of the things that could wait and put more money into getting roads fixed route okay thank you thank you crystal clear thanks very much ELISA Smith from _"

    "text": "could I have marked your ad now okay historic places can 't_''_3.98 agree counselors thank you very much for the opportunity whilst we 're here I 'd just like to acknowledge the person of Pam Wilson a well-known here to advocate who you may recall and in your travels and I think his contribution for preservation of Christchurch heritage is just something very very special I 'm Pam was for many years in the record in trust and also an addition was also goes right back to the beginning of the nurses memorial trust to save it and it 's rather sad that you won 't be there to see the opening next year we 'd also like to acknowledge and thank the council 's here at it 's team professionalism than the staff and we think they 've done a really good job and we very appreciative pass on our we 're really appreciative of their efforts we 'd also consider the council 's here its strategy the policy and charitably an excellent initiative and we look forward to its ongoing development in other words well done we think in favor of it now just get into the serious stuff and start place academy but also like time for some former counselors we fully endorse Stockton lock its notif submission of proposed projects long term plan on deferral of the restoration of the clinic eventual heritage buildings we understand the council is operating under financial constraints however these buildings are internationally recognized heritage treasures and we request that the council support or options to expect the repair and restoration of these very important buildings we of course aware and we would fully support for councils and discussions of the government and some sort of partnership we must make comments since the online forum actually asked the question how in favour the continuance of the landmark grant so we have to respond to this one yes we are we 'd also expect if it is to be continued we think it 's a very good initiative the singles you 'll be with number of buildings that are now being repaired and is progressing rapidly we 've some flexibility that the council could divert because some products take some time if councils own heritage buildings and manage it but we 're quite confident council staff are capable of doing them we 're also there 's a note which we have but intrigued about and under vengeance is that under Heritage Week held annually has become a deleted measure we 're not sure what that actually means we consider that it should be held at annually and we think it 's also a good idea for a full report so that we can provide feedback and can be fine-tuned really good stuff and sometimes stuff doesn 't quite work but we it 's important to get feedback on an annual basis we understand some stuff and they 're really busy but it 's nice to have an employee a general thing we 'd really be happy if the council was actually more proactive in its marketing and messaging on history that gives you dead antiquity to make that I mean I fully endorsed the Mears wishes that Christ is in the Vegas city I remind the counselors that when you 're talking innovation we are home with the Hamilton jet Rutherford was Town Hall I think a lot of seismic work done by the University Kennedy is done here what we should tell the public we part of estimate conversation when we talk about that I think it 's more now referring to what 's become known as the expressions of interest of the number of buildings that the council has put up for expressions of interest we 've got a viewpoint on equities we think we 've get concerns about its processing in its execution of course we 're into the Edmonds ban rotunda Rob mcdougal gallery and the Rotunda this process this is a predetermined commercial process that the documents are I 'm not saying that can 't_''_252.229 carve out there but I should point out that to make a submission and we 've got a briefing from a council staff who assured us that community input will be sort on this process but it was a commercial and we went through and I 've just as an example to make the big for one of the tender one of the buildings we had to make an ER a submission 't yet notified you what we 're going to supply services for supply for copies of the tender document in a USB stick by 12 deadline so this is really as a team to document wasn 't for consultation I should add that my reading of the document theoretically I 'm not supposed to be talking about that docking because it says that I 'm not supposed to talk to the council will the council staff so I 'm probably breaking that tender document by talking to you now but I sort of have to because you 're going to consider the long term plan so I can 't avoid not do so so that and also we like to draw attention to find that your cording to your councils own significance and engagement policy a decision to transfer the ownership or control of a strategic asset cannot be made unless it is explicitly provided for and the council 's long-term plant in the public that 's been solvent through special consultative procedure we can 't find reference to that in the long-term plan it says explicitly so I 'm out the report that 's coming through us we dealt with the expressions of interest that is not a consultative document there 's a team to document and I understand it 's can 't_''_337.54 be done in public excluded which I understand this commercial that one and the public won 't have a say though you may come back the special consultant process so it 's a little bit I understand it 's a new way of doing it we 're not sure that where 's the other pump with makers that we think the side of the tackiest a commercial building and it probably should have been a month before I can agree it could take on a door there 's regards the other ones of the bullets we 've made submissions on them our viewers is that they should be where possible kicked in public hands into public access like a hierarchy with this possible community the group has a use for it and retain counsel ownership and then down irony at the last resort for commercial work where it becomes excluded from the public there was that objection if they 're mothballed until they 're available I 've got a submission which I did under the tendering process for the Bangor pump I would suggest as an example you could hold back when your decisions until a decision is made on the red zone around the area and that be incorporated as the Bengal is the only standing quite effectively of what was the thriving tonight even brain quotes quite that is now under the year so it was part of that plan then you can understand use for that building the probably no need for do it now until they 're hopeful is not far away and of course any any worker one-sixth rally on the major buildings Thomas Edmonds ban Rotunda and pavilion which are currently being repaired these were great for Jeff way even city and we think they should have kicked in public excess we think should be retained as a as a gallery we draw attention to the ECOWAS Charter which says where the use of a place as integral to its cultural heritage that you should be retained it 's a of gallery we 've also made notion about we 've done too far about the museum and fans museum that do a full consultation and meaningful consultation as regards funding of what are proposes to do some that be approved as the council is funding the town hall two magnificent achievement I had a one tour through recently it 's a fantastic engineering treatment and that 's a lot of great and we should be very very proud of it I understand there 's people there 's been concerns in the media but I don 't think there 's cost over it I think it 's a great achievement well done now my consent of living waters is the old mystical chambers specifically we would argue that it should be retained as it was pre quote which is a community venue known as our city o-tar he was a public venue we think should be retained we may point out it 's a central part of the legacy from the museum through to the Cathedral and retaining public ownership allows it 's one of the few heritage building of the that 's fits as councillors own building if it 's put to commercial and excluded from public access we would lose something very valuable that 's part of that trap and its own there 's a community asset I think it was worked very very well this first facility for communities I should also point out we don 't even think economics over that one person could run it after hours now I understand you have a new facility in the square but I don 't think you 'll be able to run it as cheaply on one person after hours I 'd be surprised you may met you also in view of us I 'm not sure what you 're proposing for the community in the square and speaking as a center of City reasoning so this decision sort of done in isolation I don 't know what you 're offering to bring the community into the CBD the other issue I should point out we had a number of exhibitions like woman on the council chamber know any James Lucas this VC etc and so it provided impacting wouldn 't have finally the thing that we were worried perturbed about was the fact that that under the council long term plan page 15 and had something about negative public response associated to council ability to fund post earthquake repairs explore all terms of ownership we actually think usually should look at our heritage buildings is the ones that lead the regeneration if we look at eyes at Theatre Royal the Art Center here is Christchurch Caribbean crushed its club 's new Regent Street they actually lead the regeneration back before the new China glass boxes came back we should treat them for what they were leaving back we also we also think that we should look at each of these cases individually as opposed to just on mass we understand its financial constraints but an individual case that is on that one we point out to the council 's own surveys important the buildings are and in addition and also the seats have had important they are and I might point out that on one of the surveys to be our city guitar he was actually listed individually open for seven years but stood on the consciousness we 've included as a follow-up and just for your interest we 've done this before Donovan rip commit there 's an American economist who specializes in heritage buildings has made a number of here just economic studies one of interesting is that based on always 36 the team percent spent on huges is actually spent on the site the remaining 19 to see the speed move site so it 's more than we also draw the attention which is a wonderful stair to Mount Vernon in Virginia the hair did visitors stayed longer visitor twice as many paid places and spent twice as much money so in other words the Heritage think does spend up it 's worth spending we also note that on here it is jobs on restoration all money goes back to the local community than our new buildings and it 's a job generator it 's more longer-term and it 's great for the economy if you need to regenerate it and we also pointed out if you check visitors came to see in Virginia heritage and shopping centers and the beaches of theme parks and probably the golf courses that 's on first time visitors and on repeat visitors so here it is is important and make sure money thank you very much thanks very much mark and again much appreciation for the passion that you always bring to the table you know what what you say is right but we 've got some we 've got some very challenging decisions here to make so thanks very much for your important thank you alright so if we could adjourn now until quarter to six _"

    "text": "right mr. Wilder you 've just arrived on time to sit down at the front because we 're all ready to go we are ahead of time don 't I mean don 't please don 't don 't be surprised but as it 's gobsmacking to me as it as to you what you 're joking someone told you to bring 20 copies but we do everything Alec chronically now I 'm just surprised yeah oh look any fandoms welcome you do I regret to say that this is additional thank you middle me and beside me is windy carpenter the Secretary of the Association I just wish to acknowledge the attendance of some of those involved in primarily the management committee of the Association and I wish to thank you all for your time I 've seen your schedule it 's um it 's impressive so I 'll try and be relatively brief I just want to touch on three issues and the first as the council strategic transport plan 2012 to 2040 to which was the plan intended to set this rate of transport for 30 years your late 2000s prior to the earthquake aimed at a time when of course traffic was quite different values and understanding of environmental and health issues was quite different it suffers an a submission from a range of problems a prime example is that it seeks to facilitate freight movements across the city and introduces new routes and in fact there was only one new freight group introduced and it happens to be from Barrington across our area and it did this without extraordinarily a health assessment of the adverse effects of putting diesel heavy their course of high volume through a residential area and that deficiency has been confirmed to me by the kinder we District Health Board and the public officer of Health and that is quite startling because of course when you look at major transport projects they invariably involve some sort of an assessment and we are concerned that the plan fails to properly reflect the voluminous health problems which were associated noise pollution and the back of our submission Appendix A see it 's out a summary of that up until about the end of 2017 introductory paper to the World Health Organization 's review of the adverse health effects off transport and let 's have plans directed at those who fix for decades it 's reviewing them it 's published in 2018 a suite of papers in the effects concerning increased dementia risks increase myocardial infection risk increased stroke risk increase ADHD in children 4% increased death risk and these are big studies eight point six million people in the study by the Imperial College in London six point five million health records in Canada big studies so we submit that the plan first needs to affect those second it 's a parent event and sit in the freight greater consideration wasn 't given to the deterrent effect of such traffic on walking in cycling in the NZ DEA and one of its high-level documents says particularly that quote reducing traffic and speed has the highest priority as it not only benefits pedestrians but can also improve safety air quality noise and hearts and the environment for others in the areas that contributes to the least quantifiable quantity of streetscape third there is research showing cross busy streets here we have roots which go past areas with homes and schools and we need a city not just in our area there 's a hole where children can walk and cycle safely and the major cycleways are obviously a good initiative but is the NZTA makes clear nuts guide cycling starts from home in eans from home and people should be able to cycle on the direct routes available it 's not the cyclists who need to deter but obviously out of step with the now draft government policy statement on land transport and I 've just put the brief front page introduction to that in tip 2 of our submission but you 'll be aware that that favors significantly health the environment and modal change it 's also inconsistent with overseas patterns we have cities and countries as diverse as Australia France Japan Spain United Kingdom with Mears and councils making decisions to restrict heavy vehicles in high-volume vehicles in urban areas and yet if we implement this plan undiluted we are doing the opposite and some of those places London 's had a specific places of policies which haven 't been considered to be effective they 've been challenged successfully by the courts you 'll be familiar perhaps made a meal with the client who the suite of proceedings from the European Union we are a number of policies both within and outside of the UK been struck down we 've got domestically of course the 20 million dollars spent on the Willington Basin flyover which was ended essentially by a Board of Inquiry in the hike because account wasn 't taken of alternatives to congestion nor heritage and those are factors which counts also not taken in this plan change is possible when I raise that because it was said to us and communication that it wouldn 't_:_512.06 and I just pushed to be clearance and tab 3 of the document before you page 107 what the independent Hearing Panel said having identified the various different routes including the strategic freight network in a strategic road network as quote these networks are not specifically shown in the district plan as they will be subject to change over time however they are an important so you have an opportunity to reflect 21st century values within this plan you 're progressing a business case you have been for over a year in our submission there ought to be consideration to change and net includes operational change for example your infrastructure transport and environment committee receives bio monthly reports which include extant rates but wouldn 't it be good if they included health issues as well arising from transport wouldn 't it be good if the people in C TOC were aware of health issues which might arise on particular roads and that was taken to account and management second topic area first we wish to acknowledge and thank you for the project which was currently being gone on we understand with the goal of helping reduce the number of vehicles and also restrict heavy vehicles we were concerned to say and a little surprised to see that there wasn 't a specific project or budget in the long term play especially since our understanding from correspondents from the councilors that reports are going to be available this month and presumably decisions being made with the to say thank you but to talk about what the roads might look like in Wien and I wish to just address first a misconception which was that the roads now like this the traffic has built up substantially especially in the last 15 years post earthquake to then transport manager of the council in a statement to the priests said that this was the route which had the greatest increase in traffic and of course necessarily was because of the damage to the east in increasingly dispersed plans was also said that measures would be taken but that they would be temporary and intended to be reversed once other roads became repaired and a number of people were spoken to in the community are still saying to us that yes I 'm getting vibrated and woken but it 's all just temporary well if it is temporary please do tell us no one 's actually come out in confirmed that advice and our fears that it just might not be in in terms of volumes strivin Road single lane each way 2016 was carrying over 24,000 vehicles per day an extraordinary amount to pump down single lane residential roads and document for there 's some floodgates packet tube device the top photo is what the intersection looked like in 2004 before the works that photo is actually taken from a beaker pre works report the council obtained nothing edited about it blows an example water wilson 's rose rounded out looks there are plenty and a few turn the page that is what the intersection looks like now in below there 's a forty four done freight train and these have been followed which go from a metro yard to access the northern motorway this can 't_''_801.459 be right in a residential area and is it any wonder that a community is concerned obviously there was no assessment of health implications the deterrent effect of this sort of transport wasn 't taken into account but the council to have credit last year acknowledged that these roads planned overheating Idris and strove and are not safe for those under ten to cycle on extraordinary when you think they service schools including some Patrick 's phenyl Tonopah near boys hi girls extraordinary when we know that this council favors modal shift and we support the council on that but we 've got to be able to practice it around our homes and on the roads on which we live the intersection at Landover Idris has particular problems and the problem really was that too much was compressed and too little this can be seen from star females unnamed staff mean the quote is willing to compromise in Lane width in order to get the signals installed the design can be modified at a later stage if there are problems in quite their number of those plants and when you look at it you will see that there are an awful lot of lanes and an awful lot of traffic compared to other roads which have high traffic volumes is just simply not the space you will have I hope because the council 's had it since last year the Acoustic Research Unit university of canterbury noise modeling multi-site 24 hours over a number of days on the intersection which reported back that the noise is grated from 30 in the morning after 00 p.m. at night which is the last one yet during those times it was in excess of World Health Organization standards that is a level that produces the health risks in the research you will have I hope deleted from the medical officer of Health who aren 't having a look reserved right to the counts wouldn 't see that there was an issue with the traffic volumes in frightened can I take one more minute thank you engagement we 've had a difficult time engaging I have an tab nine document which I hope you 'll read which a paragraph 38 just sets out the struggle some people in communities heaven being understood because it 's apparent to us there is siloing between departments going on can I just leave you with this final thought we want a city that 's safe and healthy for everyone and I 'm sure you do too it 's not a one-way street our goal has been by Beckett Heritage Week this year to heaven open series of walks through houses and Gardens to do so in conjunction with the board I know you 've run them before involving all the local schools there are people behind me who will embrace this we wish to be involved in helping plant along the streets plant along the build-out and once we 've done in seeded in this area we want to go and help do it in other areas because the problems this that he 's facing are too big to help divides between communities boards in the council we want to work with you we actually think that our values and goals are going in the same direction but through a she said of unfortunate circumstances and this was the last of the intersection stand percent of this plan would have ended up in a different situation in so please let 's just work together and sort this out and let 's do it this year Victor it 's not the only set of traffic lights that have caused your problem I think the original decision to put the traffic lights onto onto Pendleton Road at the other end of Glen Dovie Road was the beginning of what then was exists time we 're opposed to the traffic lights going in there but it was yeah the plan so you look you put a challenging submission in front of us I appreciate the fact that you 've used the LTP to come and articulate that we 'll get the message out clearer next time we 've become paperless we 've saved heaps of money by going paperless and save lots of trees from having to be cut down as a result but you 've really given us a lot of detail and a lot of stuff for us to analyze and go through but yeah we 've got work to do thank you very much much appreciated _"

    "text": "right we have Stan pull from the spreadin neighborhood network good eye as I say I 'm from the spray-tanned neighborhood network no it 's the car parks concerns the area which is sometimes known as Selwyn village it 's not Oh so in shops and I 've also heard it called the selling street project it was not my intention to actually put a submission in at this particular time because the actual work at this is going to start in 2019 lot of money and of course had been but it 's searching around for some information I found information that was available for me until I kind of come across one or two bits and pieces and which made me think that it would be prior propria to me to put on behalf a submission in it concerns the number of car parks the proposal that we put through rather the submission we put through is on behalf of one the reserve the businesses and to the people and I 'm one of them that actually use that particular area on a regular basis and in all place I would put more weight for the public rather than the business the business can vanish anytime we live in that area and we want to use it the information that we have is old information from November 2016 I think it was when the design was put to a public meeting and it was rejected soon after that I was given information that one of the council staff people had been charged with increasing the number of car parks I won 't mention the name but if you want to know I do have tonight that person has been contacted Rhys fairly recently but to no avail we haven 't got any information the other part of the information comes from a radio broadcast made by the chairwoman of the Community Board sprayed in Kashmir what was said at that particular time was a purely on the business of the seven-string shops and was concerned and the things that were said obviously made me realise that there were people making decisions or making suggestions and that I find rather strange because it really it really does work the honest with you it 's pretty but it 's silly silly it 's only got eight car parks on one side and the idea is that the traffic would then have to and this is on the side of the shops the vacant lot which we haven 't got a building on yet has no car parks so coming from my area and I want to park in one of these eight I would have to go across into a u-turn cut it across the traffic cutting across the circle ways which aren 't clear at the moment that to me is absolutely ridiculous now what 's come out from this radio conversation that I am talking about is that this person which is Miss Potter had staked out the place for an hour and a half I have been on a stakeout in that place for at least 12 hours on various days I know the traffic flow and I know the cycle situation and in the cycle situation really is very unusual because we have a we have a boost people going to work we have people coming I find unusual in the fact that we are doing away with people 's parking spaces to put a cycle way in and just it doesn 't make sense if if we are going to do if we 're going to make any changes one of the things that are concerned with we are not fit enough information and what 's going on if there is a new plan then I believe that we as a public should have that information now not go to a public meeting somewhere halfway down in August or so and then being confronted with something which we may not like so what do we do go on and on there are 23 car parks they are now this plan would reduce it down to 8 the parking position in terms of there at times all 23 are for I 've been there myself the comment has been made that this eight or one or two more could be made easier by reducing the time from 30 minutes down to 10 minutes the is ridiculous the place where I go on a regular basis it paper next door go in there and ten minutes later I 've got to be out in my car it 's just stupid but the place the problem is is that miss Potter states that there 's a great deal of movement and it 's all based on ten minutes I respectfully say that she 's totally wrong absolutely wrong I have records in terms of the occupancy of the car parks how they move on an hourly basis the movement of the cyclist no problem there is no problem in the morning or even in the evening with the cyclist situation if it was a mark cycleway the problem with the cycles is when they get up past the car parks into the area where the bus stop is and if that person on the cycle is making a right-hand turn into Brown Street now I 've only got two minutes so we my request is is that we be given more information early and the fact that you need to look I would say you could reduce it honestly it is 23 there now I would say that 19 another be a minimum the other part not take a minute there was is the enhancement yes it is a bit of a Dungy area but putting a few trees in and taking the car parks away is not gonna do it people talk about change you know foot traffic and so forth well there is very little foot traffic people say they they kind of meet there well they don 't meet there the traffic that goes into those shops is mainly from cars very little on foot and and they are very very local mainly to the fish shop fish and chip shop or they have come on a bicycle and they are very very scarce a squirrel in my submission I suggested that you would look at a model of kayakoy I get into carport quite regularly and cowboy in their little business district which is from the river down to the round first round about they have lifted the place right up they haven 't put treason but they have green you and so forth and what they have done and it 's very successful the current and it 's very successful the only thing that they have failed on is that the car parks and they have never lost one car park cowboy in that area has a lot of car parks because you can park ground it back they never had one car park they put terracotta tiles or red tiles down beautiful when they first put them down and getting dirty now and I would never recommend that in front of in terms of the car park waste of money anyway perfect thank you for the opportunity no it 's much appreciated we 're glad that you 've come on and obviously the the cycleway projects are going through a particular project price duty question so it 's a cycle can I guess coming on seventh Street it will be a cycle lane right stands right we heard loud and fear from the reason and say they didn 't want to lose the parking my understanding is the plane has been taken away I haven 't seen any new planes Dean yeah but we 'll look out for it yeah that 'll no on your part I have to keep going but thank you very much but we will feed back to the residents association thank you _"

    "text": "Jocelin silk central record on residents association hello welcome to provide the central record and residents associations i think thanks for coming in early it 's I 'm telling councillors that that 's on page two one oh yeah right good one additional funding for Christchurch New Zealand the central record and residents association do not want their rates useful through the funding of Christchurch New Zealand the funding should not be used to buy new events current funding should be used to support enterprises who wish to create events at the central record and residents association committee meeting two concerns were raised the cost-benefit achieved so far within the original 10.2 million dollar budget and the percentage of the christchurch new zealand funding spent on administration and salaries to the rates proposal at this stage our members are fearful of 5.5% being already greater than the cost of living or wage increases if we could believe the council managers could achieve work within budget and believe the promise the increased tracking down there may be less fear amongst our members of their outgoings becoming much greater than their income complete the due diligence in the ratepayer busiest standing increases and costs to rectify problems caused by council department decisions for example that contaminated walkway the costs include when the city Kerr dumped waste on private property because someone without authority says to do it in the cost to dismantle a flying fox that seemed out of proportion to paying someone to lock it and unlock on a daily basis Jocelyn I 'm dumb but I should have said this earlier on for the when we come back after each break but we have read the submission there 's no need to read it out so the idea is just to speak to the bits that you really want to highlight and yes one of the things that we 've identified as council lands such as the testing station and swimming pool can that be sold how much more land is sitting idle in the city drinking water and wastewater the three waters project in record and Road is frightening for the business owners situation situated on record and Road and we 've been going out and surveying them and we think it 's a symptom of the uncertainty of how well the project will be managed because the first stage of the project is was poorly managed wasn 't completed and now there are only just finishing it off and we 're concerned about the management of the process and then when we 're talking about the transport in community boards making decisions we consume that sometimes the impact is purely on the area 's which voted them in for example parking on booms becomes a necessity and picked an air which is a medium density housing where developers only include minimal off street parking so around the university the problem was not caused by the residents it 's people coming into the area so beautiful in in my area and central Richert in '_''_241.31 often that 's the only place people have got to park especially when individual rooms are rented then the number of vehicles per household increases it 's we consume that when they come to planting trees down the middle of record and Road along with the new cycle way and bus lines that will additional cost to ratepayers when you 've got to run and remove those trees we 're really opposed to a target of texts such as the Cathedral tax there was a lot of talk at our meeting about dedicated lotteries or biobrick campaigns as they used in the past and now crowdfunding campaigns such as the helicopter Peck campaign where people are willing to donate so forcing people on limited incomes for the targeted tax is not supported medium density in jewelry Curtin at the mayoral debate we could have cleaner waterways of people washed vehicles on the grass to stop chemicals in the storm water drains living in central record it means planning approval ensures there 's no grass left on the property that developers remove everything there was a lack of cohesion between what medium-density means this is the welfare of the people in the area versus how are we going to manage our waterways when planning doesn 't sink we never think it 's about as the developers being able to remove every tree every blade of grass every bush and put as much on a property booms not having any green space for us to wash our cars the road and so what we 'd like to see is people and pets planning getting more guidance from the instrument it was a book published about suggestions for building and medium density areas and it doesn 't seem to apply well I think thanks very much I mean your association took me for a stroll down pat de nieve which certainly impacted on me I know that I 've raised it I think my colleagues he said on the Greater Christchurch partnership committee with me will tell you that I raised that every opportunity that I can that it 's all very well to talk about intensification but intensification and an environment where people are renting out room by room and you 're replacing one Villa with one one one one fit one one one former owner you know like that 's been in the family for generations and then you 've got four four townhouses that have three bedrooms each and one carport your apartment so you know I mean it 's you really opened up urban design which had four bedrooms plus they used to sleep in the porch enclosed is now 14 bedrooms right well there is one single car garage in in enough space for a little car to park off the road will have removed six car parks around it four entrances for those places so people who are packing here before and now it restricted a mess of impact on amenity and I 'm the CBT is gonna be the same it 's going to require a little bit of thinking about about parking and you know perhaps the nighttime use of car park buildings might help solve that problem but Sara thank you I 'm just to quickly boost the Emerson 's took up the community board a little bit and that decision on the Bible with the boom parking and the decision on the design for Rickett and Road were both council decisions not community board ones so they would sits with us but my question was on the funding of Christ Church indeed and you say current funding should be used to support enterprises who wish to create and organizations and consider community funding rather than well one of the things was there was a lot of talk about of course the L&C Flower Show and buying things like that and so they 're really concerned as consumers that amount of money when people in the central record and have you know now concerned about the three waters project which is going to knock businesses out and so on one hand we have yes it 's good to have people coming into the city but what about the day-to-day lives of people who are going to have to cope with record and Road and the businesses on record and road as much money 's being spent on your big events I think you 've raised in your submission the point though that a lot of small events the community events which stays within the council in terms of supporting communities with those small events that they 've become very difficult because of traffic management plans and health and safety plans in particular and through the help with communities so that they can organize their own events when you it 's a fantastic community event well that 's the sort of thing that we should be helping you out with and that was a vital part of the excellently adjustment the resource consent meeting on Friday excellent thank you very much John that 's fantastic _"

    "text": "okay and Marie gray from the summit Road Society hello welcome no no you give your buttons are on your all good to go I got to meet my third my name is Murray gray and the secret key for the summer Rae society and I 'd like to you to introduce you to the word hell president Jeremy I got vice president um no doubt most of you know a little bit about the society already we 're established in 1948 to further the mission of Harry bowel and so we our two focuses are really on preserving protecting the pool house and providing for public access so we own two reserves up there or here in Omaha job on two rocky yeah so in terms of a long-term plan and we really endorsed the focus and then alternate on the regeneration of the port hills that 's something that we are achieving in terms about opening here bazoo which was barely affected by the fires and we won 't want to really acknowledge the support and assistance that the council rangers have provided with their regeneration or anything submission is our predator-free Port Hills project this is a really exciting project so predator-free port house is an urban tripping program so it 's a bit yeah a tripping program involving households on the urban fringes of the port hills so our goal is to get trapped in every household within five years so we started in November 2016 so goal is to get a trap in every 50 house by the end of 2000 in 21 so by our calculations there 's about 4,000 traps so the much you know doubt there 'll be a number of kind of small groups involved in that as well there 's no its private tripperz but there 's a fairly ambitious goal really to get for four thousand trips up there on the portholes and what the research are well in turn is showing us is that that level of situation of trance makes a meaningful difference to the predator numbers so in this bit car trippin program we 're talking about trending Rex master let 's earn your stripes on measles and also possums and the thing about critters of engaging the hearts and minds of everyday people and predator control and it 's about building communities because these communities some of them are just amazing in terms of how they 're becoming organized they 're actually building connections among their communities to kind of work together as a community to achieve a better treatment program so as an example we 've just had halls or come on boards and new sub if it 's just come on board they talking about getting out and network of houses around the Horsell quarry so we 've got the Rangers tripping in the quarry and then there 's surrounding houses working together to trap around the quarry so what are we going to see in terms of the native bird counts in the quarry in a few years time we 're actually gonna see that see a difference that that 's going to make so we 're really working closely with the council especially around with the Rangers and enlisting their support around monitoring and actually be enough to count like what difference this is making we 've got it started with the goals that we want to achieve we need some additional funding coming in and that 's why we 've put in our submission that we 'd like to ask the council for additional 10,000 K a year so the cattle already supports the Summit Road society with many of its objectives around that and restoration in volunteer boot parties and the like but we 're asking for an additional ten thousand and then is mainly for coordinator time as you can imagine a project of this nature is going to require a lot of coordination a lot of communication and so that 's really we 're really going to need support we 've been able to manage so far with volunteers but already we 're struggling twenty years and you can see is because this project is going to get we 're going to need their support so that 's everything I producer Freeport Hills my next part of the submission was on the tasks hill farm so the society in conjunction with the hereo our trust is always looking to purchase additional land up on the port hills pictures the latest be specifically funded by donations of BP 's for this purpose so we are hopefully very close to purchasing tussock hill farm which is around over Cavalia put a tiny belly we were nearly nearly kind of signing that last year hell that was delayed due to the default a cake trustee Terry McKeon so we have hopefully got that back on the table last year we understand that counsel here put us out forty thousand dollars to help us incidental cost related to their sale and however bit money wasn 't available anymore it 's been used that their budgets gone so issue requesting the council to put a safe forty thousand dollars in this budget to support us with incidental costs related to their sale my last point is around the Port Hills management plan so recently we submitted on the safety changes on the dyers path road and we also as submitted on the the anti-social behavior upon their on the Summit Road and I know as part of those discussions that the council was asked for the Pels management plan to be advanced movement on that the integrator plan will really assist with the management of the road including that issues it accounts as well of we 're often tunes of speeding up there and he 's a dangerous driving rubbish pendulum the range of issues that are up there but also integrate that into the management of the portholes as a whole and particular landscape ecological in recreational values so ya know me and that sums up and our submission and but I 'm sure you had questions do have questions I 'll take Aaron first and then Yanni I 'm just around your predators and don 't shoot the messenger but the other one that 's not mentioned is the cat is there a plane around cats going forward we 'll need to look at time and usually with cats whatever is life kept traps in live traps I certainly understand that a little rougher trap library may have some of those and would probably look to hear something like that some people we have a problem and catch them cat live and then they can ascertain actually is that a true fear okay and then see a donation from Gareth Morgan coming in already yawning yeah I just wondered if you had been in touch with the city foundation or the rider foundation [Music] we 're not resting on our laurels we really didn 't see any funding but this this is a masive project a kind of an initial estimate so I like you to be about a hundred and forty thousand dollars for their project and it 's probably not even really future proofing it that 's kind of crosses now so we 're gonna we 're going to need donations from multiple sources that 's great thank you very much it 's much appreciated and yeah good luck it 's a tremendous effort that you 're putting on for such an important part of our natural heritage thank you very much _"

    "text": "I 'm Richard Hanson from RIT 's incorporation hi come forward please [Music] right so hopefully I can talk to the points that he wanted raised yep that 's alright but I 've got three photographs that I can just pass around which might clarify what we 're talking about sure that 's all right yep okay so Richard Hansen 's our director redson Corporation which owns a site and Cathedral Square number nine Cathedral Square which is the previous site of the Ames in Bank so south west corner for those who know officer the new spark in quarters which was the old bean seed bank so he would like to submit specifically you must regard to the capital program schedule page 34 the line item about proposed works to Cathedral Square which familiar with and his mission relates to the timing of the expenditure on the square and the design of it so just a quick weird of background written is the ruling owning of a family business which is in process of documenting a new building with Warren and Manny the architect is Shigeru Ban Japanese architect yeah it 's gonna be really great building I am so excited well it is public now but I think it 's I think Richard said that 'll be in the media by the end of the week so he felt that my pc might be in the media to Baroda so yeah so it 's a it 's a really great site on the square and as we know those two banks stood shoulder to shoulder with the venetian blinds down the square so together with the spark building they 're thinking are thinking particularly is that this building will now open to the square directly yeah you 're familiar with the design it has a public interface on the square is a series of high in tenants including F and B operator and the retail entity that Richard runs a Atia gifts will be open and the new building to a living at night so they 'll be on all day continues which is all great in terms of where the city would like to go interestingly he has occupied a site on the other side of the a submission that he 's seen three versions of the Cathedral Square be done and he uglier than the one that preceded them I hate those paving stones I think they 're all probably adjust the missing ingredient was the future ease and a few more people maybe yeah I think those banks on the south side I mean we 've had this conversation before they had the Sun all day and they didn 't use it so this will be a changed yeah Richard 's circular consumes firstly slightly parenthetical but he 's saying that in previous iterations we designed the lighting at night it was undercooked and probably budget driven and he 's particularly concerned with the amount of foot traffic and potential for evening use that the lighting is dressed correctly for safety and ambience sorry so that 's a minor point has a major point Vickie takes a photo and puts it on Facebook is that okay I 'm just checking I 'm just cheating because I 'm she 'll be happy not to if this if it 's what your preferences well look I 'd out a name the director was cast no digital share over here otherwise the data miners will find it yeah sorry sorry sorry my understanding is that it 's being released to the media this week so either my facebook post today is premature or not I mean I probably would have to ask him just gave me things I probably doesn 't make any take the photo and you can put it on as soon as the its announced I mean I 'd say go for your life probably why not yeah anyway so to to his major point the this building is scheduled to be completed at the end of the fourth quarter of next year November 19 which is the same time as the spark building a scheduled to be complete now we know with building projects that 's not necessarily a date in stone but that 's the target date and we 're certainly working towards that in our office what he would like to submit on us that the spending allocated in the in the long term plan is prioritized to the south side the be open soon and that the whole of that side of the square will effectively be a complete thing the hotel and these two new office buildings form a complete precinct absolutely and so he 's asking firstly that the workers undertaken in a timely fashion so that when they finish and open to custom that they 're not barricaded in by a long-term roadwork plan it 's the hero for the street side well both these both sides here comfortable I think yes three he notes in here that the he referred roadworks there in consultation with the upgrade of that corner yep any I think he 's gonna happen when they say it 'll happen yeah similarly with spat because they 're very came to hibbett conclude completed before they 're open yeah yeah so he 's really talking about this queer side of it yep the sunny frontage that they 're hoping to are well it 's the regenerate Christchurch regeneration plan but but we 've we 've been talking to them and you 'll be pleased to know that they will be recommending that that funding the square is the priority he 's also keen and I know this is a few shared by many that the designers cohesive and not piecemeal okay so I think I 've covered everything that he wanted me to cover today but yes I mean we 're very confident that the building will be fantastic and it 's about time the sunny side of the square his people sitting outside I know I know it 's just yeah I mean my first conversation with an architect was when I was brand new Member of Parliament standing alongside others to save the old government buildings and standing up on the balcony looking at the back of the Cathedral and then looking across at the post office and looking across at other buildings and then you know that the white ANZ Building at which point he said to me that it doesn 't speak to the rest of the buildings and it was this concept of building speaking to each other with old government building and the the Cathedral and the post office you know and it was just yeah but the know again fantasy I think the bank 's represented themselves as a retail yep at least on this brilliant day on you just touched on briefly and I think that you kind of touched over it was lighting in the squid yeah what do you think we should be doing with lighting in the square especially around maybe the spark at what in the southern side initially I think the submission talks about safety for people at night particularly women so he 's not suggesting that the whole square is Atlit but that ambient light and safety lighting for walking between distant and maybe it 's just walking around the perimeter so the way it is now you obviously think it 's not good enough he said in his submission he 's shown photographs from the past hmm and he notes dark areas in a general lack of people okay so we can 't have uniform daylight and I don 't think they will be desirable but perhaps connected lights so then you can walk to your destination safely and thanks for bringing the pictures and you know if once the light thing you know we 're converting to LEDs and this also the nice like for teaching people so a lot of it can easily be pointed down but my question is if you thought about a rooftop garden yes there is a hospitality bit and in those tree-like structures at the top there square itself awesome in a week there 'll be some plans and some more images you can because I think this back it 's a garden I 'm into a question you 'd ask us why is it taking so long for such ideas to be will be the sunniest part of the sphere yeah yep so it 's delighting I think the question would be the solution might be no lighting buildings and lighting trees and liking sculptor in unusual way but low lowbal ads maybe that connect a safe path well thank you very much for presenting today you did a great job so and I 'm I 'm just so excited and I 've been excited ever since I heard about it Shigeru Ban as a name that 's you know that and now they all be this building and it 's it 's here to stay you know it 's just I know the story is great yeah well thank you for the opportunity to speak I think thank you very much _"

    "text": "away again and of course we have apologies from Glenn and David East because they are at a community board meeting so could I invite Roger Davidson from the property Council of New Zealand to come forward please good afternoon welcome senior advocacy riser assisting me here today and Jane has a broad knowledge of local and central government so hopefully beer I would answer any technical questions you may have firstly I 'd like to congratulate the council on the simplicity of your LTP and how clearly the different options have been laid out making it out making a complex document simple and transparent for the community the property council broadly supports their councils ltp review and note that a balanced approach has been undertaken to manage all the needs of the city over the next 10 years the property council understands the challenges facing christchurch and believe the council has taken a prudent approach to prioritizing some significant infrastructure projects whilst trying to undertake community projects however we do believe that further prioritization can be undertaken to ensure a more balanced approach to the rates increases we believe constant rate increases we acknowledge the need to continue to fund infrastructure investment in renewable and the challenges facing Council in undertaking this however the proposed rate increases could lead to a computer advantage to neighboring districts which are proposing more reasonable increases we recognized the council is currently limited in what it can do to raise funds and we would encourage the council to investigate alternative funding mechanisms as a means of using their funding burden on ratepayers the property council was happy to engage with council and developing and advocating for alternative infrastructure tools with central government and suggest long-term funding solutions that are required for long-term vina benefit and are happy to support the council in this endeavor having said that we do not support the regional fuel tax proposed by central government as this is likely to have unintended consequences such as neighboring districts becoming more competitive the property council supports the initiatives their party buildings from flooding and also supports initiatives privatizing the three waters infrastructure we agree it is sensible to prioritize drinking water how we believe waste water is also important and suggest very concerned with the prioritization within the transport budget and believe the mix is wrong children six million to be spent on local initiatives is too high when compared with 263 million on Road and projects we suggest a transport budget is weighted towards cycling and that some of it should be used for more pressing issues such as wastewater we recognize the balancing act enquired for the various council services and believe priority should be given to more pressing issues we suggest that even the communities may accept a lesser standard of roast over inferior drinking water and wastewater infrastructure the property Council believes that the current traffic management system prioritizing cycleways is causing significant frustrations and members have suggested that these suckers can be dangerous and are adding to congestion issues of the CBD not easing it to purposely constrain one mode of transportation to encourage movement to other modes could have unintended negative consequences vehicular traffic is an important component of economic activity in the CBD and to continue to restrict movement may affect economic growth we believe that an accessible city project is only things exasperating suggest that parts of the transportation budget ie cycling should be reprioritized for most more pressing projects the Property Council supports prioritizing the anchor projects that include central government funding and we note that these projects are likely to rejuvenate the CBD however we believe that anchor projects need to be undertaken at pace we know projects such as the stadium are not due to be undertaken until 2023 to 2025 we suggest that Crozier 's still missing out or major events because of its lack of large facilities for such events it is time to recognize that a stadium is part of the critical infrastructure of a modern city not a luxury it is a key part of marking a city in attracting events and visitors once the city has plans for a large stadium hotel chains look to move in close by bars and eateries follow suit and the result is what we want rejuvenation the LBT LTP has proposed another 1.4 million for Christchurch scenes it so we can put more effort into marketing to attract large events to the city right now Christchurch is missing out the apprendi standing for Christchurch indeed is premature without the facilities to hold the major event suggested we suggest there only be of value two years before the facility is available big events and conferences only planned about two years out from such an event getting a world-class stadium here is a great next step because it 's about bringing people into Christchurch enjoy we have to offer it needs to be of sufficient size that we wish to compete on the world stage and attract top-tier dance through Canterbury region discussions on trying to decrease the future running cost of the stadium should not override critical decisions on the size of the stadium to reduce the size of the stadium that was proposed to listen running costs is nonsensical and short-sighted we need a stadium with a roof that is suitable for what event promoters want and is appropriately suffice sized for our population base why would we build a stadium that is smaller than those Indonesian or Wellington as I have noted the property Council sees the stadium as part of their critical critical infrastructure of a modern follow through with the meze desire to have it push through it as quickly as possible I think if your time and Jane and I are more than happy to take any questions thank you I 'm Vicky thank you for your submission I 'm just confused by some of it if you talk about seeking alternative funding because you don 't want the whole burden government sitting on ratepayers but then you say you 're not keen on a fuel tax because it gives neighboring districts makes them more competitive if there was a regional fuel tax that would apply in the neighboring districts no not necessarily it depends where the boundaries are set and if it 's Christ you city council seeking it for the Christchurch City Council boundary it 's unlikely to go there is a regional fuel tax it will apply to the neighboring districts would you still be opposed to it or so you 're saying if there was a regional fuel tax it would be regional so if if it applied to the neighboring districts would you still be opposed to it given that 3% and a 10 cent one would obviously drop them by a lot maybe able to I think yeah we 're the boundaries is will dictate whether we 're and we 're guessing here whether alternative behaviors will ensure a drive to dunedin and you 're driving back well you might thought you can finish Burton so you avoid the boundary assuming the boundary is right so your concern as the boundaries rather than the concept yes because people will take advantage of so Mike thank you for your submission I just wonder if you 're aware that in Christchurch community boards don 't make decisions on Transport generally they they do on some road markings but they 're a council decision well and open they may I 'm not sure I also wanted to ask you about the like you 've hit some concern about the cycle ways and just any in terms of the government policy statement there 's some other strategic directions they include things like the environment and access and safety so I just wondered if you can in making a submission if you also perhaps 's and priorities to definitely prioritize some buses and alternative need to believe that some of the cycling lanes in the CBD have cost some actual concerns by getting emergency vehicles into places that they need to be so your Menken thank you I 'm just interested in your comment you made about spending two hundred and six million dollars on 63 Radian okay I assume you got that information from yes yeah it 's actually a little more than two hundred sixty three because the writing project is actually this whole side of of the graph which actually totals 418 million dollars so it gets actually not as closer do you think it isn 't obviously also the cycleways the rebate on there obviously a lot more substantial than it is under standard writing projects yes and correct me if I 'm wrong I think there might be some portion of central government funding related to the spend by the council yes it 's 2 for every 1 we spend that was the that was the previous amount and and but we 've only judged it on the 1 to the one tutor as well yep probably taking more of approach we we know that we 've got to get there balancing right but there are there are subsidies that sit with different parts of the project and they subsidized at different levels too much yeah yeah ok it 's not intentional sorry Sarah did you wanna just do just a quick follow-up I mean the the reporting has changed relatively recently as well and when the when the priests for example been reporting that 206 they have been putting in brackets you know with you know 51 to 60 days we had we just have to say the 206 to start with and in the financial assumptions that it gives us some I just wonder if you had any because part of your consumers that whether it wasn 't just the money it was the congestion and things that you think that they 're causing in the CBD and I 'm just wondering if with another sort of 10,000 people do to be working in the CBD in the next sort of 3 to 4 years if you the roading being able to cope capacity wise with the number of people coming in I think you can with the congestion is obviously peak periods ruining bacon afternoon peak and we can see the opportunity there to move people into public transport in maybe other modes just make seats it 's more about I come here today I didn 't bike I 've got to take Jane to the airport I 'm not biting that 's there the economic activities it 'd be very federated for for a city to operate and the vehicles still need to come and go yeah absolutely I mean we 're only we 're not aiming for a hundred percent biking you know if we got to fifteen we 'd be you know making huge inroads into the congestion and stuff in a city it 's just leaving the roads open for those who do need to use a car for whatever reason I think that 's been a really helpful conversation and a great contribution I think Christchurch NZ would have a different view of how long it takes to get those big well it 's not okay look thank you thank you very much for your thank you very much for your presentation it 's much appreciated that 's great thank you thank you _"

    "text": "and could could be now hip from Linda Sunderland from the Campari descendants group it 's part of all their efforts we 've found that we 've actually got nowhere so that 's why we 're doing a play today with the long term pain okay so we are the descendants of the future German settlers who arrived in Agoura onboard the French the Comte de Pury in August 1840 at that stage I mean by the French government thought a Corral was going to be the French colony and the sound didn 't quite happen like that so obviously we 're very passionate about the history of our ancestors in Decorah what we want to achieve with our cemeteries project is to repeal the historic headstones we wish to erect a memorial entranceway the Catholic in dissent a cemetery we would like to have some informative boards in signage put up in the cemeteries to help people that are looking for their ancestors into researching the history of Ekron and we would dearly love the maintenance of their our cemeteries to be improved the reason for this importance in the first formal European settlement in the South Island ten years before Christ Church so obviously a Corral is the cradle of the history of Canterbury and very important to Kent Ouisa whole a lot of the damaged headstones and these cemeteries relate to those early years of the aggressive some of the most elite significance of Canterbury are buried here whalers English colonist pre 1843 two German settlers amongst some of them many of these headstones no longer have family around to care for these plots in fungal repairs the two that we 've submitted to the council in 2012 or funded repair and is still waitin for Jacob and Judith quickly in the barrios both of those couples came out on the contra Peru in hip no family left this is the current entrance to the Catholic and deceit cemetery and this is what we would like to replace with Memorial entranceway as you can see at the moment it 's just a farm gate it 's on a diagonal to the road it 's a pedestrian entrance the main vehicle entrance is down the side of that entrance for vehicles this is joke in Judith wigglies headstone this is how it ended up in 2010 and they 're still like this including the trade bowing out in the plot this is an information board in the Lynwood cemetery that was suggested twice by the City Council staff to adopt and adapt for Agri cemetery boards we 've got an idea of how we 'd like to do this for the era of cemeteries but of course it hasn 't progressed this is a couple of slides of what the maintenance is like at the moment this is another one of the early settlers headstones that still sitting there like that this is a plane of our entranceway that we want to build we 've got to do a few final specifications but we 're just starting really and waiting to get the go-ahead from the council to be able to do it the way we would like to do in a mirror of the Catholic Church as you can see the yet the we entranceway which coincidentally was built by my great-grandfather he was one of the see that mimicked up at the cemetery from 2011 onwards these were the promises that were made to us by the City Council the first response from the city council wasn 't December 2010 when we wrote to the mirror at the time Bob Parker we had been promised funding for appeal for city headstones in 2012 we were promised assistance with drafting and completing information boards in 2015 assistance with resource concedes for headstones and the memorial in trans 2015 again memorial entrance comp plan was handed to the City Council in 2016 and proved maintenance infant new fits inside she was also promised a 2015 none of this has happened following on from the promises that were given to us by the council we measured and submitted headstones to the council for funded repairs we are identified and prioritized significant headstones needing repair or restoration we 've had full plains torn up from memorial entrance and we 've drafted up the information boards we have a subcommittee we 've got a specified financial account we 've maintained liaison with City Council and other interested parties such as the for us and we 're currently established in the prince vekar eyes symmetries group to dissipate question our frustrations and no progress absolutely none we feel like we 're going backwards symmetries master plan 2013 hasn 't been fulfilled the compter praise done work based on and fulfill promises we 've advised we cannot team to our own family graves by the council but the council was not doing this well this is because apparently this all may be contaminated we cannot dig postholes round new entrances our soil is potentially contaminated however we 've had our own specialist advice to say this can be done as long as we adhere to guidelines which we 're quite happy to do we have been diverted from progressing the information boards in the meantime because we 've been told by the council staff that what we were given from the limpid symmetry is no longer the standard in the community the state of play now the last council meeting was Canterbury staff metre not council reinforced that no immediate progress was planned and this was a year ago actually it was February the memorial gates on the current hinges and were told no you can 't_''_477.04 do that because the entrance might be changed we offered to fund the information boards with design assistance from the council but we 're told no the stand is now changed but we weren 't told a new standard we followed up with the community board presentation which Andrew thankfully was present it and were advised by counsel staff that they 'd meet with us in two weeks when the two weeks came along and I emailed and said keep winking we met I 'm sorry we have to wait now till the new financial year and it 's been happening with us again and again so we are supported I 'm very much by all the area churches the enthusiasm by the Catholic Church for the memorial entrance is very strong we 're also supported by the garden of tarnów Management Committee because the garden they bought us on the symmetries we 're looking at working the whole area as a combine to start and cocktail area Tapani key reserve was not far on the 're supported by the Friends of across communities but we 're just currently being established and we 're building up numbers for them so funding and facilitation at the moment we aren 't able to go ahead with our fundraising because we actually need approval from the council for our projects to to put that in front of the funding organization we 've offered to fund the memorial entrance the information awards we 're not asking for money we only ask if they help to do what we want to do this could be a really quick one for the City Council we you 've got a very strong community group of people here who want to do something we 're really really willing and able we just what that partnership to do it so please help us restore and repair some of the most significant headstones in New Zealand 's history enables significant graves in history to be identified by information boards provide respect and acknowledgement by maintaining the grounds these headstones as I say are some of the most important to Ken to be New Zealand 's history open for burials which makes it a lot easier because they haven 't been closed as a huge cemetery which means that we 're not as restricted with what we would like to do the soil can be dug up for burials so why are we being told we can 't don 't post on us because the entrance might be challenged we 're not allowed to look after our own plots counts all staff and looking after them we 're frustrated so we 've came here to please ask for your help thank you I think that was an outstanding submission you know that the that the terminology that we 're using for this year 's long term planners we run this together and it 's all about the sort of approach I think I think the can I just say that was an outstanding submission and I wish all of the submissions were like this but but thank you very much and I think you know you can hear from the counselors around the table that there 's you know there 's nothing but admiration for what you like to facilitate you to do so thank you very much yep and also a waste summary of what we 're asking for so I 'm gonna let some final word for no reason other than I 'm nice yeah I 'm just fascinated by the I love it I think it 's really good soccer playing thank you my lady really thank you very much Cheers all right we now have a half-hour break so _"

    "text": "[Music] so next we have the canterbury museum and we 've got michael Macavity Anthony Wright and Nigel to cost long term plans have to take the long road can I say that we are here to support the written submission we 've already presented to you and we thank you for the items that you 've already included in the long term include following out some written submission to you and they 're the ones that we 'd really like to focus on today and I 'd like to acknowledge the right I 'll take over and explain the details Thank You Marion councillors the chance to briefly summarize our submission first of all and it 's in four parts the first part we support the provision for operating levy for the first three years of the LTP we secondly object to the out years or seven years beyond that and I 'll give you more detail in a moment we support your decision to confirm the capital grant and we capital grant we were requested for the Robin doodle gallery share of the redevelopment has not so I one first of all support of the secretary grant for the three first three years of the LTP this is on proviso that the Edmond era will be corrected the figures have been incorrectly transposed from our annual staff an executive team recommendation is corrected just to note that the figures we have included critical to us during to a whole range of issues here are some numbers you can see from the small glitch caused by earthquakes it 's a it 's a strong upward trajectory we 've had all-time records for the last four years we 'll continue and that leads into our objection the second part which is is an objection to the effect that the operating levies for the seven out years have been held to inflation only for the museum as an organization annexed LTP is too late for our long term our medium to long term financial plan and we wish it to be included in this plan at the agreed the previously agreed needles that allow us to function we under wind significant consultation a few years ago and looking at the project depreciation charges for the redevelopment project and we have we negotiated with you all some very significant concessions regarding the funding of depreciation and I point out that the other three clas the surrounding districts have all included those out years in their LTPS as set out in your plan so we are asking for the those to be reinstated at the level that our annual plan requested the third part is that we support the capital grant and your share of the capital grant towards the redevelopment of the museum and twenty two point two million your share is included in your LTP which is great thank you I just note to you that this only applies to the part of our project that we we put under the pre you a k-- you do so the the planning that was underway before the earthquakes is still required but there is a editing cost obviously from the earthquakes in that relates to the next part of the Ahram their submission which is an objection that the capital grant requested for the robert mcdougal gallery of now we understand that that in your draft LTP when you were actively out for expressions of interest and that in the future of the Robert Mundell those have now closed the museum has lodged a strong expression of interest and the grant that we 've requested will be required or to to allow us to utilize the material for the continued survival of the museum on its place on the site I 'll note that on top of the capital cost of construction the museum will fund itself all costs of that out services in the exhibition development within we have copies of what we just presented and I think it 's easier just to email them around because some that I will just email them to staff because they can put them straight on the hub I like I like paperless there I was didn 't think I would ever say that but I 've gotten to that point Jonnie thank you thank you for the deputation um I was wrong if you could just kind of give us a general update on the thinking of central government I think previously one was the fact that we had money that we could make available can you just give us an understanding of where conversations they 've got with that thank you so it 's um we have continued to engage with the ministry for culture and heritage which is our our principle point of contact I have privately met with the Prime Minister and we have great needs she has agreed to come and visit the museum as soon as possible there 's some intervening events to them it might show that we we probably feel overall that our chances are at least as good if not slightly better with the change in government so that it will be a contingent part I think I 'd be very surprised if it 's not in terms of advice from the ministry to to ministers that the quid pro quo for government funding and if we go back to that post earthquake part of the project which is 87 million dollars and to care for all of the buildings of the museum post earthquake and money we 're asking for from councillors only for are asking central government to fund the rest of it the museum and typically to fund the rest of it question I have was in regards to Ravens car house museum is there any funding sort one here for the raishin of that facility or any update on progress it 's an it 's well under way there 'll be an update coming out but it 's um it 's in advance planning and public announcement very shortly we 've made an undertaking vet and there will be no additional operational costs on the museum budget it will be self-sustaining and our our financial planning shows that there will still still be true well thank you very much it 's a much appreciated will obviously we 've got a bit of work to do on this but thank you very much for your presentation thank you _"

    "text": "the next is the Simon Brown from the South Shore residents association don 't know how to get them tell them to slide mode it 's all you guys can thank you everything that we go fullscreen I had a power position as well okay thank you much good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is Simon Brown I 'm here today to represent South Shore residents association submission to the croatian city council long term plan I have lived in South Shore for over 10 years I 'm also an architect and the principal of Warren and Marni opposites I 'm proud of my personal significant contribution to the rebuild of our wonderful city we at South Shore residents Association advise you that we strongly believe Chrysler City Council have not got the balance right in the long term plan and are certainly not treating residents in the eastern suburbs particularly South Shore with fairness and equity compared to funding projects and policies elsewhere in the city yes South Shore have been granted emergency temporary flood protection this last year in our hour of need to which we are nothing further budgeted for South Shore which is simply unacceptable to us and to our residents a recent survey of our residents revealed that 90 percent of our residents felt that the flood protection was our top priority the biggest issue by far for us is the limited temporary flood protection and the need for an area wide adaptable and yet permanent flood protection solution with this in place many of the other issues also could potentially be resolved including the resource constantly issues for some homeowners trying to rebuild their homes we draw attention to the crisis City Council objective of enabling active citizenship and connected communities South Shore residents Association delivered to regenerate the ocl report and have not been replied to since March 2017 South Shore residents Association handed in over 500 submissions in 2016 but called for flood protection in South Shore we asked for action years ago before he skirt I mentioned in the LTP why is South Shore not mentioned there is no talk of people who are social and economic impacts and the subject of flooding our people of the East value their and the Pacific Ocean for many generations why are question City Council turning their backs and the people in the East what about the council 's responsibilities of listening to people 's concerns when it affects properties in which they pay rates and insurance we were also no question city council objective of making informed and proactive approaches to natural hazard risks why are locally sourced International engineering reports not being considered ie the Oso report for flood protection if heard nothing further since the ISO report was submitted apart from council efforts to discredit the report and not provide an alternative which is not acceptable the council have been far from proactive today and engaging with the community to find a solution and ways to do nothing our concerns is raised last long-term plan submission have barely moved forwards which is very disappointing also highlighted by the South Shore residents association survey was the fact that disappointing twenty percent of residents surveyed still had outstanding insurance issues to be resolved of those a significant number are being told by the council that in order to avoid and I use they cannot rebuild their homes despite provisions specifically for South Shore under the residential unit overlay that allowed development for areas in the high flood management area but it 's been predominantly affected by sea level rise there are rules in place yet council staff are deliberately seeking an interpretation obstructs progress in addition to the prolonged post earthquake stresses endured some resource consents are being granted with great difficulty and extremely obstructive processes the council have proven to be a considerable obstacle and what is already an unacceptably drawn-out post earthquake recovery for home repair and replacement for our community in addition to flood protection our remaining concerns include the following to health and well-being of our residents with increasing signs of stress in our community the majority of gut stress is ma 'am not due to natural hazards the cleanliness of the estuary here you can see the region at the screen recent test results for penguin streets showing sky high levels of e.coli in the water making it unsafe to enter the water this is simply unacceptable anywhere in New Zealand how is he can improving our area which flows out into the local beaches when is he can going to be a fully elected council we need he can to stop issuing water rights to foreign investors and allowing contamination of our waterways locally it should be on the top of their list for high water policy we used to have the world 's cleanest water is a disgrace what he can have allowed to occur we also draw your attention to the variable pool condition of the roads adding to our state of suburban decay also the very poor quality of repairs to the pavements and roads are rapidly deteriorating in a short space of time there are numerous broken and dilapidated dilapidated retaining walls along the eastern edge many of these are hazardous in their own right those unsightly polluting and in down the quotes polluting and stormwater discharge in South Shore and adequate seulement system especially in the hair industry Godwin Street and apatite Street end of South Shore water stays around far too long on the street after high tide and it 's clearly not the strike discharging out to the stormwater to conflicting message messages being given by the council regarding natural hazards to the community we know in a recently published set of minutes from the transport infrastructure and Environment Committee we 've noted there was no a low flooding risk between bridge Street and South Shore despite recent flooding events this affects South Shore given water goes around the end of buns and we share and enjoy south near Brighton amenities notably all of the attendees attendees at that council meeting I spoken out or voted against flood protection funding in the East on the contrary when we speak to the planning and building consent department we cannot build or modify our homes giving the life-threatening flood risk conditions so which is it you know if you want funding it 's no not risk if you want to develop its high flood risk we are appalled that the handling of such misinformation between Council departments and listen to this we also challenge question City Council and some of the long-term plan statements as we strongly believe you are not delivering on many of these messages question City Council state and sustainable 21st century city marshal City Council not spending money on human safety or resilience projects in the east so how is the East country included in that statement climate change leadership Christchurch is part of 100 resilient cities network there is nothing resilient about sending a bat on the coastal population and deliberately leaving this out in the cold the council are certainly not showing leadership on climate change you 're trying to push all the risk on to homeowners and not spend any money in certain areas due to nothing more than prejudice if we can 't be anything else since other parts of the city are getting flood protection and are being heard and we are being ignored adapt adapt adapt Christchurch City Council policy to increase active public and shared transport between season.you and use why is it four out of six bus services that are closing are all in the East we know that bird hospital has recently been completed and there 's a significant benefit to the eastern community and deals with the elderly and less mobile patients yet the bus service gets 'm just we have made a very strong submission on Ekans LTP not to cut the services other subjects of rates increase increases we are fully supportive increase rates as long as the needs of the city and its residents are met to make the city a better more vibrant and enjoyable place to live including the urgent items affecting our community we 'll look forward to positive engagement worship City Council and their agencies to resolve our concerns and create a resilient and sustainable future for social adapt to climate change thank you thank you very much and because you come out of order and thank you very much for agreeing to come at an earlier time I can 't just immediately turn back to the previous submission but the methodology for bringing the community into the into the how to engage with the community has that had any sort of you know sort of consideration by the residents association at this stage I mean we need to do we need to do some you know sort of strong work around around this because I mean you know I that we 're putting into and to Heathkit but you know in right yes but we 're not just we 're not just resolving some of the flooding issues we 're actually buying out some of the houses so you know it 's a it 's a conversation that we have to have with the wider community and when I 'm thinking of Banks Peninsula we had a very strong submission from that community board saying for heaven 's sake you know climate change is coming it 's going to make a difference to our coastline that this the sort of interesting thing about your area is that the history is one environment one side in the other environment is an accreting Beach and it 's a it 's an extraordinarily challenging issue we 've got time we 've got time to work through all of these issues so I kind of want to reassure you that the process that we 've put in place is designed to actually help the community work through very very challenging issues with the council I if I could have my time again I slower Trek on the on the flood risk in those areas but we need we need to have those conversations but the district plan is in place we 're not allowed to touch it at the moment we 're talking to government about how we 'd like to move on with their lives yeah and and we need to have a conversation about that and we you know we 've started that conversation with the chief executive but thank you very much for coming on you know it is a challenging area it 's a challenging long-term play and it 's actually much harder than the last one but we have to resolve a number of issues and they all sort of seem to come together in an environment that has the history on one side and the in the beach on the other so thank you very much _"

    "text": "no Simon watts Christchurch coastal I don 't_''_5.16 I thought they went oh yeah they are coming okay yes please come forward Simon Watts thanks for coming early sorry that 's why I 've got confused but thank you very much we 've got a couple of councillors that have to head away to another meeting so thank you that 's page 185 on your agenda Oh after this first slide I have 105 our slides and hopefully we have time for questions as I walk through I 'm going to highlight some of the aspects of the CCR your submission and at the end I will summarize them a point of clarity I do I am a member of the housing but I 'm not representing them at the moment I 'm a realist but acknowledged rather like I guess you do that and maybe the council and even the government I am NOT neutral I am an academic I will stay with the facts in this unfortunately not as at our graph Clara in my documents you have I talked about the residential you overlay and coupling points your document Rd which I apologize I suppose from my perspective the council and the communities are going to have to be doing things rather differently in the future maybe than the way we have done and so this is if you like reflections on not only the long term plan but what the implications going forward okay there 's an OECD definition of resilient communities at the top there the policy guidance urges communities to become resilient and councils are required to support the process of communities becoming resilient resilient cities are comprised of resilient communities and Krash Church has joined the hundred resilient cities organization so looking at this at LTP I don 't believe this council is supporting resilience in the East why do I think that there 's an our submission defines this there is uncertainty around infrastructure funding in the LTP and around council processes outside of the LTP other ways that resilience is not supported is public statements by officers and sometimes councilors about why infrastructure should not go into certain places and finally potential unequal treatment of suburbs let 's face it if be in a high flood zone where are we now I won 't bore you with the data largely a lot of it is your own the brunt of the earthquake damage is in the coastal and eastern suburbs if you go to a doctor and you have a broken leg actually you expect the doctor to look at your leg and not after one minute start looking your arms and your ears I think geographically equal split of resources is not appropriate in this situation and we know from the LTP there appears to be no further funding for South Shore and South New Brighton these are not shatter necks communities I know many of you know these communities communities that are trying to rebuild and become resilient some areas problems because the planning regulations around the high flood management zones we are advised and believe are being misapplied the in those areas where the residential unit overlay also exists the residential unit overlay has effectively a presumption of development and mitigation whereas the flat high flood zone require to avoid and therefore effectively there 's no development other lot of concern about botched earthquake repairs to people 's houses we 're concerned about botched demolitions along the estuary edge which have resulted in damage morning s tree edge increasing the risk of flooding nothing to do with climate change but the council seem to be concat 18 climate change with this non climate change damage adaptive management you know what this is it 's short term actions that give long term options especially important in a situation where we have unknown unknowns now that has big implications for you and for us for you if I read the guidance correctly you 've got to produce adaptive district plans an adaptive long-term plans and for communities it has implications because community engagement has to go up a number of notches where I don 't think it 's really been before I don 't believe this long-term plan is adaptive and that 's not a criticism it 's simply an observation we are expecting going forward that community and council together agreed triggers and group agree process that 's what adaptive management is and we expect the council to be we expect to be helping you and teaming with you lack of infrastructure now means that ultimately communities are starved out retreat before it 's shown to be necessary is maladaptation which is not the way that anybody wants to go if managed retreat is necessary this is the last action what we do now don 't doesn 't only affect now but it affects tomorrow final slide community engagement the housing spectacular initiative and a very exciting initiative it does mean that communities and council will need to work more closely together which means hopefully council get more information but it does mean they 're likely to be held more accountable for instance storm water discharge in South Shore the communities have experts the council have experts neither are less bias than the other transparency and conversation among equals is required a question I don 't know where it went you have a number of what I would call aspirations in your plan enabling active citizenship there 's a list of them and the submission that we have given you as a detail where at least three of them don 't see how they can work because of what 's in the long term plan I think aspirations which is talking the talk are easier than commitment which is walking the walk which is harder but we do this together and we remember in that process that everything is important know you 've come to the pretty much towards the end of the process but yeah I 'll take David because it is his pitch if we threw some consultation but both counseling communities come up with an infrastructure strategy along the history edge that we would in fact overcome a lot of the overlay problems that are causing resource consenting issues in Saffron I actually believe that the consenting issues are around the normal the non application of the residential unit overlay but there 's been a fairly clear decision and I don 't understand why according to that Commission outcome that the audio they should so I think that 's the core of the consent okay thank you very much and I mean there 's obviously stuff that you 've raised and the presentation that you 're you very much and thank you for being part of the how team I haven 't connected with it yet but I think it 's such a great model for you know developing a conversation with the community in a in a very open and transparent way so thank you for being involved _"

    "text": "the Northwest welcome [Music] so it 's about the no increases and community you know we can 't keep doing what we 're doing with just getting that amount all this we 've already talked about it has to go everywhere obviously there 's so many times sitting in this room stuff still have all do it from we 've all got the heart for community but you know this is the practical stuff as well so it 's really difficult out there and we 're picking up especially in cross at you you don 't need to be told the needs increase in sees likes you all know us a bit more to doing this grassroots stuff you 're one of the things that really concerns us as the exponential growth and costs for example from rental through to BCA and compliance issues through the roof for us health and safety costs are through the roof we do not have have a Health and Safety Officer we do not have Human Resource Management people we do not generally have accountants so all this has to flow down to somewhere we 're here to tell you that it 's not tenable it 's just not tenable and so yes we are also trying to create our own income most of us do that quite significantly we 're very grateful for the funding that we do get and we do a lot with us if you have looked at the aid organizations that make up the Northwest collective it 's largely a massive chunk of your city we 're not asking for massive increases one of the things we did note was there was some discussion about making an inflation-adjusted we would highly endorse that because in real terms we 're looking back over a very long period of time before there was any real increase and funding if not there 's been years of decreased funding and in real terms it 's been decreasing over that time because there 's been no inflation adjustment and one of the things that I was very proud of about being part of the city is that we had a council that was so supportive of community work we do not want that to because yeah we want to have that input we want to have that connection to council because we would with given us come so much more that 's why I organizations work together has now moved to toward a high because they were able to access some external funding to keep that project going because so we know how to work you 're there and lots of efforts in the city and I had to work collaboratively and so everybody here needs to work that way because we are all working at your work closely with your communities every day so yeah any any chance that you could have regarding discussions around long-term funding that 's we want to endorse this we also want to endorse actually having really see procedures so they 're not changing year to year so we 're not having those fleex one of my major funders changed their funding date that cost us 10,000 that we will never recur and it means that we actually hate to downsize so that 's just one organization it has immediate this is an immediate flan effects and we look at the research coming from government every sick and minors community groups NGOs community groups or who 's gonna be these miraculous NGOs and community groups at the end of the pile we 're doing a lot and we want to do a lot we want to do more I want to do it really well however we need a partnership and a partnership to me really is a partnership not in words but in action and it 's a great quote that says I can 't I can 't hear what you 're saying I can 't your actions speak so now they can 't hear what you 're saying there 's something that we can all agree upon that we can say one thing and be another and we 're asking you to stand with us the truth thank you Sarah in fill thank you very much we are we that there was originally a proposal to increase community funding by 10% of the inflation adjusted to do a bit of a catch up from previous years but it hasn 't gone up I was I did there was also a proposal to decrease it by 2% yeah currently it decreases over 13 years yeah but also while council is able to give some funding in other organizations do as well and it covers some staffing and all of your other operational costs what what 's the number of sort of volunteer hours that your organization 's are able to generate from their small amount of funding that goes into directly nuttin to the communities we would have anywhere from 25 to 50 volunteers in our organization alone some of them giving up horrendous hours so our volunteer efforts huge I 've documented it 's on every budget that I send out to every funder so my colleagues so you figure for all eight combined but I can tell you it 's substantial I think houses alone in the four thousand plus hours so could it be more combination you know more combining of your effort so there you know you 've got one health and safety plan you 've got one you know like could you could you come together and actually reduce some of your we can combine all that policies pay for one person to write policies we do this really well we know these are all toothpaste Church based organizations nice but some of them are in some of them and end of the churches help out with some of the volunteers how do you train them in the health and safety how do you and which is quite complex now so how do we do that you know those are all things that we have to negotiate with the same and so the likelihood is if you if your funding isn 't able to keep up with the costs you 've got that it 's you 're not going to be able to take advantage of the volunteer hours that are available in the community and it 's not one thing that 's exponentially increasing you look at rentals from Tom the earthquake well that 's a no-brainer vulnerable children say that 's money we we hit to find from somewhere health and safety that 's just it seems to be a never-ending perfect home we have the fire compliance guys around fight it but every time we create more money to pay for their there 's more just what we 're saying is that if we have any increasing costs it 's just like any business somewhere along the line it 's gone it 's gonna become untenable and we 've had a number of managers in our area have heart attacks or breakdowns so I 'm concerned I 'm really concerned as a manager myself and the math risk that we take on board I 'm concerned I 'm really so we 're coming to you saying we 're concerned we think this is something you should listen to I mean I 've been around for thirty years doing different things in the city so this is the second time we 've come here time was again around not increasing and it was before the earthquakes but we have had a significant increase we put we 've got government to contribute a million dollars a year for three years to the community well-being and resilience fund which a number of the groups they 've already spoken moment have funding and ones that we need to revisit Phil thanks for your submission um one of the things you mentioned in your written submission is about the mental health issues and that they have increased I just wonder if you might make any comments about that in relation to how the groups who you called Nate how they managed it so just prior to this I was meeting with a counseling service and we 're looking at doing a combined proposal around youth centers in counseling and new centers how tenable it is looking pretty untenable we have three counselors using a center most of the other group tips counselors connected we work in that 17 different schools three of them quite quickly so we see it understand it and we 've done these things they still get them back with our children and with our young children and the promise schools it 's so so some some of your groups have any outreach into the schools no that 's true and I mean there 's some wonderful examples of how those connections can be made and helps young people helps older much for your effort and coming today and certainly some food for thought for all of us thank you Delta Community Support Trust _"

    "text": "now we 've got the Citizens Advice bureaux and Neal Lancaster and miR and Taylor our submission is really based around our role in rebuilding the psychological and social infrastructure of the city and submission and we didn 't contact them to try and sort of get our foot in the door first initiative to contact us so those two those two papers are prime and what we 're doing the psychological and social infrastructure of the city our submission has the full support of CA B New Zealand and the chief executive officer we have some concern and looking to the future in the over the last three years our funding from the City Council has been cut in half think of Li and that was having it it 's going to have a considerable impact on the services that we can offer the city the City Council 's funding is gone from 61% of our funding to sorry it 's gone from 35% of our funding to 17% of our funding and if that trend carries on over the next few years obviously the services that we provide to emphasize that we have been classified as a priority-one community group and we are a must have for the city but must haves do need to be funded in particular the funding cuts over the past two years have impacted on our ability to work effectively in East Christchurch we been having a presence at the loft at Eastgate and in my mind the loft is unique and New Zealand in terms of coordinating the services of a whole range of groups together but it 's not cheap the funding funding has stayed the same over the past three years we would be in a financial situation so we could operate their system that that that that service three times a week at the moment because of our funding we can operate at one session of a week we find when we get there there are frequently people waiting to see us people who have significant in complex issues around all of the stuff that we deal with around tenancy around employment issues around relationship issues consumer issues around these migration issues and most of our interviews there for people I saw was each of them was a half-hour interview we are able to use the other organizations that were CLE to supplement the support that we can give people and it 's a model which is is outstanding in New Zealand we in terms of our own structure we don 't carry a huge amount of reserves for a rainy day we work on a prudent basis of having reserves for six to seven months so that we can ensure that our staff are protected if we can no longer provide our services and interestingly we frequently we frequently take calls from people who 've contacted the City Council and the City Council 's response has been go and talk to Citizens Advice bureaux and those those calls must come we are about the trees over the neighbors fence over driveway issues and general neighborhood issues which which we 're very happy to work on but we do note that the City Council is sending work our way our service is pretty highly structured we have a very in-depth induction program for our volunteers and after they 've volunteers each volunteer is expected to do 14 at least 14 hours of ongoing training a year every interaction we have with our clients is peer reviewed and all of our volunteers undergo performance appraisal every two years so it 's we we employ mystery shoppers who come in and give us a report on the quality of our of our service delivery so and we also have an extremely comprehensive database which we use ourselves to help people find information and we often refer people to our public database where that information is stood so people when they come and see us we do not solve the problem for them but our aim is to enable that the people in our community who contact us to be able to work away through the problem fifteen thousand calls we had last year in the Christchurch area so we are working pretty pretty busily and we are seeing no decrease in the amount of the amount of quests that we have for for our service or a national organization we have a long history in Christchurch of 40 years one of you know about us and the most common response we get to that is either you before or everybody knows about you so you know we do have that reputation we absolutely want to be able to increase our services in the eastern part of the city but we do need some assurance Jimmy information last three years council Oquendo funding reduce a lot but in 2016 to 17 you provide a 15,000 you 've got a funding only 30,000 compared to 2015 to 16 how many crimes you provide a service do you have this efika the figures have remained view is pretty static we we are we have not lost any any numbers the one thing that we would say is a lot of our calls are becoming more complex yes they actually take a longer time now than they used to so no quality will be impacted because due to an exact reduction of the funding no but it is it has impacted on our ability to expand out into the loft which is what we want to do which is what we really are looking for that we a manager has had to spend a lot more time trying to find funding from others sources which in Christchurch is not easy because everybody else is looking for funding so we haven 't been inactive we have been very proactive in trying to do this but we also would like this assurance from the council nationally councils of providing 60% of the funding of CEO these projects that we the 17% thank you we do appreciate what has been given in the past though don 't get it it 's wrong we do appreciate that but you can also see that the work could be expanded more if we had security of funding so as the issued more the security of the funding or the amount will both its security of having said that 45 to 22 was a huge cut over three years I wonderful if we could perhaps do a deal and come somewhere in the middle between two and 45 but 3 is funding is is really critical in terms of us looking at looking at investing in in a place like the loftware and where we need to know that so is it something that we can do in terms of going forward and sort of a MoU because we can check all of these things yeah just the loft and I was under the impression that you sort of hit a hot desk where people just came along are you actually based we just rented which is the rent we pay we pay the rent for that room so look thank you very much and obviously there there are some considerations there about different options but thank you very much for presenting on that LTP we just have a quick break and maybe if we just take five minutes and we 'll start again we 'll start again at half-past _"

    "text": "now the Philips town Community Center Charitable Trusts and Wayne Walker hi Wayne welcome back yeah different hair different thank you for the opportunity to speak the round submission tonight I am the Philips town community and a charitable trust that has now been operational for twenty years we started with a single Community Center building on the Philips Town primary school grounds back in 1998 with an initial grant of 100,000 from the former Canterbury Community Trust and ongoing financial support from the City Council during this time we developed many programs to support the local community as a starting point one in particular being a yearly festival where the people of Philips town come together we mix we meet over Gaines food and entertainment all at no charge to the community and we 're grateful for firstly ongoing funding we get from our community board to allow this to happen so that in every family an individual can participate but we 've also developed initiative the support of a wider communities of course it 's the most significant one tonight being the graffiti program that is now controlled the country this is something we in Philips town a very proud of in 2013 we joined with the Philips Town School in their fight to retain the local school and while history will show that eventually we lost the battle they did this community proud and the professional manner they approached this and 2014 where the trust were offered the opportunity to shift from a single building and take up tenancy and what is now the form of primary school sign well disappointed at losing the school we saw this as an opportunity to do something special for this community and surrounding areas so we signed a license to occupy with the Ministry of Education this license started as a 12-month lease with a follow one month payment basic lease but to which some Ministry of Education only has to give us three months notice to vacate and we have not been sitting idly by during this time and response to express the local butyl interest we are developing a thriving Tafari far now far noe the Philips town community hub and that is going from strength to strength we are delivering it not only for Philips town but for the community and organizations across the city particularly the eastern side of the city as you can see from our submissions we work with a white and barian range of government and local agencies along with many community groups that are very successful and newly developed a structure of collaboration with the governance and management structure in place we continue to work on ways of making this a long-term sustainable self-funded enterprise the downside of all of this is a fear of the unknown as to how long we can stay on this site we are aware the Minister of Education are rebuilding Lynwood college for the state is spected to be early to 2021 at that time the technology center which is currently on the site as well and being operated by the luma College will relocate to the Lynwood College site decisions will then be made around the site we currently occupying we are aware of the rights of no tahu under the treaty of waitangi settlement some years ago and we will be speaking with him can also offer us and ways to secure the site for the future we 're here today calling on the council to include funding or other options in the LTP to secure the site and bring it into permanent council ownership this will enable our working with other agencies and communities and further developing this site as a one-stop-shop for many different organizations and groups which support so many needy families and individuals across the city we see huge Ben it 's for not only Council but the ratepayers and local communities across the city and securing the site given our location within close proximity to the new and developing CBD we could be seen as another jewel in the crown of the city as we continue bringing life back to Christchurch the site also offers the largest area of green space for the community of Phillips Town given the rising number of social housing developments within Phillips them and the many issues at a high number these tenants may face the site offers a warm friendly supportive and inviting space they can come into this enables him to connect or stigma that is too often Stern at certain communities and people within it we recognize that the council gave full support when the Phillips Town School was quite in imminent closure and it was greatly appreciated by all of us that talked to the fight to the government of the day now this proud community is calling on you again to step up and support us as we have to fend off yet another possible break and the Lifeline that makes Phillip stand as a community work equally important as a vital link we have developed and continue to develop and be in a supportive and giving community for Christchurch as a city and tens of finance we are not looking at a significant amount of money given the cost of other significant projects being developed within the LTP indeed one option is to consult with state government and around possible land swap arrangements they could be beneficial to all parties the particular nature and location of the site is fundamental to its success there are no other options we could unable us to achieve so much so efficiently believe could and should be replicated around the country shows that when community has easy welcoming and affordable access to a Gambian space community thrive as a community that has the resilience to fight adversity and whatever has been thrown at us over the through mother nature local and central government decisions we just want a level of certainty in the same way the sporting organizations wanted over the stadium proposal and met through sports facilities and there which they now have we want a place to call home and do what we do best delivering for what and who matters the most the elderly families children people with health pursuits other community organizers and organizations in our local community residents is that too much to ask for we think not and we hope you can all feel the same way as us we 're calling for a hand up not a handout and know with certainty of occupation we can and we will deliver on what we do best supporting those that matter thank you I think if I took a vote around the table everyone would support me financial well the transfer of the property I mean it makes absolutely sense that it remains within the community we 've done a fantastic job down there I remember of when it was first established there 's a trust and what you 've managed to develop on the site since the school closed you know it evidences the kind of community that Phillips Turner 's so thank you for all your work just a number of groups and are coming to us as a city asking for us to fund the acquisition of the old Ministry of Ed sites and I just wanted in terms of Philip stone in particular given that the government was found to affect it wrongly and they 've said story whether it 's actually better to ask for government to give that that 's what I 'm suggesting yes rather than us actually funder know that we have a new government there is hope that they may just get to you know to the city for and then we can further develop it as we all know the technology centers along there site and once at that point we 'll be saying hey well actually because what we want to do we want to take over the whole site and we 've got security then another major project we would look at doing is seeking serious funding to build a purpose-built community hall that can be the you know that value to that site as well because that 's probably the one thing that 's lacking in the community while we 've got there as if I know it 's an old school classrooms and let a purpose-built community facility all they can hold even major events and like say it 's these other councils around the table Sarah thanks Wayne I 'm just thinking in the meantime while we would love that to be permanent and the government 's timeframes we 're not clear on those at this point would advocating for a longer sort of turnaround said currently it 's every three months we 're there until they say no we 've now decided we 've got other plans for the site and at that time they just give us it 's a basis but they when they tell us if they if they try and tell us we have to vacate yeah we only have three months to try and find somewhere else for you know we 've got 12 permanent user groups here but we have 50 other community groups that utilize the facility on a weekly basis I 'm sorting every be useful for us to do it like a toast it thing fiercely we 're to try and secure it and also in the meantime do like at I think some security of tenure would certainly help thank you very much Wayne it 's much appreciated very powerful submission great work that you 're doing we are in Philips town thank you thank you _"

separately or they 're all together okay so we 've got I 'm just telling the counselors we 've got the Avery house Community Trust the Richmond community garden and then Haley 's got a personal submission of her own but it 's all all coming together who 's who 's this young submitter [Laughter] [Music] in the community are very much the same so that 's why easily being able to combine them to support it today by Murray James who is on the Trust Board of a free house and also if I can 't be order in Youngjae who are part of the Richmond community garden now some of you may remember Cathy from three years ago we heard mama some bumps group came and advocated for the repair of a tree house paddling pool so I 'd like to take this opportunity to give you some feedback on pool back up and running and it was a Waring success we had families down there through the day in the evenings one day we turned up to garden and there was three birthday parties around the pool it was a fabulous success but the biggest result that we 've heard from that and from the work that we 've been doing in the garden is the activity in the park has reduced the amount of taking the amount of vandalism that has been going on in the area it was so bad at one stage out taking the pain to you I was so very very good succeed so and this is a really difficult presentation for me to make because we have a very good relationship with our community board they hate the central pyramid board the community board has supported us to keep a free house running and times when we 've had it closed and when the roadworks have prohibited access to the site so we 're really grateful for the support that we 've received and support leadership higher-risk all in Dinah sexing among many and they help us with the things that we need to get achieved so it makes me if you 're a little bit trouble to bring some of these issues with tell you today but it 's really important as a community that we deliver to you that wider issues that we faced they 're not all count solution issues now post-earthquake issues are central government issues but at the end of the day it 's gonna fall on the council 's where to help us fix them so without further ado I 'd like to just run through the issues with you so Richmond Richmond I 'm going to talk about Richmond Shirley Darlington in Haven side but I 'll focus on Richmond star Richmond is a relatively small suburb in size and it 's one of the oldest suburbs and Christchurch here we brought specs with lots of things we have about three thousand houses in growing rapidly 50-plus small to medium businesses one government department one national franchise team schools seventeen juniors and four parks now any other Saboo pets with that kind of activity close to this country should be booming and it 's not and there 's quite a number of reasons why the first issue we 've got is we split between pepperiness and eglee theorem eat well also split in half to Christchurch East in Christ you its central person itself creates a fragmentation that gets through this will achieved for us everybody tries to beast but at times we get this deluge so if we add the layer of the research red zone to these issues we we 've lost a significant portion of our population the immediate after effective of the recipient red zone was the loss of Richmond school and Marion College and also a number of key businesses you might recognize this site this is where Pico was briefly while we 're building was getting repaired it is now being tuned back to a Deering site and this is not uncommon on Samuel Road landlords don 't live in Christchurch and they don 't really care about the state school buildings no no other business person would have been the basis the business tell me the numbers we surveyed the ones that were pre and post earthquake that they lost between fifteen and fifteen now we we can 't get your numbers from them we have to trust what they 're saying but if you look at a recent as grants that we did for the house for our community board you can see that the aftermath of the earthquake side we have the impact that hit on our income the amount of time it took us to recover from there and you can see it 's only been in the last year that we 've actually got up to preach quake numbers so if that 's a reflection of what 's happening in a tree house we have to trust us trust what our businesses are saying to us about their losses I know you don 't want to hear about writing it so I 'll be brief we do do opened up four times in five years every time it 's opened up we lose another little business so this residential rezoning and the changes to our area have caused a huge demographic shift in what we understand who our demographics are and who we 're delivering our events to in what services they need because it has changed so much and it hasn 't just changed once it 's changed twice or three times a good indicator of any area is your local pharmacy and the pharmacist who 's been here for two years seed to me in the first year he was saying to her staff we 're all the babies we 're all the babies it 's no babies in this I mean this year it 's like babies one day it 's not and he doesn 't understand if it 's to do with the demographic or with roading this so we 've seen what we 're seeing in our area as a as the red zone he 's got rid of all that single homeowners we 've got a high density housing which we want because the business is saying you want population but we don 't want this on a treat hundred-year-old tree-lined Street mix to a dark alleyway in a beautiful park housing New Zealand had no consultation was the dues they have been consulting with us at Avery house as to how we can help these residents that are going into this building we may see to us how can we help you we see well we 're gonna set up a mean sheet can you help us to fund that housing new zealand 's you know we have no money but how can we help you in destruction that 's gone in this is Dudley Creek I 'm not going to say much about data Creek all I 've got to say is it 's 12 months over in 2.2 million dollars over budget you 're all aware of this in the chaos that 's causing for the resonance around this particular boom the Shirley community center is a big loss for our area I 'm not necessarily sure that putting a centre back here is the right right option but there 's nowhere within our four suburbs that people can walk to to have a meeting of 40-plus people now surveying all the businesses is actually been a couple of businesses that have seafood filming it but about how it could be fulfilled and this is where a good urban planner engage with our community and our businesses now people might be able to find a solution and it may not cost a lot of money and maims of the problem sorry last road one this is North Avery Road last night actually one of their terrible roads on North Haven Road North Haven Road as I mentioned before has been open four times this final time was for a great project it was for the beautification of the road which were all for but why do it in every single arterial Street on that road is closed because of the Dudley Creek project it is caused nothing but chaos and is the store that 's breaking the camel 's back for some of those small to medium businesses down that road I live on stable Road and I 've witnessed two two-car pileups in last week a car crashed into the power box outside my home the people in the Richmond village shop say there 's at least one incident coming every week it is complete is that you 've got a beautiful North Haven Road so the recent emo decision to exclude Shirley Aven side Richmond and Darlington from the school zone ranges outrageous quite angry and quite annoyed community to become very very upset this potentially could be another massive demographic shift for us all in this area to seen the kids to their single-seat schools that they wanted them to go to I read it in the paper I had no idea that they were going to announce that through our through our community you know this is going to impact on people going to schools and again struggling already finally my final thing is that northern arterial route we do not understand why we need to do landscaping on a route that is servicing the people from the Waimakariri describ district why can 't we not keep the writing finish for the rate payers of the council first and then do the landscaping later the other issue that potentially might affect our suburb with this arterial route is the traffic is now going to be diverted down Cranford Street Madras Street in and stable roads rogue depressing as I said before and already decreased it frustrated mom-and-pop businesses that have just trying to make a living so they 're my shoes so how does that help you people into that so I 've had a look at the numbers for Reds which is our four subgroups these are the three years I 've taken the liberty of taking out half of year one because it 's a dummy print project and I think it should go to be allocated to sand Albans each year because it 's not of any benefit to our supper we all agree that it needs to be done because it needs to be done but it 's not you know for doing us in any way so what we 're left with is the first year is the North Haven Road beautification the second year is the palms public transport upgrade in the third years a V Platt playground now if we compare those numbers to some of the other suburbs in our ward given the issues that I 've just gone through with you it 's because they 're big projects Mount Pleasant covers probably three suburbs because it 's a major roadway epinoia also made you roadway and the warson numbers are because of the pool so we through from here what we 'd like to see is these current routes to be completed quickly into a good standard the dynasty of damaged roads around the project we were repaired and now they 're full of potholes in in disarray we really would like to see chances street water street in the whole street back back on the plane so that all of the roading in our district is taken care of you have been allocated more money for Road smoothing can you do us first and combining the needs to we 'd really love for a urban planner to come in with our organizations in and talk to us about how we can actually help these businesses be back on their feet from the surveys that we 've done with the businesses we 've actually pulled together a really good team who are keen to put together a Reds association of some description so do that and finally I 'd just like to take the opportunity to to thank you for the support for these organisations and to let you know that these organizations are really strong and doing great working out and district we work individually in our own projects but as teams we work together the Richmond community actually met where it meets at least once every three months and that incorporates all of these organizations plus our schools in our community board in anyone elses can you determine area and together we are sharing information putting events on for our community and doing really good work Dabra is closing their site down for the next 12 months to repair it and we 've all got together to give them space in house to help them through that through that building period Wow thank you so you shouldn 't have to feel at all apologetic for for making a presentation it was very powerful and I guess one of the things that 's been sort of troubling me around the Shirley Community Center is the very question that you have raised about other side of the road and to the suburbs that you 've talked about so it 's a it 's yeah it 's a really tricky one but have you already started some of the palms doesn 't excite me but but but I understand what you 're saying is that is this an opportunity to actually think through things in a slightly different way but but even that would that be the right location if you 're thinking about the accessibility and and what what you want to bring people to or to make it within walking distance because that Center didn 't sound you know where it was most people drove there and a lot of people came from outside the shirley area to use it because there was a great facility so I 'm just I 'm I think it 's worthy of exploring but they need little shopping center in Richmond that 's a hugely challenging area that I think needs some maybe regeneration planning thought given to it as well we need to understand that retail is going up in their preps we shouldn 't area so that we can focus on making one set our view good yep um Dion Inc so thanks for the presentation it was good and also thank you to all the supporters behind you as well no it 's great to sort of see the support and obviously it sort of speaks volumes to the issues and also the opportunities that there are present one thing you did touch on obviously was with you know with the gardens as well which is in the residential red zone and in the loss of population but our water what are the other opportunities that you see with the residential education space we 've got 80 hours a week of volunteer hours that we copy and we donate food to Delta in the central mission twice a week but I don 't think it 's taken off I think so thank you for your submission one of the issues you talked about was the potential depopulation and potentially made worse by the school zoning err council probably don 't have the best connection at times unfortunately to with the Minister of Education which perhaps you might like your council to advocate to central government on your behalf which is really great but we need to find replacements for the loss of those two schools and we need to find a solution for the people we 've purchased in these suburbs to go to those Jonnie thank you for your submission in for the wit that you 've been doing um just to two facilities that you didn 't touch on with the Richmond Club and also the future of the boys have you looked at those in terms of community and so I think again if we were thank you very much for your submission it was really worthwhile and I think that some follow up around the regeneration planning options that around at the moment could actually find some solutions there I had a question too about the garden but because I just really would like to think that you could take over the park as well but maybe we 'll have an offline conversation about their excellent yeah well but we can take it offline I mean it 's it very powerful submission and much appreciated thank you for what you 're doing [Applause] _"

    "text": "wanna tear I don 't know a community trust incorporated society it has hit the screen okay I 'm Rachel from other know a community chassis 's here my administrative assistant and we want to thank you for the opportunity to be able to present today and couldn 't kind of pass this up and there 's a lot of things you want to say that the council around different things which are in our submission and our first slide is our strategic goals so all of the work of the trust in the weavers that I have which is team but some of these are key result areas in that South Main Street II of 2021 and one of the strongest relationships we have with one of our partners is with the Christchurch City Council so we moved together a lot we 've worked a lot together in the last 17 18 years around building capacity around bringing community together enhancing people 's lives and all the different areas that used strategically fit with your strategic goals as well that 's what we work towards for a vibrant life in terms of the long term city clean and one of the our projects and we 've talked to the community about this and it fits under the transport projects as around the conditions of our streets in terms of road and curbside genomes renewals resealing and surfacing we we have a view on that although one only Road as breezes in NZ those big roads have been resealed and are nice to drive on we want you to keep in mind that for the roads the certain side those areas it appears that we have temporary picture fix up and conditions of eroding after the youth quotes differently and of course you know in a lot of the city streets and restored back to the condition they were prior to 2013 and even so we would say that you keep in mind around the 200 to 300 C the side for the approach those projects and thus the suburban streets and side communities and not just the big streets of Christchurch because we 've still got coins galore like lots of other suburbs in the city around and we need to be pop bet you know some sort of over 60 percent mark condition with the local streets and side suburbs in Christchurch and not just the book the big babies so that 's our treats for one around green space we have worked a lot with our green space areas with city council around upgrading those in the community in at all times and I can mean the city council and staff net in the team as surely and also the coastal board councillors in staff via in representation leaders there around making sure that we consulted worth about how our community looks in that his I mean in terms of the investment that you 've put on I don 't know it 's outstanding and the green space allows our community to build that capacity I mean you put money into the on the corner of one only in him Shastri which is a fence upgrade the year around us being able to commemorate on the 25th of November every year you know around people losing and it of violence so that 's just one thing you one only part which I 'll talk more about later by installing basketball courts in also adhering to the master plan that we signed off in 2005 with the bill would Pegasus board in the green spaces absolutely fantastic so we just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for this investment today one of the other investments that you 've put in we 've we 've done together collaboratively as that I don 't know you want only community center I can inform you that the usage of that is around 80 to 90 percent we think that there 's still areas that we can work on and they 're working with community to make sure that this is a facility that is used to a hundred plus capacity it looks stunning it 's absolutely it 's a trick turf we 've hit the World Cup rugby league use there with the Scottish rugby league team we 've got mainly rugby league coming to use their facility and June exercise group faith-based groups community groups DHB have had Expo in their Ministry of Education also have had expose well so we want to work more together with the community groups to make sure that we are answering that you know that need for other groups inside that hall but without that space that has been I mean we 've replaced that you have invested internet with other fantastic funding contributors as well 920 27 square metres which has replaced wynonie and the breezes Road community centers and we 've rebuilt something fantastic in the in the community of designed it along with your staff and others so thank you so much for that because they put something else rotate it goes as well and I can tell you that just our staff alone with working for the trust we 've we have spring dancers we hire they haul spring dancers deeds and kids what abilities I need to say to you the free year 's holiday program which is run for I don 't know a children who don 't enroll into normal programs early childhood education play days around making sure that every child under the age of five is promoted and also allowed to enroll into Expo days and we also have the nurses and even meeting the around improving access to service for health providers and health accessibility for our residents the other facility is the other knowing library that 's that 's an outstanding educational space that I can tell you that from December to March of this year have had 14,000 people through that door it 's a very well used facility and I can tell you that the pc suite that they have via with ten computers as the most used in any library in Christchurch which highlights that need for us to work together and continue and those good relations relationships with high utter our community campus around providing the Wi-Fi system into the homes of our annoying people so people can have the correct communications available for future learning and also current learning to improve educational outcomes for I don 't know a community so that is I mean it looks fantastic the staff they were great and just wanted to thank you for that in terms of upgrade to the number one playing field on one only park once the first things we did back in 2005 was upgrade those playing surfaces so community could get fullness out of those in the last year we were treated to the upgrade to get it to an A grade standards through gleaning counselors in the local City counselors and we would Peters 's board and staff out to a number one standard in it it 's absolutely fantastic in we 're not the only part to receive it and Christchurch my worry about those upgrades that you 've spent millions on is that we have the correct maintenance plan around those fields being maintained and that they sit at a great standard the whole time and for the money not to be wasted and for the for the maintenance plan program not to be consistent and perfect really for though for the investment and make money because we 've noticed over the holidays from when we left at December and then we came back in January how how yellow that field was when we came back in Italy in fact the watering system had been turned off over Christmas which was on upgrades of some roading or piping or something like that so we just want to make sure that that maintenance clean around all those parts and crises that have been upgraded it 's a really good one and it 's relevant to where the park sets in the surface if it 's a thirsty surface if it 's what would evoke whatever the Tiki say and recreational services so thank you because it 's it 's been able I mean us having that upgrade he 's just made things so attractive for us to bring more people into our community and and that park I can tell you is used 8090 percent as fantastic in lots of people really really wrote it so that brings us to the end of our our submission what we also want to say around the housing is that we think that people should live in green spaces they should live in warm homes which reduces those health risks and yeah I know that you would be keeping that in mind in on support Katrina has said as well and the previous submission but spaces and not overcrowded in there the homeless I worked with to get them into the correct spaces they should be living in as well congratulations on the support Stadium announcement opportunity on the sporting person and so there 's a lot of variability in not only for this around concert expo in lots of different things in how much for each roof over the top so metro sports loved Italy elite athletes can get in and train something like this piece but we can 't wait for the celebration and we 'll be going along to support their our staff in board to the opening of Quito there is just I mean we said on the eastern recreational center around the placement of the event with certain prestige

    "text": "Catrina Hill and Gotham parish of East Christchurch welcome thank you for the opportunity today to talk I 'm used to talking to people together groups but usually it 's my congregation name do they usually agree with me I 'm hoping to try and highlight so some action can be taken my submission is in regard to the provision of social housing my first wake-up call in stark reality to a consequence of not having a home was when I came across a woman who was an around sixty we 've hopped into our church for a cup of coffee I 've got a few weeks and while she waited for her financial situation to change so she could actually afford to have a roof over her head and for a home to be a provider for her that was affordable it was tough seeing her and her predicament morning coffees were nice until one day she said to me she would have to go to the doctors and pointing down to her feet I could see that they were swollen in their delete my reply was of course I had seen all the people was swollen and we 'd felt usually linked to a heart complaint the woman had no heart complaint her swollen leads were caused not by any other health reason and no other has complained except for her sleeping arrangement overnight sitting in her car sleeping sitting in the car when it was raining all day because she had no home to be an and the community facilities were closed that night when I stretched out and my lovely beard under my roof in my home I realized how naive I was about some people 's situations today I am not naive about the situation that presents us in our community there is a need for affordable warm housing particularly one in two bedroom units for those on and comes that alone and for people that only have part-time jobs yet still have to maintain for costs of living so I affirm what is on your long term plan document which we are providing social housing creates a strong sense of community we 're having a home creates active participation and civil life when social a councillor creating a livable city must be very exciting for you but your long term plan out of eight hundred and thirty five million dollars only is sixty three million is spent on social housing and vectors on renewals and replacements and even though the need is getting greater the provision is giving lease is renewal and replacements are maintenance there is no provision of more than the 2017 to the 2018 two thousand three hundred and sixty six units and as the years go on it actually decreases to 1972 until 2018 you are just 1972 until 2018 I thank you for that provision because I do truly and I 'm sure people who are living in those homes are grateful for that yet it 's not enough for the loan now and for the future there 's a parish those who we refer to housing listen to sympathetically however they just end up getting the food on and on and around and around in a circle we ourselves as a church provide some affordable homes and we could have tenant of them again and again over the the key demographic challenges identified a new documents was for the city in the future will be the embed of an aging population which may impact both the size and value of new dwellings in residents ability to pay an aging population means a limited income if the Christchurch City Council recognizes us now for the people and the city generally how much more do you think this will affect the most vulnerable of the city the need for affordable housing is not going to go in a hurry so I urge and hope that the City Council and provides and builds more units especially one and two-bedroom flats in response to caring for those unable to afford high weeds and I urge you to make it a livable city a city where the priority for its people is first and foremost that the basic needs and I just like to finish with the hope from your consultation document was this from the two anomaly family they say I want a city I want to live in a city that looks after its people where there is no homelessness where everyone and that 's from my mum and dad India for thank you questions Phil and Glen thanks very much for your submission Katrina because I think you 're right clear whole area of social housing it has been put aside at this point so thank you for your submission I 'm just wondering one one possible way forward we have as a council to increase our social housing supply and you 're right it started with catching up with what we lost during these earthquakes what would be the council find a way of financially supporting the OTO tahi Housing Trust which is like at the moment the housing sort of CCO as housing I am really I guess of council so I just wonder would if our council were to find a way to financially support them do you think that might go some other way towards increasing yes error about the availability ideas of social housing I think one thing in regards to the social housing is important temporarily homing as most probably it 's a steep to that so I think I would advocate that support referred to people who are chronically homeless have been homeless for a long term so apart from our long term plan we 've actually really got a potential council fund which would cater for that whole housing first program which recently probably we 're government have announced some significant funding for that funding though I 'm quite which would cater for about 50 places some wondering would you see would do you think our counseling effect should also become like I guess a financial partner to government into the housing providers in any city by way of making a financial contribution and most probably nothing we understand more homes need to be built thank you Thank You Katrina it 's a delicate matter in relation to funding increased housing so up till now the council 's had a policy or a policy setting where by the tenants themselves over time effectively hit you know their their rent help to build more social housing units so ratepayers hammered actually done that if you 've got a view on that with you know over changing their policy setting so changing the policy no consideration might be given to actual rate payer phone well I mean yes rate payers to fund a lot of things I mean no I definitely would say to fund some social housing Yani thank you for your submission and you 've made it really clear that you see we should spend more on social housing have you got any other areas if we 're spending more there you would think that would we should make less of a priority in our plan basic needs being met so I would definitely take slices of pies what we want and needs to actually what we actually need and what others would need so I take slices of perhaps recreation thank you thank you very much Katrina it 's um good to see you and it 's always a compelling story that you have to tell so thank you for coming thank you _"

    "text": "then could I invite Ian Black said from the autumn Bradley Park I 'm looking forward to coming out there next Sunday yeah Thank You Fonuts ten minutes you shouldn 't you shouldn 't have been listening to our pre pre meeting conversation but yes your ten minutes starts now hold regarding funding for the PAC funding to the pack the basis for that is that we feel that the PAC is to all intents and purposes a city park yet all its facilities all its maintenance development there is actually taken care of by the charity trust which is the Ottenberg lepak board and since the earthquakes is that the cost of doing everything is increased you know we 've had huge increases in insurance health and safety cost of increased with their it 's not just actually in the pack but we 've actually lost the ability to gain people like Community Corrections Department seam groups to the pack because gobsmacking I 'm sorry but I read that in your submission yeah and I 'm interrupting you because I 'm gobsmacked when did that happen last year so yeah I know and we 've had a really good relationship with a number of Supervisors that come of the group so the amount of work you you can achieve what the group is basically down to the supervisor that counts window yeah and the there was a change in sort of direction within the corrections department probably three years ago where they started going more towards work program so so they started looking at rebuilding houses out at Christchurch prison and those sort of things and so coming to the park means being not supervised as closely i they 'd go out to the field and you know dragging trees out of whatever or whatever and we hit a number of issues with the supervisors coming out with them and it got to the stage where I wasn 't comfortable as pack manager for those for what those supervisors were achieving or how they were supervising their so it basically broke down you know it was just nothing being achieved you know it was so yeah but as far as they are concerned we used to get up to 'm Simon Martin I 'm the chairman of the board thank you Ian 's doing a great job yep sorry I know I did interrupt but I was just I was completely blown away by their it so you know there may be some consumed within the council that that it is a part on Banks Peninsula surveys indicate that you know sort of over sort of sixty sixty percent of people actually using Park come from Christchurch City itself so inside Christchurch and in another fifteen bosina sort of Banks Peninsula residents ie Charteris sort of diamond harbour I mean the rest of them are from either the wider Canterbury region region or international tourists so here is a corner a range of people so it is a park for Christchurch residents and is you may or may not know it sort of covers its cross between an English Park and New Zealand data for sure it 's got a whole range there so we feel again you 've got a strategic plan deal that we try to achieve a balance between you know that ecological sustainability and biodiversity space so it 'd be great for that for the council and we 'll more to the point the right pages of christchurch to help support that vision could I just add that the the council 's certainly had recognised the importance of the pack two great pairs of christchurch originally to the tune of 65,000 a year which was reduced when we signed the MOU in 2012 that was reduced to 50,000 and it 's since then the costs have risen and risen and risen and for all these reasons that extra custody and there 's that outlined here and it 's really because of these increased costs and the low level of the council 's contribution that were seeking a much larger one and we think that 's yep all right well open up for questions Yanni cool thank you for the submission and thank you for the work that you do I have heard the privilege of coming out and visiting on a few occasions and yeah it was really impressed I just wondered in terms of support whether the requirement is for a regular sort of from Corrections or with a one-off sort of you know cleanup days or work days could could be a way forward eg some of us have requested an army looking for the volunteer army looking for projects for example and I just wondered whether again you need that regular Conner hours or with a few times a year big big group of people coming in and helping if that 's something that could work yeah thank you I think you know there 's certainly big projects that would benefit from large groups coming in and cleans up cleaning up and planting and maintaining planting and all that sort of thing but the parks open 365 days of the year we 've got so that it 's maintaining all the facilities tracks you know make sure that you know the people are weird talking with the public you know that public interaction and everything so the actual increase in funding would help spread the load because these these period periods we just can 't_''_435.44 be there because would you because you need a break you know so there is that there percolating on from what Jonnie was talking about with regards to you know seasonal hits by a large group like the voluntary student rally or something like that the other side of that is you know we 're a council in a city under a lot of pressure with regard to the funding yeah we 've got a lot of issues recovering from the earthquake which we 're fully aware of so just for the next few years as is something perhaps your organization can do because what really parks a fantastic place I 've been there with my family and friends picnicking etc but to peps kind of pick it down a wee bit for a number of years that some of the areas that perhaps are high maintenance and just kind of keep it in limbo and as it as so to try and kind of curb expenditure for a number of years is there a possibility it depends yes yes um no because you sort of get into the stages with what you let drop off of the bandwagon we 've been really lucky in the past basically maintain all those historic sort of thing and if you were in that 's your interest unfortunately they 're getting older and their ability to continue to do that work isn 't there and I 'm not willing to go further afield now so if if we want them kept so that means we have drawn more into maintaining those historic buildings so we 're doing there so be it you know in in surveys indicate that most use of the park is picnics in in walks within the pack and so you get your print here pretty quickly if the walks you know if there 's trees down over tracks and Willie 's health and safety issues but trees over tracks or styles need all that sort of ground so you know there 's always it balancing so you can do it but really what you 're going to do small for instance there are more and more people can come into the pack more and more pressure on making sure things are safe we spend now more that we have used to on on an arborist for growing older and this safe so there 's novice that last year we probably twelve fifteen thousand a year and it goes up a beach yeah it 's the expectations of the public which seems to so you should basically got a saying you 've got a 75,000 shortfall how much of that with the corrections we could have filled do you think probably I know probably 40 or 50 yeah today particularly when you 're you know maintaining tracks and clearing Erie when you it 's particularly after large storms it 's good look thank you very much and much appreciated and where there 's obviously a bit of work that we need to do around this one and might be a combination of solutions for you thank you thank you _"

    "text": "item 12 which was deferred so that it was the last item that we were going to deal with today to give staff time to bring back the additional information we 've requested as part of as part of that work it 's become obvious that there are other items that need to be considered in this report or other parts of this report that need to be presented that are not here in the report therefore the decision is to remove this item from today 's agenda so to pull the paper and to allow that further information to be provided in the report and then for the report to be brought back as that new report with the additional information in due course so in as much as we 've reopened the meeting the first thing we 're doing is removing this item from the agenda it 'll come back into your course once the full information is able to be provided so I 'll take questions on that matter but not on the report itself given that we 're not going to be debate debating this report the importance of commit giving community boards powers etc it is the area I 'm just a bit confused why we 're you know as a councillor of the local community board and councillors in that community are happy with us I just we 're totally undermining what we keep saying about empowering community board members so either we say stuff it we 're going to oversee and double check everything every community board does and make the final decision here or let 's follow what we 've been there Metra and trying to get really going and give empower the community boards to make educated decisions on the full information I just yes so I mean maybe that when the new information is added to this report whether that means it comes to Council or whether there 's a need for further engagement with the community board at that time as well I 'm not aware of what needs to be done you know I 'm not aware of the detail of what needs to be added to this report I 'm also very aware that we 're in 't want to embarrass our staff by you know clearly there 's some discussion that needs to occur offline so that we can get a report which is capable of having a decision made around it and whatever the process is around that the process will be yonni are we able to get a timeframe for the community would delegations coming back to council because we support okay so many boards it 's a question which is outside of the matter that we 're dealing with here but I 'm sure we can get that information to you yes my understanding is that that work is well underway but we can we can get an update on that as well outside of this meeting it 's not happening before we be asked to make a decision on this report I don 't know when this reports coming back so I don 't know yep he doesn 't he doesn 't require anybody 's movie so the reports not going to be debated today it 'll come back to a future agenda once it 's been updated Alan so is the good head and altered the decision because it 's so overwhelming because I don 't know what the new information is I can 't answer that question but this further work needs to be done on this report and whatever process follows on from that will be the process that needs to happen no I know no I 'm saying the report has been pulled from the agenda so we don 't have to agree to that and I 'm allowing questions on it which I don 't need to do just so that people have got a level of comfort that 's the right thing to do but that 's that 's what we 're doing I mean we 're not going to debate a report that we now know there 's information that needs to be added to alright so that now leaves me with only one more thing to do which is to close the meeting so I 'll close the meeting thank you _"

    "text": "30 so I call the meeting back to order and we will immediately resume with item 13 the chief executives report so item 13 chief executives reports and Carlene you 'd be happy to answer any questions on this if they just want to acknowledge that the work around the LTP both yourselves and the organization and this is a very difficult challenging LTP as you know and the challenges yet to come with the decisions that you 're going to have to make around balancing affordability with business as usual regeneration and resilience into the future I 've said we were heard about you know 1500 submissions but staff have provided advice in a very short time and about on about over 6,000 points that have been raised in those submissions and then the next bit of workers as you deliberate and as you hear the submissions as us starting to think about so how can we support the things that in the direction that you give around those things so quite a lot of work to do yet around that the draft strategic priorities exposed node organization has strategic priorities and the work that we do across the organization and across the the services are delivered we had a very successful exposure casing met with staff and about a hundred senior managers came to that and of course we had a similar Expo with you we 're hoping to roll that out to community boards in some other groups such as the Youth Council to get their feedback and refinement around those strategic priorities and the third thing I just point out as though youth and local government the work inspirations we so as an organization we keen to support employment mentoring Prentis trips in other ways of getting young people into meaningful work and so we 've been together partnering with Linwood College around the work inspirations which is about people our young people actually experiencing real jobs and council and real experiences about the work that happens hopefully getting very excited about that but it also provides them with other things such as support and writing CVS and how they approach employers and work on ongoing basis so we we got our first group about to so staff from within the organization it doesn 't cost us any more for their and it 's good experience for those merging leaders as well and then they have a wee celebration with their families and you 'll all be invited to that at the end of that we course so it 's all I want to say I 'm happy to answer some questions pulling the the amount seems to vary when you turn the tap on and I 'm just wondering I start still trying to find the right level of it is this going to continue just up and down the thing or will we end up with some sort of a flip so I think that there are things that they impact on we were there 's a taste and it sometimes that they 've been sitting on the pipe and you know you need to run the pipe rather than have it accumulate if you like and it 's like sometimes some people in the shower they might smell it the initial aspect of getting into water so there 's still work around the today the final area around wino is being rolled out and then the we review and testing continuant about mid-may and in a that stage will have the levels at the right at the right levels right so we 're still kind of getting there because we 're aiming thank you Phil thanks for your report Colleen I just want to ask you about to run area Central Library because the accounts were pretty excited to be out there and I 'm just wondering if there be any developments around the glazing since you wrote this report yes absolutely so you know I think you 're going for a tour of it tomorrow you 'll see that substantial amount of glass and glazing in the building and so getting that on site has been challenging but there 's now as I understand all on site and to make sure that didn 't delay anything they 'd put what they call bought a glass or transitional gas only so that they can continue with the rest of the build and it will be gradually be replaced with the glazing that 's want to know whether staff have ever engaged with most culturally and linguistically the diversify the community and also this figure 1500 off a peck how much percentage it belonged to lost the group I 'm sure we 've got that but I don 't have it off the top of my head so there are a number of things that that consultation included including being able to translate both the consultation document but also the submissions that came back some did come back in different languages and been going out to some of the different events such as culture galore so staff were out there to talk about the long term plan and any other opportunities that they had it 's something that we can always do more of but understand that your group had a resolution around some specific options so we just keep trying to improve their access for everybody around long term plan one expect a multicultural subcommittee we already make the kind of documentation our 23rd a favor regarding to last summer record is the refer the question coming Jimmy consultation by the council we strategic authority no the fully pointer one in every active citizenship in the collective community but this effect this community the multi has multicultural community but we still you know know kinda pretty way to engage with those people we only know just priority in there is my concern yes so so we 're looking at all sorts of ways to engage and it 's an ongoing process of evolution and improving that so I when I take your point Thank You Vicki we end up putting the internship scheme with the Parks Department is it in the draft LTP let 's pick that up as part of the LTP discussion on the trial for the free entry in the all speakers and the green prescription for the swimming pools I haven 't seen a report back on that you 'd okay be great to see can we catch on noticing are there is scribbling some notes down over there can we capture both of those as matters to raise through the LTP process thank you and thank you Vicki for raising them both yawning thank you just on page owner investigation project have you got any additional information as to our own services in terms of how monitoring is going particularly the organics plant so I think it 's important that this process is independent of your I even though we 're part of the joint monitoring so they will monitor our organics part along with some of the other organic services that are out there way so there 's sometimes some confusion about weird like their odor is coming from when you 're a fever all organic type industries out there so we so I haven 't got anything specific on our plant but I know that as a result of the project which commenced in January and I think what your board was briefed and February around it there now mapping for reference ongoing issues around compliance monitoring so they can continue to do that and more deep I think board wasn 't really briefed on their odor and what I think I was going to suggest that maybe there is a reporting mechanism back to the local community boards but we were sort of briefed on odor monitoring and it has been an issue and my understanding is there 's been several notices sent to the organics client recently so so I think there are a number of areas of interest as a result of that initial monitoring and your are some that are going to have a some more in-depth investigations so are we able to get a sort of reporting structure back either through Council or the community board around the joint monitoring program I wonder that should go to the regulations I think given the local interest I think whatever went to the committee would be good to have that circulated to the board as well or a joint all or it may be if they were briefings or workshops then joint workshops because I mean local interest has been a big part of this conversation right from the very beginning and quite rightly saying there have been some very horrific cases just recently last week for example yeah all right do you want to ever think about that Carlene and and decide which best way to handle it but I think yeah taken account of in in any reporting or workshops and so on that may may occur great thanks for raising that you did you have anything else I know we 've had several that have been signed off it 's secure and we 've got a program to try and get as many signed off as soon as possible can you just give us an update on you know we 're now in a about a third of the years passed since we were first alerted to the situation I 'm just still a little bit unclear about census has been identified how many have been signed off as secure when are we likely to see additional ones being signed off so my count saw big pad 24th that 's right so this is a very complex piece of work in terms of understanding they 're not only what 's best for each well here but also is maybe Adamson has said which ones you know we could decrease or switch off to fix but still to enable the requires around water generator the public so there 's been some really determining what 's the best treatment for each of those in the program around there so that report that comes to council later on a month we 'll had quite a lot of that information so just so works sort of on hold until we get that no I work continues and we briefly about that just recently so there have been some well here 's they 've been signed up for secure but that doesn 't mean that the the network and the area around the particular plant station has been sign document and just the other thing related to the well heads um obviously there 's been the draft report back from central government and it was quite interesting reading I don 't know if we 've read the vicar report but they seem to be suggesting that councils are spending a fortune looking at UV when actually the risk is incredibly low and so there 's been almost indicates that that 's a kind of a bit of a floor and the fact that we spend a fortune on UV treatment when actually there is the have how is that work that central governments just released being fed into our will actually provide some feedback to Council on the report but also the process that 's going to be undertaken so there are two things one is we 've got the heavy lock North inquiry and there 's I give some work that needs to happen around that the recommendations or agreement at cabinet be shared and then these the government 's just announced some investigation and queries review of the three waters so that 's much more broader than that so we need to actually think about both of those issues and respond in terms of what the implications might be for us and how we might engage in that process so be it they 're linked but they 're actually treaty provisions I would have thought that would just be separate so at the moment there 's not a lot of information for instance or Boundary Waters review and we 're guessing at some of the things we think we need to understand if there 's going to be a national regulator then we in targets and measures that will be required so we 've got some of this information coming obviously in the report term to the to the meeting later this month clearly there 's another body of work and advice which is coming to us let 's let 's wait till we get that advice and then we can have a more informed discussion about it but clearly you know as we 've indicated earlier this is an area of significant concern to us and it 's an area that we 're keen to to progress our thinking as quickly as possible so once we 've got further information in front of us it means that we will have a far more informed discussion thank you well there any further questions the chief executive deal again good work on the Linwood college working I was gonna say you know I 'm not young anymore but I feel young every time I come to work but I 'm if you guys want any help with that I 'm more than willing to sort of help in the program as well you know coming up and in your report around the earthquake-prone buildings and you always have an update on that but I just wondered if there was any public buildings that were on that list sorry I can 't actually respond to it any public buildings on the earthquake-prone buildings so you 're thinking council own building yeah it keeps coming up and I 've been meaning to ask the question but I 've never join the Lincoln yeah I 've tried to open the link but it wouldn 't open if that information can be made available because I think they 'll get quite cleared you know and and so people actually know what what buildings are going into especially if they 're public yeah you know if they 're on that list and actually make that sort of more available now the other one in regulate compliance you say there 's an increased demand for investigations for non-compliance with district planned Resource Management Act and building that comparable breaches what 's what 's that the 768 breaches were identified and follow-up action what 's the most what is the is because we 've got a new district playing the part of it it 's about people understanding what the issues are around it and you know providing for the feedback and support of them around it as well yeah I mean the reason I was asking because if there are any common themes and we can probably start doing some communications around you know these are the things that have changed from the new district plan you know being a bit more proactive around you know communicating these out to people so that people can then take it up to themselves to actually so maybe it would be a good bit of work to actually just get some are there common themes if it is increase in and actually how can we proactively communicate that to people it 's wrong so so some of the things that we get complaints around the things like you know yeah different users then expected Thank You Vicky entering them is a miracle we at some stage have some sort of futher update on whether that 's legal or possible okay and maybe also done in that regard as well mm-hmm thank you update you fantastic thank you all right so I 'm happy to move that we receive this report do I have a seconder Pauline Cotter all those in favor against that 's carried now let 's move to the mayor of _"

    "text": "so now moving to item 8 the holds well Hornby Rickett and community board and we have apologies from Mike Mora who 's unable to be with us this morning we do have Garry Watson community governance manager who has joined us this morning Garry was there anything that you wanted to UM briefly highlight about the reports as is presented well actually there probably is just a couple of quick things I would say that the Holmby there 's a new residents Association being formed initially probably the didn 't Park issue but this is a new group that 's formed so I start looking forward to working with you we work with anyone else it 's probably good to acknowledge that 's there and just let you know that we 're running your leadership day today now so the staff running a leadership day with about 40 local identified leaders and so I 'm imagining it 's going very well I 'm heating out they feel hunch to have a look and I 've got some some very good speakers out there and it 's just an acknowledgement 't really think there 's anything else other than in the unhip you 'd answer any questions great Gary thank you very much so questions from Dion and then Yanni deal so we 're as the deafening ttan Park stop it so the first part well actually maybe counselor to portunity can do the better up day than I can yeah so the hearings panel has heard the bulk of submissions people submissions at this point due to the fact that the access strategy of a traffic report wasn 't available during the consultation period we reopened and that for feedback and had over 30 additional submissions ten of which which wish to speak to us so we 'll be hearing those tomorrow and in there 's a meeting booked and for mid-may for deliberations and a recommendation to the community order thank you yawning yeah thanks I 'm just in your report in the written report is talk about the proposed record and business associations and also around I guess I was just kind of interested in terms of the bus priority line so has that has the plans Road and when were they approved and is there any opportunity for them to be revisited if there 's concerns if I can just the Business Association they were looking at is a as around there and we do have some champions within the community and business champions so there hasn 't been one for quite a while along rigaton right so looking to Business Association I 'm just trying to understand like um obviously there 'll be concerns around the loss of parking for a long record and Road for the bus priority line that decision I was just to understand the plans if the plans are being finalized and approved by council and if there 's a new business association formed and there 's concerns if those plans will be revisited this week one Easter days was at the mall and Lindsey said that there 's been a lot of feedback and she 's talked to a lot of businesses that are that are new to the area as well she 's talked to all sorts of people so there isn 't a plan to revisit that it in the community along Lee to understand the options I 'm struggling with so if there 's new businesses I 've gone on since we 've approved the plans which were a few years ago then out of it and if there 's issues that arise then what are the options if the plans aren 't open to change that change is happening all the time we work with it all the time and we work with those businesses residents everyone asked to understand what what the changes are becoming and what their options are around there but it isn 't that doesn 't change the decision really if we did change the plans we 'd have to go out and probably have to go Andry consult and then get another approvals council but but I think it 's also incumbent upon new businesses that move into the an area to do the due diligence about proposals that are proposed and certainly the upgrade to working Road has been well communicated for quite a period of time and well known and as noted in the report the formation of a and input from that business community which is something that we would be wanting to achieve as council any way we can work with them really closely on how we construct us as well that 's really key so just um so final question just relate to that as but it mostly on street parking is going through between sort of a certain area in the model is that basically the plan there was quite major consultation on this some time ago when the that was going to be a fun area since then they 've found the money to do their 93 year old pipes underneath it and the consultation yesterday for example for three hours anymore I 've actually had emails they haven 't passed on to you from businesses saying how much their how much they enjoyed it and how good Lindsey was it actually making sure that people knew what was happening the the front part the first part of Rickerson road which has been a long ongoing saga the liaison between the contractors and the businesses has been amazing in fact the delay for the that they could have the summer trading and was now a weekly dropping sessions down Trevino 's and they even for Buddha 's birthday there was a lot of consultation with them about that there at that temple so and there 's another one today directly your church so I think yeah the major design is forward process to be able to use it because they do and for some better pedestrian amenities shown by them great thank you and thanks for that positive comment it 's good to hear that there 's some yeah good work and and good engagement going on on the ground during the project as well as in the planning of the project that 's great thank you very much there any further questions on the community board report so Jimmy you 're happy to move

    "text": "so now moving on to item seven the faendal to my merry Harewood community board report to Council and we 've got Aaron Campbell here with us this morning so Aaron thank you for joining us good morning and welcome to the table our culinary Tuffy Oh mater Tyra part l200 talkative Kawai cats on top of any evening call nothing that would sir peri pembo at home counsel it 's been 18 months since I came it 's a community board member and I haven 't formally introduced myself so recently there was recently David Carr right the chair of the Pendleton why Murray here would step back from his position and we have reelected what we have elected deputy chair Sam McDonald as chairperson and myself as Deputy Chair so I thought I was got the opportunity to introduce myself formally so listening today so for our board report this month I just like to highlight some points we using the groins has been raised with the board particularly in relation to integrity of the fishing event usually held in October and staff have responded to a board control of the wheat and it 's planned for the upcoming spring and summer season once the week is starting something to regrow obviously the the weave throughout our city is a good season this year with the warmer temperatures and you know high nutrient content of water fishing can take place for six weeks following any chemical control which will mean that they 're taking kid fishing event will need to be postponed possibly late November early December so staff will continue to work with interest parties primarily the kids fishing Charitable Trusts to keep them updated on the progress regarding permissions and control process so we certainly appreciated staff for the amount of time and effort putting into helping control this machine slide 3 Jeffrey 's reserved water tank it 's a replacement water tank from the Burnside water supply zone it 's a 500 cubic metre tank that 's going to be replacing a damaged 200 cubic metre tank that was obviously damaged in the earthquakes submitted feedback on the draft concept for the location and design of the water tank resulted in further investigation of eight has been developed and is currently up for consultation until May 14th here you can see the yellow poles they would have been circled there about three times it 's a preserve that has well used recreation space it 's right beside a rugby field there 's a walking track surrounded so it 's a really highly used space signage has been placed in the park and with the polls erected that shows the height in the area of the proposed facility it 's created a great deal of interest from the neighbors and all the users of the park the worker from City care who was installing the poles received some strong opinions from people at the time what he was doing and what was happening then so that we can test for it for your information please the community service awards 2018 it 's a biannual award there 's been 11 nominations this year premature and something on the slide will be considering those on the 14th and it 's great way to acknowledge all the community volunteer work the one item that isn 't honest like the the feedback from culture girl or certainly acknowledging the relationship that we have with vehicle rigaton providing that joint event with over six and a half thousand people were tending you know a huge amount of staff time to to make that event happen and a large number of volunteers helping out on the day as well basically from their feedback it demonstrates that this is a significant event cultural or is a significant finding for the city and it 's important for our communities and it brings together our diverse communities in Christchurch to celebrate and share their cultures another point I would just like to raise is our we have a bi-monthly community liaison meeting with usually twenty to thirty attendees coming from a variety of community groups and organizations I raised with one of them last year the mobile truck shops that are in Christchurch they go through a brunoise receiver mandolin would when I 'm driving through and although they were not permitted to operate in Christchurch the the idea of council enforcement to try and chase a track it 's a very difficult process full hopefully more can be done at a government level obviously Commerce Commission has had issues regarding the the compliance around you have the legalities of these truck shops so I was looking at other solutions at the community level and saw that consumer New Zealand just acknowledged Mike and Pauly now when in Christine for the community for fundraiser there this week so communicant immer New Zealand with these do not model stickers love distributed over 400,000 throughout New Zealand over the past few years they 're also pushing for changes to the Fair Trading Act to make it an offense to ignore the that do not knock signs so after a discussion with I approached Massena New Zealand to ask if we could use that design and distribute it through our community liaison network welcome to brunoise information hackers being development have being developed we 're taking a lead from other welcome packs that are available in the city the information that will be in those packs so you know local community groups programs activities things like mothers groups or walking groups and that kind of thing also information etc and also include information regarding local schools doctors and dentists and that type of thing Marian has talked to the manager of the o2 attacking housing trust and that came to have them give give it out so new tenants on the council found earned social housing units and we 're sure thousand New Zealand will be keen as well so these police pamphlets also include up just a little bit of consumer rights information which I think many people might be aware off we 're also going to just get the individual stickers printed up you know many other people particularly elderly will be more informed regarding their rights but particularly the the door-to-door sales people that can come to houses the residents can feel quite intimidated by that process it really doesn 't matter what area when you get a knock on the door any not expecting you know who 's gonna be there so this distributing through our liaison community group Network you know through churches we feel that it can at least maybe help some people you know can be quite an intrusion into the looking to distribute day next month thought we might finish the presentation with a group of the month in the Philippine one re he would group boundary and but also just want to acknowledge that we share funding for crime watch across church incorporated with Papineau Eunice during the hunting everything went hunting before the operation costs all this time I met with he 's given Wild Bill and Gary pleskot they 're both Givens a committee member and Gary say and they 're both patrollers and also Lindsey Lloyd who is the chair I meet with them for a Bevin had my cup of tea and we discussed a wide range of activities that they do and they a fantastic help to the police that are here in Christchurch they received a 95% kind of rating from the police superintendent they is a concealer baby there 's the patrols are seven days a week and ten hours a day they have both and verben in a rural patrol and the the amount of work they do that 's not just kind of you know observe and report type of the new units and fund the operating cost event and I know that some of the members from both community boards and may be looking for doing a little bit of a ride-along as well and I 'll take the reporters Reed thank you very much so that leaves time for some questions are there any questions for airing this morning take a kid fishing because there 's been quite a lot of online coming about it she said is definitely going ahead that they need to be yet yes thanks Erin but as far as I know and we 're certainly pushing from a board level to make sure that the teacher environmental considerations you know if there 's a major storm event or yeah rain yeah my application you know chemical treatments and things like that so you know we 're certainly doing what we can the the option of mechanical removal was considered but felt that it might actually just kind of cut some of the weed and the engine actually sprinted the debris and the it would seek further down the waterways and things like that this so thank you very much indeed for the presentation this morning and for your report and congratulations on your election to the Deputy Chair as well so do I have a mover to receive this community board report Jamie seconded Aaron all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you so now moving on to item six the Pappa Nui in its community report community board report to Council and Ally Jones great to have you with us this morning presenting this report welcome [Music] thank you all right okay so I 'm look no pates and a huge amount of community activity as there always is I have to say our staff are doing an amazing job at the moment Judith ESCO left us three weeks ago now so we are one down in the ward and it 's very very busy so I just want to say that I hope we have that sorted soon I know that Christine Lane is working on that and we 've had the little person in our ward as well which has been fantastic the yes that 's no no no I 'm just so the read would Plunket rooms this is a much awaited repair in the Redwood area of the world it will be well used and it has a community Social Work function which will be again as much needed a lot of that has gone into sorry about the back and forth that 's still on a timer ah the repair work that 's going on at the moment at the Sun ovens Park again long-awaited as I said the other day in the draft LTP submission this was a very poor park before the earthquakes because of problems with the drainage and that has not improved one of the issues obviously we 're dealing with at the moment with the repair is the brain as soon as we have rain as we have had recently it takes three to four dry days to enable the ground to drain so we can get trucks on there so the pavilion is being rebuilt and there is new drainage and surface going down on the park the edible garden awards we had around 36 37 entries as well I 'm fortunately we had to reduce these two once every two years now because of the cuts and funding to community boards which we 're really disappointed with because we have a great relationship with the horticultural society they were disappointed by that as well so we have had in another year what we do do and I have raised this before at council level and through the community board is because of the work that I do in PR is my business and when I have time I get images and information to the local paper of course we 've got a good comms team here as well and they do that too but I think that Pavano ENS is getting a lot of pickup in our local media because we are able to get information to them and I would ask the council again to consider put in someone or a couple of people and place journalists and students or so forth to work with community boards to help get information out about what 's going on in the wards and to take some pressure off comms obviously liaise with concert at civic the Papineau e bush regeneration program our talked about that on for the LTP draft as well this is really excited we had good local media pick up on that too and this is being done in two parts the first planting was last end of June and that will hopefully in time return this area to the natural state that it was in more than a hundred years ago now wonderful turnout but the tree that went in first which you can see in that image there is a three year old tort row which came from a seed of a children from Rickson bush the two main bushes in Christchurch in the late 1800s were written and Papa Nui and that 's been growing for three years now and so that was the first tree that winter which was really cool and the kids really loved it as well this is the Ranger team which we are now fictionally calling the blue shirts and they were great to have there a lot of hard works gone in showing people how to plant the trees and care for them and I must acknowledge young dr. Antony Sher bolt here as well for his work on on this project and others and our ward I was actually away when this presentation happen but I had heard about it prior to the presentation this is main north road and it is going to me as you see there in entertainment and sports two minutes there are a number of sports groups in the area we 're talking more at the Papa Nui in half a new evil fast redwood and that have lost their homes and are looking for something to go and this is a really exciting proposal for this part of our board so 21 covered sports courts around 20,000 square meters I 'm not going to read this out you can read but as you can see it 's resource consent approved and basically ready to go great thank you very much indeed do we have any questions for Ali this morning no questions Oh yawning thanks Ali thanks for coming in I just saw that there 's been concern expressed around the northern arterial downstream effects consultation around lack of details as your board had any view I mean our board as one that 's an involved in that has had a presentation we provided feedback but I 'm not sure how that got incorporated into the designs or the plot appreciating of course that there 's still a lot of work to do and there have been several proposals that have been considered over that last year or so as I said in the LTP the draft LTP submission traffic and the CNC is perhaps the major issue in our Ward at the moment with the amount of traffic coming through what is really important for us as a community board and what we 're hearing from residents is that we somehow address the tens of thousands of extra cars that will be going through the Ennis Road Cranford intersection and try and move them away if at all possible from the edge where Sherborne entrance to the city which is in fact a t-junction when it hits penny Avenue so far from ideal so I think what we 're excited about with this consultation is that it takes it away into the one-way system which will essentially allow for the traffic to get directly into town how that has managed how the feedback is incorporated well that 's still left to be seen because we 're in a consultation 's going to be additional number of cars coming down from the north they anticipate about 22,000 I will be end up on Sherbourne Street it 's being aired so we 're not the idea is not to reduce any traffic that currently goes through into the each where commercial village or the Barbados Street each we 're village it 's not about that it 's about coping with the extra cars and how to filter them through and council often gets criticized when they put something out for consultation that it 's so detailed that it 's obviously a fait accompli and now we 've been criticized because this is quite vague this is just some ideas going out deliberately quite open so that people can come back and say have you thought about this how about this and that 's we were at at the moment so it doesn 't close my thing June 4th or something so is quite a lot of time for people to have meetings and come back and just surprised it hasn 't formally been to your board for for approval to go been we 've been communicated with the entire way through the development of the CNC and our concerns which we 've had as I said for some time now have been regularly communicated to the project team so they were well aware of what the issues were and what the residents were concerned about and we leave the staff to do the job that they 're qualified to do which is put together a proposal and consultation and then the public feeds back on that and we do and we go from there I mean we felt that was missing why are we consulted with the traffic coming from where 's the traffic impact there are really clear easy to see maps options for your feedback showing the street so that 's been proposed for and what will happen a large map showing the area we 've got some issues about that that we will feed back on and proposal to reduce traffic on side streets so every issue that we have raised as a community board with staff over the last year has been addressed and here and now democracy is for them to feedback so we 're really thrilled with it excellent and thanks for your positive comments on that 's good to know that 's been well received by the board I did have a couple of other questions early as well one from Glenn and one from Erin Glen yeah you know just the image and some of the bullet points over that proposed Sports Center yeah kind of set off a bell over the relationship with Metro Sports are you aware of any kind of two-way it 's a consideration but what we have found from having talked to the groups in the area is that this will be a more localized community type of facility so that the Metro sports which is a citywide facility this will cope with the huge growth that we 're seeing in the north of the city around Belfast and Redwood and because we 've got a lot of people coming in and out of the city on that Northern Corridor you know it 's great that we 've got something we 'll have something there for families and having to travel across the whole of the city to the other side of the city to the Metro support so it 's it 's more a community-based facility then there 's a liaison and talking but we don 't see a clash at this stage but it 's consideration thank you Eric yeah it 's just read the CNC we had that presentation our community board on on Monday and having formerly been on the board with you guys so I really liked it I really like to congratulate the way the board 's gone about this and staff because in our deputations for the LTP so far we 've had our the one from Peter Beck from Garry Moore and from Eastern vision really see it about doing this style of consultation and not going out with the finalized plan first talk to the community first get all their ideas give their feedback then form your designs and so that 's been a really clear message and the LTP and it 's great that this is a vision of that going out so I just want to really problem in an issue so it 's been around for a long time and member the really heated meeting at pepper newly primary the place was jammed and that was pretty quick luckily we 're quite a few weeks later which you know diverted everyone 's attention well unluckily for that it should certainly changed it all right thank you so we 've got a recommendation to receive the community board report do I have a mover Mike Davidson seconded by Pauline Cotter all those in favor against that 's carried and Ali thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning thank you _"

this is so called this is about Christine Loughton who has worked all her life for the community she I met her and Human Rights Commission because she lead on the transgender campaign in Christchurch and she but she was she had so many wide interests in the community and she was hard-working and she was self-deprecating and one of the things she absolutely loved was buses and she campaigned for buses as well and there we have Christina 's partner Elspeth on the left and to her brother john-paul on the right and the rest of us as well we put a plaque we put a plaque on the wall of the bus who

was so brave and she was tireless and she was never self-reference never sell free prints Thank You Vicki and then Glenn would you just like to tell us that wee bit more about the eatable in sustainable garden awards and what you actually did I 'm going other one oh did you we copied Peter oh yeah we went to the horticultural society and we asked him to help the problem with the garden pride Awards is that they do drive-by inspections so they and it 's always flowers of course in its front yards and we had among amongst the people who have enormous we have great great backyards and if they have great great backyards that I 've been noticing the garden with the prime would they also have pitched in some fruit so how did you get the message out to everyone ah um we put it on the newsletters we put it in the pie couple of papers we did it in the residents association and thirteen people just entered the again and then you went around and talked to them but now think about the horticultural society we pay them they went into people 's backyards and they put it all in debt the presentation there the photographs of the gardens plus sometimes some comments about what people had said about the gardens like for instance the garden that they absolutely adored go around and do it or did you guys do that no no it 's recognition next year we 're going to emphasize as well sustainable because some people will want just a rainwater garden they 're not interested in growing flowers and things they 're interested in sustainability and we 'd like to recognize them as well yeah great thank you and Vicki I 'm sure there 's opportunity for some offline conversation if you wanted to get your board really informed so that they could consider doing the same thing great so Glen and then Erin and then we 'll move on Glen yeah just a quick question whether we should hear that Oh Carolyn we 're still attempting to ask you questions just wondering whether we could have that information Carolyn for the Presbyterian Church of which Kristina was one of its members and minister time of it and quite a difference would have been more accepted in the prism in the Anglican Church today to be frank yeah Presbyterian Church so if we could have that I 'd like to send it on to the thank go after that Erin you just if you could go back to the Eddington book I just wanted to say the photo on on the right Phil spike looks too big for him right some of you could think about ordering it at 40 it 's worth a hundred and forty and secondly our staff have ordered several copies to keep in store as presents on the occasions of those things new I pay 400 for that point all right so we 've got a recommendation to remove the report to move the report a recommendation to move the report do I have a move yet Phil and Tim seconds all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much indeed Calvin thank you _"

    "text": "10 which I 'm going to move up the agenda which is the banks peninsular Community Board report to Council giving Pam the opportunity to present to a slightly earlier than anticipated just so that um Pam you can get off to a corolla as you need to do so Pam and Joan thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning looking forward to hearing about what 's happening on Banks Peninsula thank you your freedom camping online so if we just use to move to the skate park as you as you see there on the left it 's a stunning piece of work done by local artists local or worldwide and is well respected by the youth the community the graffiti artists I think I suppose we could say in our communities and hopefully it 's going it has been completed and we hear that there has been some items on Facebook another good feedback or not that it has been amazing project so to complete that now we also have the school children the young of our community who will be looking at the skatepark because of the wet weather recently but it is still going to happen but I just need to say about this project and the importance of actually our governance team and our teams that are working with us to enable us complete projects that ensure that we have good engagement with our communities so this one one that was was one that was a bit challenged at the time and there was very little engagement with our community so thank you very much to our engagement team who had the skills and the ability to pull all the parties together to ensure engagement does happen and I think that it 's important but we all use our skills to the best advantage so that 's an amazing project it has been supported by southport who provided some funding for it earlier on and have recently provided some funding it 's been at the skate park has been opened and now we have an amazing mural there that we will watch and hopefully but we know other graffiti that will appear on it so it is it 's amazing outcome now um a result of a workshop that the board head and we all staff were were supportive of us finding out a little bit of information more information about our community what were the issues from our community the economic community nowhere else just from the ekor our community of result resolving this the survey was worked through with us as well as the board and so we want things in place that will deal with the new season in 2018 19 so we think things in place by the cinema so we have an online questionnaire and just last week or earlier in the week we heard that our view that were over 200 that are already completed this survey which is that when you think of as a population picks of 600 and I grew up but much wider population 200 is a very good completion of surveys so the library also has been a part of us because we have a number in our community who find it difficult to complete online surveys in the ability haven 't the equipment to do it and the library is we haven 't_''_232.27 I haven 't actually heard of the feedback from that yet but we will follow up that and see how useful that has been in the process the way through so the next one is rather a shabby looking block from the toilet block with a very full container on the side of it this is obviously from a tourist from the holiday season when the toilets were well used and we have trouble with the contract programs for entering though the special service burdens is written in the toilets and the woman 's toilets and we have a number of old toilet blocks we 'll see that their toilets not particularly flashy looking and our blocks on Bates Peninsula across the peninsula I 'm not on terribly good repair so we 've have asked that in that an review of the long term plane that we look at looking at the toilet blocks across the peninsula to decide which ones have more more disrepair than others that would be different a challenge but we 're just requesting that the funding that has been allocated they be of a an overall view of them and decide which one 's work we might do so the next slide is about the village planning committee and this was a process that we went through a number of world just last year that a small amount of funding 15,000 was allocated to this particular community and the dormant Harbor community to look at how they produce their skills because there are a number of skills in that community and Jenna trees is one of those who 's also a council plate has been has worked under contract for the council at stages about using those skills that are in our community to come up with some good ideas moving forward at little cost to the council and also working with council staff and so this particular community have come up with their village plan and we are asking the the council staff to continue working with that community because they 've identified some walkways with a neck that community that they can utilize and staff are going to work with them but this is also an opportunity of it 's how agendas work it is not a deputation it was public participation because it 's all these items are not always on the agenda so we need those opportunities to be able to talk about those within our community and this was what the small community took Little River took five minutes I did we did have a bit of discretion it 's about sharing a little bit of money goes a long way sharing ideas and getting on with the job so thank you and thank you Pam for presenting these are some pieces of information to us are there any questions for Pam on the Banks Peninsula Community Board report Tionne if you go back can you just go back to the yeah that was really really amazing and I think those kind of projects are really cool but the question I had was who owns the the old Littleton jail site if you look on the right-hand side and I 'm not entirely certain the there 's some land up there that 's owned by the Ministry of Education and the some land up there which is some items that are owned by us which may be on Ministry of Education land we could easily get an answer to the national interest because just looking at that photo I think you know given the history of that part of the you know some of my up up I went to with we 're imprisoned liadrin some of the patio wars in Iraq and a two feathers would look amazing up there just a black which symbolizes peace okay amazing to go for a walk through and I do encourage you to go for a walk come to Littleton and have a lot what 's the air you know walking some of the street walk past the new school that 's there it 's an amazing sight can you take that back to your community board Thank You Pam I 'm Yanni I just quickly do you know who the artist was so we found the ones that would be acceptable to the community into the youth no it 's good thank you any further questions you know I was delighted with the outcome for this little son number of positive comments from the Middleton community already and I think for all as Pam said the board were a little bit uncomfortable with the way that this had started out the level of community engagement the level of community support in the end has been an absolute win and I 'd also like to echo the acknowledgement of our community governance team and engagement staff in the way that this was pulled together it certainly landed in a far better place than it might have done and thank you very much indeed for that and obviously Pam a number of issues raised there which are considerations for the long term plan as well the Little River planning piece and also the Banks Peninsula toilet blocks so thank you for that now I 'm happy to move that we receive the Banks Peninsula Community Board report do I have a seconder Sarah Templeton all those in favor thank all those against theirs Carrie thank you very much and thank you Pam for presenting to us this morning thanks very much indeed _"

    "text": "thank you very much I 'll now move back to the item three public participation item three point one David Lynch of momentous public relations regarding the regeneration of Cathedral Square so David good to have you with us this morning welcome to the table you have five minutes to present to us on your chosen subjects thank you I should say but I understand the rules but you can suspend standing so fit so suspect but anyway this duplication has been pulled together very short notice as a consequence of a method appeared in the paper yesterday it finally was written at 00 a.m. this morning or started and it involved a whole realm of other emails coming in to assist in terms of showing that what 's presented has been widely canvassed among some reasonable good people in the CBD that have some concerns about certain matters around Cathedral Square I do have a handout yeah this is already on the hub but certainly we can circulate the hardcopy handouts as well yes thank you what what you actually have on that hub is actually the previous deputation love affair anyway thank you for this opportunity I don 't need to explain my background and my capacity in speaking to you on the 10th of August I did address you on what I considered at the time were very significant concerns with respect to how we generate was approaching the engagement over significant proposals and changes I don 't really want to go through all the details other than to say I think that with the passage of time we prevent that we generate is that well intended intended as they were they haven 't got it right and we 're at a point I believe that we need to look at some change so the purpose of this deputation is to set out some background to why this change is needed for the most part when I approached the council last time and we generate finally engage with me it would be fair to say that there is sponsors were totally inadequate and effectively a firm reaffirmed or validated the matters that were raised in my 10th of August submission or deputation to you and it 's to disclose about the proposal cost which I source from a number of industry people that should know of 16 million that 's been conservatives has never been challenged and secondly who 's going to be playing for this and as I said at the time on the 10th of August will be the ratepayers has never been challenged so in my professional capacity I maintain an obvious watching brief on a lot of projects and the Cathedral Square has been having made a deputation I 've kept an interest in that as I have done with the Cathedral and insofar as we generates if it 's a concern I believe that the lists and satisfactory and complimentary media coverage which they continue to receive there 's in fact a reflection of an organization that has failed to deliver and it 's time for critical change to be made with the greatest respect to the Mears headline yesterday I totally disagree with their quote the planning agencies which jointly are owned by the crown and the City Council is not or are not behind schedule I would respectfully submit that assuming is not one that is formally approved by the council as one prominent christchurch businessman said to me appears to be a political denial of the reality in so far as getting Cathedral Square in a situation where it should now be celebrating the decision of the cathedral and not caught up in layers of bureaucracy and unnecessary delay furthermore it 's rather unfortunate that it would appear the mayor 's Communication Manager might have overlooked reminding her of the substantive concerns detailed in the Christchurch press on the 22nd of December 2017 the being nine hundred thousand dollars spent on cathedral square but building owners very disappointed I don 't want to labor on what that actually article pointed out I 've captured that for you to think about and reflect on what I 'm going to suggest there 's an appropriate waste Ward to demonstrate leadership from this council in addressing the important historical hub of the city and recognizing what really should be done right now rather than a whole bunch of proposals that have not been suits in my view a substantial substantial evaluation of 's achievable there 's actually feasible in the short time available to prepare the submission I have managed to canvas opinion from a number of clients associates in the media in response to the mere statement with comments being one of surprise one of bewilderment one of disappointment in some comments that it would be an appropriate to table here today now that does bring us to the end of the five minutes so if I could ask you just to make some closing comments to wrap this up thank you but the greatest respect in relation to regenerates performance I think it 's unhelpful those sort of comments it undermines the credibility of the sconces and devar 's to move forward and it she show it is committed to this recovery I believe what this council needs to do is as I have mentioned the issues sadly were faking organization that isn 't performing with us in mind I request that the City Council meets with the Honorable Meghan woods and resolves to instruct regenerate to suspend their work on a regeneration plan for Cathedral Square for following reasons years the cathedral act as I understand allows sections of Cathedral Square to be used as a builder 's yard for the duration of the restoration the act has a precedence over the regeneration act the amount of space required has yet to be determined so it is not practical for regenerate to plan when they are unaware of what is required one might argue accounts would start incremental work however with heavy construction vehicles and motion this is likely to create some difficulties the surrounding empty sites and the perimeter of Cathedral Square are and will soon be construction sites sparks new building is proceeding now o dakaru are sitting aggressively interests and hotel development on spear lands near the convention center does bring us to a minute over time so I 'm going to need to bring this to a close now so thank you very much indeed for the presentation we 've got the written handout which certainly we can when read can read afterwards but thank you very much for coming along to join us in providing commentary this morning thank you there is no opportunity you David for joining us this morning we 'll now move on to _"

    "text": "and then I 'd like to move directly to the Linwood Central Heathcote Community Board report item 9 so we 'll deal with the community board first and then we 'll come immediately back then to the public forum David Lynch so Sally welcome to the table thank you very much indeed for being with us all right thank you to the council [Music] we 've got really positive feedback about that and we 'd like it made permanent when you start doing the whole all the bands across this one just kids giving us feedback Paul cause we went out for consultation is to the sight of it in there giving us feedback the really great group of kids we 've had so much consultation on this pool and we 're due to go out again for and because they expect the siting of it with the type of poet or community facility that it actually is so you think we 're gonna get another mode of conservation but over the years it was just a huge huge amount of consultation all very proud for it we 're very 'd like you to keep it you know here because it 's such an area of need for our community board area it covers a huge range of parts of the city for it well just you know it 's moving here and the city used to be vitalization in we 've had a lot of consultation from the multicultural festival and other things we 've had on the consultations we know Stan will post office as well tiny very it 's moving in here we no one 's going to hit as well in some events that we 've published that we 've put on recently dear no just say one thing about any we 've seen other includes application areas and this is an thing that I 'd like the council to take up a few buildings to be built was no off street parking or parking on them then under our existing policy you can have tumblr council and asked for a resonance path now this is happening a lot and there 's see one of these buildings now and the process of being built in planed come have people coming to the council asking for these residents parts and we might have a whole heap for them down one Street because there 's a whole heap of Units there was no off street parking so have a look at their policy and see whether it matches what the district painting is doing and would you want to change it depending on how it 's painting up all right thank you very much indeed Sally for the report and and for the comments I mean certainly the Lynwood will stand pool matter has been well raced through the long term plan process and I don 't doubt we 'll be hearing more about that as we hear more submissions the intensification of parking meta anticipating that you would raise that we 've actually got some wording in front of us by way of resolution requests that staff provide advice on reviewing the residents parking policy in view of changes to the district plan in relation to intensification now that wording has been provided by Sarah Templeton I assume Sarah you 're wanting to to move that matter I can get a seconder as well please Dion great and then to you Sarah to speak to thank you just briefly this isn 't reaction to something that 's negative and a district claim this is the way that housing is going to develop in many areas across the city and its really future focus the transition is really difficult there is going to be listen this need for car parking in these early properties that are going ahead with us posting some backlash in some thing transitional problems if you like but they will become more common so I think that as they become more common we need to be proactive in looking at the parking policy what we don 't want is people purchasing these expecting to be able to be you know 10 people grabbing spaces from outside a number of properties along the street I think it seems it 'll time to look at it now Thanks thank you yonni I think I 'll just support the recommendation but you know I do think it is in part a response to issues with an understood government appointed independent commissioners has three main objectives as strategic directions reducing the requirement for consents reducing the notification to communities and reducing urban design and part of the problem I think is that we do need to think about if we want people living in a central city we need good design and we need places which are usable for people so you know I appreciate this is around parking there has been a long history of discussion at a community board and it counts all prior to the earthquakes around the L 4 living zones and the whole issue of minimum car parking versus maximum car parking and and from my point of view what we want is we want well-designed you in the central city that people can live and so I do agree with looking at reviewing this policy I also welcome the opportunity that hopefully we 're gonna get in the not-too-distant future to actually review the principles of our district plan because you can 't separate these two things out and I think we can spend a lot of time reacting when actually we district plan that does encourage good urban design Thank You Pauline and apologies I didn 't give the opportunity for questions on this I 'm happy for you to ask that question if you wish thank you deal just on the parking thing I think we still want to sort of you 're just a slight caution on when we look at it because we 're still 2,000 people less in the for ebbs living then what was before the earthquake and I don 't want us to be doing things like this as a reactionary kind of thing to a new district plan that will actually discourage investment back into the city so there is a very fine balance we want 20,000 people so whatever to live in the central city that 's four times what there is now so there 's a lot of different there 's a lot of changes that we need to be doing and we need to be thinking not just on reaction reacting to parking but actually how do how do we facilitate these developments in actually how do we make it economically spaces or people that are going to need car parks to actually build them on site and then build up or something along those lines so they can have spaces underneath so I just want to be very cautious and cautious around when we do this because there is fight you know 2,000 people less living in the central city still from since the earthquakes and we 've got a lot more people that we want living there yeah I mean certainly bearing in mind that what we 're asking for today 's for a nice to be provided you would imagine that a number of the issues have been raised in this debate this morning would be sidered as a part of that advice all the work that would flow from that Glenn thank you yes I think obviously parking is one side of the equation and the other side 's been spoken to already so I get you know we have at least two options here one getting the full control of our district plan back and making that the changes required or perhaps even using the region that changes were made at the the site at the corner of Broman Colombo for instance to what was originally proposed and you know yawning others have raised this question over intensification and how it 's playing out in our urban designs so you know I would fully support no I 've heard the option raised of a region plan for housing for instance no that 's something that we may thank you and so thank you Sally for raising this issue and and thanks to those that have moved and seconded this resolution it 's entirely appropriate that we would consider the flow in a flow on effects from having changed the parking requirements in our district plan and as per my comments to Dion 's item that he raised I 'm sure when the advice is provided that will address or give an opportunity to address a number of the issues that have quite rightly been raced this morning so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried Thank you very _"

    "text": "then we invite Cape Burgess and the team from crashes Youth Council to come forward I know there 's a master plan being developed I mean I 'm not worried about that I think Yanni was talking about another one but we don 't need to have an interruption to our wonderful invited guests please proceed I 'm Kendra and I 'm a twenty year old student in the chairperson for the Christian chief counsel so we are going to kind of explain what a submission is that you guys have read and before we do that give a bit of background to how we formed it and who we are so the christchurch chief council we 're an independent organization unlike other use councils in this country who said do not sit under the City Council we are completely youthfully it with ages 12 to 24 in our leadership we have 16 people on our Executive Board and an equal amount of people as Dean remembers who support us with our events such as the one paper will touch on we are completely incorporated society with our own constitution is advocate support and strategy stronger voice for young people engage and promote ideas of active citizenship and participation in order to encourage young people to contribute to the communities create space in a positive environment we allow the young people to speak and foster networks and build relationships with decision made makers in order to influence change for young people attended the long-term plan event we have in order to engage on it with young people and we 're going to Caitlin white this is account so who 's your engagement support student it I mean how do you think agent workshops call decisions for the decade it was how Thursday the 4th of April in the Mears land and it was open to all young people who met abroad and we had a broad tune out of 42 people we were also revised obviously capsules and then the entity of you it was awesome to see Johnny he turned out something type we don 't only get at our bins and this is heart red we had an ice breaker and instructions of the long-term plan that 's the scene and to the umbrella into workshops the based on the key topics in the long-term plan the we lien had Chi and an opportunity for individuals to outline the priorities through a monopoly money activity you can see the results of actively and the submission we did open the floor at the alcohol to ask questions the elected members and offered councillors an opportunity to discuss for some topics to them the purpose of the engagement of it was to enable young who were to fill to feel informed and empowered to complete their own submissions and the feedback from salute we 've had a number of young people who have stated that they may not feel comfortable complete the submission which is awesome although this was not the primary goal of the event CFC also used as imagined to create our own submission which you read and as well as this we want to we want a position to be based on the discussion and highlighting issues from young people much of the information we have provided is not directly responding to the long-term plan nor providing the neat workshop the workshops that were run on the night we 're transport broken into five points on public transport cycle ways an accessible city street lighting and road repairs we had parks heritage community facilities and then water which was broken in so would equality storm water and flood protection and alternative funding and rates with another workshop we were highly impressed by the depths of conversation that occurred in all these workshops when we were planning this event before about five on topic from which young people might prioritize but actually we 're really happy that we didn 't have to do this as you can see from the submission content we actually had a real really good engagement with each of the topics which really outlines the passion that young people have to be part of the decision-making process and have their voices heard we thought that often young people are underestimated in this think that then gave up sit-ins provided yet to young people aren 't always leading to good problem-solving that we feel this event in some of you guys were in that room around these topics that they were really passionate about one thing to be very clear about with our submission it 's there were 42 people attending that event there is so many more young people involved and so we are not representatives for all young people in Christchurch we are representing the some but even within there there are disagreeing statements for the now submission because many people are diverse and complicated and this is what a submission is showing so we would like to note that the feedback from the young people who attended the event was very positive many young people they just know that this was the first time they 've spoken to or met an elected official or the mere we would like to recommend that more opportunities like this are made for young people and to think of CIC as in a position to support you in achieving this we would like to recognize the effort of all the took the time to come and support the young people without mother 's help contribute to such valuable engagement from the young people we would like sector and as a core partner of our co papa and ensuring we create networks in foster supportive environments and we felt that and their consultation again it was really supportive been successful without the road and what it was really good to have someone like this on the council that we can help and we can in order to achieve about um we heard black to Marika mean that the Sorrell and similar ones be fostered by City Council and future in the difference very good Andrew Dion your comments around alcohol taxation so you 'd obviously have the discussion about taxation on alcohol relating to on licenses off licenses the young people concluded that if this was to be looked at it should focus on supermarkets and liquor stores and not bars or restaurants I 'm interested in what the discussion that got you to that conclusion was like and how you think this might be implemented or what it could look like Piper and I we 're not one of the young people that running that particular workshop which is alternative funding this area is definitely something of where that was coming from and we just know that alternative funding will the workshop and the young people were invited to think about what a potential to gain other revenue to make things happen and City and we just didn 't have time to really dive into that one particular point so we 're not in a position to really give comment to the question all right thank you Dion on page 204 of our report the budgeting exercise just talk about that a little bit because that 's really cool and it does give a good priority of the things so when we discuss the purpose of this event we talked about the fact that we want to invite as many young people to come in and make really learn that whatever happens in this room has real impact and money is coming from somewhere and it 's leading to something and sometimes young people talk dead a lot and like the money is going from this place to this place so we decided that we need to show them how that works and so the idea 100 and monopoly money and then write out all the different key points we had identified in the long-term plan and they could write down like a condition to that money and in place of the earth well they could just throw money at it and so some of the examples had a lot of money thrown at it like the inner city dog park which was just someone coming up with an idea and asking a whole bunch of other people you give money to it I like that yeah the idea around it really was we all the time tell young people that this is the money that the city is using to make change for you or you can have a say on that but if you don 't like it because it is your money so to give them that money and say you have the opportunity to give it to the them and in show you guys that this is where young people want to see the money throwing it or not throwing it yeah I might be showing my age here a little bit sure it was just one of those things that got noted down there um a young person who wrote it down would be really good at explaining I 'm Sarah thank you um this is really cool and it seems to me there 's one area here that takes up a lot of space which is great and that 's transport I know that sort of from 30 onwards young people are more independent wanting to be where they have to worry about their parents and cars and things so what is it about transport looking at buses and cycleways things that really helps young people and what gets in the way I think so there was lots of discussion going on there wouldn 't be one thing I 'd say it 's really important to every was mentioned the cycleways here and people really super excited to the completion were people aware that they 've been pushed out time and what was the comment the feedback on there and it was kind of and there 's lotsa mixed feelings about the cycleways and whether they need to be more 't drive you so if I could use them now to get to school which I can 't_''_671.23 at the moment so as well as the major ones that we 've got going in the big routes more of those sort of local connections connecting up to stuff yes yeah very good sorry oh listen I wasn 't looking sorry my apologies I 'm interested in what of security around street lighting to be placed around in for it to be of better quality very good thank you very much and really appreciate you taking the time first of all to hold the event here at Council it was really great to see so many young people just engaging and a process it 's not the easiest process to get people engaged them but you managed to achieve that so thank you very much on behalf of all of us thank you _"

    "text": "and New Zealand Federation of freshwater anglers welcome to I keep the car won t come out too tacky greetings its first of all I 've been here in this capacity I now return to my roots as someone who trained as an ecologist originally and the Federation of free fur Enders represents the consensus of around 80 priests water fishing clubs throughout the country now I can 't tell you exactly offhand how many different Canterbury but I knew that do you know that 28% of the 74,000 people who hold fishing licences actually live in that or actually get those licenses in the North Canterbury region so we 're probably talking in around a potential audience around 20,000 people but approximately only 10% of them are active in fishing clubs so we 're looking at about 2,000 or actually active but we have a a readership of our materials which probably puts it forget close to 10,000 in Christchurch fishing is listed by sport New Zealand in the most recent surveys is the second most popular outdoor activity of New Zealanders after walking so it 's we like we 're concerned particularly about the lack of commitment aspirational in the long term plan towards activities that are family or intogen in intergenerational focused activities such as the fishing in the example that we 've quoted is the situation that has arisen and in the groins and for fishing ponds that are at the groins fishing game I 've spoken to him the last week and the Isaac trust me Academy into the creeks full name for the Isaac conservation of wildlife yes have reached the point where they will not put any more fish in those parts and the reason is because of the lack of ongoing maintenance and restoration work in those areas the silting is probably of the order of 60 centimeters in each of the ponds the Willows have encroached on 80 percent of one of the ponds and are encroaching on others and the pond weed has got to the situation now where they can 't put fish in because there 's simply nowhere for the fish to move last year the Federation 's affiliated clubs went out in October and assisted in a dingy some rakes in Forks it 's actually difficult to remove I lost that weed we did get some help from the PD people on that Saturday morning with lots of comments about spending in their morning clearing weed but we actually worked through a process where we found we 're actually only effective with about 10% of the weed it actually needs to be done by council staff yeah and we 're concerned that there 's nothing there i 've trolled right through the entire all the entire bits i can on the council 's long-term plan relating to the groins I can find nothing in terms of a commitment to improve the situation and I think that this is this is a genuine intergenerational family outing when people go out there we had over 5,000 people tuned up to take a kid fishing day and our fishing clubs were that the bulk of the 200 volunteers who were meaning the area in that particular day fishing going before me that they 're getting 200 people a day after those ponds during the summer because they 're stocking them out because there 's no commitment to this a lot of our members get quite upset when they see the local soccer grounds and local cricket grounds being mowed reso and rade remarked every week often for the enjoyment of 22 people on a Saturday whereas you know here 's a counsel resource that is so badly neglected that it 's unusable for the purpose that it was put there for so we really want you to to look at why this is occurring and what can be done to ensure that things like take a kid fishing which at the moment is on hold for this year can actually be reinstituted I think it just comes back to the fact that we feel that these sort of outdoor recreational activities are quite significant in people 's mental and social well-being we 're not there to promote our interests as fishermen we 're here to promote the children to get involved and an activity that we have had a lifetime of enjoyment that that they can actually get a foothold into I draw your attention to the four summary points 'm not going to speak to it to each of them in tune but I would really like the council to have in the back of its mind the idea of duplicating what 's in the groins to some extent in the east of christchurch for those youngsters who don 't have access to transport to get out to the groins to enjoy the recreational side of fishing that that was that that was the first concern I wanted to speak about the second one it 's been so eloquently put by even and friends just prior to me then I 'll just mention that we also are very concerned about any suggestion that wastewater management systems could be sacrificed for any other consideration their members have a long history of frustration in anger in dealing with the discharge from the Belfast freezing works into the lower Waimakariri River which is the most used section of River anywhere in New Zealand for fishing and yet you know what what they said to me was go and promise the council that we 'll put as much effort into opposing every other I 'll bring up it 's not to do with the LTP directly but our members are quite concerned that the image fishing gets from certain miscreants on the pier and would like to throw in the solution that if the port of Middleton which is a council owned properly largely was not built like a concentration camp and people could actually access wharves that have got no theater no ships it get them at any particular time then you may not have the problem you 've gotten the pier and you sit and you open up this recreational activity to a much wider range of christchurch people Europe thank you and I 'd like to pick up on your comments on Littleton obviously fishing off the wharves at Littleton is something that did happen in time past there have been as you note in your submission health and safety considerations which have prevented that from happening in more recent years under the Littleton port recovery plan an area of public access is being created at Dampier Bay in Littleton so even if it wasn 't possible to have fishing safety concerns if an appropriate area was a big set aside at Dampier Bay do you think that would be acceptable to recreational fishers and sure it would be acceptable but I still struggle to find out why it 's a health and safety concern for for Littleton when there are other ports around the country which make the wharves available they do not have shipping good thank you very much that 's appreciate it yeah well the three shorter the Federation of Rachel rain dislikes we 'd like to thank you for the opportunity to pass on that sort _"

    "text": "right Denise forge a bond otaku Oh Forest Park opportunity to speak this afternoon I 'm from the Water Co Forest Park as a group was created by a lot of like-minded people over three years ago our vision was to see the red zone around that Eden River become a native forest and we can park so we 've been actively promoting this idea as well as working on the ground during ecological restoration and we wish to see an increase and notified worse now setting Christchurch may be the wetland capital of the country which is a great thing in my mind but however a city does not support indigenous bush foods that have found in other cities such as towing to do this we need our native trees such as toto and Katia along with fruiting species to be give a stable food source for these birds we believe they 're a natural cultural and natural and cultural heritage should be an important part of the fabric of our city it gets a sense of belonging a foreign fauna is very unique and special and we should submission we propose it the City Council increases are spending on arts and heritage there is much research and public that has been published about the health benefits both of the physical and mental well-being of being a nature we 'd like to see funding funding targeted at increasing and protecting our indigenous biodiversity in the city energy that has stated in the district plan is to enhance a maintain and adjust by diversity we 've been running a monthly routing be at Horseshoe Lake Preserve where for the last few years we 've been planting and weeding this initiative was started by a local resident who was resound in the area through efforts with miniature plant at least over 1500 plants and also tackled weeds such as old man 's beard and Blackberry however we just volunteers we 're doing this in their own time which is limited and we have limited resources we feel that this reserve has been neglected even with the best efforts of the Christchurch City Council rangers who are fantastic while we appreciate the council has allocated funding for boardwalk and track appears this them the reserve itself so we control is a very important thing if grey willow and other weeds such as old means being not control they have a bigger negative impact and also it takes away years of restoration work prior to the quake and after the quake the budget should be set aside for recording and monitoring the biodiversity area how do you know what is in it if we don 't look we don 't know if we don 't look we have seen much regeneration of native species in this reserve which is a good thing horseshoe lake reserve along with Travis wetland an incredibly important fish water wetlands for biodiversity flood control and our well loved by Christ Church citizens we were working the reserve is common to hear the bell bird and pink penthouses flitting around next to us it 's a very pleasant place to be when looking at funding I was concerned to see there 's no funding for Trevor Sweetland which is actually pretty dear to my heart as well and the draft but I hope that 's just as a misunderstanding the Wheatland is important to our city 's biodiversity birds such as a button have missed it there and there is an endangered species and is very few of them left and I think we should be waving the flag saying hey this is great we 've actually had this amazing food breeding and our city in an urban area there is also Marsh Creek and spotted Creek which is pretty rare as well in much diversity of insects including the endemic species of the flightless crane fly the partnership between a city council especially the Rangers and I can 't_''_254.17 say too much about being because our wonderful the Travis the partnership between the Rangers and the cherry and trust as a Zeigler of the house council in a community group can work together to achieve a combined goal so I the council I believe needs to support community groups such as ours and such as a Travis we can trust for what the wonderful work they do in these areas we would like to see funding for that even our auto carro over Ramirez own included in the have gained permission from loons to work with volunteers in the red zone and we have sites where there 's been where there 's significant native vegetation that we have allowed natural energy regeneration to happen as we haven 't been allowed to plant because it 's under millions of control so we are around native regeneration to happen and one of our sites especially there was Tokra there 's you know the seedlings coming up so there is real scope and their area totally some native you know some regeneration happening on its own and we are also seen as ribbon woods that are taller than me now which is probably not such a big deal but there 's cabbage trees confit and other species that are regenerating so we wish to take on transitional projects to continue what we 're doing in these sites and we would like to have support as I said before we are just a few people doing this work in our own time and we would really like support from the council to help us and what we 're doing you know we plants and moral support I think is really important as well so we 'd like to see support for groups like ours and others be it in the red zone or reserves like course you like and Travis Beck Leslie is another area that is crying out for word restoration to bring annexes Detra leaned and to salt marsh habitat which is you know the history has changed we 've lost some of the salt marsh habitat so we 've got an opportunity Leo Pixley to bring that back and we also supportive of essentially proposed by kahlenberge so in conclusion we watch the City Council and the long-term plan to allocate funding to increase native biodiversity in the city by supporting supporting existing reserves such as Horseshoe Lake and trellis we 've been supporting community groups who are actively involved in restoration we would like to see the council take a lead and the ecological restoration of the auto care even read zone and expand on the already good things that have been done by community of use such as ours in Avon Network a forest Wheatland parking red Trevisan ocean lake will offer significant opportunities to fill policies and targets for both local and central government such as zero carbon and climate change issues and I 'd also like to note we support the east to trust of others who impose the cycleway around the east to each and we also even network we want betting to start planting in the red zone and to create wetlands because we have the screen spine and there 's no bit of time start and there to actually do something and net land thank you thank you yonni Vicki thank you for your submission I just want to ask you about something that was in it but I don 't think I heard heard you talk to and that and I 'm really glad that you 've raised it and that is around the LED lighting yeah and I just wanted to get a bit more of an understanding around the alternatives and whether or not you 've had any contact with our staff about what they are actually putting in no no I have an H Street no but you what has been planned and Brian Patrick who is a entomologist in the city and and he 's very interested and dr. Watson butterflies he has been doing work on those type of lights and impacts they have on specially invertebrates are you I don 't know is there a process by which we can at that information and maybe get either the committee or the appropriate people looking at it and this was a concern I raced when we went to greater the switch was the environmental assessment on the ecology yeah but I just don 't know where what we 're doing in that space okay you know I think there 's certainly research out there from overseas as well of the impacts of those type of LED lights okay okay thank you very much via submission just in relation to the planting of more and natives particularly in the red zone you actually allowed to go ahead and do that on lands land now we I haven 't been given any you know to say that we have we are allowed to no I 'm not sure actually working with along with a carrier Network and region two that would enable you to be able to do that because it seemed like quite a specific proposal there I 'm not even sure if you 're imagining planting them such that they 're permanent or planting them so that they 're shiftable with necessary well if the we would I have been told it you know that may not be permanent so they could have to be removed but I would hope after they 've been here for five years it people may change the line so but yeah you haven 't got a process by which you could get the go-ahead for that proposed no no we haven 't no no we we don 't applied for a transitional Lane juice plant thank you all the best thanks very much make sure when you do Denise and a you aware of the innovation and sustainability at the council and my sorry are you aware of the innovation and sustainability found at the council yes I have um when you get your permission thank you thank you thank you thank you _"

    "text": "now and by even slip back but this time as the spokesperson for Aven attack Iran neat week mr. toto yep resented my chakra network with my colleagues Georgi Jardine and Peter be there 's parts of the spot sounds a bit brutal so apologies for that but let 's see here we go Edna chakra network is extremely concerned that in tempting the very difficult task of balancing priorities that you 've got the melons very very wrong here and that you need to know gently think of your long term plan strategies Lenin your introduction to the LTP you identify that we must get the basics right then we don 't believe that you 've done that here you also indicate that the Garden City is about sustainability about environmental protection in ecological values clean rivers clean air and flood resilience you also identify the need to be aspirational and make Christchurch a place of opportunity and you have set strategic priorities that include improved waterways enabling active citizenship in connected communities and maximizing those opportunities but again we don 't believe this LTP delivers those outcomes the for the regeneration of this city in a particular for the regeneration of the environment for the regeneration of the eastern flat lands and for enabling active citizenship and maximizing these opportunities for start the very process of consultation around the LTP as Peter explained before is an example of how appalling council processes are at engaging active citizenship for a moment let 's focus on the even otário River corridor recently as you said before we had announcements of the proposed green spines as a default position throughout the corridor which is great and for the first time in seven years we now have an opportunity to progress transitional projects in the red zone with the least period of up to five years and the ability to plant in the ground for the first time although with four if that 's edibles we 'd still have to do a lot of soil testing and Possible 's before we could even achieve that we 're in the final stages of defining a regeneration plan for the long-term future of these vast areas of land in this unlocks enormous opportunities to a big way in the near future and in so doing regenerate the suburbs of East Christchurch with it however there is no provision within the LTP for maximizing this opportunity or for enabling active citizenship in this despite many groups as I said before chomping at the bit to get things started you as a council have a key role in this by facilitating seed funding for both transitional projects right now they 're desperate for money and on a larger scale for a longer term capital projects as soon as the long term presses the regeneration plan is approved which should be within the next 12 months but none of this has been included no provision for this system the LTP as it 's currently stands and we have detailed what we believe should be provided for right now in the LTP in our submission in detailed amounts you also have a role in signaling to other funding providers and their boards that now is the time to start investing in transitional projects in the East that the regeneration of the East is far from being complete is as enablers in facilitating navigation through complex compliance Hills they significantly challenged the fast tracking of these transitional initiatives which is what you 're speaking about before that he we ask that you work with community groups working in this area to enable active citizenship in participating and making these transitional projects happen our experience to date with working with Council has not been tremendous a lot of the delays you 're talking about Viki actually emanate from this body we had three years of negotiations before we even got a transitional River Trail along the wall on the river and what took a long time to get that switch long from red to green two years of intense negotiations net what we 've got is very sick and right and make do but we 've got something moving the bit of the midway bridge along the trail because I was here late last year talking about it we 're still pushing that through Council processes to get it achieved this is what takes the time turkey it 's going through these processes and trying to cross all the T it just doesn 't happen overnight and in Council this lender in a significant landowner and the regeneration zone is an important role to play here secondly the very modest budgets that support this such as the community water partnership water ecology and water quality improvement programs and the pest management program all are under funded or not funded at all in this LTP they 're all really key programs to make things happen but none of that will be to any avail unless you get the basics right in the basics here how to meet your core obligations as council and your strategic priorities and that is appropriate levels of investment in the three waters infrastructure we believe you 've dropped the ball on this when this LTP and are seeking us out to continue to drop the ball for decades the D prioritization of investment effectively disinvestment in wastewater infrastructure in particular is a total abrogation of a key responsibility you were elected to UM to take all the fine words about cleaning up our urban rivers are just hollow words when you accept it as okay to frequency with time yes offensive in their waterways of the scott-free offensive to all cultures tell me to fear not and party ha this is absolutely contrary to the spirit of your commitment to progressive improvement in your waist would have discharged consent and morally wrong it is no coincidence that much of the discharge closed east under the metaphor Seward Avenue out of sight out of mind unless you lived there wastewater infrastructure is not a nice-to-have good enough is not good enough disinvesting and wastewater is not acceptable but here it is in this LT paid this happening on your watch the sister legacy you want to leave to your kids you 're a must address this is the matter of conscience please please rethink these priorities and please please engage with communities a lot better and a lot earlier when you are defining your infrastructure strategies through the future they are not the responsibilities of staff alone or just you but all our responsibilities but you must give us the chance to contribute meaningfully that process for 2021 should start now with communities but in the meantime this LTP thank you thank you can I can I just start off with the 15 million dollar ch fund we 're about to state aid the front is still sitting here waiting to be used for long term projects that connect communities throughout the East but it 's not to be spent on projects which local authorities would otherwise and regional authorities would be expected to spend nyan so it 's not there to replace council budgets for the attacker sucker weigh-in or was it to the air to build foot bridges which would otherwise be the responsibility of this council I wasn 't suggesting what it should be carried on life it is near his accrued interest so could it be used for some of the transitional projects that you 're talking about there 's something certainly we 'll be discussing with with it can be earthquake appeal trust three regenerate Christchurch and particularly the interest there might be some capacity to do that there for sure and there 's certainly a need to access funding there but there 's also a need to talk to the to it 's a message we 're getting from many of their colleagues and other transitional community organisations they 're promoting transitional uses whether it 's in the red sari or whether it 's in the city that the message is that there 's no need for transitional more it 's all done and dusted that for the east that process is only the starting where five years behind the CBD the CBD still has need for transitional projects to make it activated that process only starting in the red zone and we need that beckon and net support from you and from regenerate Christchurch to make sure the philanthropic so also well aware of that they need to support those as a matter of priority right now yeah but I just I did want councillors because not all the counselors will be aware I mean Eastern vision of both the AVA note occurring network successfully negotiated with the was known as the prime minister 's fund for the 15 million dollars to be set aside for this very purpose so the question is is how can we unlock that and that I think it 's more to do with fast-tracking processes to pull compliance I think the funding from their aspect will flow there 's also a need this is not going to happen from one pot of money we 're all going to have to put money into the pot to make these things happen even as a transitional level whether it 's public funding through you guys regional councils Uhtred government whether it 's philanthropic so whether its private money all of them are gonna have to put money in the pot to make this happen well they does that 's absolutely true and there 's money that we have got on budget that will you know in terms of stop banks in terms of major cycle waiver instead of all of those things so they all come together but the question is is that you 're asking Council to set aside funding for projects to catalyze action and the redzone and all I 'm simply saying is that there is funding that you have access to that could assist with it as well yeah absolutely we don requires a partnership approach from all the agencies and from all the communities to work together to define what are the priorities the short term and in the long term and where do we drink that 's the limit of use respond resources we have got into that it 's about the communities themselves having a key say great yeah I was there yep okay okay right look thank you very much for your presentation yeah hard husband and appropriately so and look forward to working with you and a collaborative way thank you _"

    "text": "dad knee and both Samsung from the Avon Heathcott history huge hide I 'm the vice chair of the even has history a hoot I trust and this is Bill Simpson one of our board members we have a great relationship with both regional and city council that 's been addressing today and a special relationship with you guys and the regional council we 've got a memorandum of understanding about what the role that we partake in the care and the efforts that we can make in the you tie two wards it 's ecological management and conservation and preservation and we have advocated for the histories submission to long term plans that we continue funding from yourselves if that 's possible and that we have a valuable member of your council stuff and I think it 's a really good positive exchange of membership of the council and Trust Board and we also really appreciate the funding that Eric banks gives us and that communication sort of stream what 's happening with council matters and our interests in one of the big focuses of our trust is to and we 're in the throes of putting more final touches to that for the implementation but regarding submission on the long term plan and excuse my six eyes but I 've yet to receive my bifocals I need to just support some of the aspects of our submissions and one of the key features that I 'd like to talk about today which is sort of in a general way is the the need to keep pushing for management managing increases and improvements to wastewater and stormwater management and our submission has detailed that we 'd like to see clear targets for improving storm water quality and that these targets statements are phrased in such a way to be easily understood by the community we also submitted that sufficient resources provided for achieving the targets so there 's a lot of talk in the waste and stormwater management scheme of things to desirable achievements but there 's never any actual concrete sort of we 've got to try and achieve this so we really keep on trying to stop contaminants from getting into our rivers and our streams on long time we 're also very keen to include community water Partnership Program in the long term plan and we can 't see that it is in it at the moment we really really would advocate for that this might be a tool for addressing storm water issues and allocated to the program each year is the you spoke of the estuary in the new one of the new cycle ways we 've been collaborating and liaising with the forget the name of the organization but they 're the people that are charged with creating the cycleway Network for Christchurch and they 're really great it but I 'm forging ahead with that but one of the issues for the estuary that we hope to address and convince them of is that we mustn 't encroach into the history anymore our wading birds are losing their feeding habitat on a regular basis by small incremental we call it death by a thousand cuts and cycleway is gonna have a major impact on the estuary that humphreys drive area of it where there 's a whole hectare gonna be lost by extremely valuable Godwin 's feeding territory we 've put submissions to the group who constructing the cycle paths and said you haven 't got any matrices for the ecological impact of this cycle way at the s3 engineer and we would really recommend not only to them but even councils they push for an alternative which has all groups are happy with including forest and bird and this wind surf is another interesting community group that we put the cycleway either on the other side of the road and don 't require as much that the seawall does need to be repaired but we don 't need to encroach and we lose that one hectare of history bed which the braiding birds really rely on and we 've we 're really hoping that we can either go to the other side of the road or the track be put through charlesworth reserve decision be made on the eat so when we nurse sorry yeah there is yeah but the the purpose of the submission is to say that the process of asking for a environmental assessment to be done as the horse you know that an actual fact the environmental consent should be done first on the history side after full consultation and hearing people but without an environmental assessment no I mean going forward to eat the environment yes I just I think it 's around the wrong way you 've seen it and we 're fully aware of the concerns but it does seem to me that I mean the point of the submission which I 've read was that the environmental assessment should be done first just part of the matrix as part of the matrix for decision making yeah I think I agree with you yeah okay noises anyway as long as we 're because I think I think people don 't actually yeah but we want the cycle track not to encroach we 're just starting to try and get we 've signed international deals so we do need to stop and we 've been entering into international arrangements with both Korea and China so I mean the God works as soon as you said goblets you know you had me there so I don point is something yes the point is is that that the submitters have raised a very good point which is the process around environmental impact and the question that I think we need to be asking us should environmental impact analysis precede the process you know so and then inform the process orders that come afterwards through the resource consenting process and I have to say that I 'm beginning to favor the the proposed will put up by the submittals all the men that 's the position as you 've summed it up kappa force yeah getting good enthused yep sir so we choose the best site for somewhere and then we go on afterwards and go well what 's the impact of that site and then we decided on it and we do that with almost every project which is why I 've raised with the chief executive the need to review the content of reports because what we need to do is we need to completely understand what what the risks and opportunities are around all of our projects that would that would help us with good very good example of we would want to do that so thank you so has anyone got any questions got 43 seconds to go liens are happy represented on there so I just wander around the work that regenerated going to be doing on the are the East your agents and South Shore like do you have a preference like we some submitters tell us we would like to see a hard edge which we can you know concrete eyes or right around Mike or and the other option we hear better the sorry I 'm just wondering if your group has a preference ecologically it 's interesting I 'm wearing my history traveling south for residents association and obviously from history tress point of view we 're very concerned about the ecology of that whole history page even so particularly we do recognize their recreational and they see excess values might outweigh so-called ecological values but it 's a very limited to each other I sent about 200 meters or so to us vision is to make sure that the public in the community does have access to the actually a very balanced response and I appreciate that thank you all right well we shall move on and thank you very much for making your submission _"

    "text": "so could we invite some Peter Beck and Eastern vision to come forth I was going to say your grace but it 's here again well having said over there and but I 'm very much aware that I 've been away for two years but it 's not like what 's the hell 's he doing here then what does he know about what 's going on one of the things while I 've been in Taranaki is keeping a close eye on what 's happening here obviously and I still convene Eastern vision and most of your hope would know that Eastern visions been around about six years we linked with a concern at that time and we were particularly obviously as you see from the submission what we 're about in terms of eastern Christchurch but alongside that it was about Eastern crust but also about the processes by which decisions are being made and really working hard to get community engagement concerns long tagline that we used to use the wisdom of the local community always exceeds the knowledge of the expert so I expect you rewriting of it is that the wisdom of the community when combined with the knowledge of the experiment always produces more that one can produce without the other absolutely the issue is though of course is how do you engage and communicate with the community and the problem is and it seems to me it 's not it 's endemic somehow in in the culture not just to this council but of local government in general in terms of how that engagement happens or doesn 't happen and mostly it doesn 't work very well I certainly when I was on the council it didn 't work very well I 'm now I listened to Evan of course and we 're part of a team so this submission isn 't isn 't just mine it 's come from the people who are on the ground who are listening to the community who are entrenched and embedded within these communities around this I could know and trust that the reflections you 've got it are coming from people local people on the ground who too often feel actually they can 't feel heard even by you guys some of the time and there 's that one of the issues I think that we face that I want to pick in here is it does seem to be endemic Joce over here god bless him talked to me earlier about the way you could see it like would rather have the invitation to go to the bush to choose the tree to make the walker and then carve it together rather than simply being invited to the launch it feels a bit like in a sense despite all these submissions you 're getting fun of being invited to the launch here really a little bit of tweaking we can do here and there but actually the engagement with the local communities earlier in the piece it 's endemic you know I remember when I was earlier here going to meetings week you see committees that we had and I remember us in 2011-12 they produced a Q&A pamphlet with us we were told to have a look and I said well this is interesting where 'd you get these questions from our think about talking to people the people the local people about that I mean I think what we 're trying to say here is that we don 't seem to get it right anywhere not just I 'm not talking about just Christchurch but it seems to be entrenched in the culture of bureaucracies and in the petanque cultures of local government bureaucracies and government as well so it 's hard but surely we have got an opportunity in Christchurch where we can try and find ways of doing it better than we do just to be honest the feedback we get from the community is it is not working it tends to be the professionals the planners that others they take they have some conversation they produce the bluefin and then they take it to us as kind of a more or less completed document that 's what it feels like so in that LTP canoe engagement process you 're getting on page two particular with the LTP we 've just explained that it does seem a very inaccessible document and the feedback and the questions that you put you they 're not coming from the community so that 's part of that bit and I guess that 's an overall comment but it 's also saying I think we can do better hmm I would like us to do better I think we could say that you know I have to say that listening and seeing and looking at what regenerate had been doing with what 's going on that that feels like that processes work better actually so what can we learn from that what can we learn from that that 's coming up here the how the how team that 's been working as a result of Renu Brighton that their encouragement to do that has been working better there you do get feedback from people in the community it 's listening to people in the community not just their what they say their body language that the whole thing is they feel like there 's some engagement some excitement about what 's going on there there as we pick up very little excitement about engaging with this so I think we can do it better think about that and as we going into the trap the New Brighton regeneration scheme gosh I was part when I was on the council when the master plan went through and they 'll hold the hard work Glen that you and I put in to get that through there was a halt there was a whole little bit of me three attempts there was a whole bit of me that thought why are we doing this because there 's no money around it and and yet we 're doing this and he 's doing this mass but what we have and we 've got the master plan and it 's got some backing and there were severe amount of engagement on that one but now it 's it 's been put off and differnent will be on 2021 and the obvious comment which is explained in here is that that suburban master plan which is about the economic development of the business sector within new bride has to be as an integrated part of whatever developments are happening on that on a New Brighton on the shore they 're the whole development of that business community as well so we 're encouraging you to as it said that the provision for the implementation of the super master plan be moved back into the first year of the LTP for the reasons that we said they 're Southshore well the thing about the Southshore one is that we note that the regeneration strategy and the work towards that doesn 't seem to be linked in with the infrastructure strategy as though then one will play with the other it 's kind of like this infrastructure strategy which you pick now our what we suggest by the way in our submission we 've thought about that quite a bit is that there 's no reason why the infrastructure strategy should be started work on now rather than being put out until 2021 start on it now because it 's something many ways that infrastructure strategy has to embed with the with the with the with the consultation about the regeneration strategy because they feed each other if you 've got the infrastructure then that will decide what the regeneration could do come up with some better outcomes so that 's what we talked about encouraging there I think that 's probably for me it says the endorsement of a Verna tackler obviously our two organizations work very closely together completely this guy 's a gift from God I think what evan offers to our city is just extraordinary through all the time and a whole lot of of my work and my engagement is fortunately through evan and the other members of the eastern vision group and i also linked into Avon a target of some great people doing some great things pushing really hard but so often we feel like it 's push push push I feel for you guys Kansas because I think a lot of your life is push push push you know if that 's the nature of these organizations pushing out and also pushing with and often against your own your own staffing because that 's the nature of it but how that can change and work more cooperatively that 's what we 're on about and that 's what we want to encourage you to cause that column that I 've done this week you 'll know that I 've read your submission before I write the column so okay hi to both of you and thank you for coming just in terms of the recent announcement about the fact that you can have five years temporary use in the red zone have you guys got ideas that you want to put forward and what are they attack or submission about treatment style but yes the short answer is yes and there 's a lot of community organizations similarly preparing proposals right now and and how are you getting them through the process by which that happening is still being worked on as a work-in-progress and it 's we believe needs to be led by regenerate Christchurch on the basis of the agreed regeneration objectives for the corridor not on the basis of their management objectives they the land owners concerns need to be addressed but the main leader and that should be regenerate questions so that 's similar have you got an easy lease agreement and list of what you can do and what I think that still three months work in progress things have changed quite a bit dramatically on there in the last couple of weeks we 're still trying to work out what that means I think we 're all trying to do that agencies and communities alike so it 's very much work in progress but I think watch this space the next three to six months three to six months actually soon enough there 's still on the nature of consultation is it takes time how as you know but the other bit is the other great thing is that we 've got that I mean I think it 's fantastic this having the transition and that seems to me as there 's already things on the ground happening now and other things that are in the pipeline but there is a need to consult with local communities about what we want to do there it 's not just just plunk yourselves down with re it with no regard to the local communities and the people that already lived there we need to take them into account so there tracked as possible so we can get some really really when you say we are you working with regenerate on this we regenerate and with communities use I think you 'll see that there 's a degree of impatient sand it 'll be here to seven years to make this happen so impatience is very strong with us but we also have to make sure we do it right there has been examples where things have been rushed through in the past which are being counterproductive ecologically and we have to be very careful that we get it right but as quickly as possible I totally agree absolutely stakeholders and possible because I 'm sure you 're right well if it would have been easier if we transferred the speaking order so then we could have gone straight onto you even but if you could step back yeah yeah and then I 'd like to invite so thank you very much for your submission and I 'd like to invite

just about get on a plane to Coromandel Peninsula so there 's a whole introductory session there a section there about the context the Kashmir stream and their power Heath good catchment that it flows into I 've talked to this room before about the Kashmir stream and the challenges it faces so I won 't labor the point I will quickly go through and the our submission up to the summary and just emphasize some points particularly on the first page the bolded sections there soak input must be a permitted activity I think harvesting particular on the port hills needs to be more controlled and regulated a lot of the consents that those companies were working under were non notified and I think I could put up a whole lot series of really nasty photos of the results of that so hopefully don 't need to labour that point going through to page three I think I 'd emphasize that the rivers streams and remaining wetlands of Christchurch and banks benancio are a large natural asset then unfortunately has been currently eroded by the business-as-usual devoting the pro development approach of Canterbury take that as you may and I 'd like to well the thrust of our submission is that those natural assets need to be afforded some protection and odd-odd suggest investment over and above what 's him [Music] acknowledging the stuff the good stuff that is happening we 've had a lot of good collaborative work with city council engineers and ecologists and the Kashmere stream headwaters which would like to acknowledge the the community water partnership we 've been recipients of funding from that and I think the return on get to see in the headwaters of the Kashmir stream so welcome page four I think I 'd sort of emphasize that the community can help ID place identify places where you could focus some rehabilitation if it these are large things that large number of things and places that need fixing in Christchurch and banks manchala if you talk to the community they can help you focus on some key areas that you could do some targeted intervention that are a bit more durable than just you know fixing everything page five the Sutherlands Road sort of eastman Westlands and innocent valley proposed wetland and base and retention stuff we got the impression that that 's actually being deferred so whereas that is could be a major improvement and things so we 'd like to see that forward or semi supported coming through to the flood protection and dredging we acknowledge that crotchet Christchurch is a low-lying City and a lot of people 's houses seem to get flooded and more appear to be flooded would like to more innovative ways of dredging be thought about and retaining the earth all the trees large trees go etcetera and I 'm sure there must be better alternative methods that could retain some of that biodiversity which we 're very short on so the models that are used to direct where that dredging happens we 'd like to see the benefit of that show from the models that these are the best places to open up to increase reduce flooding or a cruise flow then we 'd like to see there and actually that actually could have some biological benefits as well waste water a whole series of points on waste water didn 't see a lot of real improvement in in long term plan seems to be again a lot of permitted discharges of wastewater drinks high rainfall events which are only gonna become worse with climate change so we 'd like to see some some acknowledgment of dad or at least sort of attempts to reduce it so the yeah coming the water quality waterway ecology and water quality improvement fund page seven with that seems to be being dialed back in in preference for investing in horizontal infrastructure that those would have returned a lot of return on are being taken away and invested in the built infrastructure which we don 't think is as good a spin so coming ok through to the summary so just in general things the collaboration is a whole collaboration theme there that we talked about I 'd also add to the ones that are there there 's our in our engagements with the council it 's very hard we 'll have very good engagement with one arm of the council but that arm of the council can 't actually help us talk to the other arms of the council so these I 'd call them silos and we 've emphasized and we 're actually part of a power Howe Heath good River Network group which is I think is talking later in the week we 've found it really hard to to get a two-way communication going but you the council come and talk comes and talks to us when they need to to stakeholder engagement over a Pacific project but an open and full dialogue doesn 't seem to happen but and they might have the same issues the water partnership again with we like we that 's actually we think has could deliver a lot more than what it is so we don 't want to see that dialed back storm water and flooding I think the emphasis on the in-stream resources the rivers and streams there 's a whole resource and asset beer it 's not just about people 's they assets the bulk assets around them you need to to retain and build the asset that 's in the streams rivers and the remaining wetlands so just a maybe a little bit of a refocus or at least a look in strength talk me through I 've talked about the wastewater discharges yeah I 've talked about their to Paxton heritage the power he 's good there was a linear park plan which had a lot of potential and I don 't know what 's happened to that it seems to have fallen off the radar so again building up the community 's expectations perhaps about issue while I 'm on that the redzone what is the it the way that 's landed it might be really two reasons why it was wound back to just a bare minimum but it 's pretty much where they you can build on because of the substance risk so the opportunity there for a large wetland and preps of building resilience has just been I don 't know it 's the it 's the given so the green spines the given and there 's still work to do on the other areas so regenerate Christchurch you 'll be holding a an exhibition starting I think June main I can do main thank you for that in tonight there 's from the outside no no the green spine is the given and it 's what happens to the rest but I I think large wetlands and that Horseshoe Lake areas a real plus yeah it 's got lots of benefits in terms of resilience for climate change etc so this again the full benefits of it I mean it 's been put up as a pair sort of thing it 's actually gonna could actually serve flooding amelioration all sorts of wetland options we need to know exactly what we 're dismissing so I don 't know how well it 's been costed thank you for the reference but you want to finish oh well I 'm an orang counselors because they here like it so I 'm told not to do this well the presentations are going on so yeah just sort of emphasizing that you know Christchurch and banks much we have a large set of natural freshwater assets and that investing and protecting and enhancing them will actually return a lot more value than just as parks and that that needs to have equal weighting or at least some waiting when you you do your math the yeah so that costing needs to happen so that the Garden City still looks you know I 've got some issues with a garden monoculture but anyway you 're on all finished very good well I 've just been sent a very handy email from somebody who 's been listening in from outside here saying the red zone futures exhibition will run from Saturday the 26th of May to Saturday the so there was a reduction I don 't know where it ended up but just certainly there 's a maybe of inferred too much when reading the plan but this seems to be sort of delaying them spending I mean it 's quite subtle there 's a delay of spend on environmental stuff and in an up and spending on built infrastructure so again I haven 't gone through it 's really highly to to work out where that money will be invested or not okay and the other thing you mentioned the community water part and the ship find what she hasn 't got going you can I think you might be confusing it with the flysheet we smelled in the zoning committee biodiversity thank you for that submission you referred to the riparian planting for shade protection purposes along the streams that 's on your page age and just so that in fact we 've growths reduced and the beach cleaning costs for council reduced to yeah so I 'm just wondering if you could perhaps expend on that as to what sort of scope that might be of that riparian planting or appearing planting sort of program and I guess for me the upper Heathkit springs to mind probably as well as the quiche ministry would reduce the growth of the macro fights the exotic macro fights have really do really well on high light conditions that 's what they 're adapted for so if you can put the shader and you 'll actually encourage other competing perhaps indigenous Mecca fights and to take some of that space so you 've locked yourself into a into a clearing exotic macro flights do really well in a like a week colonist thing when there 's equally spaced I 'll just go like nuts and fill it all up and because you go through and cut them all out there have been any native indigenous macro fights that could compete with them actually nailed so you 've you 've created a situation with those exotic macro fights would highlight will go do really well so if you can shave them out you can alter that balance so yeah I think it 's um it 's to get tall trees and the lower river as well right well up thinking very much much appreciated but except and I hope I 've given you some good news excellent okay _"

    "text": "gonna have to beat a bit jump no pressure no I 'm actually not gonna do there anymore because it 's distracting to our visitors you see come wait to these made us some presentation thank you Jim right thank you I 've got Andrew Washington with me senior investment adviser he knows the detail because he 's got money so I 'm just going to congratulate you on the work you 've done to date with your transport planning we appreciate that you 're under difficult fiscal pressures and trying to balance rates with all your other priorities including transports not easy I guess since you did your long-term plan and you know we 've written this letter two things have happened one the draft policy statement from the government 's come out which signals quite a significant shift in terms of how we all are being challenged to think about transport and I think from a council perspective you 're probably very comfortable with it because it 's actually taking a broader systems view than the state highway efficiency perspective and all the activity classes are going up order to balance the up on the other side but critically for the region an opportunity for the city is the the rapid transport activity class and also transitional rail and I think the extra amount of money in public transport as well is going to be of assistance then the critical thing here is there we 've suggested in our written submission there 's a couple of priorities that you 've a couple of bus priorities that you 've moved out Gilmore Street Salisbury Street we 're in Lincoln Road and we 've asked if you could potentially bring them forward you may not be in a position to do that in the next couple of months but if we keep working with you and the government has signaled GPS to which will be more of a fundamental look but there 's also the opportunity to vary the regional transport plan with the support of partners and you sit around the Greater Christ huge public transport committee they 've got to do a PT 's futures piece of work and then drop that down into the network so it leader might be best addressed through that forum and the broader context of what do we really need to do to turn on buses and get more people on them which is more than just the infrastructure it 's also a hole in the system so having said that we support the work you 're doing around accessible city that is part of the system 's change and it 's also totally consistent with the GPS which is genuinely asking us is transport people to give each of the modes of fair choice which means walking cycling buses using a vehicle using trains at coastal shipping at central mode neutral planning is the jargon words that are used but it does mean we need to respond to that accessible City does have a hierarchy in it it does have the walkways it does have the cycleways it doesn 't the public transport vehicles because it is different for a lot of people to make genuine choice and there 's something you may want to look at I think you 've got one and a half staff members committed to it cycling and bus transport and so on we know from work that 's been done with various businesses and moving back into the CBD that if genuine travel planning including identifying cycling walking bus the opportunities is put in then you can get 20 to 30 percent shift in behavior which means that 's a lot less people in cars which means you know the infrastructure money can go somewhere else so we support you in your endeavors and I just look forward to working with you further in those areas there 's a very strong emphasis on safety under the new government policy statement then you might want to comment but my understanding is your plan already has a pretty fair emphasis when you 're transporting programs for safety so that 's that 's really good and the other one that we 've raised is it gets better joining up with major transport training produces ie education and I guess you could put DHB in there as well because schools have intrigued me they 've tended to be a solo operated without reference to us we 've been building your staff and high school primary school which is linked to cycleways and no excuse because that 's just officer time in my time and time so so to sum up we support Union difference we know money 's tight we think there 's more opportunities there we 've got to make sure Christchurch in the south is their fair share of that that rapid transit activity class as I hear it is the first decade walking gets the first slice then pretty good good well Vicky Yanni cleaning Dion so Mike great to see the innovation unit it is it ta and some of the intriguing things that they 're doing I 'm assuming that whole different approach will apply to the whole organization so just in terms of couple of things demand management we 're actually funding that from the Innovation Fund at the moment but I 'm as will you guys be funding any of their would look to co-found their investment with the appropriate business case to support their investment yes so if we 're putting some in you 'd look to co-funding yes absolutely there just needs to be completed and we would look to Kofun what 's been proposed within that investment proposal cool and the enhanced usage the speed limits on what were rural roads that but it now become urban roads I 'm assuming it 's going to be much easier to get that past the entity a in terms of reducing those speed limits as we sit here today the system for all sitting hadn 't_``_429.7 changed it is on the agenda of the associate minister transport on our agenda to simplify that process because it requires two or three steps and two or three rounds of consultation do you have a sense of when work that will become easier and will it be easier also to have 30 K zones within residential areas in Rapid Transit for Christchurch is this such a thing yes there is in the public transport futures which is going through that you can move around on the ability to move people sorry who was next Yanni thank you the NZTA Ministry of Education you say you 'd welcome the development of improvement of the transport for that or are you have you now got the ability to actually take a much more holistic approach with the Minister of Ed and get get it funded through central government I think there 's two things you know there 's the planning side which is when schools are going rebuilt or you know joined together then you know thinking from day one about how the pupil is going to get there is great and the neighbor works the flow through two funding opportunities through the various activity classes walking cycling I just I guess if it was a private business being set up as a private development they would have to fund the the traffic improvements and some you know significant way internally based on whatever consent because its ministry they seem to just have designations where they 're not required to have any commitment to us it 's a fair question I do recall the rates inquire into local government some years ago which had sixty nine recommendations and one of which was their public institutions we 're just gonna run out of time so let 's 's our spokesperson he 's our Regional Transport three so I will come back to you then for God 's sake grow up snakes are really really good and always go nice about the management 's been looking through you you 've been around that this cycle way and it 's quite a very diplomatic response there I would I have read through that actually that you 'd probably think it 's a good idea for the council not to defer this cycle way forward and I guess with the opportunity of potentially more money through the GPS on the table can be tweaked together to see if we can assist this way it also there 's always an opportunity for what 's called front-loading we 're you know give you a higher farm now and take it off you later on and your general manager Dave Anderson 's run me about that so we 're open to a conversation well I think there 's some important conversations moving forward specially if we want to go with the direction that the government is sickling and obviously although your contribution is contribution forward as well but I 'm also hearing that you were open for the discussion about light rail as well well light rail is in the context of the broader public transport system what I 'm expecting there 's a non-voting member of that public transport committee is a report which identifies those opportunities and fairly puts forward the case one way or the other all right clean thank you in terms of the green spine which region has announced gym and activating that and the other things you 've said in relation to the schools and safety etc the NZ Drive bridge presented is a bit of an issue and I just wonder what the status is with NZTA over there particularly the access under the bridge which is now not safe for this is relevant to our long-term plan for what reason for delivering the Aven or tackle or cycleway the green spine and our mutual objectives with region I know the bridge approaches are damaged yeah in terms of our time frame for replacing it and possibly realigning what we 're doing something else with it underpass is half submerged so I wonder what you also usable mean I 'll come back to you and I can find out just looking at the road we have a situation where we 've got community boards that are supportive of this in community boards were not to do and the reason I 'm not supporter will destroy the Eddington community going through the what reassurance can you give us they won 't happen I mean it 's not state highway that 's part of the submission though yeah so with the exception of the timing of yeah that he would like to consider we would because we would like CCD to consider bringing this project it 's not a for loaning proposal so essentially that would be a council lead project still the reason we 're looking for it to be bringing forward is to support the public transport operation within Greater Christchurch and also the fact that halls were was one of the record growing communities of of Christchurch and to support that growth we need the public transport facilities in place before the growth occurs to follow standard council procedures and processes to come up with the optimal design that is a ultimately endorsed by community boards prior to any sort of construction but this is the public transport project that you 're referring to not the the Lincoln Road widening which has a component of one of the lanes is going to be tuned into a bus priority lane he 's great no Eddington village doesn 't get widened no that 's right yester Lane was for a bus there might be other ways of doing without widening the road we will be discussing it as part of the LTP I am confused because as I understand it there is no four linings between between white Li and Morehouse so yeah butBut and I understood that the four laning was to enable the bus priority lane to go on so you get two white leave yeah and there 's absolutely no discussion or planning on what happens from white Li Barrington to Morehouse air and dead is the issue because white Li Barrington Lincoln is already gridlocked so if you get a four lane from right up to white Li air Barrington Lincoln Road you are just getting more vehicles to the same gridlocked spot rights road is the racecourse now sorry to like what what the f sorry what David an able them to come down and then drop in in front of that traffic so it 's not for anyway relief of the congestion of the traffic it 's actually for congestion of the bus which we hope will encourage people to get out of their car and into the bus because that becomes I can bike faster than I can then I can actually bus from wall to wall at the moment so so it 's a moment it 's it 's only for the buses it 's not for to publicize correct okay so okay well I need to I need to move I just got me the spray tan Kashmir community board just remind people we said they were quite fine with having a bus lane in the as part of the transport system well it 's they did say they 're opposed to widening of the road but clearly and keep the vehicle traffic moving right so we need to understand it because I mean yeah yeah but we haven 't actually made the decision to widen Lincoln Road hey boy yes but it 's not eight million dollars it 's not eight million dollars if you have to put on a bus lane so in the factors is that we have to put a bus lane on Lincoln Road if we don 't then buses will get trapped as they do now you 've started a mess approach um and this is all your fault Aaron Aaron yeah so just around your puppetry because no one else has turned up it 's just around infrastructure but infrastructure doesn 't seem to get more people on buses than I do note we neither the school holidays are on we don 't have any traffic issues in fact if no one was driven to school we would have by ourselves 30 to 50 years of traffic engineering so have we considered a program where children all school-aged children in high school go to school free on the bus or even there 's update has that been a consideration different muscles are already there it 's just a real difference is the loss of revenue from the few kids that do catch the bus but you know if we win out hardcore to all our children in Christchurch and see it hey do you want to catch the bus for a tomb it 's going to be free and just see how it goes and then I mean it could become the national model but a lot of countries do it and it works really well we just for some reason haven 't tried it I 'm just gonna take one more question Dion cuz I did have a question before but I thought was gonna get stopped my questions around the infrastructure that you 're saying would be about 50 million and 45 million each year as many the ins eta is through partnership funding in Christchurch obviously I mean a lot of what you 're saying is yes we 're gonna get people out of cars and you know that frees up congestion but actually the question I have the road and the actual infrastructure and in Christchurch the unique situation that we 've got with the amount of heavy vehicles on the road so it 's not actually the cars that are causing most of the damage it 's you see a road laid and then you know truck has done a u-turn out of a sort of thing where it 's had you know construction material or demolition material and it 's ripping these roads up and you know record time is there any conversation that can be had within ZTA around increasing the road smoothing budget so that we can actually start sort of looking at this you know increased damage that we 're having on our infrastructure so that we can actually sort of have smooth roads and actually do all this other stuff as well because is one of the biggest things that people are talking to us about and it is one of our biggest problems that we 're trying to fix in the funding gap well the level of maintenance money is an ongoing discussion between ourselves in your staff it 's the pressures that are on it and it 's based around the cost of fixing it and you know the amount of money that you need is taken into account with what we assign to you so we should be reflecting that what I would say is that in terms of smooth travel exposure price which used to have the smoothest urban roads in the country well ahead of anyone else for various reasons we don 't need to go into here the level that we would fund you to is based on the average so that would be less a standard than you used to have but ahead of where many of your roads are today and your improvement program in your maintenance program as I understand it reflects that side from now our budget yeah I mean because the reality is that we 're only Reis moving to us in development roads in a given year and they wrote smoothing last maybe 15 years or whatever and actually we were expecting that road to last 50 years if we 're going to have a 2% rotation so I that problem out because the increase of heavy vehicles which is you know a result of the earthquake is actually having an in proportion t amount of you know wear and tear on the roads is what you would normally get out of it as in a normal open environment and I think we actually need to really sort of nail that down and actually look at it and actually sort of send a signal to our communities to say look we 're getting on top of this and we 're going to sort it out should have taken those factors I can confirm you 're going to be communicated from our chief executive this week the numbers for your continuous program and the operation maintenance per space and it has increased significantly over your last three years as a result of the good work that your staff have done in that space and there 's also an opportunity to unlock further money from NZTA but there are some conditions that go with that money and when we 're working on putting a plan in place to undertake that to look thank you very much for this it 's right like it 's more okay look thank you very much we 're only one minute over the scheduled time for our break so if we could be back here I 'll just take a 15-minute break and be back here it just

    "text": "can we move on to Mike button from the Christchurch Botanic Gardens trust afternoon good afternoon thank you for for hearing myself and my fellow trustee Allen move on page one three five everyone yeah sorry because we 're out of order now so I 'm just telling people your submission is on page 135 oh good good should I wait till everyone 's ready no no they 're already okay I shouldn 't everyone 's read the submission that we 've put in yep good in that case I won 't bother reading it for Batum because you already know it but the two points that we really like to highlight this afternoon we very much support the City Council and as you know we signed a Memorandum of Understanding and in 15 August 15 but from the trust point of view we have a almost like a catch-22 situation where prioritizing of the significant lieutenant garden projects and programs identified in the spatial plan and development of the cost process and concept drawings doesn 't actually happen in practice to date prioritization indicative of cost in concept development gardens have not occurred so we are we are we are as I said before catch-22 we really can 't go to potential investors and donors in any project because first thing people say is what 's it going to look like and without having a Content plan we can 't show them well just just briefly we the trust was formed three plus years ago and we went through all the various some housekeeping matters and registered with the Charities Commission and we picked as Alan said two years ago natella observatory as a project that we thought we would like to do because we want to test our systems and we thought it would be a simple low-cost project it 's it 's not simple it 's still probably low cost as Ellen 's indicated but it 's frustrating at times because we 've got this catch-22 the reality is that we 're told that the final torrents of public consultation can 't_''_257.44 be done at all those the monies raised and this is maybe 200,000 we can 't sort of the donors and they 'll say what money this time we 'll find out what it looks like in detail this provision does make sense when it 's council money being allocated okay with the legislature then we 'll go through the process of getting it and all that stuff it doesn 't work really well when the money 's coming from outside because it 's we can 't get the money really and told me we have a finished product that we can say so I 'm just wondering whether we could get somebody to here but look at this know that well is the holdup the the Heritage status of the building it seems to be the look like an entrance at the moment it 's got a it 's actually just that it 's a it was just a yeah it 's brutal cut a door which only scrapes enters being a wheelchair access with we 've got 20 people in there then they 're gonna be kind of trapped under a one-way door so really does need sorting but let me just go back a bit I started with on this one of said that 's one thing the friend I can do we can form a trust and so it 's morally arm 's length from the City Council we had the first job that came along if you like this that we was the gunrunner garden which was a really exciting thing that was happening at that time and having trouble writing the brief so we got together the friends organized a workshop to talk people around the country together the geologists the archaeologists the well the whole bunch of people from Wellington Auckland Dunedin we had several universities involved Lincoln Canterbury Otago and genius science we had a great day bad storm yet we came away with what was a we thought was a very good brief I mean that the council accepted that the officers but went away and then nothing nothing happened you know a year later what 's happening nothing oh that design has been taken often given something else to do how can we roll on then became be the earthquakes and so everything stopped for a while then we with the with the new building clamoring for the pedestrian bridge being what I want where 's the bridge we talked to the architects and they said yeah we want we 'd love to design the bridge will do it partly by Bona go back we have to say to them look we can 't instruct you we don 't want to hold the contract for this and so we came to the council and said would you instructed no we can 't use those people because it 's a different project and we have to Riera ties for design interest and all that stuff so there was the people who really knew the building user site and that at the same time they said we really need to do this spatial plan so we can work out with circulation from the Newbridge they took me unified the people to do it it took a year to do it and the year to get sort of approval that 's three years where everything just froze can 't_''_502.52 do anything but we didn 't pick up this magnetic survey building in the meantime so this is ten grumpy and so we 've got to say if we 're not asking for money funding for decisions and people tenet Gardens sheet it 's a sheet but it 's got this amazing history to do with in fact we have intact people used to go there to get their instruments aligned before they went down to Antarctica you haven 't got a Fritton for life now she 's she 's gonna vote for anything that you want a for that I 've just given to the councillor is something we just had printed that we 're going to send to all the Antarctic societies throughout the world for this project we 've managed to obtain Margaret Austin to become a patron and Margaret is a fantastic lady she has been I was so helpful to us and she 's saying things that trust meetings like why don 't we talk to the German ambassador we actually don 't know him I do I 'll go and talk to him okay so she 's a breath of fresh air so that 's I should have brought more more copies but so Lee and I 'm just wondering if to sort of resolve some of us in fact if the Botanic Gardens trust people might come and talk even informally to air committee yeah so we actually have some further discussion yes we 'd love to do I think I think a workshop and and you get appropriate staff from the room yeah just just not about it 's not an it 's not insurmountable it 's just no no it was great yeah I mean the the thing is is that this project here the magnetic observatory it just sort of it 's the Antarctic story I mean it was a whole what was that was that somebody who came and talked on it it was a yeah it was yeah so so this it 's a big part of our story as a city so that 's actually really important they could almost get it to strategic capability on that basis I mean not strategic capability to innovation and sustainability well no because it 's the basic strategy but and it 's tomorrow so why don 't you take you what if he doesn 't solve it then feel free to come to me thank you very much all right thank you very much indeed I think I think you 've made made more than your point and hopefully action will follow thank you very much for what you 're doing thank you very much thank you no Jim Harmon you don 't look like Kirsten dangle come forward gender script green hawk it 's got a fantastic story that we 've got to tell ya okay thank you _"

to the submission I need to say there is a disability community we have worked hard with the City Council for the last seven years and we look forward to that continuing we look forward to Christchurch being a really accessible City we 'd used to talk about the most successful city I hope we get there and I hope that our contribution helps I 'm on the but I look forward to lots of good things happening I know we have the accessibility chatter and I know that I 'm is gonna be talking about some modes that we 're not so so yeah it 's a big speak for us but we look forward to continue interweave with the council thank you thank you opportunity to speak today as you 'll see a submission focuses on accessibility and applying an accessible Ling aleene 's along with long term plan well this focus is that until disabled people continually access places and spaces community inclusion participation in social connectedness cannot truly occur we 're extremely proud of launching the accessibility chatter and Canterbury and collaboration with Barry free New Zealand trusted in 2017 and it 's related to obviously the very pleased at the Christchurch City Council became a signatory of the traitor along with other key regeneration agencies given this commitment by the council in attack adored to the Charter the announcement on Friday regarding the Metro sports facility did come as a surprise it also requires us to make an amendment to our submission on the long term plan it was announced on Friday that the Aquatic sensory experience a water-based recreational opportunity designed for disabled people who have significant needs must source its own external funding for foot out as highlighted in the council commission feasibility study the addition of the sensory experience within a major recreation centre as a powerful signal of inclusion and integration however by applying a different funding model to the sensory experience suggests that recreational opportunities for disabled people are not valued on an equal basis aquatic sensory experience being asked to source external funding for its foot out we know other water-based components are being asked to do the same the council 's long-term plan 2018 28 outlines and additional four new aquatic facilities Lynwood horn being bright and hot pools in Metro on top of the current for indoor and another for outdoor aquatic opportunities bringing the total to 12 facilities however only one of these facilities includes a space designed specifically for disabled people with complex needs the long-term plan is allocated 221 million dollars to either new or upgrading existing aquatic facilities over the next ten years the ADL G would like to add to our submission the recommendation that council finds the funding to fill out the sensory experience and put value back into aquatic recreational experiences for disabled people while the aquatic sensory experience as designed with the disabled community in mind it also gives the general public the opportunity to experience the innovative way of entering didn 't with water as the aquatic sensory experience is a great initiative everyone we 'd like to see it receive funding in I was just about to see Marianne email saying um how much was the cost of that because the the decision that was made on on Friday was was that the government was prepared to obviously work with the amount of money that we could pull out off the out of the budget for it so the decision could be made to proceed the advice that we had from staff was that they 're 100% confident of giving support for the provision of these the sector is not then left to get there on their own so where the money comes from for it whether it comes from the rate paying base or whether it comes from sponsorship or external support that is something that that we 're taking on board and so your submission is very timely indeed but it doesn 't you know I want to reiterate there is no intention of leaving it to the sector to do that and at the end of the day it 's going to have to come back to us if we don 't achieve what we achieve but we weren of just giving the movement that we needed to get moving on the on the center so and and I mean councillors wouldn 't have been over the detail of this at all so your submission would have been used everyone around the table except for those of us who were actually announcement because we had a spokesperson from the disabled sporting organization who acknowledged that that was the case and was very confident also that the funding would be there so that 's it 's it 's not an intention to leave out it 's an intention to change the way we fund that component of it and we did actually think it was the easiest thing to fundraise for long-term well that 's it for one it 's the PR of it you 've chosen one thing designed specifically for people with high needs that 's why it 's the easiest thing to fundraise we can 't actually we can 't fund for so Aaron yes so thank you for bringing that to our attention and I I don 't like it feels like a bit of labeling ago when we had share an idea this everyone in the city was invited to dream at the city we could have can you give us a rating on we you think disability people sitting there sitting now and how they feel about the city that 's being delivered I think it 's a five or six out of ten because we haven 't got consistency we never the building code is out of date but we 're not I think this study council oh one big but I think the counts always been has been fantastic it working with us in terms of accessibility of chatter and in terms of of people getting behind these are shoes but I think that the the result is still really is it in terms of an accessible city so the intent is there some of the structures are updated in what I 'm seeing is the disabled person is no it 's not completely accessible so and I don 't want this city built for me I 'm 50 now I think I 'm young I 'm so Dancing with the Stars want to see I want to see the city accessible because I want to work in it I want to pay rates I want to contribute when you have a council that prides itself on creating equity for everyone was still got a we way to go and I think I think that accessibility was seen is quite you know it wasn 't deemed as just for disabled people like it was seen there 's my vote around the city for buses you know so the accessibility you know plan turned into a bus strategy public transport strategy so I think we really need to be careful in clear about what we mean about accessible Yani thank you I 'm just I guess just to reassure you that the limited Wilson pole design hasn 't been developed yet but that community board they 've got the delegation that are very keen to make sure that it is completely accessible for all very afraid so we really really aware of that just the the other the two other things in your submission one you 've touched on one major facility but you had involvement do you have any concerns sorry No with the library or the Town Hall the library did come and present to our network and assume the last year and I don 't know if they were completely confident on the understanding of accessibility either and we did have a few issues around employment and things like that I have personally done a tour of the town hall but otherwise haven 't_''_663.95 been involved with the design process is there anything short-term that I mean I don 't know just what they 're shown to open these two new facilities shortly and not have you you know not have them as accessible as possible we do have an advisory group that provides advice so I just I 'm just a little unclear as to the difference sorry I 'm just did a little bit of a loss as its I understand that there has been technical advice very free yeah yeah just cheering it 's gonna look like I think to the sector before facilities open would be great to give them assurances of what they can expect talked about shared pathway has been you some written submission but you didn 't really go into it much and you 're very bonus give us a quick snapshot of you think we have we have been involved in submissions on a lot of accessible city transport projects and footpaths and cycleways we absolutely advocate for separated cycleways in the city the the problem with the shared pathway particularly when you have disabled people with low vision or a vision impaired it 's it 's really hard to navigate do you know you 're you you think you 're in a safe place by being on a footpath that has in Europe you you have certain expectations when travelling along most of us you get into a shared space we 're then you 've also got cyclists to compete with and there 's still not clear etiquette on how to use those and I 've talked a lot in the transport liaison group about some education programs on how people use cycle ways and how people use shared pass I think one of our biggest areas of concern is where and there are a few of those popping up I think there 's gonna be I think that in front of the parents as well and there 's gonna be so around the Convention Center that is a real concern on how people utilize those spaces because if you have someone with a vision impairment who thinks they 're sleeping you know if they are still on the footpath and they 're in the middle of the road how are they going to know that we recently also did a submission on here for the street and there are some crossings but no signalized crossings and halfway along the blocks so how do people use that how do people know wind across safely and how do people know how to interact together and I just don 't think we have that yet well I think one of the things that has been done and a positive note is the removal of the free live tunes and the replacement with with with the signalized crossings so with the free live tunes that 's exactly where you say you don 't know good thank you thank you very much for coming on and you know we 'll certainly follow up on that data issue I think that yeah releasing the barrier free advice I think would be I don 't see that there 's a problem with that so and if that would give reassurance to the sector then I 'm all for that group of people a lot of those people want me to communicate right yeah so I 'm just a we 're the day so the most marginalized community that may not have their voice food I mean I can get my belief Allah to really clearly but that community can 't_''_910.819 so I just ask you to think I 'm considered it that 's lovely thank you thank you very much thank you um I don 't it 's Kirsten Dingle here you know _"

    "text": "Torstensson from social equity and well-being network welcome but please don 't let stand in the way of knowing that design really values and acknowledges the amazing you 're doing as a council to restore well-being to our communities and to our city I 've once again presented oh I get down too gritty when we look at the long term plan and it 's the budget lines for the not-for-profit grants and once again I 'm really disappointed and and as our our members to see that there 's a differential between the way that economic development is being treated in the way that social development is being treated economic development over the 10 years of the plane shows a gradual increase and the percentage of the funds whereas if we take it from this year 's finalists financial year 's budget than the strengthen communities grants have declined over the life the budget by nearly 12% that sends the message to our sector that social well-being is not valued as greatly as economic well-being whereas we would argue that each are equally important the city we can 't a healthy community in a healthy society we 're not going to have a healthy economy and think you know if we can 't address the issues that we have in our communities that can be a drain on our economy I also said it really high to follow you know I felt like I needed a kind of a master 's degree in an accountancy to be able to follow the budget lines when I tracked them back to previous reports that the numbers seemed to change and I didn 't know why what was being taken to account and what wasn 't for instance you know there was nearly a million dollars removed from the strengthening families and communities grants this year to be put into the community resilience partnership fund which I understand is a time-limited fund but I can 't see any way where it 's coming back into the budget line once that fund closes and that makes it really hard to kind of understand we 're not for profit sector funding is being moved from them to and whether it is actually increasing or up if we could get some kind of more clarity around the way that the budget line is put together and what it consists off that would be really helpful for us in the sector yeah basically it 's my request to you today you know we hear often from the council about how much you do value the sector there 's a statement of intent for your relationship with the sector which would be really great to revisit by the way it sometimes that says how you 'd like to work whether it 's in an open and transparent way present the funding isn 't feeling transparent so if we could clarify that I 'd really like to see that happen and happy to work with with the team if we can well I 'm happy to kind of kick off because one of the things that we commenced and the previous council which we 've picked up now and and brands to reinstituted as the in I can 't remember the name of it the funding funding funding review working group yeah so which is a working group at the methodology for funding community groups and the desire seasoning on my part and it 's been the driver for me to move to a more partnership approach so that it 's not just here are some money you give us a report and tell us what you 've done but what can we do collaboratively and partnership together and could we achieve much more and the million dollar transfer to a fund that are specifically designed to build connected communities and are designed specifically around projects that actually I think the vast majority of them were already funded through strengthening communities so but that 's a different model it 's brought in a million dollars from central government as a matching fund around community well-being in resilience so I think we 're we 're on a bit of a journey at the moment but I think the challenge that you 've just put to us as can can you be engaged in that process as we develop the model because I 'd always intended that it would go out for public engagement but perhaps the model perhaps you that and that working group as an external reference point and and I would be really happy for that to happen if if you felt that that would be helpful from the disability sector nothing about us without us really good we wouldn 't we wouldn 't implement it with that but it 's it 's just to try and get a handle on the scale of it because one thing that I wouldn 't agree with in terms of your submission as that is that we only spend what we give to community groups on on social well-being because that isn 't true every community facility every asset that we you know our parks our rivers and the commitment that we make to keeping them sort of worthy of the Garden City status they 're all about social well-being so an environmental well-being so that what I do agree with entirely is that there or as we connected yes sorry so Glen thank you submission Sharon could I just ask you with what you 're saying is really like a reduction in the strength in Committee 's funding we resilience for me but anyway but I 've brought in an extra million dollars yes but I just wondered it overall for you 're really saying for a number of years there has been a decline and so I 'm what I 'm interested knowing is are there any significant and important NGOs which in fact um you know have struggled to the point in fact we may even be losing them is the situation is serious as they 're and wonder if you could tell us about their I 'm aware that most survivors of sexual abuse has now combined with means Center and and part that was brought about because of the challenges and funding I 'm hearing from all around the sector at present that people are finding it really had I am aware of other groups of close this year or late last year I 'm sorry I can 't bring them to mine because I 'm old and my brain leaks that 's definitely there have been a number of closures in the last probably 12 months yeah clean HD you personally Sharon thanks for mean you 've got fast experience in history with putting it across the I 'm just thinking in your submission you talked about and you 've just said it today continuing to treat economic development more favorably there for well beings of being written and produced so you know is that a reference point that you would I think this council is always done really well that even though from you know for a while those for well beings were taken out of the egg that you 've still honored those for well beings and when I 've done the comparisons what I 've compared is the brands to what is now what 's Accord it used to be Christchurch in Canberra tourism across New Jersey yeah yeah yeah thank you so that 's the funding that you 're giving to that organization to carry out your Economic Development Program and the funding that you 're giving to the not-for-profit sector for its contribution to community well-being and that 's where the two discrepancies are and those two budget lines syrup yonni you 've just been reference you 've mentioned in terms of you 've talked about the operational funding but in terms of the big picture in terms of things like the Community House where a number of these community groups are based I think you 've referenced some that are struggling how sustainable do you think that model is going forward in the current situation and do you think council should be considering any sort of capital expenditure around a new community house in the central city to try alleviate some of those yani I do know that at present a number of groups finding of lost evil inside of community house at present because they weren 't able to meet the rent which you know even though it was subsidized by a community house itself they 've been several groups go to the Philips Town hub which at present can offer extremely no possibly even free I 'm not sure but this is only for a limited term so the rather concerned about what will happen when Philips town have been has to start increasingly rents again in a couple of years what would happen to those on rent where do they then go do they going to come back to community house and have to pay that extra rent which now they won 't be getting funding for so it could be a bit of a problem down the track a window with Philips down have not gonna last sorry what 's the gig what folks turn how sorry I don 't know is that how long does it last for I mean I gather that they 're able to offer very reasonable and I 'm not sure whether it 's actually free space at present no no but how long does the how long does the arrangement last for two years as I understand and then what happens sorry well that 's why I 'm asking it 's Sharon not anyone else but I don 't know I 'm not any more informed than the local councilors but what I 've been told from when we 've been discussing it as a sector as they 're after two years then I 'm not sure that Philips town hub itself actually knows what 's going to you still think that there is there 's a real issue around the sustainability of overarching accommodation arrangements for the social sector yes it 's just quite a bit of moving around and going on at present people looking for cheaper wins yeah okay well this that 's something that I think we should have a look at yeah all right we 'll look thank you very much much appreciate it _"

    "text": "age 17 of the consultation shows the average farm having a value of 950 2,000 in paying two thousand seven hundred and twenty five dollars and rates I 'd have to say the averages don 't be any resemblance to the values and rates that are paid by actual farms we 've been advised by the council that the town represents about three thousand properties that are considered rural in reality it concerns us because the table suggests that farmers could be regarded as getting off lightly this is not the case according to industry statistics Everage rates around twelve and a half thousand dollars for a sheep beef farm and around sixteen thousand dollars for a dairy farm not that there are many dairy farms in christchurch apparently this is quite a discrepancy I guess what we 're asking for here is a bit of a recognition that those averages don 't really reflect what a what the farm actually is and I think we would rather and that where it says average farm the Grove and have that called remote rural average ways to that effect another solution properties a lot of other councils do this and they do include farm examples that are farms as opposed to small blocks just my having made that point I 'd just like to go on to the roading part of our submission submissions mainly focus on ropes we strongly believe that rural roads on the bench might still have been allowed to deteriorate over a number of years it 's a real worry for our members because they 're such a crucial lifeline for rural people we have photos that will run through shortly that shows the condition as we 've said in submission and sufficient funding over a number of years has lead to the situation we 've been told the amount spent on rural roads will have to be would have to be doubled potentially to make a real difference and give the level of quality-of-service victory around perhaps that could be we also think that as well as the money side of it that the work could be done better I 'm not an expert on roading engineering but we 've got a couple of farmers here of what and how the maintenance has been done and what could be done potentially to improve it I have to say a council is very responsive in dealing with problems as they arise but it 's a little bit like the ambulance and bottom of the cliff it 'd be better to have a fence at the top to stop the person falling over in the first place I think what we what we would like to see is a bit more planned preventive maintenance will make the roads last longer and be more resilient to the effects of storms for example and we think this sort of and this would actually help reduce ongoing costs over time particularly those for storm related repairs so that 's okay I 'd like to hand over to Hamish now I just like to highlight some of the roading issues that we 're seeing on the potential clap currently this is one of the roads that we travel regularly to get to school which the school bus Trevor 's drivers on this slippage occurred nine months ago they seem to really frame lane with a corner approaching on that hill we also downhill side which makes it very dangerous road to travel there 's no real signage leading up to this this is a case going out of molecular the road was reformed also nine months ago and just left with the shingle surface and we 're seeing that deteriorate and cause issues with Trevor traffic coming both ways on it like the last slide this slide also is this is a major tourist route we see up to 25 Kimber vans a day go round here over the summer Plus tourists of cruise boats and buses this seems to be repaired jobs done this was repaired about a year ago but for some reason now they seem to be just patching it and it seems to permeate again very quickly now I 'd like to counsel thank you very much for making time to hear us Rhoda she 's a very small in comparison to what Christchurch faces but these are the lifelines for produce in and out and my contention we look through these slides is is that I feel and that is either that the contract by the contractors for the maintenance of this area is being inadequately done or to that in fact the job description between the council and the contractor is in the resin over the 40 odd years I 've been driving these roads I 've seen the pendulum swing from reasonable maintenance to poor maintenance and I believe we 're in a poor maintenance level even though response for a quest is good and if the maintenance done correctly then it will in fact save the council money in the long term so this is just a little example of the blind corner no I 've complained about this it 's been that bit for three years this is the Holmes Bay Road and this is quite a busy single Road and this is in the middle of February and there 's a classic is an apple of electing and keeping the water I seal it off the road and more of the same and this one is almost all the time rains start of the Holmes Bay Road homes Bay Valley Road this the thing really is this seems to be a real phobia about a maintenance grading and I really do ask the council to review their program with the contractors because there seems to be no standard program right obviously at this time of the year there 's there is a class example of a public road leading to farmland now that has been repaired and to a degree but if we get a winter that 'll be like they have again in the summer that 's costing the council a lot of money here 's another public road that feeds two dwellings and through not maintaining the cold water an edge long layer is slumped away and this is a very dangerous situation on a public road we are getting people travelers advantage things go around there and as that example that is just purely in confidence about not having a maintenance program on the road again and and this also is after a quest to do some work diggers gone down there down the Kollwitz but no one 's got out you can see in the top right-hand corner submit the council that they review these contracts and how its worded and that they step away from this so-called request complaint process back to a proper maintenance program so that that 's the end of our prepared statement would be if there is time about all be happy to take any questions one of the questions that I had is in relation to their measure as one of the hard things about the unsealed roads is that they 're they 're more unpredictable you know in terms of the management of them so I mean do you have any important to the into the into the rolling contracts that we have on bigspin sure at the moment there 's an update an organization no not not formally not really I mean obviously I 'm I 'm just wondering whether we could do this better if we formed a bit of a partnership you know I mean we 're in this together as the dienes that she is LTP and I just wonder whether I mean you 're seeing things early on and the thing and I 'm early on storm events in this area too over the last week while Andrews sort of suggesting he because I 'm assuming that is the local councillor I 'd like to chip-ins on absolutely thinking that the community board have already said that they want to be involved in the priority setting in the way that this is done I mean we 've heard similar narratives to what the whole Council have heard just now for some time and I 'm also frustrated that we haven 't been able to respond to that in any meaningful way I mean whether there 's room for a working group or regular meetings to be set up between either federated farmers or a representative group of Banks Peninsula farmers with the Community Board on a regular basis so that we can influence the maintenance program and the contracts and the the reactive maintenance that 's required as well I mean I 'm very conscious that some of what we 're seeing we need to do some work on that as we move into winter otherwise things are only going to get worse I 'm wondering but that allows us to work together to get the measured results for the peninsula probably driven by the community board might be a good way forward I think that would be a great idea sorry somebody 's gone down dry throat the wrong way thank you very much for your submission it 's always very powerful to have a presentation that has images like that [Laughter] thank you very much that 's and I think Andrews got a very good suggestion that we could work with you on I think be great if we could find a way of actually maintaining these roads and a far more systematic way yes okay thank you very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "can you just is here another one down anyway I 've come forward Peter and we 're gonna have a quick look to see if we can find Michael 's other submission just on our association he 's the vice president of combination and I just want to add a couple of things that you did ask Kim before I forget we do paying membership to crush your sins in anything from probably 250 to six or seven thousand dollars membership my little hotel of twelve rooms pays three nearly four thousand dollars to be a member and also when you 're talking this is the old CCT yeah he 's still doing they 're still going here yeah and so every major hotel from the page three or four thousand minimum problem yeah so we aren 't going here of things and also I just want to add then everyone talks about the hospitality industry and the hotel industry the only one that makes money out of of tourists I put it down it 's the butcher the baker the candlestick maker that makes money out of tourism because buying more products we buy more hydroponic lettuces from horse will the service station sells more petrol the taxi drivers get more so it 's it 's all very well to have a tech or beer tax or what I 'm going to call it but it 's gotta be fear that because everyone unemployment as well there 's more employment so it 's just covering a couple of things you asked Michael as you know hostage a new zealanders the voluntary trade association and we 've been operating since nineteen hundred and two and we have over 3,000 businesses we merged with the motel Association two years ago and Bob Pringle was the the president of the motel Association of Canterbury so he 's going to talk to you about more to do with the accommodation and the in our in our area here at Canterbury we have over 300 financial members in this in this TLA area the Crushers Terrell Licensing Authority but in a Canterbury area which we go from kaikoura down to tikka PO we have over 450 members we do appreciate you giving us this read it so we 're not gonna go right through so many pages of it but some of the things that Michael has sent as as we fully endorse the money that Christchurch New Zealand to operate and the same reasons that Michael has already told you we really need this city growing to cover all the things that 's that we 've lost since the earthquakes I will also cover some other things that right at the end of our submission including what Michael said about fire alarms and billion B 's that 's under duty of care to visitors and a minimum of health and safety requirements for online accommodation operator so you can read that in there and the other thing that we do have a problem with as when the earthquake happened we did lose a lot of restaurants and food outlets and since then there 's been a huge uptake of food trucks we have a problem that they it 's not a level playing field anymore there 's more and more of them opening but more and more than getting like licenses from yourself the noodle markets which in previous years has only happened four for four days or five days this year when I thought 10 or 11 days and right at the prime time of our hospital for a season and a lot of our restaurants especially complained that it 's getting funded by help funding by the council and and we 're and it 's not a level playing field in my pain rates 365 days a year and employing staff etc etc I 'll leave it Lea questions now you wanna hear from Bob first runs the night noodleman who owns it well what 's the Facebook no no no no they sponsored it but they 're not they didn 't run out do they I 'm the impression that the council gave the list of the link a very good right no we 'll find out about that alright and I think he we encountered on on Ritalin right we 've got a few concerns of our members we don 't change K if everyone 's but when I skied back in the litter box in sickbay actually I yeah we 've got a lot of worried members a lot of tree might tell this reform cost you some yeah and you know I hit a lot of members having trouble to take your rings and while the big monkey ear being beef we 're getting more and more these coming on with a more important so we need to be able to bring them under the same regulations that we 've got and we 've heard Michael spoke about for that father we had the lights are all to do is to have the current of time to the conference I think you didn 't do this so it 's quite important that we have to try and bring them into the same regulations that we 've got we 're paying the commercial weights with paying insurance were paying those standards what was worried is one of our members told me that they have got to be here being being next door to them and the more success with another to a non we gladly follow me throughout the country you know we have to do something as member told me that they had they own and here being being in another district and they are only limited to four people on the side and after that and she said that they someone come from the council and told them what I had six on the site and we have to be vote and consultations with the council 's on the council 's you know comes back to your decisions here that what happens with Airbnb how it gets regulated it 's not fair that we have one site spending the money on compliance and the other ones getting scot-free yeah it 's public liability insurance is another one I 've just we did a survey of our members on us three local things that we have happened here one was the golden oldies tournaments will we had three members and that they had rugby players there we had one that had threatened their quarters on the mood at new markets had none and the lantern fence till we had three people three people say them they tell us we are some serious Christians another one we 're yeah there 's quite a concern to us of that industry and we have to work in conjunction with them that we want the same fit like a level playing field you talked about the bid takes it 's not a via text so never was a via tax it 's a capital value tax and this is what a lot of people don 't realize it 's a typical replica nothing to do with bums and beads and this is where a lot of people we gotta get some money out of those sellers coming in hotel isn 't much I wasn 't making a fortune airline yeah it does not have much not many motels with making big money in Christchurch market at the moment so it 's pretty sensitive to what we are going to do and we don 't want paying a share on the user pays but what really annoys us is people also see there 's quite interesting Michael and he cycle wise this is a wee bit off here yeah thing that we get an American tourists stayed in one unit and we stayed in the next unit the American tourists be at 500 uni turns out quality took a few days he took everything the cyclists cleaners companies in the hell are they young because they 're still boiling noodles and the jack so yeah we want those high-end visitors coming into a town so the money spreads right throughout there 's one thing I have failed to mention I 'll be really tall about don 't and I know it 's a concept kind of a contentious issue is the stadium of course I understand why and it 's great that now we have some certainty around the metro sports because that brings huge amount of domestic tourism into Christchurch Vicky 's different question that 's not a new subject of your submission Peter their hospitality Association in Wellington did an interesting initiative along the waterfront of story how would you feel about doing something in Christchurch we will spam we 've signed up to two straw free and we 're members of will being tried we 're coming our members that mean it 's we can 't make it compulsory it on one of our board members from Hungary is he we 're going to use sustainability and pricing and hospital using our next one of the biggest things that work exactly thank you excellent well thank you very much and much appreciated that you 've gone to the trouble to come on we realize that there are challenging issues that affect your industry and I know that you you can see that the challenges that we 're confronted with as well but I would like to invite Michael Peterson to come back with us other hair _"

    "text": "TI a christchurch hotel sector which i assume is the tourism industry association oh okay right okay sorry thank you without changing the economics great yeah brilliant I mean the name without changing there yes so merely any encounters this is a real honor for me to be here today you know I want to take a photo for a leader if it 's absolutely the so today I 'm here representing the hotel sector I managed the Commodore hotel for my family we 've been here drawling where their business for 47 years and what I 'm speaking about today is is actually our submission was around ensuring that Christ returns it has sufficient funding to promote the region we REM before the Christ before the earthquake Christchurch head around 25 percent of the national conference market so the loss of the Convention Center has the Doucet market she is just known to see and we are delighted and pleased that there is a Convention Center being built and this is um you know we are very appreciative of that but the challenge Narrows who is going to go that 's the the thing we want to ensure that Christ Regency can has the capability to do that we need to invest in Christchurch to attract back those conferences so that we rightfully get our um our fair share of of that market New Zealand travel patterns have changed I mean you would be well aware of their than Queens owners now another recognized gateway to the South Island and international airlines are increasingly focusing on Auckland so we really truly need to compete it 's Auckland and in Queens sandwich scenes as well visitors spend around six times as much as locals do each day we all know from our own experiences that when you when you travel overseas you end up being free of spending and that 's really important that we attract those people who are free of spinning and research has shown that 80% of that visitor expenditure is quickly Rhys bent on the economy so what we 're saying is that that money is turned over really quickly within our economy and comes back into our community so it 's got a far-reaching consequences 've all seen it with each year and so many people went to Geneva and it was reportedly worth at least 34 million for the Dunedin economy and of course we need a stadium which I know your it looks likely and it 's that 's really pleasing as well but again it 's around the issue of who 's going to promote these facilities when we do actually have them and also promoting the facilities that we we have now we do have there 's no that about we 've got capability without the new stadium to have events and it was seen firsthand with when the boss came to John Fleetwood mech to an audience of 35,000 generated 8.9 million for Dunedin recently and in the six years of the cover stadiums opened its pump an estimated 200 million into the city according to Dean 's and Eden venues management the hotel sector and in Christchurch is is performing you 'd have to say we 're performing okay but the thing is that we 're just being all the the other centres are actually are performing significantly I to give you sort of a flavor of so for all regions last year and their hotel sector the hotel sector was around 81% Christchurch was at 86% Queenstown 77% Auckland at sorry Christchurch at 77% in Queenstown at 93% that was for last year so you see you know 77% it 's a it 's a reasonable thing we can make a go of our businesses but with more hotels opening up and and that the the 77th assume the risk is that will drop further so you know 777 percent in christchurch versus 93 percent in Queenstown and 86 percent and in Auckland so that 's that 's what 's going on in our seat don 't really I 've delivered all all I have to say would there be Christians yeah I 'll just open it up questions Yanni thank you I just had two questions questions one is I just wondered if you could just talk to we 've gotten one of the other submissions is discussion around air B&B and what impact that 's having on the you know accommodation sector is that there 's with sort of accommodation sharing and impact on the statistics that you 've given to us well I know Christchurch indeed have done some work on it near economic department here than they they actually see the part of it they were picking up from was the young people applying to mean their own homes to to give them capability for to receive gifts one thing I think it 's important and these are views of the organisation and personal views is that it is important that those people that are staying with us in New Zealand are receiving a quality experience but also their safety is theirs paramount as well there was there was a family and a Malaysian family over and I think it was around Scarborough or something who in the house caught fire and was no smoke detectors and the young and in the house you know we have to to have you know building warrant of fitness in a teen two things in a professional manner you know you would it would be him well everyone should have a smoke detector of course be great you know there is a real risk fear that our industry could be tarnished by things going awry okay I mean was but there 's good with it to Yanni I mean you know you isn 't nice to think of someone and a family homes able to maintain that family home and potentially read he had a couple of rooms yeah and the second question was there was obviously been a big discussion to buy up and Oakland around the bed tax and one of the questions that 's come through I guess has been around you know if we provide these new facilities or additional money for ravines Yahoo benefits and who pays so have you got any thoughts on the industry actually making a greater contribution to the cost of bringing these events although you sure we 're not you know behind paying our own share and we also one thing we do really well and we did exceptionally well post earthquake was actually that sort of hosting the prospective and looking after those people that were going to the familiy the charitable groups there was at Bruce Garrett Bruce is speaking later on today and really good at trying at ensuring that we we pulled our weight in terms of when it was needed for you know if there was any vin time there was people hosted and hotel free of charge but getting back to your point Jonnie about the bed tax right that issue we have as an industry with the it 's not called bid texas attack the target of rape and as applied in auckland the issue we have with it is the unfairness and the way it is applied if it could be applied in a consumption way on you know is like 2 per night per gift or something it would be a hang of a lot fairer than imposing a rate on a property in this there 's a recipe to that that you know high value of properties that that you won 't actually see such a palatial hotel built because it 'll be on the value of the property rather than metered on the on the nightly stay and I honestly you understand to the dilemma you to the North Texas but maybe there 's a way of somehow other engineering that with government so that it could actually be and let 's not forget there 's also there 's a jeans to Yakima took there 's an awful lot you know it 's a wonderful Jamilah of jeans been faithful by these this is a bone of contention between local government and central government but but at Exxon at X which is the rates have GST at attached to them but and also all of the extra effort that goes into economic development initiatives or attracting you know events or whatever produces GST and we don 't get a bar of it so yeah so so but but you 've given us a little bit of well a gunner of an idea about how we might approach central government around some of these alternative mechanisms for charging because we don 't think rates as is going to be a sustainable mechanism for local government in the future certainly not for a city this size so look thank you and you 've patty you answered my question but so it sounds like you you wouldn 't be opposed to the concept of a beard tech so be how it might be administered included that would matter and I wondered if the same if you might have the same sort of view about a visit at X well it 's it 's yep it 's the application counselor and we 're also you know just don 't_''_647.12 Ricky if we don 't shoot yeah yeah I might introduce you to a very interesting conversation with the airport chief executive on that one Aaron yes I mind um just a question on something even actually spoken to today but you and I had had conversations about it given that you 're in our community board area and that was around the cycleway the major cycle way and it 's rooted a couple of main roads over from where you are but you had a suggestion around the memorial of being the Gateway cycle wave to the city I wondered if you wanted to mention that today I know you 're hidden rendered out using the TI a 2-day so Michael we know you well enough to invite a personal contribution okay I 'll be really quick but I 've got a I 've got a submission and around it one and and so hopefully I 'll get called up for that one Aaron and I 'll retract okay he 's on the list to be heard again we could have we could have been so I 've been one is a cycling one down here Oh is there a separate I don 't even seem to be one of these recidivist submitters we 're just gonna we 're just gonna double check but why don 't why don 't_''_732.38 we move on why don 't you hang about for a few more minutes and we 'll invite Peter Morrison and hospitality Newseum I 'm sure you 'll be very interested in their submissions and then the cycling is about it 's about it 's truly about making sure that entranceway to our city is is is there 's something special and imagine imagine this picking up a retort a bike from Malcolm at the airport and has team you safely into our city I don 't think I 'd have foot my luggage [Laughter] thank you _"

    "text": "I invite David close to come forward please always feel very guilty David when you turn up and you represent yourself and get five minutes whereas a few represented a group you could get infinite so sorry oh okay okay you are on your own for ten minutes let 's go for you well done on the long term plan it 's a vastly better plan than you produce three years ago you 've brought the capital program under control the debt peaks at 2.4 billion about 2026 whereas before it peaked at 3 billion at 2029 you 've made the hard decision put up quite significantly in the next year or two in order to fund more renewals from rights consider putting a huge burden of debt on the next generation the portion renewals that you 're funding from rates is going to increase from 56% of present to 75% over the 10 years so well done that was a tough decision but it 's going to benefit the future generations greatly by having lower debt and what 's more you 've done all this without selling seven hundred a much stronger financial position in the long term this plan is also much better because it 's based on a very good 30-year infrastructure strategy the staff do is a huge pat on the back for the infrastructure strategy because it sets out all the facts so that people can really see what the priorities should and you asked the question excellent Christian have we got our priorities right I think by and large you have I think the medium spend option is the right option but within the option I think some things need to be challenged now the first challenge I would put is to the sewer renewal according to the infrastructure strategy silver renewed sewers will be in a worse fate in 10 years time than they are now it 's predicted that overflows including dry with overflows will increase from about a hundred a year to two hundred a year so I 'm sure that the council can 't_''_181.92 be happy with that the second challenge I would put as overriding the LTP proposes to seal three percent of roads a year you don 't average of 33 years between windshields that is amazing on that scenario roads will deteriorate and the council have to spend an awful lot on reactive maintenance so I think there are things that need to be looked at I 'm not suggesting you should put up rates walk or borrow more I 'm suggesting should change some of the priorities in accordance with what the staff suggested for the low spend option for example the staff proposed to trumpeting was 83 million of the Aven floodplain management that 's not really urgent I live in the lower Aven there 's nothing really urgent I 'm spending of that sort that needs to be done they also prepares to talk about 50 million off the realigning of waterways again that is not a priority according to the infrastructure strategy they suggest only about 6% I think that six percent as a team to see of the of those waterways need in immediate attention so my proposal because it should look at the low option the staff suggested for waterways and floodplain management stormwater and put the money into sewer in urgency similarly when it comes to roading I 'd go for the low option for cycleways and instead of putting eighty million more into cycleways put there in the ceiling of roads because cyclists most of the time cycle not on dedicated cycle ways but on ordinary roads and better fix the quality of their travel etc so really I think that 's something that needs to be looked at now of course and you 're expecting this I know you 're expecting this your priorities are really wrong is housing last year I made a submission on house and I 've told you that for half a mutton the cost of half a mutton for a pair per week you could build 1,500 units over six years and Vickie kindly put me on Facebook for that and you said my solution last year was good submission and you 'd refer to consideration for the long term plan I was surprised and disappointed when I discovered there 's nothing like that in the long term plan in ten years time the City Council and octo tahi Housing Trust are going council had in 2010 before the quake meantime the populations gone up by about one bit percent per year and what 's more the elderly population has increased more rapidly and the council is not part of the solution it is part of the problem when instead housing and it 's not just you 've dropped the ball on housing you 've never tried to run with it bunt on this however in February there was a report to the Housing Committee about research into housing need the need for social housing in New Zealand it calculated that was a need for 180 additional social housing units in a museum in Christchurch every year and that the council sheer might be fifty sorry that was good research it 's a good target but there is nothing in the long-term plans to address that need financially because it says that there is a council policy a policy setting it 's called not to use rates money for housing that is an undeclared policy it 's a policy which you have not put up for the public for consultation and I know public would tell you very very quickly that their priority it would be for housing ahead of subsidies for professional rugby at the back of my submission is a spreadsheet which shows that the council would implement that fire 30 units a year which the report says should be the target 50 units a year 500 over 10 years that you could implement that not just for half a muffin but for less than that for a decent bite of a muffin per ratepayer per week I think it 's a realistic program and I think that that 's really something that the council should grapple with because I think that you will have huge regrets will you see that we continue to have a housing problem in Christchurch homelessness etc and the council is not providing the sort of you see Sierra Clinton fill I just quickly think she was just the order of speaking for us just a question on the roading and the transport options we are we 're that the cycleways program involves a whole pile of intersection improvements in carriageway sealing that has a higher do well it 's something you need to grapple with but honestly you need to look at the results of the cycling policy the performance indicators indicate that the start do not think the cycling policy cycling program is going to increase the significant number of cyclist easily the data is actually quite the opposite the ins ETA and staff productions say that it 's going to increase significantly and our data already sees what the performance indicators in your own we 're already exceeding our 2031 targets but you know I just wonder if you were aware that if we took 80 million dollars out of the cycle wise program it would only give us 50 million dollars to spend on other things because the government subsidy would disappear certainly I think you need to look at the roading because I but that 's a balancing that we should take into account clean and infill thank you thank you David could you please give us your view of what you see would be the long-term effects of the council not putting away for social housing for extra social housing for housing people who are homeless people asleep in cars haven 't struck anyone sleeping rough just recently totally rough recently there was somebody sleeping in the bill would pack go and another people person speaking abandoned houses and I 'm pleased to say that the council finally found a unit after a considerable wait for both of those people but there 's this desperate need for simple accommodation accommodation beats at studio units built in the 1950s it 's actually very good 1960s it 's ideal because it 's low cost and affordable and I think that 's where the Cantonese ago I think that there 's an avalanche of housing need coming as people older people retire and cannot afford the private rents and the private sector I think we were looking for poverty the the mid-water of health has spoken about that it 's only submission he certainly spoken at for a while ago about the need as he sought for increased housing for the elderly thank you David and I I had not read obviously the last paragraph of your submission properly because I overlooked the submission on any draft annual plan or long-term plan and I hope that it 's not the case I would be devastated to think that we weren 't going to have the contribution of David close to our ongoing consideration of these matters because each year it you know this LTP gets a life of its own but it 's a three-year operational plan not a not a 10-year one we look out the 10 and the 30 years in the infrastructure strategy but essentially we do it every three years but every year we end up a justing elements of our long-term plan and I would want you to continue to come and I 'll always give you ten minutes so madam-ji I was thinking that I wouldn 't be around in ten years time that your request I might change my mind thank you very much thank you now could I invite Michael Peterson who 's that you _"

    "text": "Thank You Mia and counselors just to just do the Tuesday club nights first they choose to club just to explain those who and to where yeah since I get 15 minutes either side done that me oh I see right if you 've got my submission first I 'm quite happy to do that first right happy right the fit the first one the first comment I want to make is a very brief one and it was an old board member of City Holdings no having a cup of coffee a couple of weeks ago and we were wondering what methods and this is just a question I don 't require an answer but what methods are used to to assess whether or not there are new potential monopolies which should be owned by Prussia City Council and managed by City Holdings so that 's just a question to keep an eye on the yep okay so the the second point is Yanni raised a question with me last week about which didn 't fit on the EAG reports are now commenting on it but when you look seed and when I look at the performance measures I think they are quite weak and I think as a council you need to turn your minds to how do you make them stronger and I think that 's over the years that it 's sort of watered down and what started me being interested in this was I 'm involved on a trust that 's involved in youth and when I looked at the fact that Christchurch NZ does not involved in youth employment initiatives at all and yet we drove youth employment initiatives and Christchurch as a council and my time around the council table so I think that if you look at the agencies that you are fun then Christchurch indeed the budgets 14 million DCL is 4 million regenerate Christchurch you putting 4 million in the government 's putting money in to regenerate otac erode DPM see it 's real you know this council table needs to actually say what 's the best way of getting growth in our economy our place in the world driving the South Island playing a key role and I think and said as you need to ever had look at it you go this five minutes what part of Christ Eugene is it a lot well I think I think at the moment there 's far too much focus on the staff then the marketing stuff and if you look at if you look at those levels of service specify the levels of service of it and you and you look at gross domestic product average wage net migration workforce skills at citria stand I think quite a lot that 's the Chamber of Commerce 's role and in B 's role and how can this council which has always been an evasive actually look at an agency like this and how could we actually make this the best agency in New Zealand you know I first came across CDC when I was a young member of parliament and that used to have a contract with central government called action works it was a joint venture with the what was prior to the Ministry of Social Development and that was part of the mayor 's task force for jobs which role was mere but just after you stopped being Mia the results of the re-evaluation of CDC came in and they got rid of action works they turned it into and to a trust that actually fell over so the trust is in abeyance right it has and so the trust is still there and I discussed with one of the trustees the fact that it needs to be revived because abuses but why should it be revived as a as a trust that can 't survive the lack of partnership with central government why wouldn 't it go back into Christchurch in seas right so you think that 's a good model oh yeah what we did with action works is that we set ourselves a target nobody under the age of 25 was doing nothing and working our way through the ages we 've got 219 we have 9 65 or 64 people under the age of 19 we knew who were unemployed we knew every single one of them and we knew why they weren 't working and we were trying to work on getting them there seconds yeah very quickly I mean I had a similar question but but put in the action works to one side it also seemed to me from recollection that CDC was a place where it wasn 't just about business it was a place where anyone in the community of NGO who wanted to do something and get advice and services to support enterprise etc so I just wanted if you had any reflection on on that aspect given that seems to be one of our focuses through our vision as a place where anything is possible and yet one of the key institutions that you 're referring to you 've raised the question around whether it 's really accessible for people to go and get services rather than just sort of advice I always felt as a board member of CDC then it was really important it 's it 's there 's a glimmer side to actually looking at big business and trying to attract it to Christchurch and tourism and all that sort of thing but it 's also really important at the other end of the corridor into work and have them the same corridor is really important and it embraces the the haves and the have-nots and the Economic Development Agency should always reflect that yeah back in your day though CDC didn 't cover the tourism side so we Amalgamated CCT and with amalgamated some of the larger beans that we would run as a city and we 've also amalgamated international education which they 're not currently funded for so I mean there are a number of issues but I think you 've raised a really valid point which is look we support your bringing them together because I see it on tourism I couldn 't understand why the hell it 's just another city could be treated the same absolutely thank you very much so now we 'll move on to your Tuesday Club which should be very interesting because we 've got a series of eight headings but yeah so looking forward to the detail some will put more emphasis on others just to explain to council around to where Tuesday Club started with a group of us feeling that we needed we responded to the shipping report on the challenge of the mere and see serie and got something like 130 or 140 submissions and the Tuesday club got two thousand submissions from the community they need a lot of money we didn 't and such initiative message so we meet that weekly at smash palace we get between 40 and 60 people or when ref turned up we got 70 that night when the minister tuned up we got 120 it 's varies usually it goes out to six I looked up for account 627 people and sometimes emails go all over the place one email a couple weeks ago was shared 115 times from somebody at this table there 's we have a vast array of topics and these are all people who care about the city so all we want is to make it a better city that 's air capable so the first thing I did in preparing for the submission as I looked because I remember sitting at this council table and this is one method of receiving submissions but a really good one is the survey that you do I presume you still don 't_''_525.48 distilled it right okay I couldn 't find the results for this year I found last year which that on the 24th of April I think you need I just point that out to you you need to have a hard look at that because that 's that 's got more used to you than probably me sitting at the end of the table so one of the things that we we were concerned about the ref came along and talked to us about the LTP we were really interest to them and when when I read it and I look for instance their strategic objectives that you 've got as a council I can 't see them on your document and when I when I think about ref talking about method of consultation that he came out with which was superb you know Vicky was global-warming lien with the size of the care the city and growing to one and a half million that 's the sort of dream that needs to be out there it 's as dry introduction it 's basically financially focused and it needs to be a big vision for the city you know and that 's something that I think is really important and I think that all the ideas that yeah I talked about here there 's a fantastic ideas really this table and it should reflect your ideas and their introduction in and their document I don 't think it does the the Tuesday club had a real big interest in water they they felt that there 's a need for a different way of consulting on water it 's not just you 've been driven by your water engineers it 's by you saying this is our particular focus we 're going to actually get this right and when you look at you know sewage going into our rivers and we sang all or let 's okay you know in big water events well is it in and you look at you know focusing in on say the Avon and the heath get and when I look at the health care and I think well the history 's risen that but the city like the Yacht Club that that sails and in the history you know the engaging those people I think you 've see a model with the EAG where you brought a group of people and to actually assist you with the process and the Tuesday Club viewers that we actually need to do the same thing with water and that involves coastline that involves the lakes that are on Banks Peninsula it 's a big issue and I think people be pretty pleased to see you doing it I think we were particularly we look out the window of the Tuesday Club and we look at the the land that 's been allocated to Fletcher 's with all the lanes that have been put on there and nothing in its place and it was the feeling of people there that it was really important that we have a capital some put aside for the central city you know when the when the city library furnish it opens and people walk out onto a bombsight that 's actually not a good message and and the Convention Center will be same you know you restore the Cathedral you 've actually got to put probably twenty million dollars aside at least for the central city to actually do something about that regenerate has done a plan for it where the hell is it you know you should be asking that you should also we believe maybe you need to look at short-term idea my short term I mean sort of 20 to 30 years use of the land and the central city so that you have planning opportunities for people to maybe build a building that 's got a 30-year lifetime or something they maintain an office downstairs and live above it attracting young people from around the world to live here in Christchurch you know while the rest of the world 's asleep Christchurch is awake we could be doing processing and trading and so that was something that the Tuesday Clem felt what 's really important and we felt that it was important the council table header view on what the central city should be and get on an advocate for it and don 't I just think it of the people that are blocking it where the hell is it investment in the red zone is also same as that as the central city different focus on the treatment of sewage I would have thought at the time you know I know how dangerous it was at the time of the earthquake having all of our sewage in one place we played with it in my time and those always arguments against it but I think the council needs to look seriously at different ways of treating I 'll played with surgery sorry I made a of myself anyway no I won 't go any further cause it 's them I 'll just dive into it so it 's a cab parking in Christchurch you 've got fabulous care packing buildings I use them all the time I think you need to actually be proud of them and advertise them and say you know that people think they 're going into the whatever Phillip care does it fit us and they think they 're going into a council one it 's right back there the other day it think you need to really focus in on what 's your marketing plan for those for those units I use the one across the road here as well and and under the art gallery that excellent excellent capex and I just think you hiding it tell it under a bushel right the ad gallery sorry the art gallery I was talking about sorry that is across the right I 'm not no no no no no no and now the next one is I think it 's really important that this counsel and I don 't know you could have done this so this might be but we were talking about this at the Tuesday Club the accountability of the negotiations at the moment are really important that you actually I 've seen around the city and I 've got connections all over the place so I get all sorts of information there 's a lot of executive conversations taking place some of those in various agencies will be territorial imperialism they will be looking after their jobs has this council got a a an opinion on what sort of be like you know those are those to me that 's a workshop all on its own but we felt that it 's really important the people of Christchurch are fed up with negotiations that all of a sudden happen and end I think the council would be saving its community well if it started to have and be and don 't be scared of differences of opinion it 's really healthy and the Tuesday clubs about to start a series on I 've got some submissions on it at the moment and to print on what what a single agency would look like and there I 've got views on it but others have got views that I disagree with but that 's fine and it 's important that we actually have their disagreement and arrive at some conclusions as a city thank you yeah I I that 's the difference between a lawyer and somebody who sees the Lord not as a straightjacket but as a guideline I think that it 's I think we 've got a minister is on site and that 's a fantastic change trust the community to actually have this conversation but what they 're not one that open discussions on the allocation of the crown additional three hundred million dollars it 's not we 've got to wait till the crown actually announces its budget but we need to yes and we we don 't know what the limitations are going to be so but but you know I mean I 'm hearing what you 're saying if if the Tuesday Club are going to help us have a serious conversation about how we review the multiplicity of agencies that we 're necessarily a compromise then that would be incredibly helpful and I 'd be happy to participate and we and like for instance with the water and issues like that we 've got people that come there I mean the retired professors and people like that that are really capable of producing some real goods exactly thank you well thank you very much for making the time to come on and to present to us with both hats on it 's very much appreciated the mediator and could I invite Dave _"

Christchurch City Council was helping to instill a lasting culture we 're active living Metis what Christchurch City Council does makes a real difference the council has a critical part to play ensuring people continue to enjoy quality recreation opportunities council planning needs to adopt a long term approach that takes into account factors such as urbanization population growth an aging population and the rise of tourism to ensure that recreation can increased demographic diversity has and will continue to place increase pressure on recreational infrastructure new facilities are experience experiencing pent up demand exacerbating this is the closure of some recreational facilities due to the earthquakes this displacement effect places even more pressure and already stretched

dual symbiotic benefit of easing traffic congestion and making it easier for residents to integrate healthy recreational activities into their day-to-day lives we also support the prioritization of work to maintain parks and riverbanks we note that according to sport New Zealand data walking which would happen on impacts and amongst New Zealand adults we also support the funding of new facilities particularly the pool and Lynwood Woolston and a Leisure Centre and home B we submit that the Christchurch City Council will need to do more to activate these recreational spaces and activation theme and all of our submissions to the various counselors across the country nowadays a builder and they will come approach doesn 't always work recreationally assets need to be activated and programmed to make sure them make them more appealing in to break down barriers for the hard-to-reach areas in the community we also submitted our support for the funding of the Metro sports sports facility and a separate multi-use arena and we thank and congratulate the council 's role ensuring that those two facilities remain separate and not located it was a fantastic review last week the transport section we support the expenditure of two hundred and six million dollars on work to complete major cycle routes the planning and pre work done by the crusher City Council and the preliminary stages of those cycle routes was robust comprehensive we would like the council resolute and its implementation of those cycle routes we support there the choice to spend more on transport in particular the particular outcomes of reduced traffic congestion and increased use of active transport in the community facilities section we submit that the expenditure of ten million dollars on the New Brighton hot pools needs further study we suggest that a peer review process is undertaken for this facility to ensure that recreational use is optimized we support the expenditure of 21 million dollars on the aquatic facility in Linwood we support support the extent spinach on stage one of the night puno wire sports app and we support the expenditure of twenty five million dollars on recreation and sports grounds renewals we 've taken this opportunity to caution the council of a predictable lag effect of participant uptake and the utilization of new recreational facilities many forms of recreation have has suffered a loss of participant numbers and organizational capabilities since the earthquakes we reach the council to be patient with regard to how quickly and fully these new facilities will be utilized similarly we encourage the council to be earthquake there have been significant challenges and recruiting people into the recreational space and maintaining that capability we encourage the council to ensure that there is sufficient operational resourcing and workforce development to effectively activate those recreational spaces and places parks imperatives position means that our race submits and general teams that the maintenance of parks and open spaces has suffered in Christchurch since it can brief quakes and this is put at rest the reputation of Christchurch as a Garden City we support the regeneration of the portholes the port hills provides accessible numerous accessible recreational opportunities for the residents of Christchurch and I just like to comment no previously around the median wealth effective recreation on the great outdoors we support the proposal to spend more on parks and heritage and particularly supportive of parks

standard I 'm blaming you for bringing these kind of new angles and you know such as the one we 've just heard Sam it 's really good and refreshing be here just pick it up on a couple of your points in there with regard to 20 21 and 22 you know that region is prioritizing the green spine is part of their planning we do here you know what would be your response to say bringing forth the Aven or tackle or cycleway is a way to of a pet division yeah it would seem to make sense solely the council 's responsibility we 're a big fan of active transport in general across the across the country and the process that the council undertook to plane and bring about the urban cycle ways in christchurch was really robust and i understand is being criticism and there 's often some detractors but we 're firm commitment urban cycle West and and we note that a study showed there was I think at 15 percent 15 percent more cyclists like 33 seconds cycle way so it 's they 've have been completed by the 21 22 financial year not actually pushed right out to the 27 do you support that or would you but no we we supported in our submission the increased expenditure on transport which yeah but there 's two things is the increased cost but also the tutoring it out right so would you would your position be to support the increased cost but not to throw it out as well so it 's good look thank you very much and it 's just perfect timing so well questioned and well answered much appreciated and and thank you for coming and you know in coming in to suit our timetable as well thank you alright councillors we 're now going to adjourn until 40 and we will hear mr. Garre more at that point we 'll hear them individually and then we 'll have him as a collective immediately thereafter _"

    "text": "the next one after this is 28 so that thank you tonight go to cart or in a manner in our bio you 're always on a tether my tena koe tu ET monofin wha t no koto co it2 machi Oakley Roku a corner you see si called Josh taco winger car noe tamekia koto cat toy nor Dana tena koe tena koe tu kaito-kun oh and thank you for the opportunity to come and present today I 'm Josh Proctor and today I 'm here representing not myself but the 15,000 students at the University of Canterbury I am the elected president of the Students Association an organization recognized as the voice for students at the University of Canterbury myself Harry Beaumont Emma Macomb and land only son left lol executive come along today to share some of our our ideas on the long term plan because we think the student voice deserves to be heard there 's ultimately the decisions you make as a body are the ones we build and here as the youth first of all I 'd like to commend all the counselors here 's faced the city post-earthquake I can imagine this hasn 't been the easiest of challenges but some of the tangible developments made so far have been very well received so well however it 's of concern to us the amount of students that are leaving Canterbury post their tear here so essentially the way I see it we 're attracting some of the brightest the smartest the most talented people to Christchurch in Christchurch City and you have two three four years while back here at university to sell the city to them they should be here they should fall in love with the city and they shouldn 't want to leave but the way we 're seeing it a majority of those students at the moment I decided to leave once they 've finished and I don 't want that to happen I think there should be a priority to try retain these youth so I 'm sure you 've all seen our submission and had a chance to read through it but I just thought I 'd talk through a few other points today and then give first point was around a vibrant city so I think this is something we 've always had a focus on as a Student Association I think it 's super important but in order to have a vibrant city I think there needs to be ample living opportunities in a city and I think what that creates is more of a bus there 's people around no no no they all want to get in first because they get excited by what you 're saying they want me to notice them first so that I write down their names fear so I 'm writing I 'm writing down Dion and then Phil but but but don 't distract our guests please carry on I 'll give you an extra minute living opportunities within the forever news as I think personally for myself was to live in the CBD I would I 'd spend more time here because currently accessing the the cool things are popping up so it for us to live nearby I would be more likely to come and some of those things there and then I guess we events around the city I 'm super important so a vibrant city it 's it 's all pretty much captured and that anyway so it 's a pretty straightforward second point here is around the multi multi-purpose arena which has been good to see it gauge gain some more traction over the last couple of weeks we as a student Association full support of the multi-purpose and a multi-purpose arena but in particularly multi-purpose arena with a roof and I think that needs to be a priority and it 's something we think should be a non-negotiable and I 'll give you example just last week I 'm not sure if you saw in the news the world-renowned rapper Kendrick Lamar it was very popular amongst youth South story he was actually his agent was and negotiating negotiations were ther events led and we believed we had Kendrick coming to the city but what we didn 't know is they were negotiating with a targeting Association as well so we went through all the hard yards and even penciled on our events calendar but at the end of the day sell what is it six seven thousand tickets home castle or for South Barrington even and it 's not just King direct it 's each year and I 'm sure you 've seen the list it 's time and time again and the reality is if there 's a good concert and someone people want to see they will take the time to travel go go well I 'd like to see people coming north with the Canterbury rather than ask him to drive south and also with the multi-purpose arena and actually provides a lot of employment opportunities for students which is something we 've seen even with castle through the basin the likes and and that 's really important to us because there 's a lot of financial hardship for students so having those employment opportunities transport networks so moving onto that that 's something we think is really important it 's good seeing that if it 's put in around the cycle ways in there and we want to continue to see environmental transport being a priority and not just cars essentially so that 's their question that as I think it will go some of the way towards creating a vibrance with some of the new meats and things they want to bring to the Christchurch region I also understand they had a submission around International Education which I believe the University of Canterbury put a submission around their support for that I 'd like to put our support behind that as well I don 't know too much information about that but I think it 's something that would be really important and we 'd like to see and then last but not least we 've got the parks and heritage which as something students use widely particularly there are Port Hills one thing we 're seeing is a Student Association is an increase of mental health issues and well-being with students and actually giving students out of what I call the eylem and record and bubble is really important and things like the port helps are really important and even just going over there going for a walk seeing the beautiful view and there as can go steps towards helping some those issues so spaces is really really important for students so I think most of things we had and capture the near submission and if there 's any questions yes love to hear them it 's like Dionne they thought the question I had was you 've got a couple of other students associations around Christ huge yes do you guys Lincoln with Christchurch ends it at all what have you I actually think that all the students associations and that 's probably something that could come out of this immediately is actually they should go to this to Christchurch indeed Lincoln there and actually start talking about the events calendar for youth Lincoln Student Association so trying to grow a stronger partnership Lincoln at the moment ara don 't have a Student Association to try and sit that up but I think that 's a great outcome that could actually happen immediately I think that and we 're trying to arrange a time for for the executive to meet with the council so of the Students Association so I think that would be a first good step towards building that relationship so Josh think thank you for your submission and like you 've talked about students getting out of the island bubble it sounds great and you 've complimented us on air cycle ways and I guess duty cycle is a great example I 'm just wondering too though like how can we perhaps support you students to have closer links with the city so that an effect the city can become more like a well you have you 're learning in inner city as well as the hills and like we know that the classics Department have recently moved to the Art Center this wonder if you think there might be scope for other say small departments to do likewise or other parts release of responsibility of the students yes obviously they moved into the old Art Center which has been really cool and I 've been along there a few times already which is I think it 's awesome but again it 's only a small pocket of students in terms of what will get students to town those that we 've talked about you know the lantern festivals so markets and stuff but our number of students went along to those some of those things are the things that create more of a torque added by at the moment to be honest there 's not overly a lot that would draw me to the city so amazing or something in a submission on the LT page yeah opportunity often there 's some new bars and stuff opening up which drags a few students which has been quite good but it 's particularly over my first video thank you very much and and we do appreciate it and we look forward to developing a strong working relationship with the Students Association executive thank you for coming in thanks thank you now look I did say that we 'd go on to a break but I have noticed but wait there 's more I 've noticed that Sam Newton is already here who 's the next submitter and I just he was scheduled for eleven twenty but if we go to him now was finished by eleven twenty were just after then and then we 've got a fifteen minute break _''_694.87 I won 't Garry Moore 's the next one after that and he 's eleven forty all right so what do you like to come forward rather than watch this all go off for a break and and I don 't know why but I can 't seem to get counselors back exactly on ten minutes but thank you very _"

after that yeah yeah [Music] disrespect Iceland would dearly love to see the protection of the mystery age freezer chef Royden de mine which is the way you like to court and really like putting at once which seem to have been spending an awful lot of money on the coastal path way across the causeway and gravel road and planning to spend on something that we just go through there 's also a plan for ransom free stroke which is going to include reclamation into the history which we do unless there 's some history waters into another area to compensate for that at my butt doctor walking group over the coastal pass by two weeks ago and in the torn Weaver 's ear which was maybe three mothers on a pathway with their creams in two days down at the Yacht Club at fitting point on Wednesday afternoon we had a closing day there 's can 't have the pathway reinstated thought it was before the earthquakes and before the erosion of all the erosion that 's taken place erosion erosion which taken place that only continent he rides a bull material back into the history and just sitting there turn this we don 't send back the bottom of it since we 've gone for retention basins around different parts of the city and it 's outlying areas really feel that some of the money that we didn 't put into the coastal pass by and watch gonna be spent around Humphries Drive a small portion of that could be spent dealing got frightened to protect the history edge and reinstate the pathway we go on to the area of the rivers the rivers of the main method of getting the city of Christchurch draining the storm waters flood waters and need to be kept clean into the true depths if they were under the previous Radian of a separate drainage board preview 1988 I didn 't know when or something I was taking I 've been absorbed into the council workforce what would Wolfson cap to the Ridley Park should alleviate some of the flooding further upstream along with some being modifications it was a cut only cleaned there to some 66 to 75 percent but the build-up of a silk except true well then it not return to the design with whips and dip so it was when it was built when the old board was there we used to have a bridge running up and down the rivers he 's got in the ocean keeping the brother words to what it was and the depth to what it sure was and should be and wonder why the dredge is not back which could also swim the banks of the river with it there 's this gross spitting it into the rivers of Russia 's the other are noxious and obvious crime war between Russia 's and just helping doesn 't basically reduced to Winston 's brother all day long that 's the dredge was operating it could be tremendous banks and returning to what they were originally the riverbanks when you walk around the I feel like a wish side of downwind I enjoy drawing countries draw to call the city of Garden City were to be a very much and with my mother weeds seats without a ground around those areas displace to city the call himself a Garden City oh sorry you 've sorry that was the last one I was actually quietly agreeing with you on your last point having been around to observe and the Heathkit area is just that is disgraceful but it 's it 's something it 's giving it 's going to be got under control Sarah and then Aaron and if we have time the only but I doubt it thank you I just wondered if you were I just don 't_''_502.21 at the South Shore area in the history of protection there and I 'm just wondering if you were aware of the work that the estuary trusts are doing on the naturalization and stabilization to stop erosion in their area in their submission on the funding for this work to take place for naturalization and planting along the South Shore east edge to stabilize it and stop erosion so the E they want the ship naturally its back maybe 5060 meters away from what is easy what we say is you want an engineered as the hard edge yeah thank you that 's right yeah yeah mean they told me oh yes just the past bit smooth yeah I mean just I 'm just a quick point on your comment on the coastal pathway I just wondered if you realized that even at low tide when the estuary is mostly empty of water and South Shore is completely you know hundreds of metres away from the water that even all the way along Beach Ville on the other side of the East you the water that 's at the age twenty-four hours a day and right up against Council EC it 's such as roading yeah yeah and so it 's one of the reasons is it main difference here migration of rocks into the water yeah there 's quite a lot of people going in there looking for shellfish yeah I think it 's why they had the deeper edge that was approved around there as well anyway it 's for coming in and thank you for your submission it 's very much appreciated thank you can we move on now to Josh Proctor and I see you have a team here from the University of Canterbury Students Association well we might as well do them and then have a ten minute break yeah come come through come forward yep _"

    "text": "Katie Simons I 'll come to you first Vicki hello welcome so my name is Katie Simon 's I 've lived in Christchurch now for 15 months with my family and I 'm from the UK we did live in Christchurch as a family for six months in 2013 so before I came here in 2017 I was already familiar with the benefits of living in Christchurch and one of those benefits to me it was was the ease of getting around the city by bike so I wanted to take this opportunity to express the support for the work that you 've done in the five years since I first came to Christchurch encourage you to continue to prioritize cycling investment and talk a little bit about why I think it 's important my experience and how I think it can really help make Christchurch a city of choice in New Zealand so I own I own a few bikes but I do also in a car and but I choose to cycle them to work for my daily commute about 500 metres and I 'd make that choice the Society of the planet its pleasant it 's enjoyable it 's cheaper it 's definitely faster than going by car but also it 's safe and that 's really important but I also know that I 'm really lucky that I can say that and 80 percent of my route to work is is on dedicated cycle lanes it 's off road and part of the unicycle major cycle route and the pass through heavy park I really wish more of my colleagues had access to similar infrastructure to allow them to cycle to work because unfortunately I know that from talking to them that personal safety is is a big factor in why most of them ought to drive to work even though a few of them are quite keen recreational cyclists so I think there the general benefits of cycling friendly cities are pretty well known I 'm sure you 're all familiar with them one 's being low pollution though congestion and I 'm lucky to have experienced it firsthand because I lived in Copenhagen in Denmark for nine months and I really experienced the value converted to cycling is that brings and what a great place it is to live and but I could also see that what made it work and one of the things that many work is making sure the network was fully integrated and as various other peripherals like giving priority to give cycle parking facilities and things like that I lived in Cambridge in the UK for 17 years before I came here so Cambridge is a city in the UK that 's got the highest rate of journeys done by bike it was a really hard very hard to leave our home there and was well his family and our jobs and it was also a really great place to live but knowing that that Christchurch was also an easy place to get on by bike and was was definitely a consideration and that my husband and I took into account when we made the decision to come to Christchurch and if it hadn 't been perhaps we might not have come and I just wanted to sort of highlight that if you want to continue to attract people live for all residents and let 's maintain the investment that you 've been maintaining in cycling infrastructure there 's a global trend toward sustainable living sustainable cities and being a cycling city is I think a key selling point that Christchurch has over cities like Sydney dare I say even Auckland and I 've got three children they 're aged six eight and three and they all love cycling they all ride their own bikes they can all ride their own bikes from our house into the CBD and sometimes you take them on longer rides on tandems and trailers and things but um and and recently they had their grandparents visit from the UK we had three generations in our families cycling around a city and I just think that 's amazing I think it 's hard to do anywhere in the world let alone any other city in New Zealand let 's really celebrate that here so in summary I just want to congratulate you on your work on the major cycle routes I think it 's fantastic be aware of the noise from opponents from cycling numbers and if you continue to build safe efficient cycling infrastructure that takes people where they want to go people to use a bike really did you recognize the opportunity for Christchurch to be an exemplar cycling city and and the important contribution that can make towards making the New Zealand city of choice so I really urge you continued urge you to continue the investment you 've done in cycling infrastructure don 't leave the job half done please give more people from everywhere in the city a real choice to travel safety by bike and as my kids grow up here in Christchurch I hope their opportunity is to cycle safely and the city will grow as well well thank you very much and it 's just an absolutely spot-on in terms of the time so it 's no time for questions so look thank you very much for your contribution much appreciated all right we have a 10-minute break until 11 o 'clock I yeah because I mean I could I can see I see Derek 's arrived so we could move straight on to that one _"

    "text": "I could I invite George Parker from free Theatre Christchurch to come forward please morning George nice to see you again Thank You Me At counselors for the opportunity to speak to you today and please forgive me if I sound a little bit tired look a little bit tired we 're currently racing towards a production on Thursday and the Art Center in our space Jonah you 're all coming too so we 're looking forward to seeing you and I apologize always so for the thing that 's running across my face it 's a result of the production I guess the main thing that I felt would be useful to speak to in terms of our submission which is really focused on an around nurturing local talent towards a more vibrant interesting cutting-edge City all of the things that are featured in the LTP how exactly to achieve that I thought perhaps a way of approaching that might actually be to share how I come to be here because I really didn 't intend to be in Christchurch I went to school here and my first thoughts and in the school I was it and my one particular teacher see do you want to be Nate you don 't stay in Christchurch you actually don 't understand New Zealand you go away to London go away to Sydney so that was my teacher was actually to go to Sydney to go to neither drama school the end and I started working at a place called 40s and sea field just outside of ish burden of freezing works towards making money towards going to that drama school and I got a little bit bored all I was raising the money so I took some papers at the University Theatre papers and there I started to be introduced easily to the history of theatre a sense of its traditions but also a much more contemporary idea of theta which so until that stage I didn 't really know much about because my experiences had been here the court theatre the immature theaters that never take them and so it was I had a very Anglo view of theatre and then suddenly here was this new world that was opened production and I 'd seen her in the old free theatre and it completely blew my mind and it was a the theatre was completely converted into a nightclub for our production of Heiner müller 's Madea material every space was used the toilet under the stage over the stage in the stage in the audience you were very much part of the action and I remember at the time my peers at the University and I a twin about four or five times and afterwards would meet just just talk it through because it was beautiful and we thought this is what feeling could be and this was something there you know the city could really help nurture so I did go to NIDA I did audition and I de I got into NIDA but I decided to come back here and continue at the University and to join the free theater in I decided that it was a difference between becoming an actor a commercial entity in becoming an artist even saying that now sort of makes me feel a little uncomfortable because to say you 're an that is what I decided to do and that 's what I 've been doing ever since with my colleagues and I in a number of different organizations and artists because it 's what we do we work between disciplines we 've been creating work particularly some of you may be familiar in the post quake environment work that 's been created is includes free theater members have started kept for a feast and then of course a number of other organizations we 've started the theater in the art scene the gym in Freeth you just done a number of productions in and around the city that very much engage with this time in place because this is the most interesting thing to us in terms of making art is to engage with the time the place and to see art is not something that 's just a distraction from everyday life but a way of engaging with it and talking through ideas problems provoking conversation so I look at the LTP and I asked whether I guess the kind of activity that people like me and and others being catered for or is it being acknowledged certainly the council 's work very hard to try and make these things happen particularly in the place of quiet period and I think some of the initiatives that have come through thing truly wonderful when should be the basis now there 's nice folks where we start looking at what does the city look like teen you know 20 years from now how do we start to build on those foundations and something that can really grow and develop I think the main thing obviously and in many hats organizations and I 'm sure you 're sick of hearing this have brought up about the idea of the need for a new ass policy and there is obviously provision with and then you plan for a refeed refresh of their policy in that governance group has been started I would question whether their governance crew how that 's going to operate that there are are people that are actually working on the ground that are involved in their conversation so that we don 't just repeat the same models from elsewhere artists haven 't_''_378.2 been nurtured here a lot of them have left many of my colleagues go elsewhere like I wanted to do so I think that strategy very much needs to be based around people people from people that are working on the ground so that they can really find a way to share what exists what 's actually here what we do what could be and then how we bridge the two together because there 's not really a clear mapping of all the different groups in what they do and have what 's relative and this where it gets frustrating where a group like ours which is struggling to and finally and very challenging to operate in the city since will study about really desperately wanting to when we hear about millions for a a new Performing Arts precincts and yet and we 're asked whether we want to participate in there and of course we could and we would like to but nobody 's really asked us what we 're doing or looking at what we 've actually created and that 's why it would be what we 've actually created specifically for this production as a black box theater for you to see Ashley what you can tell you with not so much money but with passion and and a view and a vision of what is possible in a building like the one that we 've created I think particularly around festivals and events with Christchurch New Zealand there needs to be some sort of provision encouragement to base festivals around local talent neutering local talent at the moment most of the time it 's important so if festivals the ats-v Christchurch Arts Festival was a Christchurch Arts Festival was based around local talent if the chairs and blues festival was the buskers or whatever it 's going to be that would be enormously helpful in building a sense of activity and purpose and in life in the city because those those are has been told that they can function here and they can create things I think particularly yeah there 's various ideas I think around what is distinct to this city to me in this region we 're not Auckland as Auckland Tony means donate nights we 're kin tebron 's we 're not Christchurch IANS the province is a very much key to our identity urban and rural are very much cooler so if there 's an engagement around at so food is the most interesting conversation here if the Christchurch Arts Festival brought together Chiefs in artists major what might be possible okay litter just spilling now thank you thank you very much do to pick web questions yeah um I guess in any art form you know you if you can have a draw card like a key talent that 's surrounded by locals because that not only is a draw card but it also inspires and people learn went through a resource at cetera so what 's your comment with regards to the arts feast and especially the Jazz Festival really on which had a bit to do with the a percentage or a balance of the imported which I don 't quite like the tune but you bring a talent in for a reason but in a balance between debt and local is that what you 're would be great because a lot of the time local talent a Sunbrella but it basically means you just bring what you 're doing there 's no real encouragement yeah I certainly don 't have any issue with bringing in the house to work but I think if artists were actually brought in to work with locals towards creating wikia they it 's a whole different picture than just bringing in something that pre-exists like they can still happen of course there 's an obscene edge of them but I think the balance needs to shift but if there was a contractual agreement that 's guaranteed dinners and it because most successful artists do want to share their talent with happen camera so it 's a very giving absolutely yeah okay thank you jeez lean slightly provoking stones still feel through the old boys network out here that conservatism that peps keeps our young people at a distance doesn 't let them in I mean I I think there 's there 's room for everybody and at the moment yeast that probably traditionally things have been set up around very way shape or form against it I just think that strategically it would be sensible to hear of what else is out there and actually realized that this city in particular has a history of artists that have grown up on the margins are outside those yep established groups and then it 's not only created a local culture but actually influenced the National one so Christchurch those guys clicking against their conservative identity eventually created a very distinct idea of what this place is and that 's exciting I think what you 're saying is that it 's not or it 's room for both and and there has to be room for both yeah absolutely the nice it 's a spectrum and I think just it 's about balancing if the moment if it 's skewed in one particular direction that it 's it 's great look thank you very much for your time always very interesting to hear from you I can 't come on Thursday I 'm really sorry I 'm not in town oh you you can hold me today it you can with your _"

since our inception 2000 in secret on Rama he Mahana Karamu t-toku ketta ketta corridor PR Carter Carter thank you for the opportunity to speak to a submission ten akuto a ten a utter me does our counselors thank you for the opportunity to speak to this ere submission which we take it as read and I believe we don 't need to go into too much detail about introductions you know who we are and we 've been around for a years as an organisation we 're a diverse representative organization that 's champion in the central city through its recovery phase in rebuild phase and as the city is moving into the regeneration phase now more than ever it is important that a coordinated independent body such as the CCPA exists to provide a collective voice for the business community in their cohesion with the council so we 're here to principally speak to the question of funding in to ensure that we 're sufficiently resourced to carry out and complete the work and their strategic plan we 're seeking a two-year commitment of 100,000 dollars annual grant to support the implementation of our strategic plan plan and move towards an independent funding model in addition to this we 're likely to seek further support from the council spurred establishment fund to assist in resourcing growth in the ccda membership base this is to the specifically targeted to grow our membership over the coming year and which is this will be key Steve the fetus 's successfully established but in the 2020 financial year so why do we need this gap in the June generic market for the central city specifically we want to work with our regeneration partners in Christchurch in seed to look at developing the Central City brand or at least to ensure that there are strategies in place to create greater awareness of the central city in what it offers with a clear brand we 'll be able to better align with existing events in partner and developing new events that bring people into central city accessible city we came to work with the wider business community in regeneration partners to explore ways to address real perceived barriers to people coming in to town regardless of the mode of transport we want to look at innovative measures improving parking and long term accessibility to the city the exam has been transaction based incentives for parking we 're also keen to explore how businesses can play a role in promoting and welcoming active in public transportation safe city we are partnering on initiatives to make the central city streets safer especially at night in reducing the incidence of begging in other on street social issues initiatives such 's mentioned previously there progress towards financial sustainability as an organization a key outcome and a strategic plan for the next two years is to move to an independent funding model to generate resources required to run the CCPA into the scene from the first of January 2019 the CCPA executive committee is to introducing a membership fee is a stepping stone to a birth establishment Indian derived from this will be will contribute to meeting the requirements of successful burn establishment towards the end of the 2018 19 year and carrying on through the nineteen twenty year we intend to take undertake a comprehensive engagement process with the business community around the feasibility of establishing the Business Improvement District program for the central city in is mentioned running it whole in the nineteen twenty year and to do this we need to grow a membership base so we 'll actively seek to do this the value of the CCPA to the central business community is having board an engaged membership in which will enable our advocacy role to continue to be representative is the Central City community continues to support of the business community for the central city but we don 't see any questions Ciara Jamie Andrew in film and I think thank you so much for the really constructive work that you do at the Central City we don 't always get really constructive comments around for example the transport program those kind of things that you 've already we 've engaged really constructively on these two barriers and perceived barriers it 's been really good I didn 't realize until I bend your submission that it was no funding at all and I know that last year we had your deputation talking about initially it had been sixty I mean up to a hundred and we 'd meet you that support could be available this year so what would happen if we didn 't and if we didn 't fund as much as was asked would you be able to compensate by say I mean got 220 members 200 a pop would be forty four thousand dollars that kind of thing so what would happen we 're actually asking we 've gone through our finances over to as we said up resource to issue ensure that we can actually deliver our goals under the strategic plan and that means we are going to need more funding rather than less to achieve that so we want to get to the 2020 bid poll and a position where were actually truly representative of there 's many businesses we can and to do that we 're going to need that more resource so we have that she looked at the possibilities of actually less funding but it does make it very difficult going forward so what we 're asking is two years to ensure we can actually achieve our goals which we actually developed together with the council how strategic plan so there 's so you know we 've will come back as much as we can all here is that we actually can only do so we handle everything we don 't have it 's like consultants handling our social media and Yvonne would take another warm board made sure that we 're actually running like a well-oiled machine but on but do you have any contribution from your funding the goal is to obviously introduce a membership fee but we 've actually looked at that as actually some additional funding to help with air up resource to achieve our goals under restoration plan that is a modest fee that 's proposed it 's 100 a year plus GST our membership spends a quite a wide range of businesses from the people who operate out of caravans essentially to hotels can you have a graduated fee not not initially I think the the you know the fee part of it it 's just an initial step to get them used to paying something the bid poll would obviously see that fee increase so that 's the introduction of it get them used to actually you know being a part and paying for our services now we deliver to the city but obviously to achieve bigger and better things the bid poll is obviously the fourth subscription but we see that it actually a positive move to make sure that when people actually are committed whether it 's su by a target of rate or membership fee their interest voice and she increases so we see that as actually a positive move but it 's a state-by-state process thanks I note under your inner city residential eating the comments there and particularly around the support of the reimbursing or rebaiting of the development contributions for residential in the scene from City my question is how long do you see that running forward so till we how much longer should that run for I suppose that 's we see some really uptake of residential yeah in a way that actually adds some meaning to getting more people living in the city we 're not seeing that at the moment something that is due to my belief you know perceive restrictions access and parking and some of the city yes it 's getting back to the level they were pre youth plan which would include so instead of a date close date it 's a outcome and look you may have actually some other more inventive ways to activate property owners or you know to actually want to we just want to see more of an actually hit me into thank the hundred thousand per annum for two years followed by what we would hope to be a successful establishment of the Business Improvement District in 1920 would that then see you financially sustainable in a way that you wouldn 't be expecting to make further requests for council funding at that time because of that financial sustainability it 's our expectation that the targeted rate the bid polls held all over the country though they 've got a lot of success was you know we haven 't seen one down here to at this pace that we hope this is a positive move and and leading the way for other areas like New Brighton like Littleton sinem who also could actually you know go through this process so it 's really important that we are resourced well enough to ensure that we can actually prove the worth of it and getting out and make sure you having it established we believe that the target a right way she set us up in a way that will certainly put us on a good footing obviously as years roll by we want actually deliver more and again it 's a step by step process we want to get it initiated get them you know committed to being a part of the team and really is t-mister you know we 've got to make sure that we get a really successful Central City back and we 've seen over the last seven years with the lack of having you know okay he 's of Central City people 's habits have changed and we need to change them back so they come back as you did really well to use the theme of the LTP and your reply to their question so no thank you all very much we are in this together so thank you very much for your submission and also for the work that you do it 's really important for our central city that it 's alive and active and people were loving the earth so okay _"

    "text": "what sudden chief executive Cantabria employers Chamber of Commerce and I assume you have filled a shoe with you as well welcome so what I 'd like to do is just make some opening statements and trust that you 're here all with that submission and then three minutes for any questions so as hopefully most you know the cannery employers Chamber of Commerce are the largest membership based organization across the South Island and we currently have over 2900 metres from around Canterbury and the West Coast goes without saying that we are committed to the city we 're also aware of the challenges that we all confront and rebuilding and regenerate on Christchurch after the earthquakes but we are concerned that the scenario laid out in the long term plan does not deliver the vision articulated by the council and we believe that it will take a change in attitude in the excitement some different and more innovative ways of operating operating for us to realize that vision the chamber welcomes the vision for Christchurch articulated in the document of the city is a place for of opportunity new people and new ways of doing things a place we anything is possible however there is a fundamental disconnect between the stated vision for Christchurch and the proposed result delivered and the draft LTP the reality is at the level of service delivery and asset and infrastructure maintenance and development contemplated by the draft LTPS preferred option does not live up to that vision for what essence should expect the real key is that we are New Zealand 's second biggest city while we 've been through some hardship it is not unreasonable seven years on to expect to hear the comprehensible comprehensive sorry a food war plan to return er infrastructure to a standard by other cities in New Zealand a little bit of story it is also not unreasonable for our citizens to expect to enjoy the amenities that other people in similar sized cities enjoy so in short we would like to see the focus put on the hight scenario rather than the middle option outlined in the document the funding get to deliver this appears to be around 2 billion an order to bridge the altered to reflect a commitment to work at pace to get our city back to what we would expect from New Zealand 's second largest city a new approach to maximise the release of cable from the assets the city owns and a commitment to developing an innovative approach to managing SES and services a commitment to finding efficiencies and current spending a strong pathway indicating investment and infrastructure to ensure we are on the events calendar again and Christchurch and specifically the delivery of a multi-use arena and a reasonable time under the current capital program proposal the work will not be completed on the arena until 2025 we strongly endorse bringing this project forward and the timetable and great to hear a signal from you Lee and thus more knowledge but certainly in terms of the lights in light of the government 's recent announcement of support for accelerating the development of the business case for this facility in overall a commitment to a new innovative way of thinking that will ensure we can deliver on the vision that the council is espousing and we at the chamber see in our GP there is much bolder we believe that Christchurch should offer an experience to its residents that is comparable in provably exceeds other major cities however we are also cognizant of the financial challenges of delivering these outcomes that is why we are very supportive of creative and innovative solutions being found it will take a change in the way that we think about what assets we currently own how we manage them and how we maximize the returns from those assets if we are not prepared to change and to be bold we will be left with a vision for Christchurch that we will simply be unable to realize very happy to answer any questions thank you dear and regards to the assets you were talking about do you see any opportunities with some strategic partnerships rather than just selling the assets and that could deliver value to the city absolutely and I think you know there is a confusion that when we the minute we add assets and to any conversation people automatically assume that we 're talking it about ourselves and we 're not what we are suggesting is nothing should be left off the table there should be robust discussion about all of those assets and how we can realize more potential from those SS strategic partners is a great example of how we can potentially bring an additional value to those assets by bringing in a partner that has more more experience will add value to that that s it and actually invest in our city along with what the council and with the rest of the Christchurch pokey just in relation to the capital raising from the assets that we own now you 're aware of the bond raising that we 've already done you say but are you thinking then that we can just keep raising capital one those assets and so I guess the example that di just mentioned about bringing and strategic partnerships as one as one way another way is to actually look at partially sit cells so raising money through a bond as one option but it 's not the only option available to the council limiters but not know it 's the order of payback 's all so I mean it 's not it 's not a nunnery preclude you from doing the things that we 're suggesting it doesn 't know jimmy council need to consider identify new ways make those service available to a city but with our necessary only which means probably need to attract to engage with wider the potential business invest in this area but in practically how to make the happen because regarding to a break-even you know a sage or how to make the happen this man may be particularly we are very very happy to work with with anyone across the city to identify solutions because we do appreciate as we 've seen a number of times in our submission that we have some mess of challenges ahead of us so working with business and working across the city with all of the different entities is really important as we move forward to find solutions is that answer your question I 'm sorry Jimmy I mean because basically the kind of service you know that 's very important for us I mean that like a central city is real potential to look at partnerships with business and a number of areas of delivery that the council are currently involved in and it 's about having their innovative thinking and I think you know we brought in before talked about some of what they 're suggesting and even working across the region just the city I think is a different approach to the way that we are currently doing things and that is what it 's needed here is to really think creatively about how we bridge some of the gaps that we 've got thank you yeah just just trying to understand you in terms of the kind of thrust of your submission you 're asking us to reduce operational spending but you 're asking us to bring forward the things that will have a huge impact on operational spending like the stadium at the same time you 're asking us to get rid of things that bring in money to us as a city so I 'm just trying to understand from a very high level in terms of an economic sense of doing something like income we 're not actually talking about reducing operational funding what spending what we 're talking about is finding ways other ways to raise revenue to pay for it so at the moment the only the only levers that are being used are rates indeed and we 're saying there are other options something things off even partially that bring in revenue to us yeah to put into something like a stadium which will cost us a fortune to run how does that make economic sense well I think you 're also assuming by impartial as it sounds that you 're going to be worse off and that 's there is not necessarily the case so I think there are what we 're suggesting is there are a number of different things is there a number of levers that should be looked at across the whole platform rather than just looking at you know simply ditch in rates as the two levers there on different options that we need to consider absolute struggling to see from your submission is apart from partial asset sales which again I don 't quite funding would have come from for things like a stadium for example which you know we 're still paying off the last stadium that we redeveloped which was going to have all these benefits which never really seemed to be realized I think we 've I think we 've pretty much answered the question I mean one of the options as partially sit cells bringing strategic partners on board so you know there 's another option that the council has it shouldn 't be dismissed other questions look thank you very much for your time again for submitting on this this is it is a it 's actually I said this the other day and I know that the chief executive feels the same way that this is a much harder LTP than the first one the first one it was kind of what we didn 't know and we had to make decisions like pushing the stadium out and and in the timeframe we didn 't have an insurance settlement we didn 't know how much we 're going to get shortchanged on the horizontal infrastructure so we now 've got a number of challenging issues in front of us and thank you very much for going to the trouble of submitting on the on the plane thank you Thanks _"

    "text": "and Nick 's submitter as it would chalice cellies yep from senior lecturer of water policy and management waterways Centre for freshwater management University of Canterbury Lincoln University is a nice combination thank you thanks a lot yeah and thank you very much the opportunity to come and speak to the to the submission which is University of Canterbury in Lincoln University written in consultation with with colleagues here actually all of who work on different aspects of freshwater management in rural and urban settings some of the rural work also impacts on christchurch city but the submission today 's specifically focused on urban waterways and urban water infrastructure issues that we pulled out of the draft long term plan yeah I 'm a senior lecturer in the center and focus not so much on the natural science of water contaminants and and water chemistry but on policy and governance so that 's where my expertise is I wanted to just say that clearly there 's a huge challenge that the council faces with repair renewal of three waters infrastructure wastewater stormwater drinking water and we recognized that the nature through the submission just want to make a CLE or a call for a balance of restructure plan water infrastructure plan alongside to a considerable investment in community partnerships and I 'm gonna elaborate a little bit on there so when I say community partnership I recognize of course the council already works in partnership with many community groups it 's probably fair to say that 's core business of the council but I 'm just want to suggest that with water way urban water and water infrastructure this could be done in a more coordinated and strategically coordinated and better resourced way so alongside the considerable investment and infrastructure there 's scope I think for a considerable investment and community partnerships and engagement with communities households businesses however you access these people 's schools at the neighborhood scale in urban catchments and sub catchments to raise awareness build capacity motivation and tap into what 's already there actually around urban waterways foster an understanding of how the storm water system is connected to our waterways and so on which never ceases to surprise me how how little people realize think the stripe to this is already a proposal in the planets it 's actually rather be reach and the in a service plan for parts unfortunate but there 's a proposal in the plan it could well meet this the subjective and I 'll just come to that in a minute but clearly there 's a need to of this and repair and renewal of the of the water infrastructure and particularly the proposal to defer wastewater works was concerning for us and I think is possibly unwise and so there 's clearly a need to prioritize some years of work and D prior to Ric be prioritized others but particularly given the sort of increasing susceptibility of the network to you know storm events and flood events and interconnectivity between the storm water and the wastewater system deferring where sort of works and allowing the network to deteriorate further into the future is clearly going to lead to more overflow incidents more contamination of rivers and so on and I mean this is acknowledged in the plan and to some extent it 's a calculated in deliberate decision I would just like to raise now concern with that but with that idea as the draft document if consultation document acknowledges this will lead to more pollution incidents higher costs into the air into the future so I think allowing it to deteriorate may also undermine progress in other areas all the work that 's going into extreme care groups and around the waterways themselves but also work that could be done to improve the the storm water and drinking water infrastructure could be undermined if we neglect waste water infrastructure but to see it as one piece of a puzzle that if you just leave it out and you 'll jeopardize good work being done elsewhere so of course the need or the impetus for prioritizing some work and D prioritizing other areas of work is cost clearly it 's really expensive not only in terms of the capital cost of treating storm water and so on but in terms of the ongoing maintenance and repair costs there 's a huge cost as you all all know and because it 's unlikely that council can actually meet this but I would argue that that this the kind of community engagement community partnership approach could offset in the mid to long term some of the costs of treating these problems at the end of the pipe or at the bottom of the cliff if you like to use that analogy so we have strong endorse and investment by the council and this and through this plan in tackling some of these issues at source and this means investing in programs that engage communities as I said whether it be households businesses probably all of the above in caring for urban waterways so stopping these contaminants before they get into the system tackling the problem at source in the household in in in with businesses is it probably a necessary approach to accompany the kind of significant infrastructure investment going forward I 'd like to see the council fund the initiative so the specific initiative is listed in the service plan for parks and foreshore it 's detailed in the written consent for community water partnerships and I think this there 's already a wealth of community groups some of going to hear from later today networks of neighborhood associations and community groups that are out there actively engaged and looking after our urban waterways and these groups would benefit greatly from being better resourced and being able to better coordinate and and take us take a strategic and coordinated approach to it to the activities and I think that they would be an important part of a durable and long-term solution to sustain its going forward my own sort of area of research has been looking at collaborative environmental governance and it internationally and one thing that the research shows is that infrastructure and engineering solutions and regulation even will only take you so far if you don 't have community by and and ownership of these problems and solutions with communities so enduring solutions to the to the problems that we face with storm water and wastewater and urban waterways will be achieved I think we 're seeing a real solid engagement with communities this needs to be resourced somehow and it should be meaningful engagement not only will it get buy-in from communities and get them on or a lot of the earth is an energy that is out there with a lot of these groups already so just to summarize I 'd say yes obviously there 's a need to proceed with this huge investment and in renewing and repairing the infrastructure going forward but I 've just appeal for a balanced approach that doesn 't doesn 't neglect wastewater infrastructure because it will undermine progress in other areas and and it 's potentially increasingly susceptible to to environment all to storms and floods with climatic change and with the disruption that we 've had through the earthquakes it 's deteriorating and shouldn 't be lived to continue to deteriorate also to accompany infrastructure investment I think there was solid investment in keeping our communities through some kind of Community Partnership mechanism that was sort of fostering community engagement in collaboration in a strategic and coordinated way around around water will help to address these issues in a sustainable way into in the longer term thank you I just had a question and then I 'll take Pauline it 's just do you see some potential in order to improve the quality of the water that sexually discharged them to their brother yeah I think so sure and in some ways I mean there 's a huge amount of work happening on this many of you have probably aware of a lot of it it 's a huge opportunity to rethink some of the ways that we do urban design and particularly with water storm water and wastewater and so on absolutely and I just think some would be important to not and Julie or single-mindedly focus on the red zone the important issues was there and in other smaller sub catchments but they read zone can be a great enabler and it could showcase some of this some of the fantastic things that can be done with the community-based approach Pauline you 've been focusing on a new disease which would put it up and fund it a lot of status based around behavior change it 's through education of course it 's very difficult to make like to link these two link things causally so I think I 'm certainly there 's a lot community is a foundation for for building their engagement and tackling these problems it 's it 's not straightforward to say if we do this we prepare this information pack for primary schools and send it out we 're going to measure an improved quality in the rivers in five years time so as you 'd appreciate it 's quite difficult to to to establish that I mean you you have to do that really through engaged through community engagement and through in essentially some kind of evaluation or research on how these partnerships have worked but I think it has to work at the community scale at the small scale there 's probably room to coordinate a citywide awareness raising or education campaign but at the in the end I think this these kinds of projects are most effective when they happen at the neighborhood level with small streams or sub catchments and that 's where you 'll be able to identify more clearly these programs can be I think so that not simply by leaving it to communities because I think they really need resourcing they need to be the principal able to act what to be activated but they need state often need a degree of resourcing and capacity building was in some ways and support to foster what they 're already doing or trying to do and some of us just about coordination there 's a fantastic and catchment they are coming to make a submission as well so thank you very much for your submission I think it was an excellent example of that the balance that we 're seeking to achieve and the challenges that we face and doing that and how one decision in one area can have a flow-on effect and appropriately use of language to another area if you don 't take that on board so thank you very much for your submission it 's very thoughtful and very helpful thanks thanks thank you now could I invite _"

    "text": "and I 'd like to invite my fellow mere Sam Broughton mayor of the selwyn District Council to come forward and just prior to your starting I think we should just take a moment to acknowledge the scale of the Pupkin that has been grown for the competition between city and country and I think that I would like to take credit for it I planted it and that is the credit that I can take and it is the only credit that I can take I have been to observe it the first one that was grown actually beast so it sort of blew itself up and but fortunately they were able to manage to to develop this one and I 'm going to give full credit not to the person who planted it which was me but to the people that grew it on my behalf and nurtured it and a fully organic environment at the attacker o community orchard so I would like I think we should acknowledge my pumpkin in the most appropriate way can we know the bar can we learn it Albert thank you actually let me take a photograph of you seem you know because [Laughter] that 's what they always say right thank you very much so with with it and mine Sam is going to take the pumpkin with them at the conclusion of her submission in order to take it for judging and the Selwyn District Council tomorrow yes and don 't don 't eat it on the way there 's no danger of losing it okay over to you corta we 're at among a call I knew inhibit our core Krissy to Walker nor Davila ho call Sam Broughton chuckling we 're not at our tena koutou tena koutou tena koutou katoa just to acknowledge the process that you 're going through here today and will be for some time thank you for your leadership of the city you know spending time listening to ideas in reflections on on your long-term plan you put out so far I had the pumpkin there 's a little bit of a slideshow really here today but it 's great to have it and it really does speak of the partnership that levels and we have given three pumpkins to each school and so on and us and to grow them as a way of trying to understand water and nutrient use and the water and nutrients that we might put into a pumpkin grown in a garden and then think about if you explain that over 20 hectares of pumpkins what they might be doing to our echo pheasant air catchment those are the sort of things that we 're trying to get young people to think about so thanks Liam for growing one and your judging 's on Thursday and through your long-term plan thank you for the document it was great to be able to read through and I suppose I want to congratulate you on providing nothing clear ways for people to engage by saying actually spend less here you 've got the spending about right here or spends more you 've clearly identified what that might look like and for me I 'm not really here to talk about the dollars that you 're going to spend on things but a little bit about the projects so together on the West Milton Christchurch zone committee and the work that we do across Canterbury I suppose on the with the mill forum and through the Canterbury water management strategy I think Canterbury has really been an example for for New Zealand on tackle a bit of working actually works in and can provide good outcomes and questions has been a key a key player of that the other thing that has been happening is the way that through the greater question Spanish ship we 've looked at urban planning and that 's fit into roading decisions and also rhodium developments and I guess the Porsches actually say it 's probably far more than than roading roading has been one part of it and unfortunately I think it 's been far too much the key part of it and there needs to be a greater look at public transport the way that we 're moving Freight around Canterbury which needs to get off the roads as much as possible using the sea and using the port where we can and so your food great great equations partnership and just worth with us and with ekn and with y Mac I think we 're setting the city up and great across each other in a way that actually plans for our future well rather than just being reactive to and the pressures that we 've got on us right now I 'll just touch on a couple of things that were in your long-term plan proposal one that the big one I suppose is the spending on an indoor arena I think that that stadium is a Canterbury regional facility that should be located in the city but this should be an expectation in a conversation around how we fund that across the region I don 't have a magic bullet answer to what that should look like I do know that the museum and the funding for the museum is shared by omakr Inouye Selwyn in Christchurch and perhaps that may be an example of a starting point to look at could that work on a wider scale at the moment it needs Christchurch as leadership for that project to start and those conversations won 't happen until you in Christchurch the bulk of the money will still come from Christchurch even with a regional contribution so you ask them for the conversation to happen now let 's kick on with that I think we need the stadium built a nest city and would like to see that that happen and to say it 's a stadium for more than just sports it 'll be a space for activity for bringing international acts and artists to the space and will create economic benefits for for Christchurch and for the Canterbury region as people come and then travel around this awesome place we live in yeah thank you thank you first of all one welcome and thank you very much for taking the the time and the trouble to come and submit on our long-term plan I actually I may actually regardless is as indicative of the nature of our relationship and it it hasn 't happened before we 've certainly had a can here we were a bit surprised to see them here the first time but it was but and this occasion it 's it 's really it positive relationship and you know to come along and to identify that a project on our budget which has been sitting out on our budget which we 're now kind of signalling that these potential to bring forward and a number of people a number of submitters have asked us to bring it forward and that enables us to potentially bring forward a conversation with the region as well so thank you very much for bringing that to the table I 'm much appreciated so go for Tim and then Phil and we 'll see how time goes but the in yani I 'm thinking I 'm just two quick things one is with regards to roading can the pressures of your community coming and are getting held up with regards to time of travel all I 'd ask is that your planners with their planners just make sure you look at the sensitivities of our communities that are affected by there because you know there are a number of issues that we 've got and we 've got to protect those communities with the inflow so if we can your comments with regards to the stadium when we look at say the insurance I hate to mention that the distance that were traveled in the places people stayed to be able to go to Dunedin but if we also look at the Queenstown marathon that 's a single largest event and there 's 7,000 people brought into that area and that 's the area not Queenstown so I thought I 'd really like the conversation with you guys to look at having packages rather than just people come stay and go and so we 're enhancing all of our communities in Canterbury so I think that would be a really good conversation with Christchurch indeed totally and the thing that people didn 't stay in Christchurch experience so on and people that he 's saying someone experienced Christchurch because the people that live either place you know they come if you have got visitors in Christchurch on you and I you live here you travel to the mountains to go to Castle Hill if you if you so when you come to the city you know you punch on definitely actually come to Canterbury not cross your track Phil thank you Sam I think you referred to for example in transport how we shall Freight that kind of thing and in your submission to you make suggestions around bran Street where there are some congestion problems but obviously we 've been surprised around these suggestion of grade separations like especially in a what am wondering seem is where that might fit in terms of the government policy statement strategic directions if we look at things like for example livable cities in New Haven form public space in that whole environmental path reduction of emissions if you might make a comment on how that might work in future and I know that isn 't the only suggestion you make yeah I think that well the current GPS focus is actually really on on safety in reducing the road toll to well road deaths to zero I think with Braun Street like there is with will you come from a high speed zone into into a slower zone and Evans on both ends they just needs to be an understanding that linking their two districts there needs to be work done on both sides so it 's not just the piece of infrastructure itself and so if we 're deciding to put a road anywhere only in a livable space urban planning and eroding networks needs to match up and align I think that 's the same with our public transport we can 't build a space and then all of a sudden decide that public transport might suddenly pop up and three years time once people have really decided to buy cars so there needs to be strong planning on both sides so Sam besides us council talking with the NTTA it would be good to talk with you as a neighbor good thinks in fixin ya need um just two quick things one is I just wanted to know if you guys have considered an an off road cycleway linking along the southern motorway to Rolleston and any progress on that and then the second question was you 've talked about the importance of the region and and contributing to the Metro Stadium which is great are you also is seeking additional money from us to put into the events that would encourage people to come and visit your region as well so I don 't think that we should be funding the Metro facility and just use it would I think the bits of facility that actually serves the population that 's in Christchurch and the same way that we provide parks and indoor centers so that it to me it 's a different conversation than the stadium itself it is it is a wider conversation I mean the Christchurch in Z is an amalgamation of CDC and CCT Christchurch Canterbury tourism so it 's always been a regional kind of organization but it hasn 't it hasn 't had direct contracts with every component within the region I think your answer is absolutely spot-on but Christchurch in Z is named Christchurch indeed as much for its city status as it is for its Gateway status so you know but it 's a wider conversation that Christchurch NZ would have to have because some of the council 's in our region have their own economic development agencies they together so right answer wrong question I just want to clarify I was talking about the stadium not the Metro sports facility yeah the Metro sports facility I think is Christchurch funded absolutely stadium I think it 's a regional SES where the discussion is okay but then around Christchurch in Z again let 's talk about these things I suppose it 's from here today yes I we work together on so much stuff which make sure we have open conversations and leave together there suck way is plenty of it 's in our long-term plan and as part of in GTS work along the motorway as well yeah excellent well thank you very much for coming in and you 're always welcome here and I really appreciate the time and effort that you 've gone to to make the appearance this morning and I 'd invite you to take my Punk there 's a pretty heavy pumpkin just think just like how much soup that 's gonna baby no flavor right thank you _"

each of the community boards has has 20 minutes and how you choose to use that as entirely over to you but I would advise you to leave a little bit of time so that councillors can explore with you some of the issues that you want to raise all of your submissions have been read by councillors and so it 's really important that when you come to the table that you really touch on the issues that are important to your community so could I invite Sam McDonald and I don 't know the others I don 't know if you 're bringing your deepsea up to the table as well Aaron new role as the chair of Pendleton were mighty here woods community board what I think it 's quite an articulate and well for a submission to you today also acknowledge Aaron is added each year and he 's also spent a lot of time working on this what we thought we 'd do today is provide before we go into the detail of the projects a bit of a context about our wards and it 's always important I think of the demographics we have over an hour part of town and I think that really plays a role and the projects we 're advocating for so I 'll do that talk about how we engaged and the Aneta highly we 'll talk about some of the projects we 're looking at and then Erin is very keen to talk more about some of the projects and as Leanne said we 'll certainly leave time for questions it 's a fennel to my Mary here with tradition that we are concise and to the point so we 'll leave plenty of time for you to come back to us I think it 's really important to note at the aging population particularly in our findell in the area and sort of those larger homes I also like to point out to any community group indeed you guys today that we have a large number of housing New Zealand properties and our Ward ironically they 're actually in predominantly in the phenols and Ward and the back of brand WA and then I guess the other side of that is that deprivation of these so we have a really broad spectrum ranging from a1 and the Homewood area right through the nine and jelly park so I guess what we 're trying to do is just paint a picture that you know there 's a really diverse population in our area who will contribute to our community what I wanted to do is just take you through just really quickly our wards so if we look at Pendleton first the median personal income you 'll see up there is 35,000 and 700 the average house price is 855 thousand and their annual rates contribution is 41 million I was looking average house price the rate increase would be five point seven two percent based on that at the moment if you look at my ward that one Maori group the median personal income is in line generally with the city at twenty nine thousand four hundred at the average price house price is 600 eight thousand and our annual rates contribution to the city coffers as nearly 27 and a half a million based on that we would get a 5.6 percent rate increase based on the current LTP and then here would Ward Aaron Cohen 's work we 've got a median personal income of 32,000 an average house price of nearly seven hundred and thirty and via annual rates contribution is nearly 33 million dollars based on that we would get a five point six seven percent rate increase on that average price I think this is quite an interesting graph if you if you 've got a chance to have and look up at the screen and it breaks down are the proposed capital expenditure versus the rate take in those rules and obviously that 's just signifies that you know we practice what we preach and we don 't ask for a lot but we do contribute significantly to the city obviously you 'll see Linwood central and Heathcote is substantially higher and I think that 's you know everyone will understand this predominantly due to the central city rebuild but but I think if there 's one thing to take away from this that 's certainly a really good step for the day for indeed the rest of the presentations I thought I 'd just touch on briefly how we engaged and I 'm sure that as you 've all been working through your LTP engagement you 'll realize that it 's a lot easier to go to the people then have the people come to you we found that the culture the law was a really effective way and we were hit over 15,000 people come through in a couple of hours and indeed you 'll see the picture up here with ref and the two airings outside Bishop Dowell mall and I think it 's really important and we 've certainly made it genuinely take their views on board so then you know before I hand over to Aaron I just wanted to touch on a couple of the key concerns from our engagement are the first one and again don 't shoot the messenger we 're passing on the feedback from our communities was the concern spent concern over the money spent on cycleways you know from my point of view there 's been three things that have come out of this process you know the rate increase we consider is quite high the cycleways obviously is a concern that people are raising with us and I think the water chlorination which you know is obviously an issue you 're all working through at the moment so if we look and I will pass over the errand to go on these and go into these in detail but just a really broad level we want to focus on the regeneration of Bishop Dell we want to look at and you know we 're obviously in full support of traffic lights in the brains and he would and gardener 's Road intersection we and we would like to see some toilet facilities it like along with a deferment of the wheels to win the cycle ways and then obviously as I pointed out at the beginning with the rate increases across based on the damage house price we 're really keen to see that rate increase driven down because it does disproportionately affect you know properties within our area so look I 'll pass it over to Aaron to go into a wee bit more detail then we 'll conclude and then happy to take questions of that slide is probably these two things I 've just like to highlight there and one is the the lake roto and it used to be the site of the former why Mary council landfill it 's a fantastic character about these two lakes is basically action like so one predominantly for the jetski in Canterbury group as well as the other Lake has a huge variety of recreational uses from dragon boaters learn to sail what 's just goes on in cinema it is open for public to access it 's had a tremendous amount were supplied paid for by the recreation groups two supplied by Council when you have two three four thousand people there in a day those has quickly become overwhelmed these issues around just the management of its space and try know that staff working on which we certainly appreciate twelve months ago the the issues that were at their lake were slightly different there are getting kind of security and that kind of thing now it 's just the the amount of use that it gets is history to say in the LTP there are two toilet facilities on budget once and the north ones to the south about 3,000 per unit we would like to request that one of those facilities be brought forward and the LTP so that that 's installed a little bit sooner than what 's currently being and then that would go on to the regeneration of Bishop Dowell particularly the bishop Dowell mall fears are currently like a grim sight there that is quite damaged it 's beyond cost-effective appear as well as the use of facility it 's just not really suitable for and the RTP from deferring one of the tort facilities at Weatherwax fear and bring that into the shutdown wall so it 'd be a public facility public toilet facility that 's available 24 hours a day as you 'll know the bishop Dowell mall library and community center and Ralph Paton it 's just being the tour facility beer is only you know during effectively like reopening hours and things like that so that 's major fantastic so look just in conclusion right through it sorry I 'm not the best PowerPoint mover so you probably missed a couple of these as we 've gone through but just to conclude and I think our submission genuinely articulates and the views of norway 's Christchurch you know we 're strong advocates for minimal rate increases a real focus on core infrastructure and services and we 'd like to see the annual general charge inflation improved and that hasn 't moved in a couple of years so we 'd like to see that we generally aren 't supportive of the bridge or of original fuel tax and we 'd like to your continual drive for efficiency within the council I think that is showing real dividends the last point there is just greater delegations to boards and would continue to encourage their I know Leanne 's very strong on it and we genuinely would like to see more are being done at a board level so look thank you very much for your time and I hope you can take on board some of the points from our presentation I 'm happy to take any questions with any other time we 've got remaining all right plenty of time Mike Jimmy Phil Glen the key yarny I don 't know but I suspect cycleways Yossi requesting for us to defer it in the long term so part of your decisions here Wood Road couple institutions on Huard Road where actually if you did the cycleway those intersections would be upgraded and so you realize obviously with the cycle ways that the funding is two-for-one and but of course just the road in project it would actually be wonderful one death in ZT I agreed lose funding so well my understanding was each year in turn sideways Suzie not well for the wheels to win so there is some caps on oh but with the wheel still wins obviously well you psych away so therefore it would most likely get the two-for-one funding and we get staff to answer that question but we know yeah but we know for sure so so therefore if that 's the case if it 's the will stir wins wins the world was to get two-for-one funding would therefore your board still want to defer it or would you actually want to bring it forward so we can execute those intersections folks and actually a bit of cost for the right path well I think the first point is that with the traffic lights at here would brands which we get a lot of feedback on locally I mean look if that was the case and if we were putting that in and they were coming as part of it that may be something we 'd consider I think that the the general point in that from the engagement we 've had was that you know city we were looking and being pragmatic and our community is an area where we could save the city money and with that be deferring it for some time so we 're not saying we 're opposed to it entirely we just think that at the moment you know if you talk to general if you 're talking to the public in our communities it 's the fact they can 't drive on our roads properly and that they 're facing some severe rating procedures so we 'll probably always disagree on it essentially because obviously the soccer wave goes through through my ward as well and actually I 'm hearing the difference during from my community they 're actually very concerned that these cycle waves have been deferred because they 're actually a really good thing for not just people trying to get to work on a boat but also a lot of a lot of kids I 'm hearing an opposite sign from from my legend but when you look at the actual funding mechanism in trying to actually make the the right pads dollar go even further a lot of side benefits from just doing the cycle wave which would be the intersection improvements that your community board are actually calling for so to me if we 're looking for actually trying to improve these intersections which I actually I agree with we need to do then potentially trying to defer the soccer way it 's not the best way to do it actually bringing it forward would be because actually we 're going to help the rate pair out in many ways but I think they were getting more funding from both NZT Oh kind of don 't wanna I don 't wanna interrupt this wonderful speech talk to fit you and we when I just yeah let 's try it I think I speak to that is depending on where the Restylane cycleway actually goes which intersections thing actually goes through some there 's probably two or three different routes that it 's currently being kind of and at least a couple of those it doesn 't go through specifically the he would careers intersection the amended LTP a couple years ago had a 2.4 of the most dangerous of high-risk intersections along the he would Road corridor and so from a safety of all road users point of view the reprioritization of spending money towards improvement safety particularly if that one now that 's also been now to fruit from the current LTP yeah that 's of concern for me and it 's one of the reasons why we 're saying look at deferring we don 't think that the money that the government of subsidizing will disappear the national government obviously started that the subsidization process of cyclist and the current government I can 't imagine that removing if not increase so yeah if that if the current government wants to come to the table with even more subsidy and yeah hey it 's let 's discuss the thing but under the current budget constraints that the council is in right now obviously it 's developing day by day water chlorination ashita well it 's issue is is day by day this is this is one aspect that we can say let 's push this back out for now Jimmy the rates to we review even percentage e popular for hungry in the four and a half million dollars so ha so point of firepower between the two five four million dollars but here you patty go emphasize still have a son or a project or items need to be take other higher priority particularly you mentioned like regeneration pichia tear more and the for intersection of you know the your roading etc but you proposal is only learn winds two wheels psycho will party beautiful to spend most party to support those a for intersection loading area just questions popular party still not sufficient so do you think of what kind of party either in your poor or citywide puppet can beat up in full I mean you make an interesting point the reality is we didn 't come here today were the list of things we we want and things that we we can 't that we won 't have that we can 't fund so what we 're saying by the deferment of the wheels to wins is that actually substantially we contribute a lot more back to the city want so we 're not coming and saying you know here 's twenty three million back or whatever it is and we want twenty three million more in our community we 're saying actually here 's twenty three million bag we want about five so we 've kind of think we 're being responsible in that respect and sort of demonstrating that we 're not wanting to take take take we 're giving back as well which hopefully reduces that burden on our ratepayers so as a board we did discuss levels of service around very local and specific project I could rattle off a couple in our field like kill on Creek Road there 's a cheers installation artwork in 2027 2028 it 's up for renewal its 85,000 for that there is a it 's a Western Reserve learn to ride a track of myself it 's a fantastic learning to ride facility for children to you know learn how to ride with a roadmap and this kind of thing again it 's up for renewal out 220,000 it 's really really good so when it comes to know doing some of these things is something that you know we certainly would love to be able to bring these things and kind of highlight them to counsel absolutely you know you note from the discussion that we had with the external advisory group last week that we want to review levels of service for precisely that reason so thank you for those examples Phil so parents and you 'll be aware that two of our strategic priorities one is active travel and the other one is Safe Communities so like if we take your referring to wheels to wings if we take your part of the city the it you 'll be aware the airport is one of the biggest employers are in the city a large number of people commuting to the airport in from your area so if you you 're saying don 't do that we lost awareness but how can you actually in doing that how can you actually ensure the safety for people who want to commute to work to the airport at by bike is compete with those and cars I 'm wings there 's two access roads to that 's obviously just being improved it was still currently is you know the most dangerous intersection of Christ but that 's Memorial and Johns Road but now with the new absolutely these two access points there now that why recce roads been closed off and that 's a he would wrote and underneath the underpass and in the second ones through memorial if you 're looking at the catchment for the people to use that underpass and then also the distance that people will all cycle the numbers that cycling team cycle from Crofton road north sorry west to the airport right now I don 't see it I don 't see major cycle way would likely lead to an increase in children biking to school and the impression is there would lead to a dramatic increase I really would like to know whether other people that have questions are going to focus on the on the one cycle way or where are we got other issues yeah I got another si Glenn on social housing my question so at the beginning in your ward you talked about the aging population given that baby boomer bubble is coming through will need obviously to provide for social housing whoever delivers it will get in a big pickle have you got any ideas over it where extra funding would come from for more council units yourself yes so our submission wasn 't advocating for more social housing we were just explaining that there is a demographic within our society that is supported by the council in the government yeah that so the question is around council supplying more units my well that we didn 't actively discuss the set of board level but if you were to ask my opinion I would look at upgrading current council units to make them more liveable so you 're looking at upgrading insulation to make making them a better living environment for the current tenants rather than expanding the program right now and waiting to see what the government will bring along from its I I am actually gonna give you another two minutes because I should have pulled up another counselor before so Vicky Yanni Erin when the toilets can they be done within the existing budget by reprioritizing I believe so yes exactly the second one the fuel tax is interesting given that you want to keep rates down so if for example there was a four cents per litre fuel tax that would reduce rates by about 3% so if you 're still not looking to have any other sources of income apart from the home as it people own fuel tax is regressive it 's gonna hit low-income families hardest it would be similar to increasing GST it 's going to yeah and low-income families will have fuel efficient and they may even need several vehicles because the public transportation system isn 't efficient enough they could well have three vehicles with a family is rather able to dispense all the costs we 've gone to their house certainly you 'd rather all the costs we don 't right then spreading I think it 's around reprioritization of capital so it 's being brought up the EAG last week that certainly summarized what the board was thinking and discussing basically we believe the spent better particularly around procurement yeah need I think you I 'm just a very short question in terms of the groins roto coyote master plan is your board driving that and do you have a timeframe for that being complete okay I 'm just really keen to pick up the issue of the toilets and I 'm not quite sure seeing as we have to wait for that plan before we can make a decision on the toilet yeah staff is obviously doing the work and they 're gonna come back to us once they 've done that but we 'd like to see this though yeah the biggest issue here I think is around the transfer of surplus to the extension of these issues around surveying that land and bringing it into the larger groynes Regional Park so I 'm just trying to think what resolution that we can pass that would help you get the toilets we can we can deal with it separately we 're dealing with the hearings today we 'll be working back again through the community board chairs prior to making any resolutions and Aaron I 'm sorry but you 're going to be able to have your discussion directly with your own community board so thank you guys very much for presenting to us today and we will we well that 's not helpful actually really it 's just right yeah thank you very much you could I invite the Ross McFarland for the horse war Hornby Brooklyn Community Board to come forward look we 've got 20 minutes per community board I allowed 20 minutes so people want to our questions then please keep the questions focused and short but also can you let me know that you want to ask a question early on on the piece because if I don 't write your name down then you aren 't going to be added to the list at the last minute if we get to the end of question time so I 'm trying to be fair to everyone we 're under a strict timetable and I did allow an extra two minutes for that one and one question turned into three and that happens from time to time so to be Ross so thank you for stepping in I know that mics not well and we really appreciate you coming today thanks for the opportunity I also like to take this point to thank the staff I think their levels of information that we have got and received and this long-term plan has been superior other years and we 've been able to make more informed decisions particularly costs and particularly across neighboring boards we have a better idea of what our neighbors are doing so our board considers the council 's approach to be pragmatic and its goal was seeking to strike the balance between the many competing demands infosys the board acknowledges the big issues for the council over the period of the plan the focus taken by the council and generally adopting a medium approach and forming this budgets for key infrastructure projects is understandable the board is pleased with the levels of intended investment is recognition to the intensification and growth occurring and the greater self with you is available some of those examples obviously the rekelen community center the which the plans aren 't leisure center I 'm going project the chains Road couple issues the year which is mainly to do that the prostitute southern motorway to and the interfacing of their areas and those roads a teacher one area our board is disappointed with is that one project and particularly bred short ears we 're extremely disappointed to know that it 's been slipped outside the first three years of the LTP it came into the LTP and 2013 I understand we 're often asked to sweet assets I can absolutely assure you of visiting this area yesterday the CC is deep there 's nothing left to come out of it it 's back at me and I think the promises that we 've made of the community to restore the level of service back to that area as as well overdue indicative costs tears on your agenda yes it hurts but it has to be fixed we 've got to carry on maintaining our board regarding the making progress question and the prosecution 's either such a board sort of see that at ten point two million dollars they 're receiving four million maybe um the ability for error council holding companies to talk those points up and I know we like to take the return of them but that 's an area where our council holding companies actually return better by having these events ie pair of what ports etcetera so our point is that we cannot support that additional one for the question boy approach NZ our residential rate rises that 's the Tuffy we all know what we 're up against there there 's a borders concerned though tonight the compounding effect of the projected rate increases over those coming decades example would show understand dear boards followed since 2014 through to 2024 under this long-term plan puts a reasonably priced house at 51 percent increase over that area that I 'm sorry period so that takes it from four thousand seven hundred and ninety five to seven thousand two hundred and forty one and that if you 're on a fixed income at sadducees absolutely unsustainable rates policy rule rates affect self posterior because of error and boundary obviously in formulating this submission the board is reflected of the council 's current policy but graphic on you over here dear this is an area and the Southwest at his undergone the revision by the council 's writing staff this is what they see is the correct rating the twenty fives on the board are the ones that received that remote rule rule right the ones that pay the residential rate so these are similar sized properties doing similar things in very close proximity yet just by being the neighbor to an hour or a 25-year that person 's receiving on-base general rate of 4,000 about a thousand dollar rebate and it makes it you know pretty it 's a costly year it 's our policy it 's wrong this come before us and the 2015 and long term plan as well they proposal and I think councillor Galloway the for here sorry for bringing that will be coming to the Finance Committee I understand we need to review this policy this is the start doing the best they can was bad policy you 've got hours and twenty fives as neighbors the substantial amounts of money and but yeah it 's wrong so we ask the board respectfully requests that the council initiate a review of its presence rate policy the aim to be clear and degrees that the traditional property Bates race system is not sustainable for our ratepayers than the years covered by this plan and we do have to look at our other alternative forms of income not an easy one this obviously we can 't keep taking off here um council hold companies to the degree we are but some things that our Board considered potentials were the tourist bid tax Airport landing charges or review there the free admission for visitors to museums and art galleries perhaps we could buy our Airport landing charge text in there and give them free entry by default so we had museums in the the board offices full support for the indicative funding in the lat and the draft long-term plan for the multi-purpose arena pretty critical to our area I think we 've seen that it would be good for our city in the greater regional area and I think you 'll find must broaden offering that the region should be paying the greatest year for that as does happen in the wellington area and the target area the board also urges the council would open it optimize the revenue generated from development accomplish contributions to keep up with the growth demand I do note here though that we develop as our allies we need to get our city to the population we had previous break we 're not there yet so these guys help us get there by their developments it 's an easy hit on development charges and we have got to help them across the line they have this appearance of being fat yet so I would suggest that 's not the case I was pretty hard market out there in development at the moment flood protection this is a big cost a lot of this is residual work in futures works to be undergone and mainly the halls will Ward but for the protection downstream of Kashmir sprayed and Lynwood central out towards the history on completion of the Hendersons basin has proposed it surrounds will equate to the area the located primarily in our ward will contribute much to control the flooding for those downstream communities accordingly the board fully supports all such flood protection critical related projects and we fully support the strategic Glen acquisitions fund and I just note on that that had some of those 15 20 year old purchases of properties and areas in the south west not been made 20 years ago we would not have these options to create these type facilities here what we pay now obviously for what we couldn 't potentially pay if not more in the future our board on drinking water totally support the council and its initiatives there and obviously that 's got to got to be our priority that 's as good as a picture on air as water transport our board fully supports the inclusions of some major projects in the transport area the written bus priority and public transport corridor these are major works and that 's the effect of it they 're graphic there they deep down trench works across or side down most used bus route and it 's going to create major near is a real improvement on the speed appeal of the area and yes it 's gonna be a tough project that one thank you for the funding it has to happen the infrastructure underground is as as bad as barrel to use the just moving on the the board also note that there 's a number of other strategic corridors one of them being that Lincoln Road corridor our board reiterate its view on the importance of the strategic and transport link and this is to gain access to new yep if we don 't get public transport priority down to down the road corridor towards Falls Road we won 't have the ability to service these new developments the roads are clogged now it 's a very small section of road that we 're talking about and it 's the link between high road and good that 's true police Waterloo Business Park we are bored very much thank the council for including this increase this is a critical road linked to a first developing industrial area the road presently services is totally unsuitable it has gone a projects and that 's primarily because we have to deal with them kiwiRail in relation to the the Waterloo Business Park developers have been very forward in and added considerably to the ear on required development to get this rolling link across the line and just like that any business that we can get in this business but is one that probably won 't go I can go to the would also like to ask some long-term funding in your plan funding for some strategic corridors and here we 're particularly talking about the issue mini Road corridor we have had some initial briefings on this this is one that is very very heavily used by cyclists it 's it 's one of those runs that goes up and it 's ghosts and they love the obviously appreciate going up on this real gone dear it is an unsafe Alegria de about two years ago the whole area how the traffic comes into that link needs to be redesigned and you can see the scars in the middle on the hill see it is we 're getting more development on and Kashmir Road has no intersection available no good intersection at the bottom of Westmoreland there 's another four hundred homes going at the top of Westmoreland which will take the the homes to about 1200 and we would like consideration in the pretty short term that we get some beta access via roundabout or integration going back to facilities this thanks for the record in Community Center 1b library obviously we were so very supportive of their replacement of the occult which was like the one who stopped good that was removed navel point project for error and exponential a team just regarding benefits in the South which we get a lot of amenity area which comes with the areas of storm water detention etc the tends to be a perception that some of that is reserve lend its able to be used all the time for recreation unfortunately it 's not it 's flooded for a good percentage of the time it 's very wet the board has the view that if we are taking reserve areas that we take the land as opposed to the money it the cash it 's gone whereas if you have the land you 've still got the a seat and the benefit and the humanity level that comes with it which could always be developed better in the future the board repeats the support for the continuation of the strategic acquisition and it 's primarily as future proofing of our areas the board also think the council for and support the council the 1.9 million towards the landmark brand family a heritage fund and and we in the record in the area have just been grounded some funding for Paul Lodge which is terrific and that will add a little historical to a new development at the other side down naked and I suppose there are other comments and these are very aspirational we would like some funding to initiate appropriate this investigation towards the needs of an indoor velodrome cycling is one of our most popular sports performance cycling as it 'll live all that the facilities we have it employs you to say Delisle I think we all know that member goggles got better than us was a shame soon after the US but they expiration all things that we very much like the council we also thank the council for the continuation of its community grounds these small people really bring out the best of citizens the actual benefit thank the council for returning some of those some maintenance issues and I think that 's been touched on in the previous presentation we 're giving citizens of 5.5% rates rise potentially we would all like to think we 're trying to get something better in the levels of service back so you 're happy to take questions I don 't have a gallon for time two minutes twelve so Sarah and then term I think that 's probably all we 're gonna get to so if we get to you fellows after if we get to him Sarah thank you um and it was it 's a really comprehensive one and I thank you for that just quickly the exam just a bit of a disconnect between two of the comments here I was trying to understand with the UM the main map here at such as I once in the central city those key landmarks and the grant for that and yet you 're very firm that you 're really reluctant to hit the rates increases was the border where because the wording isn 't particularly clear in the document I don 't think that the continuation of the 1.9 million per annum to the lire Maggie grant fund would mean a rates increase on top of the five point five I didn 't read it yes in the moment it kind of reads like we 've already budgeted for it and then should we continue it but actually it 's not in the draft currently in eating the 1.9 would mean probably a point four percent on top of the five point five with the board aware of it I think in relation to Heritage it 's it 's a difficult one we 've got a critique yeah similarly to the Christ Eugene 's II figure about point four can we afford it well anything hurts obviously I was just checking on how that question was written with you thought yeah if it could be slaughter 's the tough okay thanks okay um Tim to yeah announcer along the lines of yees or no would be acceptable at this point I think probably if given that the level of investment that we 've taken and land acquisition and the very specific point between rights and Curless right the designations been in place for some 59 years we own most of the land there 's a few more properties to buy we 're buying a component of it is a designation and requirement from the Health Board for the frontage for the nor we search which links some domain t receiver in X row we 're doing that now the area is changing predominantly to commercial by the Medical Center and a new to me it is a feel like it 's the neat between the the sandglass we 've got flow one end and it flows out the other it 's technique of the scene and the anti so just struggles I think we 've made preparation for it so high on the list for yeah from Network people in the team that presented well I I don 't like the word for laning to me if we use multimode with public transport priority will get a better level of acceptance and obviously the subsidies to that we get by putting in public transport remember the section sales in divorce with state highway 75 if we do out that means ETA will do the abit and I think we 've seen that of recent government announcements it 's excellent look thank you Thank You broths and thank you for stepping in and in playing this role what 's been greatly appreciated and it 's been a very valuable submission so thank you very much deliberation thank you we 'll be seeing you before then could I invite and Stuart for the coastal bare wood community board submissions committee along with Tim centers and income money thank you all for coming this morning and as usual stunning photographs to greet us to your submission you might call it an annual plan like Christchurch to a house and the coastal board Ward was the living room with a huge panoramic window so he has the house of the a great start on the living room with a new children 's play area just outside the room and a few other improvements there in the pipeline which we appreciate however the family revised its LTP budget for the house and unfortunately the issues in future potential of the living room were not reflected on the family 's new budget the question is does the family really appreciate the full potential of this room currently near our budget item is missing the living room requires an antique commitment from the family in order for this room to catch up the commitment and investment would attract residents visitors provide huge with creation opportunities increase rate tape bring value and words to the recovery and regeneration of not only the living room but also the rest of the house so what does this potential actually look like the LTP talks about areas of growth here are some of our current and potential growth areas on the top left we have two hot new high schools got residential red zone wisten subdivision qe2 lured Hospital near Brighton foreshore developments any Brighton master and work that they are doing the question is do you see us as a growth area community initiatives we mentioned this because our community do not just have their hands continually help out but on the country their hands are continually getting stuck in after me amazing community have raised and contributed millions of dollars towards events and fantastic community facilities well done to them we appreciate and acknowledge you and does essential that our existence there are existing and proposed LT items by retained for our Ward and our teepee question has the council got the balance right our board said no Parliament Pro primarily because Tim preached flood protection and civic permanent no budget history each earthquake repairs replacing what we had no budget steps River catchment issue snow budget regeneration plan strategies no budget on the slide above you see here Thompson part car park and graphic the main tennis courts Thompson Park is a highly utilized park and skate park by the beach safety issues need addressing and are a great concern to us the community and the police we require additional budget next year to domain alongside Thompson Park has an 11 year old management plan other than two items of sports two from the tennis court renewals which the board weren 't retained there is no budget to implement the plan the board request 350 p.m. for the next five years we have also highlighted other things in our written like New Brighton Richmond or a plague of biblical proportions the midges Lynnwood central his cut very pleased to see budget allocated however for the call and much management plan to be implemented this needs to be increased to three hundred sixty year fourteen years program reprioritization earthquake ketchup is needed for example at one screen this is cocaine reserved by wynonie bridge on your Brighton Road this historical reserve carpet is used to store current construction material a real other examples the new Brightman breezes row potholes and flooding on pages and you Brighton Road Transport on the list of lifts as I 've just explained this is what we have on the right is what we would actually quite like however we note that the priority prioritization of works is based on east current low traffic volume roads that are in poor condition may not meet this meet this threshold where does earthquake and regeneration start with this criteria through community conversations in the OTP engagement our community who basically told us that the 206 million on cycle wave is not a priority given the day-to-day issues they still face an our board agrees a higher priority for our community in relation to transport was invest and improve our public transport connections in services you can 't get a whole family on a bike but you can get a whole family on a bus in principle we support cycleways here we believe a queen state council asked the government to expand the subsidy as this study is still in a coma stage n direct impacts of all that aforementioned issues to our community are and has been social health and safety economic psychosocial and social degradation to name whew this is a direct contrast to what we the counts were aiming towards I quote the LTP heavy AusAID document Christchurch a place of opportunity for all places has open to new ideas where anything is possible this is a great vision this is the positive lens that needs to be worn when finding budget and solutions for our board to free flood protection this is an aerial shot of the south shore showing the temporary Bund which protects about 500 families in their homes the next photo is on the left-hand side you see a picture of a existing wall bubble that was there and pulled down after the earthquake got damaged and you can see on the right-hand side that 's what it looks like now next page shows what a big time looks like it 's quite nerve-racking for the residents and after this is it some flood line after the big time on the 2nd of bid Bree she can see the temporary Bhangarh overtopped lucky there wasn 't a big weather event with it real worried even though we are thankful for the temporary bond it has given a little Tim little long-term confidence to the families that live there they are now finding out that some people are trying to build to bind their section and getting resource consent this is this is not good for the community this that is trying to get itself back on its feet this this is to do with being in the high flood area zone let me remind you that a big part of Christchurch would be in the zone if it was not for the stop banks and the ymax Sumner and Haven River temporary stop paint do not give anybody confidence would you go for a long drive with your family and if your mechanic had said that he had done temporary repairs or no brakes as you were seeing the latest slide the social residents asked a coastal engineer Gary ter to do a plan for the permanent protection of the history I 'll talk to that later we fill as planned as exciting as it covers all the needs in protection aesthetics network with a soccer walkway on top what is it concern in the region strategy plan for South Shore South Brighton is there is no budget this is are wearing on to South New Brighton you can see in this picture here this is damaged in the earthquake and they 're performing very well you can see the trees behind are in excellent condition and of course them next photo will show you another particular bit where it 's undamaged and don 't very well their next photo this is an example of the problem we are now facing we have lost approximately 20 trees with another 30 at risk of going this year with another 6070 behind them apart from being unsightly these pose a big danger to the users of the council walkway alongside the local campground is next to this and has visitors from all over the world what an impression they must get when they see this see the next slide I must remind you to see those that tree there it 's falling over that 's falling towards the pathway it could hang up there another tree this is happening all the time and this is what we 're gonna end up if we do nothing about it there 's so many trees there this is not a quick fix we don 't protect it we 're gonna get thousand dollars to remove there 's approximately a hundred trees they 're at risk contractors who have been doing the work on the nearby jetty and surroundings have quoted five hundred and fifty thousand to repair the history history yet if we don 't do this we would look at this danger we face for many years to come and go back to that plan Leah Gary tear coastal engineers plan and mention this showcasing our area with adaptation to future weather events an amazing cycle walkway nature visit as we all know the vistas are stunning and the amount of people appreciated now is amazing this could link out to all the cycle lanes walkways around the area in fact wouldn 't it be great if we could have a bars like they 're doing Nelson that takes people and cyclists to ricklefs to link up with the cycle wait yeah if you see on the next photo there this is Gary 's plan it 's a soft edge that he 's even drawn a bit of a plane like it could be a goblet Island the yellow place about the catchment working party consisting of pepernoten US coastal Burwood community boards and the community this working party has been meeting since July 2017 to provide community and put into a decision making about the Styx River catchment particularly in its lower reaches the catchment extends 24.8 kilometers from here were to push up dollars through to Belfast and more recently Chris Preston 's development drainage exits into the Stokes river concerns have been identified early go to those different questions later the recommendations one an increase of 400,000 annually between 2018 in 2021 that is to do further dredging of the river blockages areas were identified as appropriate number two long-term budget requirement for us of 600,000 for a long term strategy both the board saw this is vital for a Styx River master plan for a hundred year plan with staff and community engagement involved in number three long term budget requirement of 40 million and we ask you to refer to the gdh report a one-off action over three year period to compensate for the under maintenance of the river since 1993 more recently we 've the community that point to the visit the Aranui pumping station and the water systems under providing and it seems that the build was not to manage future growth this also includes evidence by reports of groundwater entering the sewer system and celebrators into their open River this means increasing pollution breaches will be a serious environmental and health issue and moving back to Barrett again an area wide community meeting facility for beer with three suburbs equal one community facility of all the studies suburbs devastated by the Canterbury earthquakes beer would Avondale and Downton were hit the far west by the West they lost their neighbors shops churches and schools and more than that they lost a sense of community belonging as they continue to face constant change social isolation is a major concern there is no meeting facility and any other seat these suburbs there weren 't prior to the earthquakes the subsequent Residential 's red zone and followed by formation of regenerate held the community to ransom however there are no had been no recovery projects that have been planned in all this time these communities of these concerns auctioned a research study for coastal bear wood boards they showed very clearly a need for a community meeting facility in the west of the board the board has also received a deputation seeking support to save the Burwood school hall for community use when it was publicized that the Burwood primary school would be demolished the concerns go back that far earlier this year with funds from the community resilience partnership fund a feasibility study has been approved to scope what this community facility I could look like and what it would provide that studies underway and will be completed before year-end very recently the board received a letter on behalf of Berwick Avondale and don 't an organization 's please include three respective residents associations two churches and a trust they are asking the board to request council register and interest and purchasing the land currently and disposal process by the Ministry of Education the site was previously the Burwood primary school the board is fully supportive of this location in fact it is likely to be the only potential site for an area-wide meeting process the purchase process I believe that is underway and to set aside funds for a community facility build project Council along stoner myself are willing to continue working together to gauge potential for public-private funding project and there is potential for other entities to be included after almost eight years of being on hold we feel this project should be expedited to allow the broken communities to rebuild and moving to Azusa Kirito Park we asked at a feasibility study on demand and supply of a 50 metre deep water facility be added to QE to existing we 're waiting for to be opened pulse and we think the timing should be 2020 which would give the high schools time to impact on the 25 metre that we were currently using we 'll be using and for a bail price-wise prospect planned for 2021 a whole generation of children and the East have missed out on one of the most significant life skills to master swim capability a child aged 6 and 2011 is now attending high school while our Eastern communities in outlying districts look forward with excitement capacity planning for the term needed Paul is already a concern for the board children youth must be given every opportunity to become equal proficient and have access to deep water sports so must adults especially honor people who were big lane users the board has concerns with the pool premium programming for the 25 metre pool and already season limited access for community use from opening day onwards as user groups dominate this deep water pool space and community providers provided with only three lanes while we accept that some of the user groups will transfer to the sports Metro we see the increased demand will be from the new residential developments and the three high schools and particularly the pressure added by urban side girls hi and Shelley boys home being at qut park it concerns us greatly that community will lose access to the schools very few from the east or transfer use to the sports Metro because it is unaccessible and time and cost to do anything other than an occasional visit thus disadvantages coastal and Eastern communities from many quarters community have expressed their concerns groups in deputation direct to board and recently the Qt master planning event which attracted a great number of people registered their concern that qe2 will need a 50 meter pool the aquatics facility plan assessment informed that the eastern aquatic facility needs to cater for a population of 60,000 clearly as community to have been trying to tell its community board and council another deep water of pool is required and this board stands behind councillor east and council 11 students call along with the communities called for another court to be fast-track built and carry to graffiti and vandalism led to these current panels the New Brighton RSA community and our board believe they have created a visual barrier and detract from the memorial the board would like to lead a collaborative project removing the panels of real and spoken would not only create an attractive space for reflection and commemoration but more people to use the area therefore reducing the likelihood of vandalism 300 million dollar capital acceleration front you can see up there with suggested a couple of things there and the board would like to LTP documents sourcing LTP information specific before award was extremely difficult in the time consuming and time-consuming for us let alone the community we appreciate the improvements that have been done there needs to be more improvements must be made if there is to be greater active and well informed submission participation in for planning transparency in future community boards Lyon items need to remain an ApS and lt piece and we recruit that action award host local national international events which I show you every month in our board report before ever because our for short as a metropolitan SEF there is increased usage and hoc way that in event times therefore greater levels of maintenance and subsequent budget is required for in this unique environment so in conclusion the community board and our residents believe that our board requires greater investment to give us thank you I 've got Vickie Lynn and Sarah but I don 't think we 're going to get through all of those because we 've got 23 seconds to go so if Vicki knew a number one top priority in the redzone given what would you most like to have happen there as quickly as possible really good question we haven 't actually discussed it for a board but we know that the cycleway I think we feed to sonia now great is fine be used well it makes my set yeah and hit the st. briefings we have over government changes over no no no it 's not the point the point is is that the question is in relation to whether you 've given some thought to temporary use within the residential red zone as a community board no thank you all right well look thank you very much that 's to the end of the time so much appreciated and of course a lot of detail in there and you know you 've obviously gone to a lot of trouble so i 'd like to thank you on behalf of all of the counselors thank you and if we could narrow it during the meeting until 00 00 a.m. thank you you so it Livan 11 welcome Ellie on behalf of the Papa no II underscored the people would settle this jibber-jabber so it was my favorite television program Boston Legal just just saying beer worth it 's another one of my favorite television burgers Miranda right hi we gonna be a little bit like the Two Ronnies here we 've got all our information but we 're gonna just kick each other under the desk as we get to the bits women talk about and I 'm Ellie Jones from and I send one of the hardest things for our board to see clearly what the community is to see clearly what the community needs hearing what the community needs and knowing that we have nothing that we can take out of the draft ltp in our ward of course boards anyone can request new things be included in the draft LTP without understanding it has to be give and take things go and things have to come out with all who bear the poppin ons board doesn 't have anything to take out because we have nothing in there that isn 't major infrastructural work land drainage program cycleways those kinds of projects that said we do have for funding of projects and our water one of the jewels and the papua new eunice crown is the Styx River and the surrounding environs and this is something that emma has been working with staff and with residents on so I was able to closely with the river catchment working party and our board supports the resolutions included in our submission which came from them and but we do know it will be subject to the land drainage staff determining the timing of the works within their project prioritization however we would like to specifically mention the need for further dredging and continued weed cutting which clearly has a financial impact but it 's absolutely key to managing and maintaining this river we also support the development of a Styx River master plan and the necessary funding required to make that happen this is essentially the foundation from which we can work to ensure the sustainability of the Styx River and the full information around the Styx as an attachment a on our submission now the traffic on some really lovely photos up there can you do VIN it in the sticks that we have a very engaged community here schoolchildren supported actually by excellent work from Council scarf the traffic in our ward is one of probably the number one concern our residents have and have had for some time the hills road end of Westminster Street which you can see here has a playground a preschool motor her primary Christchurch Park and there is a building there that may be used by the community in the near future and that means a large number of children and families are regularly crossing this increasingly busy road there is no safe crossing point on this road until you get to Cranford Street which is about 1.5 kilometers in the other direction and that 's not really very safe some days either now the board is requesting funding for a pedestrian refuge to ensure that our children and families can safely cross Westminster Street another part of this issue of traffic and related to traffic at school speed zones and I know this is a concern across a number of boards in our Ward and the pnina 's Ward we we have a very very high concentration schools and in fact we have a very high concentration of families and children living in our Ward the Papa Nui Anna 's community board continues to support the citywide 40-kilometer in our school zones and that they be maintained at five hundred thousand dollars for the 2018-19 financial years to allow the program to be accelerated and all schools currently on the waiting list need to have speed zones and stalled still with traffic and the Christchurch Northern Corridor or the C and C is one of the biggest road in projects in the city bringing more than 20,000 cars I think I 've heard the figure mic up around 28,000 through that earnest Road intersection how many the ago develop this has not been my strong point 55,000 through that intersection into the ward from the north and that 's clearly going to have implications for the residential areas in which the project ends which is there Ennis Road Cranford Street area and then into each where insert albans again a very high residential area with a lot of families and by by the council as well the downstream effects to the cnc to the Northern Corridor and the board 's contention is the funding for the work to counter these effects is in the LTP at the wrong time now the downstream effects will be felt as soon as the project is finished in mid 2020 but it 's currently the bulk of the money is in the 2021 component of the draft LTP and we suggest that work needs to be completed before then to ensure that we are ready and and and it 's currently in there too late right major cycleways roots of the completion of the circle way program in our would specifically the northern line cycle way this is partly built already in as well used by residents and children to across the water however it 's missing a vital link between Tucker 's and sterics Road and cyclists are currently using a grass beside the railway line to get to where they want to be obviously this is a health and safety issue is there running about a meter away from the railway track soon as possible and it 's an unfenced as well so they 're right there up against the track the board 's concerned that slowed the delivery of the program will cost council more in the long term I think that 's a really key point and I know one of the issues across the we understand that the issues across the city around quality of roads and pavements and we 'll get to that in a minute particularly in the Shirley part of our ward but the Greer 's Northcutt Sawyer 's arms roads and such intersection the highest accident rate for pedestrians in our ward we 've had one fatality and a significant number of car accidents Northcutt Road will become busier once the CNC the northern corridor is completed it was actually meant to be completed already around about two years ago but it keeps being deferred and again this is a health and safety issue the new subdivisions around high stead Cavendish and gardener 's roads are creating more traffic heading down Soyuz arms Road towards the center section because it 's so it 's not of streets in Richmond which we are pushing for to get included in the LTP and Nichols streets and also Randall Street and we 'll talk some more about the issues in this year of Shirley are in a moment however these particular streets need to be singled out for urgent inclusion and the renewal program they were on the program Nakul Street was on the program but he 's now been pushed off and we also support the remaining one-third of Randall Street two thirds of it has been done but the other third isn 't so we want the whole lot to be done and residents have come to the board on more than one occasion about this and we are hearing from them regularly as well by our email and phone calls which is you know that 's our job but we need to raise it with you as well in August 2017 the mayor has always been passionate about the resilience and well-being of communities said and I quote the most important element is connecting communities and encouraging active citizenship to that end our Ward needs LTP new community facility wise for our ward for the next 10 years nothing zilch nothing for the next 10 years this is despite parts of our ward in dire need of such facilities there are projects and train and we 're grateful for those however they 're a long time coming and they still not complete some have been delayed so Norman 's part the best use Park in our Ward has been unusable since February 2011 and was in poor condition prior because of drainage that is now underway and is looking fantastic can 't_''_7061.949 wait for that to happen however of course with the Windsor here now it 's going to be at least another 1 to 2 seasons before you know autumn and winter and unto the summer before it can be used and we have the very reasonably priced sand albans community center which has been delayed because of an objection to the resource consent our ward our Papa Nui Innes Ward has been forgotten in many ways particularly the shirley area an area that is in the East but not the East we hear here I won 't tell you what you already know but we do want to emphasize that this area particularly contains continues to be to struggle to be stressed by ongoing major land drainage work which combined with major roading projects has seen residents deal with noise dust vibrations roadworks closures and general disruption for almost 5 years this is where we need community amenity community facilities hence the top priority of funding for a community facility to replace the well used and much-loved shirley community center at 10 Shirley Road now this may not be replaced as a community center but it is a community facility needed it has been in and out of the LTP an annual plan like a yo-yo of the last 5 years the community has been consulted they have an expectation and that expectation has been dashed more than once the funding of more than 100 sorry the funding of 153 thousand dollars was originally allocated in the 2020 2021 financial year to begin consultation and design work and was brought forward to 2018-2019 which is where we thought it was at the end funding however when the draft LTP came out it was nowhere to be seen for the next 10 years that means nearly 20 years until this community gets a replacement facility on this site we would like this reinstated we have a list of people in the area who support the reinstatement of this community center or community facility and we can leave those names with you I think an important thing to remember too is that there are eight schools and surely again reflecting its residential and family aspect sixty-five percent of residents are families with children it 's one of the highest percentages in the city and census figures show that 21 point two percent of the population is between zero and 15 years compared with a city average of 17 point 8 this community is close to breaking point they need a place to meet and together to repeat the funding of a hundred and fifty three thousand originally allocated in the 2020 2021 financial year to begin consultation and design work was brought forward to 2018 2019 plus subsequent funding and we would like this reinstated dollars in funding as we 've had the opportunity to purchase the section next door which will future-proof the project for the community providing much-needed green space in this high-density residential area this wasn 't something investigated four to five years ago what the backing of the council however with the house on the section it became problematic and was not progressed and we would also like to reaffirm that the original funding is carrying forward from the current year to next year first here is a new school being proposed for Belfast which we see is an opportunity to work with the ministry in the school to build a new library for the community and these have been built around the city before and they work well and so we believe this is an opportunity there not should not be missed the Belfast library has been included in their long-term plan for a number of years now but has been completely pushed off this current draft it 's also identified Belfast as a significant area of Christchurch to experience growth over the next eight years and the Christchurch City the Belfast area plan now the edgeware community pool the board is requesting that the council fund five million dollars so the ITO Airport group to enable this asset to be completed and the each web pool is not an aquatic facility like the council pulse it is a community facility a great gathering place a safe place for people of all ages to meet a place for children and adults to learn to swim and a warm pool for the community to use for exercise and relaxation year-round and the some of the Earth 's outdoor space which will be landscaped and there will also be an indoor teaching pool they have already been inquiries made to the pool group for people who want to provide the learners pool service that 's actually an income stream for the group and there 's certainly interest from providers and the Ward and this is one of the issues in the area to around edge we 've got this still in the planning process so that will sort of change the focus in the area traffic wise as well but we we hard to get to this point they have spent a huge amount of money out of their own pocket and when you talk about community partnerships this is an ideal example of exactly that type of partnership but a partnership is two-way and there has been some support from the council to this point but we believe that these should be more and financially there is a big as well remembering that there would be no operating expenses that would continue with the poor and this also demonstrates when we look at what 's happening across the city with other birds for pools this is about equity this has a budget of around five million dollars to be up and running so you can see it 's good value for money with no operating expense and certainly improves the equity of spend for these types of facilities across the City Council put funds into the long-term plan for outdoor youth facilities in the Papa Mui and redwood areas such as a skate park or basketball court and this seemed from a meeting we had with a group of young people number of playgrounds lots of open green space in packs but nothing for the youth of the area well that 's our submission I just want to reiterate again or we would like to reiterate honor we 've got strengthening communities funding sorry this has been obviously an issue for a number of boards as well with the reduction over the last financial year it has not been an increased cover inflation in the last ten years for strengthening communities funding we have a very engaged Ward as far as community groups go and as a very active board working with these community groups and we cannot continue to absorb the costs that have been reduced or the cost that we have to absorb because of the reduction and funding our communities and the strength and well-being of our communities actually make for a stronger City and if we cannot continue to support these groups we believe that will weaken not only our Ward but the city across the whole of Christchurch thank you right Ben Jimmy thank you for your presentation I 'm just curious over are the Julie the temporary facility at McFarland Park Emmett Street 100 608 the community church as well so I 'm just how much needs analysis has been undertaken by way of proven you know the needful provision for community we 've been doing that and staff have been doing that for the last four or five years and what we 're finding is that the church facilities are now basically fully direct versity there 's a new one that 's just been set up at the Chile working men 's club on Hills Road a fantastic what they 've done there has basically got it and completely you know redo it they are at capacity and there are still groups in the area that requires space to meet this is not a casting aspersions against those who are church-going people or Christians but there is a perception sometimes that people want a secular space and so that is something that we have to deal with in the ward as well we met a couple of groups one I can think of which is a Probus group so this is affecting older people is based in Shirley and one story was based on Shirley before the earthquakes they now travel to New Brighton to meet and they want to come back and meet in the area that is one of around about eight groups that we 've heard from and we have information from all of them and staff are still collating there so there is definitely a need and we 're not going to argue for something that we don 't believe there is a need for needs analysis yeah well we can get yes of course you also mentioned the fact that provides for very concentrated or area of high need and surely around that McFarland Park area sort of founded by Queens Road Shirley Road and housing new zealand 's about so we believe start a new building plan there as well and that will increase the density and the number of families they 're using that facility so they are very different and should not be confused as far as needs go but I appreciate your request for the information and we 'll get it Jimmy I do I proposed long-term print the rates will be increased we haven 't taken a view on that counselor team because we 've been focusing very much on the community facilities okay yeah eventually because the base on your presentation if you seek in an additional sum of a project like you mentioned an age where community poor they were popular for the five million dollars another two cent opens the community facilities fifty K plus Bo first library service for another total together is why know about five point five million dollars they prop increased rates about a one point two percent eg plus you know I think the point that we made that I have to reiterate is that we would very much like to put something in to counter the funds that we 're asking for unfortunately unlike other Ward 's we don 't have anything that we can swap because the spend and our ward is almost entirely infrastructural projects Road and land drainage multiple millions of dollars but actually when it comes down to community amenity and facility there is nothing there so I can 't really that we could look at more equity across the city and maybe there are other wards that might be able to cut back what they 're asking for in order to enable our communities to get a bite of the pie okay thank you Jonnie just quickly there is a cute amount of money be quickly on those you got away with it the northern arterial the downstream effects have you looked at those budgets and terms of budget savings because it does seem like some of them like the beta Street have several million on dollars for Street sorry but beta Street and Madras Street have several million and it 's quite hard to know how that money could be you know it 's been I mean it seems like a lot of money you 've got for those roading projects so I just wondering if there 's any of those writing projects that you 've identified that actually could be reduced in scope to fund some of the things you want we have already gone back to staff to ask that and some of those projects in Barbados goes into Central obviously so there 's a award share when we asked for it we asked for information back but the consultations already gone out so yeah but we 're well we it 's we 're still we 're just about to consult on that as far as getting traffic into the other into the city that 's the downstream effect stuff yeah I 'm not entirely understanding what you 're saying yeah I don 't know we 're quite with that boundary owes but you know just who 's putting some lines on the road several million not just lines on the road I mean the problem and this is what we 've raised a lot when we 've looked at the cost of some of these works some of them have seem to be very basic road renewals but what and you know this you need to once you take out gutters and you put new guttering in and all that kind of stuff as well as why during widening the road traffic lights at 250 to 500 K a pop it 's it 's frustrating but an accountant or writing engineers I can 't answer then yeah thank you very much look thank you for your time and um presentation it 's very good it 's very valuable giving all of this and put them to that LTP thank you and could I now invite Pam Richardson and the team from banks peninsula community board so this morning I 've got with me toy peddler who is the representative and of course Joan natured who 's their governments advisor on my dear look um this is a challenging morning and attached to our presentation we have put the banks premature Community Board submission summary for you a one-pager that gives you an outline Department and of course our submission is it 's very full and yeah I would love to see a time on top of these that we could actually be watching or was the ticking over because they make a clock has actually gone so we haven 't got much to follow what 's going on anyway I liken myself to to come and that we are the garden Kim talked about her house are the garden mix Peninsula and the amazing photographs so I wanted an intern into how we fit in with the city and this next slide shows a hundred thousand hectares on the right hand side and the very small area on the left at the top there of the city so we 've got 651 kilometers of council roads 3331 of which is 331 of unsealed we 've got 145 council parks 116 local community parks 8 garden parks and here 's 6 4 parts and 15 regional parks about 14 cemeteries based across the peninsula got seven major sports and recreation amenities in the area and the ekor are is the only cruise port at the moment in Canterbury and we had over 200,000 visitors from the cruise ship season so that 's where we fit into the city and what we want for the long term is a fit for future infrastructure infrastructure is very important for us over the years it has been well I hope people talk about sweeted sounds like an awful term but a lot of the facilities on banks peninsula have ended they need to be maintained to a better standard or we start a planning process of a new one the next one is about transport about our roads and our walls now this is where we 've heard the most information from our communities of course a lot of our information and the submission has come from the very many meetings that we 've had the reserve management committees that we work with so we have many opportunities of working with our communities so we pick up a lot of information and our submission is based on that information that we collect from our communities so this is an area where we 're we 're we 're looking at doubling budgets because of the road measuring our roads are in very poor condition and as I look back over the weekend I found a document that was 1998 thanks for the district council braiding policy and the same issues we are dealing with today the base structure of those roads is in poor condition it 's we have not been able to improve this situation with the budget that we in the system somewhere that would allow you to see what has been talked about the calls that renew programs as another one as though as we 're seeing increased storms on the peninsula we need to make sure that our drainage is improved and that the the the culverts are far too small there are small Calvert 's they need a lot of maintaining we need to see a greater budget to improve those we need to see that the funding we brought for for the diamond half of Warren all the wharf is diamond haber wolf was part of a network part of a roading network a tourism opportunity and it 's an it is there are difficulties with it and a safety of us so we 're looking also for the start which soon as on the wharf renew when we ask for a renewal mean for for warfarin your projects we are asking that that we actually as our community becomes clear to us when they 're in the time in the tight and the planning process and there 's some certainty that they are going bit of money to start a project would be very welcome to get them the planning going through with our communities because a lot of the projects for example the echo Worf will have to go through a number of steps to come out the other end there 's Asus toric Worf and there will be another steps that we need to go through safe drinking water or the three waters there 's another area we want to see that we 're improving the situation on Banks Peninsula unfortunately the first one near the Akane 's Bay potable water supply is in a community that it 's got a camping ground that is very popular it 's got a museum school but it 's got a very small base population and at the moment that that water supply is well it doesn 't meet the standards at all it 's not it 's not not a good situation and all the City Council and poor light that we 're here we have a council that has got a CC management in it involved with the community in Tahoe and we same with y new even waste water supply it 's been one that 's been in and out of the system over the years and that back in 2011 that was proposal was identified being in the long term plan today it 's not included at all it is very for very small community but it 's vital that we get their water out of the the water out of the harbor acara Harbor and onto land so what 's the use of taking the a Corral wastewater out of the harbor if we 're going to have it going in on the winery side so we need to look at how we can do that and in our submission there we give perhaps an idea of an example of what we might do to resolve these regional facilities most of a lot of those that the facilities that a lot of the things that we 've got on banks potentially going to consider them regional facilities like the Darwin Harbour Wharf the echo ha a piranha Harbor wolf know the in Cannes Bay water scheme as you could consider and that 's a bit confused and they and the document it talks about Littleton Marina marina and environments development be included as presented in the draft but it 's naval point a naval point is very important for our water activities whether it 's swimming with sports whatever it might be but it 's important that we have a facility there and there is some funding that is already being identified from the community that they would be quite happy to form partnership and look at building to house no well maybe points and also the the Coast Guard so there are a lot of opportunities down there for for working together as a team now what we want from the long term plan are connected communities and empowered citizens and I think that we over the years have got those as you can see up there we 've got your canes by camping ground we 've got the devotional Hall in the middle we 've got the aleko Hall we 've got Little River and the big ideas and we 've got the hot Diamont Harbor plan so years the three at the bottom will be run by reserve committees and then the two at the top of energy planning and resonance and ratepayers local residents behind them so for our local facilities these those were those little things that we included back there like the devotions hall and the metallic alloy and there are many others Allen Dale 's got a new one Governors Bay he 's got a new one but for many of them they are very old and not not decrepit or do for demolish to be demolished they are focuses of our community for example the pigeon Bay all and so a little bit of money would help to to improve those those facilities and continue to keep those groups working in behind him the next one is new um we talk about is the banks manage to toilet block renewals what a subject anyway the funding has been identified for a number of toilet Rock with toilet blocks across Peninsula so we are looking at putting looking at asking the council could we put the lump sum together for those toilet blocks community board and the communities to work out which ones are more more important than others that we should be starting so figure out a community planning planning we 've had two planning processes over recent years the Little River Big Ideas and the diamond Harbor Village plan both of those have got a plan at very little cost 15,000 was allocated to them and I don 't think either of them use their full funding amount so it would be nice now to look at allowing them to have some funding to do some of those projects and there are many of them and you 'll hear from the little Weber area trust who is looking at pushing those forward and of course our submission so coastal inundation is one where we look at needs to come forward we need to be thinking about it now in fact tomorrow we 've got a power cut and picture Bay where we 're a Ryan are actually putting rises on our power poles because they 're in the sea now but sea walls have disappeared so it is in front of with working with our banks potential at communities so maximizing our investment it 's about empowerment through partnerships and those are all the plans that we 've got there are a whole host of them that we 've got here the little port plain recovery plan the Erie management plan wara a little master pit there 's a huge number of them is about empowering through partnership and that 's how we and banks potential well how the whole city needs to be looking at how can we get the best out of our communities at the least cost and a little bit of money goes a long way so they 're just finally here and the next one where does the money come from it 's about board empowerment it may be that we 're looking looking at prioritizing though the funding that 's allocated to some of those bigs finish the projects and we look as a know clearly look at where they might go maybe we look at the cemetery 's funding and decide where it might might best be spent but we thank you for the the final slide got our vision and our way of working which comes from our board plan I just wanted to make one final little comment about the rating and the difficulty for our community we 're looking at raising over three million dollars for our integrated self health center and because might have been a way that we could actually support our community just the ekor our community to get some extra funding to support i look at the the development that you have available for improvement in a business district improvement why can 't that sort of been looked at for the similar sort of situation for helping your community our hospital and public facilities they 're not private so can I just take that into one the yeah well I 'm glad that you raised that wanna be in because that was the one that I wanted to ask about you know it did occur to me I went out to a meeting with one of the counselors down swards with the Sydenham business community and that and they kind of they the Business Improvement Districts model they weren 't really aware of it and didn 't really see that it was a possibility and were quite interested in it so I think that raising it now as you have it as a good I have to say the weight of submissions don 't seem to support the idea but I think that 's because they haven 't had a real example such as yours and so maybe what we need to do is in order to facilitate your community that wants to be considered in this way as whether we can find a mechanism for expanding a business improvement district model and to a more community oriented model but but but it does it does present us with a challenge because you 've got a real example a real live example where the communities on board and I think that it 's been quite challenging for people to think well we don 't want another rate but they don 't see it but it 's actually a fundraising mechanism for something that people want and that they have to vote for it in order to go a wake-up call about how important that is so you I 'm just kind of reinforcing that I know I 've got Sarah and Vicki really good just wondering while the budget for Everywhere 's xiri tight with the ibly saying yes you 've got some key priorities they 've been around for a while such as the you know a crow wharf and the diamond harbour those kind of things and you 've also got the naval point I 'm sorry if it would be useful to the head the ability to be able to prioritize within those if funding wasn 't available to add more then whether it would be useful for you as a board to be able to prioritize funding within those at all I think that would be very difficult for us to do that because they 're there for different reasons I know a good point is for recreation Dermott Harbor is for a transport network yeah a karara 's for cruise ships economics visitors yeah very difficult so I think that you know I think that we would accept that perhaps a little them moving along get the working groups going to look at how they 're going to do it what 's going to be involved like we have with naval point and then we need to know that it 's going to be included in the long term blend as soon as possible but he 's so naval points got a big chunk it had some sieve initially now it 's got a bit of a Chiang yes yes would maybe taking some of that chunk to do seed funding for the other ones to look at how they will be developed just a little bit no I can 't if there 's no other funding available yeah these are regional facilities I would I would claim that these are other regional facilities and the perhaps the budgets in town need to be looked at so that we can actually complete these rip these facilities for the region they are for the region they 're not for being financially totally they are mainly for the region thank you a lot of them are health and safety issues yep condition safety stuff of the other yeah it 's one if it 's not extra funding available then would you like the opportunity to choose we haven 't_''_8802.3 we hadn 't considered that as board whether we can choose how viky thank you for the submission I noticed some the finger to my mary one this morning elfin litter and what everywhere now one this morning that they allocated they did a big wreck that they put up there on the contributions this is the proposed capital expenditure by Ward and banks furniture was interesting in that the capital expenditure is about on this graph about 13 to 14 percent and the rates contribution about two two and a half right so there is a major contribution from the rest of the city ratepayers what I 'm intrigued by then as your response to the fuel tax and I understand the logic behind it but given how much other ratepayers are contributing here what 's your alternative suggested spreading of the rates food and given how high it will become well I think you 've got a look at banks furniture what is I know I 've got the garden analogy and all of yeah it 's it 's regional issues that we 're actually we 're doing and I do think it 's very unfair to look at those rate payers of they 're paying for all of those things that are there a MEK in our community there was a question and the thing about alternative forms of revenue raising yes and you didn 't like the pool table so I would have expected that you would have looked at something out something different we haven 't had the time to look at anything else it 's different Vicki I think this it 's quite an unfair question of expecting it was very short time frame that was around that we 're not economists I think it 's a no it 's I think it 's a bit unreasonable to expect us as a community to come up perhaps we might put a road text at the beginning of Banks Peninsula and collect from all of those that come and visit us I don 't know I don 't know it take that extra Rotex are us that can travel long distances to your meetings to do things in town and yet our roads are in poor condition so we need to look at it at equitably yet we do need to look at equally and feeling it is very challenging I mean is that the truth is that you know and I 've said it before the shotgun wedding between Christchurch City and Banks Peninsula was always going to play out this way so we have to find a way that we can work together in order to achieve what needs to be achieved with this enormous challenges facing us particularly with our oil waste water that the other things that you 've highlighted so we 're going to have to it is going to be a question of working together to find solutions so we start now we don 't leave it until just a few months before the before we I totally agree right now we can do it I 've read the submissions for tomorrow and I know a number of people going to say that we better and I agree and I think that by instead of and I ref said this before so I 'm just going to steal his idea but attribute and that is is that if we actually just think of this as a as an assertive process every year I mean you can change an LTP every year just whether you have to go through a special consult or procedure or not in a consultation document depends on the significance of the changes that you 're making so why not take this as a much more iterative process over the three-year and then engage the community and the consultation documents themselves so I leave I mean I 'm not saying leave it with us but work with us over how we could do this better oh absolutely absolutely yeah eonni thank you dan resubmission and I do notice that the peninsula community has been very good at looking at how to work jointly and has got I guess because of the history a way of doing things which seem a lot less than what we would do and with that being seems a huge amount of money given all the concerns that you 've raised on all the other things that you 'd like funded have you thought about how much of that would just be essential to get something there that would be you know it 's still an upgrade but at a much greater reduction of cost so that we could fund some of the other things that you 're asking for well there are some things that they have been looking at that you know putting in something that might be temporary but whereas we know temporary upon becomes permanent more substantial button to start off with to get it moving rather than putting something and for example taking the pontoons that are out there there now and condition there the beasts of the poor but you know the advices that we need to use it for we need to put something that 's in and fits in with the plan that 's going to go move ahead that 's going to move the head but certainly maybe that is an option that we actually look at what I 'd be really interested given the number of things that you 've asked us to look at funding for if you could look at the navel point projects and work out which was really the most important and also you mentioned that that was seen as a regional facility and yet the community boards got the delegation over so are you happy to give up delegation if it 's a regional metropolitan facility right can I just take Erin because it 's where bright on the deadline for time are you mine was just a quick point and I loved your photos at the start you 're certainly competing with the eastern suburbs for the best photos of the city the best-looking part and the analogy around the garden versus the living room and stuff I think it 's family analogy and I look at Banks Peninsula like more like a mirror of our wife that they look really good but very expensive I 'm actually going to this strongly objected I 'm actually gonna roll it out of order I mean I know what you 're trying to to try and say so just just you know just that 's fine for Friday night team that gives us a hand to do this we 've got some amazing skills within our staff to allow us to put these presentations together we have spent many hours many many hours over the last few months getting things together understanding what the issues are and they really deserving of wonderful accolades yes thank you very much and very well-deserved thank you right if we could have found Sally back and the team for London central Heathkit I apologize for my comments I mean to say Ponsonby it was a joke about a TV show I retract I 'll stop watching TV oh hey it 's like herding cats isn 't_''_9281.22 that far away okay thanks waiter wipe our community board would like to thank the council for allowing us to speak to our submission with me today I 've got um Tim Lee go lay some inject McClellan yeah yeah we 've got the whole board here except for one person and they will speak on parts of our mission as the proposed capital program item the renwood will stand Paul Airport campus a huge area covers the suburbs of Eddington even solemnly Phillips town central city Sydenham Austin watham none would history meet Mount Pleasant reckless some then parts of San Albans now we as a board very Douglas diverse group of people from across these various suburbs however we are totally United about the need for an aquatic community facility and the Lynwood Austin area to serve all these suburbs especially the lower socioeconomic suburbs in our area were united about the need for this we you know that where it should go and we know about the type of facility that is proposed in our communities and these areas are united and right behind us on this issue we do not support any reduction in funding or extending the timeline for this community facility and our board really appreciates the council 's resolution to delegate a decision of the location scope and final concept design to the board I just want to say in our submission we have included some projects it could be deferred or it 's alternate ways of the council raising money now I 'm going to pass the Jake to talk about children sure I 'm just gonna briefly touch on in a city priorities so the regeneration of the little village is something this board is determined to see real progress happen and in the current term and the community lead revitalization plan is well underway it will be completed by seen between the 18 we 're getting lots of feedback and a big kept well abreast of of learnings so early community feedback indicates that more community facilities and green spaces are a priority and the board seeks requests funding to implement the plans all-important priority projects in that same vein we 're calling for a greening of the inner city East that 's a high priority for the ward area I represent the board requests funding for this to enhance in and the assessor and the health outcomes of the neighborhood and contribute to Christchurch as image as a Garden City this needs to be a part of the city residents even more proud to belong to money has been assigned project progress the board would also like to commune console and councillors housing first and I should have however we continue to advocate for more in high quality social housing Daryl thank you good morning everybody three issues that I 'd like to address the first is drinking water storm water and flood protection infrastructure drinking water storm water and flood protection significant priorities for the city and the board fully supports the council initiatives on these areas the board also notes the planning around coastal hazards and signals the need for funding in the widest sense to implement priority actions in the future secondly the master plan is inclusive of the fury road master plan will an Austin Village upgrade and Heath got no Street Street capes enhancements and the suburban master plan programs overall council will be aware that there are nine master plans within the limits central Heath board area we had five of those master plans so as a significant issue for us so the board supports the completion of all suburban master plans in the board area inclusive of Park remodel the suburban master planning for suburban Christchurch that has been a process of rebuilding people 's confidence expectation and optimism and their communities and the wider city so therefore we support the council 's initiatives and the master planning areas finally the skate facility Sumner to ferry Mead and the village green this as a priority project of significance in the bays area for our board escape facility for youth will have multiple benefits it has been a project that has seen significant community engagement over an extended period of time and the time has now right to bring this process to fruition before the board supports this project as it has been a long-standing community project thank you Tim right I 'm going to talk the first ones might major cycleways now the subways projects overall in the city have reached an interesting stage where enough has been done to get numbers on how many people will be using them and the figures that are coming through show the cycle ways are popular and will be used even more than anticipated so we strongly encourage completion of the cycle ways in our area delays so we support strongly funding of those cycle ways we also know that the Rapa Nui cycle way will connect the center of the city through to the beginning of the Christchurch coastal pathway at fairy Medan and that leads me on to the second one which is the coastal pathway itself the works currently underway on the pathway that will be carried out so we 'll bring the pathway to the position with 90 percent of the length of the route will be in place the bit that 's missing is that will be the chunk around the difficult section around last vein and as a board we ask we request that the project is taken to full completion it has so many benefits in terms of of Health protecting against climate change outcomes providing safe transit between suburbs the connection between Red Cliffs and some is a very difficult section and is a dangerous one for pedestrians and cyclists so we strongly urge that that is completed what a mention at the beginning of the coastal pathway there 's that lovely little ruin called Cobb cottage which knows what 's happening to it under We strongly support repair of cobb cottage as soon as possible it 's woman 's much left on the community and the strong support for it to be brought out up from wraps and into a place where people can enjoy it and finally I want to talk about the flood protection works particularly along the Heathcote and up our whole River the residents along there that on our boards and other boards have been very patient while the council does the detail work of mapping out exactly how things have changed and exactly what the impact of various remedying activities will have it is now time for those to be implemented and implemented as quickly as possible so we strongly support the flood protection work along the hiss kit we also know that it gives a great deal of opportunities for community enhancement walkways cycleways etc in a relatively inexpensive way along a beautiful part of it so we encourage community consultation there 's a strong desire for that time for that to happen for a safety perspective but I would also had one more thing to say um last year we advocated for a drop-in center a citywide project for a drop-in center for Street communities and we will live and after the annual pain with the idea that council was going to work with us on this and have it somewhere near Central City and we put forward a site for it a council piece of land for it but we 're still waiting to find out what where this is going in you know how we can help progress this idea further we get half of questions right good well I 've got Jamie Glen Phil Mike okay thank you you speak to the inner city East revitalization particularly around the loom Wood Village area but I wondered if you 'll board had a view on central city residential specifically within the four airs I used to put it differently I know the dog part request but does the board wish to see more residents living centrally and is there a role for the council to do more or help incentivize I do think that what you have in terms of what you 've got to do in Central City I think up limits what people can do in there and is causing a lot of problems now as we have an issue coming up an airport later today about how places are being able to be built without any parking and so therefore other strengths and having to take the brunt of that you know and they want to walk place to parks so that they can get to the patient through the back and then the other streets have all the parking for that if you look at our board agenda you 'll see that today issue so I think if anything the council could have a look of what the government did was the single city and maybe everything about yeah how it 's actually working out yeah it 's a district planar shape but I was just quite surprised that you hadn 't taken a position on the numbers of people sorry it doesn 't anybody you know it 's not see well actually here 's the space of any we could have tiny house bigger houses or something rather than having every having to have eighth a unit every two hundred square meters yeah well that 's there is an interpretation of it but I hope you 've got someone from the resource consenting URI all that does the district claim people coming to talk to your community because I mean this is this not a requirement it 's not a restriction you can 't not have parking you know you 're not obliged not to hit parking but it 's not a requirement to have parking but anyway that 's so if you 've got four hundred square meters in the single city area and you try and put one household it 's very difficult to get it for council there is a there is a there is a requirement to build more densely than you would in the neighborhoods yeah that 's true yeah if I could add to what Celia 's saying and say that this is not necessarily a board perspective it 's a personal perspective but I do have a concern over the way the development is taking place the accessibility issues something that the council needs to reflect on because the feedback that I 'm getting even within our board is that there is an area of concern yeah the district planners the district plain nice sorry I mean I understand LT P process is not something that we can utilize but the desire to have more people living in the CBD far I mean was a lot sooner than the earthquake Seaver occurred you know it was been in the it 's been in the urban development strategy a very long time and I 'm just surprised that the community board doesn 't have a view on 20,000 by 2024 no 2041 was the urban development strategy and all the there 's been no change to the urban development strategy that brings that forward at this stage but that is what we 're working on Glenn fool Thank You page 92 you say request additional funding for new social housing units you please tell us what precisely would be that funding source and it 's in the context of priorities the LTP submission comes from some machines also on the it 's a yeah it 's just a bit of a general statement it 's not up to us to decide how your capitalization of your housing trust happens or anything okay what we are saying is we support social housing we support more yes we 're requesting additional funding it 's in your submission but you 're not saying where it 's from I 've just said that 's not err we we have given you some projects where we would say you can defer these or pencil some of them even if you wish to say to the money no an information so thank you um you you 've commended the housing first program and also referred to developing the social housing increasingly just when asked about that we the drop-in center concept might fit in with that with especially for example housing first four people are homeless now there might be aligned and fit together preps and also wonder if you talk to the city mission preps about the drop-in center I don 't get a lines together and we bought this idea of really needed and the in your plan and we were told we 'll go to committees which I think you apart when your committees may be new film your committee in a country new houses committee and we would you accounts would work with us as a board however we have not heard anything back from from anybody about this in that 's why I 'm raising the year I think we could talk further and also with a City motion as well silly it would be good because I thought you were going to be because it was a citywide project rather than just a board project and the homeless Christchurch but where the congregate is often Mike thank you thank you very much and I just like to acknowledge obviously your board support for of the signal number which is a much-needed aquatics facility in your area and also your ongoing support of community facilities in saint albans is a part of your community board er it 's actually a significant part as well there is a lot of residents in there and it 's only a hundred gonna be rebuilt and also around 300 meters away from the st. Albans port community the community are actually saying we want this bed so as a community board would you support these community projects giving the additional funding required st. Albans Paul each report in the st. Albans community center which pretty much is right on the boundary of central and actually affects a lot of the residents that you implicate for would you support funding for those two projects the boundary question tree because it was bound to be a lot of the users of that Center are gonna be from central and also the same with each we 're ports 300 meters from the boundaries so a lot of the users of the pole are going to be actually from central and we 've heard very clearly from the community about how important these two produce there so you may not have a board view but does anyone have a personal view no it 's not fair but there here is a board and I think that you 've cleverly raised that issue and I 'm sure for further consideration before they come in I think the issue here is not raising a question and putting it in front of us cold but give us the information and let us make a decision rather than putting us on the spot to or something that we don 't have all the facts on yeah I think that 's absolutely the right answer and it does give us an opportunity to think around those you know because I mean some of the some of the wards we 've already heard you know that things transferred from one ward to another and then change community boards and so people who 've very familiar with a particular subject suddenly our faithful that being dealt with in another ward so anyway that gives us an opportunity to back down from our very strong support for the Linwood Aquatic Center in the and making decisions process and you know the advantage of raising the issue here one is the incredible cost saving that it would represent if it we 're modeled on the other side of the board so just saying so thank putting so much effort into your presentation that 's very much appreciated thank you and last but certainly not least Carolyn Potter and the spray-tanned Kashmir community board representatives thank you no problem Kuro tato we rip said that you were all sprayed and Kashmir community I said why Varun spray from Kashmir community board on my left is ARA her nui grace and melanie coca and helene mountain er we I want to start this off by just naming and I know this sounds boring himself angry and I think I want to name the residents association and now the committed groups in our community the City Council used to acknowledge residents association and the old days were the prize for the residents association of the year Vicki back in her role as Mia gave me one month 's bignum recently its association winner she 's slightly spoiled the occasion by then commenting that Beckenham was a suburb of pseudonym why didn 't we call ourselves there Oh laughs it was meant to be a great honor the hand tradecraft residents association the huntzberger munities center whom a community location area residents Association Sommerfeld residents Association the Kashmir residents association manuka cottage Addington net rally house a power ho his cat river network beacon them neighborhood association the hoon a community Center and hoon hey Community Association Cory or a house as schools many of whom the board visited in the last year our churches some of them are some of the people from our two to sustain residents associations our environmental groups including the river network friends of the new Clark the Friends of the rakesh midstream and new world Sint Maartens Barrington mall Zero 's cap and he 'll walk behind who hosted us when we consulted the community about the LTP the spreadin appreciates the opportunity to submit on the plan and we are speaking to it the board is mindful of the concerns expressed by this is the first time we 've ever raised this the board is mindful of the concerns expressed by residents about rate increases particularly many of those on fixed incomes and we have the largest percentage of our population our older people in this Franklin cash me award are experiencing and that includes people with debilitating illness and disability and single parents the board understands the financial constraints the council 's under and we do and the efforts continues to make to curb rate rises this submission is made with those financial considerations in mind we are also very conscious that for instance we have enormous sums of money being spent on flooding in particular and other infrastructure issues that go with are having and their power has got river throughout our Ward and including house purchasers and we also know that we have pockets of flooding that continue to distress residents in our ward there is no time when we 're not having heavy rain where I don 't think of those people who have had constant flooding not just in their houses but through their garages or on their property and how they lay out what lay awake at night listening to the waterfall they June we danced yes yep so about general maintenance which normally we don 't bring up either but the board has been hearing from residents like all other courts and the ear in the footpaths and potholes and roads parks and reserves and other green space and how it 's been maintained and also the use of maintenance of drainage facilities um one other comment to have got here because I actually went to a talk that was given about the use of herbicides and there 's been we 've made a comment here about the council possibly revisiting some of the information that you 've looked at before around not using glyphosate um to control weeds so apparently there 's new scientific evidence that says actually it 's not toxic to people so there 's been collated from a whole lot of scientific evidence it 's not got a whole email of about 10 or 12 links that you could read if you 're interested so um it 's something that we 're wondering if you could look here because it 's a cheaper and more effective method if it isn 't toxic to people and then the other mix around water and we always say this about believing in pure clean and clear water and all forms and particularly around their a town and we 're always looking for family provision for and the protection and maintenance and enhancement of the apollo heath care we 're about in its water quality which of course Carolyn 's kind of mentioned already community pending the board stresses the importance of councils funding of the many community groups and projects that that are at the heart of the city the board would oppose any reduction of the level of community funding and agree with Kevin Orie illnesses submission in this respect they hundreds of in very few thousands of dollars that we contribute to some organizations disproportionately importunate to those groups and are disproportionately valuable to the community that those groups serve and we we big we beg the council to maintain the level of community phantom and keep it in line with inflation safe routes to school this isn 't this is not one of the 60 subjects and it 's not one of those subjects that has a high priority in terms of subjects that people talk about when they think about the council but it is nonetheless a service to the traffic engineers that the community really values especially the schools though we have had lots of comments particularly in the last year from schools and staff involved with the major cycle routes program and the council staff concerned with the safety of local roads and exits in and out of schools about how much they value the services provided by the council in this respect most recently Tim and I went to and to his instigation went and looked at the Sint Maartens roundabout which we have not put in the long term plan but of the mayor 's idea of the long term pain being a rolling reiteration then we would be thinking about submitting on the Sint Maartens roundabout and in the preps and the next year in the meantime the resourceful traffic engineers have implemented a light indicating it your speed as you approach the roundabout in order to try and keep people safer who are circumnavigating that very busy area around San Martin school heritage buildings the board that understands there is not sufficient funding to repair all local heritage buildings within the first few years assess interest in the various here it 's buildings the borders of the view that repairable heritage buildings must eventually be a priority to the city given those that have gone forever the board has nearly syndicated below at three six and four one where a considers some delay may be sustainable and we 're at considers no no delay to repair would be acceptable we have one priority in our board and that 's coronation Hall because the delay in the consideration on on this building has been unfortunate and we would like to see this building ended to use addressed very quickly in the next even in the next six months we are always opposed to the Salem council err census of financials of strategy disability access this board has raised disability access possibly six years in a row the board recognizes the importance of disability access being met and to this end has previously sought a specific requirement in all projects and proposals that come to the council committees and community boards to include a requirement for staff comment as to how the proposal or project will why the council cannot implement this disability isn 't at the forefront of anybody who is able-bodied mind when they present proposals and projects to the board nor is it in the forefront of fitment of people who are assessing those projects disability only becomes important to those who are disabled it is one of the most discriminated against groups I cannot understand why council processes do not allow for consideration on the impact of proposals on people with disability especially in the ordinary idea for instance of getting in and out of your car when faced with Dig Dug assets just for example and flooding issues we as I had already said we understand the enormity of the flooding issues experienced in the wake of the newspapers and we appreciate the continuing work in that area by the superb engineers that are involved with all our waters we support very much the proposals for the banks of the hizmet river and for the kerlix storage basin and I have spoken to neighbors of the coolants proposal and they are delighted at the idea of having reserve that will enhance present them with a reserve a next door to the land between them and coolants Road the thing that gets you a little bit though are the people listening to that water that I talked to you about and we have frequently meet with exhausted residents whose houses are being flooded in small pockets of flooding in our Ward Manuka cottage Manuka cottage has been operating in adding since the 1990s it 's a very successful community center it it is now in st. Mary 's Church I can remember the despair I felt in 2014 when the council told manuka cottage that their college would not be rebuilt before 2016 it is delightful to know that we are very close to this the putting the Spade in the turf for the turning of the first sod and we would stress that we need continual provision of funding for the premises of this community developed project that has been critical both to the support of the local community and a positive and productive CeBIT engagement over the recent years our priority projects this first priority is so we 're advocating developed with lots of consultation quite a long time ago now I think there 's a lot about 10 years ago and aspects of the plan are now being given affect us on the river banks are being stabilized near the South Library and other parts as well and that 's currently under way but when we believe it now is the right time for that work to be undertaken and the provision of this funding to be influenced into the long-term planning Barrington wall this is the third fourth year that the Barrington wall has been our priority last year it was operational funding with the promise that it would be done last year their difficulties have arisen as is natural you can 't get in and out of Barrington mall as a pedestrian you can 't get in and out of Barrington more without mixing it with all kinds of traffic and it 's extremely dangerous and it has the sprayin library right next door to to exacerbate the problem the project was the board 's top priority in 1718 annual plan residents going to the mall in and accidents they the traffic engineers have put up a camera to note the difficulties of the exits and entrances to the small we want the right-hand turn abolished it 's a very simple procedure if you 're a person looking outside apparently if you 're a traffic engineer it 's not but we would hope that this will be funded in going this year the intersection of Barrington Street Lincoln Road and Whitely air this is a significant compared as a significant community of disabled persons residing in proximity to the intersection the provision and the in the draft long-term for safety prayer plans does not include fully compliant for disability accessibility and safety we would seek this intersection in particular because of the numbers of people that live absolutely adjacent to this intersection that who are seriously disabled and living and supported living circumstances that this intersection of all the intersections set the standard for being fully compliant for disability accessibility and safer and safety we have a community center in whom hey that was the children 's library it 's tiny and perfect it is a lovely some carols outside of it and we 've eaten the barbecues outside of it we 've had meetings inside of it including a recent flooding one of about more than 30 people which to our surprise was very comfortably housed we cannot practice menarche tanga in this little community center which just incidentally the saving of which was led by Melanie Coker we cannot practice monarchy toner in there because it 's got no kitchen we want a few thousand dollars to put in a kitchen and a disabled loo and this little place will be perfect for the humane community which has not had a community center before the intersection of Kashmir hoon Hayward 's leaves Road has been postponed this is a dangerous intersection that 's one of those intersections that our neighbors of porn being Horsfall Riperton talked about in terms it 's one of the intersections along cred Kashmir Road that our neighbors talked about and this intersection particularly needs addressing right now right now and our neighbor talked about the intersection coming off the hills of thank God for your memory if we can have traffic and build probably help even Westmoreland that far away and Coronation Hall this is the one subject that we talked about sustained fire damage in October 2015 the people who the keroro club that was occupying it have gone to other premises we have had expressions of interest from groups including a drama a drama group as a long-standing credible reputation in the wider Christchurch community and with a toy library and people who have expressed interest in it we add despair about the delay and consideration we look forward to some funding we know these funding sorry we know this funding of the long term plan now we didn 't know there was funding in the long term claim because it 's not apparent it 's over 500,000 and it 's an optics somehow and you won 't be seeing and but we only found out about it when we were briefed at long last on it and so there is money there that 's been allocated for it to appear and there groups that are waiting William yeah we want her to earlier we want it earlier _''_11586.489 of the things we have asked for we would like to delay or delete repair of the Cray Croft cabins I 'd love to go in there and have a look I 'd love you guys to go in there and have a look you 'll be people here have been in there to have a look but it can be fenced off and Elaine and the repair are rated wait can wait for us to win lotto I 'd like to thank Hornby Hall School and rigaton for the contribution to the discussion on Lincoln Road curl it to rights unfortunately their residents didn 't elect them because they don 't cover that area we do and our position is not that Lincoln Road should be widened we think we can save eight million dollars there are four lanes at the lights of culottes and rights one going left one going right and to go ahead and we can install a bus priority lane in one of the two going head without widening this road one meter not one meter and if we care about public transport we can more cash means anything else but build it and they will come we are idiots we can save ourselves eight million dollars we can save Paul 's will horn be written from heading to worry about the section of the road that isn 't part of their Ward and and we can get exactly what needs to be done in terms of bus priority without widening their Road a single meter and we can save eight million dollars and here are teachers well thank you in the comments down actually just wanted to say thank you for actually bringing us something that has a saving I 've just been counting in my head we 're up to about fifty million dollars of extra capital from just this morning which is one piscina right at minus eight million it 's forty two million so thanks I think yeah it 's a it 's a good example of you know the focus of a lot of what we do is especially I think and even the community boards is all the capital stuff but you even mentioned that we 've got something you know I think there 's a bit of exercise where we could actually look at Optics as well as the capex because that 's what 's really going to drive some of the savings and the council and you identified it beautifully and also the first first community board as well so think I just wanted to make that comment because it 's they were very very familiar with you know they were talking to the universe I 've got a new committee so they 've gone through quite a my wonder destruction was the story thank you very much and thank you also for the for the reminder again around the importance to flag the disability issues and our papers so I 'll discuss that with the chief executive but there are a few things about around the decision making papers that come to council that could be improved and I think one of the elements is actually the requirement for any disability issues to be tagged and the actual report and then if it 's a tag and the report then somebody 's going to have to so it serves as a reminder where it 's not required and that serves as a action point where it is so thank you very much for trying again hopefully this time we 'll get a result look thank you very much I 'm now going to adjourn the meeting until 30 tomorrow morning so thank you all very much for participating today I think that 's a very good start you _"

    "text": "and last but certainly not least Caroline Potter and the spray-tanned cashmere community board representatives thank you no problem puro tato we resent that you were sprayed and kashmir community I said why Varun sprayed in Kashmir Community Board on my left is our aha muy grace and Melanie coca and hello mountain we I want to start us off by just naming and I know this sounds boring and self angry and I think I want to name the residents Association and now the committed groups in our community the City Council used to acknowledge residents association and the old days were the prize for the residents association of the year Vicky back in her role as Mia gave me one month 's be condemned recently its association winner she 's slightly spoiled the occasion by then commenting that Beckenham was a suburb of pseudonym why didn 't we call theirselves there laugh it was meant to be a great honor the hand-crank craft residents association the huntzberger munities center whom a community association sprayed in neighborhood we 're getting to Neighborhood Association the Lokesh mere residents association Sommerfeld rally house a power ho his cat river network Beckenham neighborhood association the hoon a community center and who in a community association corey or a house as schools many of whom the board visited in the last year our churches some of them are some of the people from our two to sustain the residents associations our environmental groups including the river network friends of in declare the Friends of the mid Kashmir stream and new world Sint Maartens Barrington mall zeros cap and he 'll walk behind who hosted us when we consulted the community about the LTP the sprayin appreciates the opportunity to submit on the plan we are speaking to it the board is mindful of the concerns expressed by this is the first time we 've ever raised this the board is mindful of the concerns expressed by residents about rate increases particularly many of those on fixed incomes and we have the largest percentage of our population our older people in this Franklin cash me award are experiencing difficulty with meeting the increasing demands on their financial resources and that includes people with debilitating financial constraints the counselors under and we do and the efforts continues to make to curb rate rises this submission is made with those financial considerations in mind we are also very conscious that for instance we have enormous sums of money being spent on flooding in particular and other infrastructure issues that go with are having and their power Heskett River throughout our Ward and including house purchasers and we also know that we have pockets of flooding that continue to distress residents in our Ward there is no time when we 're not having heavy rain where I don 't think of those people who have had constant flooding not just in their houses but through their garages or on their property and how they lay out what lie awake at night listening to the waterfall they so about general maintenance which normally we don 't bring up either but the board has been hearing from residents like all other courts in the area in Christchurch about the standard of maintenance my council including the footpaths and the potholes and roads parks and reserves and other green space and maintenance of drainage facilities and one other comment we 've got here because I actually went to a talk that was given about the use of herbicides and there 's been we 've made a comment here about the council possibly revisiting sort of the information that you 've looked at before around the not using glyphosate to control weeds so apparently there 's new scientific evidence that says actually it 's not toxic to people so it 's been it 's been collated from a whole lot of scientific evidence it 's not got a whole email of about 10 or 12 links that you could read if you 're interested so um there 's something that we 're wondering if you could look here because it 's a cheaper and more effective bit of as I 'm talking set to people and then the other mix one is around water and we always say this about believing in pure clean and clear water and all forms and particularly around their power Heathkit River and we consider the river to be a town and we 're always looking enhancement of their power heath care wherever in its water quality which of course Carolyn 's kind of mentioned really community founding the board stresses the importance of councils funding of the many community groups and projects that that are at the heart of the city the board would oppose any reduction of the level of community funding and agree with Peppa Nui illnesses submission in this respect they hundreds of dollars in the very few thousands of dollars that we contribute to some organizations disproportionately important to those groups and are disproportionately valuable to the community that those groups serve and we we big we beg the council to maintain them community friendly and keep it in line with inflation safe routes to school this is an this is not one of the 60 subjects and it 's not one of those subjects that has a high priority in terms of subjects that people talk about when they think about the council but it is nonetheless a service to the community in terms of the community tribal advisors and the traffic engineers that the community really values especially the the last year from schools and staff involved with the major cycle routes program and the council staff concerned with the safety of local roads and exits in and out of schools about how much they value the services provided by the council in this respect most recently Tim and I went to and to his instigation went and looked at the Sint Maartens roundabout which we have not put in the long term plan but of the mayor 's idea of the long term pain being a rolling reiteration then we would be thinking about submitting on the Sint Maartens roundabout and in the preps and the next year in the meantime the resourceful traffic engineers have implemented a light indicating it your speed as you approach the roundabout in order to try and keep people safer who are sukham near navigating that very busy area around San Martin school heritage buildings the board that understands there is not sufficient funding to repair all local heritage buildings within the first few years of the long term plan and process has been developed to assess interest in the various heritage heritage buildings must eventually be a priority for the city given those that have gone forever the board has nearly syndicated below at three six and four 1 where it considers some Delaine may be sustainable and where it considers no to no delay to appear would be acceptable we have one priority in our board and that 's coronation Hall because the delay in the consideration on this building has been unfortunate and we would like to see this building and its use addressed very quickly in the next even in the next six months we are always opposed to the Salem council assets as a financial strategy disability access this board has raised disability access possibly six years in a row the board recognizes the importance of disability access being met and to this end has previously sought a specific requirement in all projects and proposals that come to the council committees and community boards to include a requirement for staff comment as to how the proposal or project will affect the accessibility for people with disability I do not understand why the council cannot implement this disability mind when they present proposals and projects to the board nor is it in the forefront of foot ment of people who are assessing those projects disability only becomes important to those who are disabled it is one of the most discriminated against groups I cannot understand why council processes do not allow for consideration on the impact of proposals on people with disability especially in the ordinary idea for instance of getting in and out of your car when faced with Dig Dug assets just for example flooding issues we as I have already said we understand the enormity of the flooding issues experienced in the wake of the newspapers and we appreciate the continuing work in that area by the superb engineers that are involved with all our waters we support very much the proposals for the banks of the hizmet river and for the coolant storage basin and I have spoken to neighbors of the coolants proposal and they a delight the idea of having reserved that will enhance the safety and condition of the water but also present them with a reserve a next door to gets you a little bit though are the people listening to that water that I talked to you about and we have frequently meet with exhausted residents whose houses are being flooded in small pockets of flooding in our ward Manuka cottage Manuka cottage has been operating in adding since the 1990s it 's a very successful community center it it is now in st. Mary 's Church I can remember the despair I 've felt in 2014 when the council told manuka cottage that their cottage would not be rebuilt before 2016 it is delightful to know that we are very close to this the predict the spade in the turf for the turning of the first sod and we would stress that we need continual provision of funding for the premises of this community developed project that has been critical both to the support of the local community and a positive and productive civic engagement over the recent years our priority projects priority is so we 're advocating now for the implementation of the master plan it was developed with lots of consultation quite a long time ago aspects of the plan are now being given effect as the river banks are being stabilized near the South Library and other parts as well and it 's currently underway but when we believe it now is the right time for that work to be undertaken the provision of this funding to be advanced into the volunteering plan Barrington wall this is the third fourth year that the Barrington wall has been our priority last year it was operational funding with the promise that it would be done and last year their difficulties have arisen as it 's natural you can 't get in and out of Barrington mall as a pedestrian you can 't get in and out of Barrington more without mixing it with all kinds of traffic and it 's extremely dangerous and it has the spraying library right next door to to excessive eight the problem the project was the board 's top priority in 1718 annual plan residents going to the mall in the adjacent park are very familiar with the near incidents and accidents they the traffic engineers and put up a camera to small we want the right-hand turn abolished it 's a very simple procedure if you 're a person looking outside apparently if you 're a traffic engineer it 's not but we would hope that this will be funded in going this year the intersection of Barrington Street Lincoln Road and Whitely air this is a significant Canaris a significant community of disabled persons residing at proximity to the intersection the provision and the in the draft long-term for safety prayer plans does not include fully compliant for disability accessibility and safety we would seek this intersection in particular because of the numbers pet of people that live absolutely adjacent to this intersection that who are seriously disabled in living and supported living circumstances that this intersection of all the intersections set the standard for being fully compliant for disability accessibility and safer and safety we have a community center in whom hey that was the children 's library it 's tiny and perfect it is a lovely cottage it is much enjoyed by the neighborhood we had some carols outside of it and we 've eaten the barbecues outside flooding one of about more than 30 people which to our surprise work very comfortably housed we cannot practice menarche Tonga in this little community center which just incidentally the saving of which was led by Melanie coca we cannot practice monarchy toner in there because it 's got no kitchen we want a few thousand dollars to put in a kitchen and a disabled loo and this little place will be perfect for the humane community which has not had a community center before the intersection of Kashmir hoon Hayward sleaze road has been postponed this is a dangerous intersection that 's one of those intersections that our neighbours of porn being horrible Riperton talked about in terms it 's one of the intersection to long trek kashmir road that our neighbours talked about and this intersection particularly needs addressing right now right now and our neighbour talked about the intersection coming off the hills of thank God for your memory if we can have a proper intersection here with lights that will pulse the traffic and bull probably help even worse more than that far away and Coronation sustained fire damage in October 2015 the people who care arun club that was occupying it have gone to other premises we have had expressions of interest from groups including a drama a drama group of the long-standing incredible reputation in the wider christchurch community and with a toy library and other people who have expressed interest in it we add despair about the delay and consideration we look forward to some funding we know these funding sorry we know these funding of the long term plan now we didn 't know funding in the long term claim because it 's not apparent it 's over 500,000 and it 's an optics somehow and you won 't be seeing it and but we only found out about it when we were briefed at long last on it and so there is money there that 's been allocated for it to appear and their groups that are waiting William yeah we want her to yeah we wanted it earlier we haven 't_''_1070.47 asked for much and this is one of the things we have asked for we would like to delay love to go in there and have a look I 'd love you guys to go in there and have a look you 'll be people here have been in there to have a look but it can be fenced off and aligned and the repair rated wait can wait for us to win lotto I 'd like to thank Hornby Hall school and rigaton for the contribution to the discussion on Lincoln Road curl it to rights unfortunately their residents didn 't elect them because they don 't cover that area we do and our position is not that Lincoln Road should be widened we think we can save 8 million dollars there are four lanes at the lights of tulips in Wright 's one going left one going right and two going ahead and we can install a bus priority lane in one of the two going head without widening this road one meter not one meter and if we care about public transport we can support that and if we think widening roads to allow more cards means anything else but build it and they will come we can save Paul 's will Hornby Riverton from heading to worry about the section of the road that isn 't part of their ward and we can get exactly what needs to be done in terms of bus priority without widening their Road a single meter and we can save eight million dollars and here to dispel thank you in the comments [Music] Dion actually just wanted to say thank you for actually bringing us something that has a saving I 've just been counting in my head we 're up to about fifty million dollars of extra capital from just this morning which is one bosina right about minus eight million it 's forty two million so thanks I think yeah it 's it 's a good example of you know the focus of a lot of what we do is specially I think and even the community boards is are the capital stuff but you even mentioned that we 've got something in optics that that we 're not all seen so you know I think there 's a better exercise where we could actually look at 's really gonna drive some of the savings and the council and you identified it beautifully and also the first first Community Board as well so [Laughter] I 've got a new committee so they 've gone through quite a thank you very much and thank you also for the for the reminder again around the importance to flag the disability issues and our papers so I 'll discuss that with the chief executive but there are a few things about around the decision making papers that come to council that could be improved and I think one of the elements is actually the requirement for any disability issues to be tagged and the actual report and then if it 's a tag and the report then somebody 's going to have to check to see if there are any disability related issues so it serves as a reminder where it 's not required and that serves as a action point where it does so thank you very much for trying again hopefully this time we 'll get a result look thank you very much I 'm now going to all very much for participating today I think it 's a very good start _"

    "text": "Celie back on the team for Allenwood central Heathkit I apologize for my comment as I meantersay Ponsonby it was a joke about a TV show I retract I 'll stop watching TV oh hey it 's like herding cats isn 't that yep far away okay thanks weather wipe our community board would like to thank the council for allowing us to speak to our submission with me today I 've got um Tim Lee go lay some and Jake McClellan yeah yeah we 've got the whole board here except for one person and they will speak on parts of our mission as well and I would just officially like to speak on the proposed capital program item the language will stand Paul Airport campus a huge area and covers the suburbs of Eddington even Science Romney Phillips town central city Sydenham Austin Wilson none would history meet Mount Pleasant rector of some then parts of San Albans now we as a board a very diverse diverse group of people from across these various suburbs however we are totally United about the need for an aquatic community facility especially the lower socioeconomic suburbs in our area we do not eat about the need for this we you know that where it should go and we know about the type of facility that is proposed in our communities and these areas are united and right behind us on this issue we do not support any reduction in funding or extending the timeline for this community facility and a board really appreciates the council 's resolution to delegate a decision of the location scope and final concept design to the board I just want to say and our submission we 've included some projects it could be deferred or cancelled to help with your budgeting process we also support alternate ways of the council raising money now I 'm going to pass to Jake to talk about human children sure I 'm just gonna briefly touch on in a city priorities so the regeneration of the Lynwood village is something this board is determined to see real progress happen and in the current term and the community lead revitalization and is well underway will be completed by December 2018 we abreast of our learnings so early community feedback indicates that more community facilities and green spaces are a priority and the board seeks requests funding to implement the plans all-important priority projects and that same vein we 're calling for a greening of the inner-city East that 's a high priority for the ward area I represent the board requests funding for this to enhance in the aesthetic and the health outcomes of the neighborhood and contribute to Christchurch as image as a Garden City this needs to be a part of the city residents even more proud to belong to money has been assigned but now we keen to see keen to see some project progress the board would also like to commune console and councillors housing first and I should have however we continue to advocate for more in high quality social housing Daryl thank you good morning everybody three issues that I 'd like to address the first is drinking water storm water and flood protection infrastructure drinking water storm water and flood protection a significant priorities for the city and the board fully supports the council around coastal hazards and signals the need for funding in the widest sense to implement priority actions in the future secondly the master plan is inclusive of the fury road master plan will in Washington Village upgrade and Heath Captain Oak Street Street capes enhancements and the suburban master plan programs overall council will be aware that there are nine master plans within the limb would central Heath board area we had five of those master plans so it was a significant issue so the board supports the completion of all suburban master plans in the board area inclusive of Buchan Park remodel the suburban master planning process has helped achieve a restoration of the a vision for suburban Christchurch that has been a process of rebuilding people 's confidence expectation and optimism in their communities and the wider city so therefore we support the council 's initiatives and the master planning areas finally the scape facility Sumner to ferry Mead and the village green this as a priority project of significance in the bays area for our board escape facility for youth will have multiple benefits it has been extended period of time and the time is now right to bring through this process to fruition before the board supports this project as it has been a long-standing community project thank you Tim the first ones might major cycleways now the subways projects overall in the city have reached an interesting stage where enough has been done to get numbers on how many people will be using them and the figures that are coming through show that the cycle ways are popular and will be used even more than anticipated so we strongly encourage completion of the cycle ways in our area if good expressway revenue a cycle way without without any further further delays so we support strongly funding of those cycle ways we also know that the Rapa Nui cycle way will connect the center of the city through to the beginning of the Christchurch coastal pathway fairy maiden and that leads me on to the second one which is the coastal pathway itself the works currently underway on the pathway that will be carried out next year or so will bring the pathway to the position in place the bit that 's missing is that will be the chunk around the difficult section around the Hawke 's Bay and as a board we ask we request that the project is taken to full completion it has so many benefits in terms of of Health protecting against climate change outcomes providing safe transit between suburbs the connection between Red Cliffs and some is a very difficult section and is a dangerous one for pedestrians and cyclists so we strongly urge that that is completed what dimension at the beginning of the coastal pathway there 's that lovely little villain called Cobb cottage which is much loved but as sitting under plastic and quietly who knows what 's happening to it under there we strongly support repair of Cobb cottage as soon as possible it 's one that 's much left on the community and the strong support for it to be brought out and up from wraps and into a place where people can enjoy it and finally I want to talk about the flood protection works particularly along the heath go and a powerful River the boards have been very patient while the council does the detailed work of mapping out exactly how things have changed and exactly what the impact of various remedying activities will have it is now time for those to be implemented and implemented as quickly as possible so we strongly support the flood protection work along the hiss kit we also know that it gives a great deal of opportunities for community enhancement walkways cycleways etc in a relatively inexpensive way along a beautiful part of it so we encourage community consultation with there 's a strong desire for that time for that to happen for a safety perspective but I would also add so much the community thank you I just had one more thing to say um last year we advocated for a drop-in center a citywide project for a drop-in center for Street communities and we will leave and after the annual pain with the idea that council was going to work with us on this and have it somewhere near Central City and we put forward a site for it a council piece of land for it this is going in you know how we can help progress this idea further we get questions right good well I 've got Jamie Glen Phil Mike right thank you you speak to the inner city East revitalization particularly around the loom Wood Village area but I wanted a feel board interview on central city residential specifically within the four airs I used to put it differently I know the dog part request but does the board wish to see more residents living centrally and is there a role for the council to do more or help incentivize I do think that what you have in place which the government are no put in place in terms of what you 've got to do in Central City I think it limits what people can do in there and is causing a lot of problems now as we have an issue coming up a little later today about how places are being able to be built without any parking and so therefore other strengths and having to take the brunt of that you know and they want to walk place to the back and then the other streets have all the parking for that if you look at our board agenda you 'll see that today we issue so I think if anything the council could have a look at the what the government did was the single city and maybe ever rethink about how how it 's actually working out yeah it 's a district plan issue but I was just quite surprised that you hadn 't taken a position on the numbers of people sorry like it doesn 't anybody you know it 's not seen well actually here 's the space of n we could have tiny houses on here 's some land where people could build some bigger houses rather than having every having to have ate a unit every 200 square meters yeah well that 's there is an interpretation of it but I hope you 've got someone from the resource consenting area all that does the district clean people coming to talk to your community because Simon did this is this not a requirement it 's not a restriction you can 't not have parking but it 's not a requirement to a parking but anyway that 's so if you 've got 400 square meters in a single city area and you try and put one house on it it 's very difficult to get it for council yeah there is a there is a there is a requirement to build more densely than you would in the neighborhoods yeah that 's true yeah if I could add to what Sally is saying and say that this is not necessarily a board perspective it 's a personal perspective but I do have a concern over the way the development is taking place within the central city particularly with the parking issues and the accessibility issues I think that there is something that the council needs to reflect on because the feedback that I 'm getting even within our board is that there is an area of concern yeah the district planners the district clean those OLTP process is not something that we can utilize but the desire to have more people living in the CBD far I mean was a lot sooner than the it 's been in the urban development strategy for a very long time and I 'm just surprised that the community board doesn 't have a view on 20,000 by 2024 no 2041 was the urban development strategy and all the there 's been no change to the urban development strategy that brings that forward at this stage but that is what we 're working on Glenn fool Thank You page 92 you say request additional funding for new social housing units can you please tell us what precisely would be that funding source and it 's in the context of the LTP submission comes submissions come into board okay well it 's written and it 's also on the I 'd say yeah it 's just a bit of a general statement it 's not up to us to decide how your capitalization of your Housing Trust happens or anything okay what we are saying is we support social housing and we support more yes we 're requesting additional funding it 's in your submission but you 're not saying where it 's from I just said that yeah we would say you can defer these or cancel some of them even if you wish to say it 's the money no an information so thank you um you you 've community housing first program and also referred to developing the social housing increasingly so just when asked about that we 're the drop-in center concept might fit in with that with especially for example housing first for people homeless now there might be aligned and fit together preps and also wonder if you talk to the city mission preps about the drop-in center I 'd like to get a lines together and we bought this idea of dropping the center to you because we felt it was really needed and the annual plan and we were told we 'll go to committees which I think you apart money or committees maybe new film your committee and I can 't remember else 's committee and we would you accounts would work with us as a board however we have not heard anything back from from anybody about this in it 's why I 'm raising here I think as well selling it would be good because I thought you were going to be because it 's a citywide project rather than just a board project and the homeless Christchurch but where they congregate is often in my okay thank you very much and I just like to acknowledge obviously you the board support for us in number which is a much-needed aquatics facility in your area and also your ongoing support of community facilities in st. Albans is a part of the community board er it 's actually a significant part as well there is a lot of residents in there and it 's only a hundred meters away from the st. Albans community and it 's gonna be rebuilt and also around 300 meters away from the st. Albans poor community the community are actually saying we want this bed so as a community board would you support these community projects giving the additional funding required st. Albans Paul each report in the st. Albans community center which pretty much is right on the boundary of central and actually affects a lot of the residents that you the boundary question tree because it was bound to be a lot of the users of that Center are gonna be from central and also the same with each report three hundred meters from the boundaries so a lot of the users of the pool are going to be actually from central and we 've heard very clearly from the community about how important these two produce there so you may not have a board view but does anyone have a personal view no it 's not fair but there here is a board and I think that you 've cleverly raised that issue and I 'm sure that they will take it back to their community board for further consideration before they come in I think the issue here is not raising a question and putting it in front of us cold but give us the information and let us make a decision rather than putting us on the spot to answer something that we don 't have all the facts on yeah I think that 's absolutely the right answer and it does give us an opportunity to the some of the wards we 've already heard you know that things transferred from one ward to another and then changed community boards and so people who 've very familiar with a particular subject suddenly are faced with it being dealt with in another Ward so anyway that gives us an opportunity we would in no way back down from our very strong support for the Lumet Aquatic Center in the and making decisions process and you know the advantage of raising the age where one is the incredible cost saving that it would represent if it we 're modeled on the other side of the board so just saying so thank you very very much for coming for today and for putting so much effort into your presentation that 's very much appreciated thank you _"

    "text": "and could I now invite Pam Richardson and the team from Banks Peninsula community board so this morning I 've got with me representative and of course Joan legend who 's their governments advisor on my dear look this is a challenging morning and attached to our presentation we have put the big spinach to community board submission summary for you a one-pager that gives you an outline Department and of course our submission is it 's very full and yeah I would love to see a time on top of these that we could actually be watching or words are ticking over because they make clock has actually gone so to follow what 's going on anyway I liken myself to to come in that we are the garden Kim talked about her house in her living room and rooms of your house we are the garden mix Peninsula and the B see some amazing photographs of so wanted Linden into how we fit in with the city and this next slide shows a hundred thousand hectares on the right hand side and the very small area on the 've got 651 kilometers of council roads 3331 of which is 331 of unsealed we 've got 145 council parks 116 local community parks 8 garden parks and here is just about six sport parts and 15 regional parks about 14 cemeteries based across the peninsula got seven major sports and recreation amenities in the area and the ekor are is the only cruise port at the moment in Canterbury and we had over 200,000 visitors from the cruise ship season so that 's where we fit into the city and what we walk for the long term is a fit for future infrastructure infrastructure is very important for us over the years it has been well I hope people talk about sweetened it sounds like an awful term but a lot of the facilities on banks financial have ended they 're getting near the end of their life and they need to be maintained to a better standard or we start a planning process of a new one the next one is about transport about our roads and our walls now this is where we 've heard the most information and the submission has come from the very many meetings that we 've had the reserve management committees that we work with so we have many opportunities of working with our communities so we pick up a lot of information and our submission is based on that information that we collect from our communities so this is an area where we are where we 're looking at doubling budgets because of the road measuring our roads are in very poor condition and as I look back over the weekend I found a document that was 1998 thanks for the district council braiding policy and the same issues we are dealing with today the base structure of those roads is in poor condition it 's we have not been able to improve this situation with the budget that we 've been achieving over the years so that will be in the system somewhere that would allow you to see what has been talked about the calls that renew programs as another one as though as we 're seeing increased storms on the peninsula we need to make sure that our far too small there are small Calvert 's they need a lot of maintaining we need to see a greater budget to improve those we need to see that the funding we 've walked for for the diamond half of Warren all the wharf is Diamond Harbor wolf was part of a network part of a roading network a tourism opportunity and it 's an it is there are difficulties with it and a safety of us so we 're looking also for the start which soon as on the corral Wharf renew when we ask for a renewal mean for for war for new projects we are asking that that we actually as out community becomes clear to us when they 're in the time in the tire and the plan process and there 's some certainty that they are going to be looked at at some stage and a little bit of money to start a project would be very welcome to get them the planning going through with our communities because a lot of these projects for example the ekor are Wharf will have to go through there 's Asus toric Wharf and there will be a number steps that we need to go through safe drinking water or the three waters there 's another area we we want to see that we 're improving the situation on banks peninsula unfortunately the first one near the Akane 's Bay potable water supply is in a community that has got a camping ground that is very popular it 's got a museum a school but it 's got a very small base population and at the moment that that water supply is well it doesn 't meet the standards at all it 's not it 's not not a good situation and all and it 's the City Council and poor light that we 've here we have a council that has got a CC management in it involved with the community in Tahoe and we haven 't got a community what a good community water supply same with why new even waste water supply it 's been one that 's been in and out of the system over the years and that back in 2011 that was today it 's not included at all it is very for a very small community but it 's vital that we get their water out of the the water out of the harbor acara Harbor and onto me and so what 's the use of taking the a pariah wastewater out of the harbor if we 're going to have a going in on the wainui side so we need to look at how we can do that and in our submission there we give pets an idea of an example of what we might do to resolve these regional facilities most of a lot of those that the facilities that a lot of the things that we 've got on banks potentially going to consider them regional facilities like the diamond harbour Wharf the echo heart a pariah Harbor wolf know the Akane 's Bay water scheme as you could consider then her regional facility as well so naval point and that 's a bit confused and they and the document it talks about Littleton marine marina and environments development be included as presented in the draft but it our water activities whether it 's swimming with board suit whatever it might be but it 's important that we have a facility there and there is some funding that is already being identified from the community that they would be quite happy to form partnership and and look at building to house no well naval points and also the the Coast Guard so there are a lot of opportunities down there for for working together as a team now what we want from the long term plan are connected communities and empowered citizens and I think that we over the years have got those as you can see up there we 've got you canes by camping ground we 've got the devotional we 've got Little River and the big ideas and we 've got the hot Diamont Harbor plan so we have worked with many of our communities over the years the three at the bottom will be run by reserve committees and then the two at the top of energy planning and resonance and ratepayers local residents behind them so for our local facilities them these like the devotions hall and the Natalie Cola and there are many others Allen Dale 's got a new one governor 's base got a new one but for many of them they are very old and not not decrepit or do for demolish to be demolished they are focuses of our community for example the pigeon Bay all and so a little bit of money would help to to improve those those facilities and continue to keep those groups working in behind him the next one is new um we talked about it 's the banks managed to toilet block renewals what a subject anyway the funding has been identified for a number of toilet Rock with toilet blocks across the peninsula so we are looking at putting looking at asking the council could we put the lump sum together for those toilet blocks on the pinch and look at working through with the community board and the communities to work out which ones are more more important than others that we should be starting with or so figured a community planting planning we 've had two planning processes diamond Harbor Village plan both of those have got a plan at very little cost fifteen thousand dollars was allocated to them and I don 't think either of them use their full funding amount so it would be nice now to look at allowing them to have some funding to do some of those projects and there are many of them and you 'll hear from the little Weber IRA trust who is looking at pushing those forward and so coastal inundation is one where we look at needs to come forward we need to be thinking about it now in fact tomorrow we 've got a power cut and Pigeon Bay where and where a Ryan are actually putting rises on our power poles because they 're in the see now that the sea walls have disappeared so it is in front of our eyes and we need to start with that but with working with our banks potential communities to look at how we 're going to deal so maximizing our investment it 's about empowerment through partnerships and those are all the plans that we 've 've got here the Littleton port plain recovery plan the Erie Management Plan wara a little didn 't master pet there 's a huge number of them is about empowering through partnership and that 's how we banks peninsula well how the whole city needs to be looking at how can we get the best out of our communities at the least cost and a little bit of money goes a long way so they 're just finally here the next one where does the money come from it 's about board empowerment it may be that we 're looking looking at prioritizing though the funding that 's allocated to some of those bigs finish your projects and we look no clearly look at where they might go maybe we look at the cemeteries funding and decide where it might might best be spent but we thank you for the opportunity to come and talk to you today and on the final slide we 've got our vision and our way of working which comes from our I just wanted to make one final comment about the rating Health Center could actually support our community just the ekor our community to get some extra funding to support them to assist with that process I 'm looking at the the development that you have available for improvement in a business district improvement why can 't that sort of be looked at for a similar sort of situation for helping your community our Hospital and Health Services public facilities they 're not private so can I just take that into one of the yeah well I 'm glad that you raised that when I begin because that was the one that I wanted to ask about you know it did occur to me I went out to a meeting with one of the counselors downes words with the Sydenham business community and that and they kind of they were the Business Improvement District model which has been established and our in our planning processes they weren 't really aware of it and didn 't really see that it was a possibility and were quite interested in it so I think that raising it now as you have it as good I have support the idea but I think that 's because they haven 't had a real example such as yours and so maybe what we need to do is in order to facilitate your community that wants to be considered in this way as whether we can find a mechanism for expanding a Business Improvement District model and to a more community oriented model but but but it does it does present us with a challenge because you 've got a real example a real live example where the communities on board and I think that it 's been quite challenging for people to think well we don 't want another rate but they don 't see it that it 's actually a fundraising mechanism for something that people want and that they have to vote for it in order to go down that track but it has been a bit of a wake-up call about how important that is so you I 'm just kind of reinforcing that I know I 've got Sarah and Vicki just wondering while the budget for Everywhere 's is eerie tight with the abri been around for a while such as the you know a crow wharf and the diamond harbour those kind of things and you 've also got the naval point I 'm sorry if it would be useful to have the ability to be able to prioritize within those if funding wasn 't available to add more then whether it would be useful for you as a board to be able to prioritize funding within those at all I think that would be very difficult for us to do that because they 're there for different reasons I know a good point is for recreation Dermott Harbor is for a transport network yeah Aurora 's for cruise ships economics visitors yeah very difficult so I think that you know I think that we would accept that perhaps a little bit of seeding funding to start the processes to get them moving among the working groups going to look at how they 're going to do it what 's going to be involved like we have with naval point and then we need to know that it 's going to be included he 's so naval points got a big chunk some it had some sieve initially now it 's got a bit of a chance yes yes would maybe taking some of that chunk to do seed funding for the other ones to look at how they will be developed just a little no I can 't if there 's no other funding available yeah these are regional facilities would claim that these are other regional facilities and the perhaps some of the budgets in town need to be looked at so that we can actually complete these rip these facilities for the region they are for the region they 're not for banks Peninsula totally they are mainly for the region thank you a lot of them are health and safety issues yep condition safety stuff is really really important that 's why sort of the other yeah it 's not extra funding available then would you like the opportunity to choose we haven 't_''_930.31 we haven 't considered that as a board whether we can choose how picky thank you for the submission I noticed some the fingers of on one this morning that they allocated they did a big wreck that they would have their on the contributions this is the proposed capital expenditure by award mm-hmm and banks potential was interesting in that the kept expenditure is about on this graph about 13 to 14 percent and the rates contribution about two two and a half right so there is a major contribution from the rest of the city ratepayers what I 'm intrigued by them is your response to the fuel tax and I understand the logic behind it but given how much other ratepayers are contributing here what 's your alternative suggested spreading of rates food and given how high it will become well I think you 've got a look at banks miniature what is banks furniture it is the backdrop to the city no no I 've got the garden analogy in all of yeah it 's Rick its regional issues that were actually we 're doing and I do think it 's very unfair to look at those rate payers of they 're paying for all of those things that are there thing about alternative forms of revenue raising yes and you didn 't like the food so I would have expected that you would have looked something out something different we haven 't had the time to look at anything else that 's different to Vicki I think that 's it 's quite an unfair question of expecting it was very short timeframe that was around that we 're not economists I think it 's no it 's I think it 's a bit unreasonable to expect us as a community to come up as alternative perhaps we might put a road text at the beginning of banks peninsula and collect from all of those that come and visit us I don 't know I don 't know it 's so difficult and the very people that you 'll take that extra Rotex are us that can travel long distances to your meetings to do things in town and yet our roads are in poor condition so we need to look at it at equitably yet we do need to look at equity and feeling it is very challenging I mean 've said it before the shotgun wedding between Christchurch City and Banks Peninsula was always going to play out this way so we have to find a way that we can work together in order to achieve what needs to be achieved with this enormous challenges facing us particularly with a coral wastewater that the other things that you 've highlighted so we 're going to have to it is going to be a question of working together to find solutions so any baby that we start now we don 't leave it until just a few months before the before we totally agree right now working together do it I 've read the submissions for tomorrow and I know a number of people going to say that we can actually do this whole process of LTPS a lot better and I agree and I think that by instead of and I rested this before so I 'm just going to steal his idea but attribute and it is is that if we actually just think of this as a as an iterative process every year I mean you can go through a special consultant procedure or not in a consultation document depends on the significance of the changes that you 're making so why not take this as a much more iterative process over the three-year and then engage the community and the consultation documents themselves so I leave I mean I 'm not saying leave it with us but work with us over how we could do this bitter over oh absolutely absolutely yeah eonni thank you and resubmission and I I dunno notice that the peninsula community has been very good at looking at how to work with us jointly and has got I guess because of the history a way of doing things which seem a lot less than what we would do and with that being said I was really interested in the navel point because it seems a huge amount of money given all the concerns that you 've raised on all the other things that you 'd like funded have you thought about how much of that would just be essential to get something there that would be you know it 's still so that we could fund some of the other things that you 're asking for well there are some things that have been looking at you know putting in something that might be temporary but whereas we know temporary upon becomes permanent more substantial button to start off with to get it moving rather than putting something and for example taking the pontoons that are out there there now and you could pick up a news but they 're in a poor condition they 're the best of the poor but you know the advice is that we need to use it for we need to put something that 's in and fits in with the plan that 's going to go move ahead that 's going to move ahead but certainly maybe that is an option that we actually look at what can we what can we start doing it I do I 'd be really interested given the number of things that you 've asked us to look at funding for if you could look at the navel point projects and work out which was really the most a regional facility and yet the community boards got the delegation over so are you happy to give up delegation if it 's a regional metropolitan facility that would we we would be part of it wouldn 't we I 'm not sure but um can I just take Aaron because it 's we 're bright on the deadline for time you 're mine was just a quick point and I loved your photos at the start you 're certainly competing with the eastern suburbs for the best photos of the city this looking part and the analogy around the garden versus the living room and stuff I think it 's better a family analogy and I look at banks potential a lot more like a mirror of our wife but they look really good but very expensive I 'm actually going to strongly objected I 'm basically gonna roll it out of order I mean I know what you 're trying to say and it just really was a very bad way to try and say so just just you know just it 's fine for Friday night team got some amazing skills within our staff to allow us to put these presentations together we have spent many hours many many hours over the last few months getting things together understanding what the issues are and they 're really deserving of wonderful echelons yes thank you very much and very well-deserved thank you right if we could have found _"

    "text": "so Livan 11 welcome Ali on behalf of popery and US community board people settle down please and take your seats thank you enough of this jibber-jabber so that was my favorite television program Boston Legal just just saying beer with its another one of my favorite television bergen 's Miranda right hi we gonna be a little bit like the Two Ronnies here we 've got all our information but we 're gonna just kick each other under the desk as we get to the bits women talk about and I 'm Ellie Jones from and I send one of the hardest things for our board to see clearly what the community is to see clearly what the community needs hearing what the community needs and knowing that we have nothing that we can take out of the draft LTP in our ward of course boards anyone can request new things be included in the draft LTP without understanding it has to be give and take things go and things have to come out with all who bear the Papa new en-us board doesn 't have anything to take major infrastructural work land drainage program cycleways those kinds of projects that said we do have some requests and some arguments to back up our requests for funding of projects and our water one of the jewels and the papua new eunice crown is the Styx River and the surrounding environs and this is something that emma has been working with staff and with residents on so I will throw too closely with the river catchment working party and our board supports the resolutions included in our submission which came from them but we do know it will be subject to the land drainage staff determining the timing of the works within their project prioritization however we would like to specifically mention the need for further dredging and continued weed cutting which clearly has a financial impact but is absolutely key to managing and maintaining this river we also support the development of a Styx River master plan and the necessary funding required to make that happen this is essentially a foundation from which we can work to ensure the sustainability of the steps River and the full of information now the traffic on some really lovely photos up there can you do that it 's some really lovely photos of what has been done in the sticks that we have a very engaged community here schoolchildren supported actually by excellent work from council staff the traffic in our ward is one of probably the number one concern our residents have and have had for some time the hills road end of Westminster Street which you can see here has a playground a preschool motor herd primary Christchurch Park and there is a building there that may be used by the community in the near future and that means a large number of children and families are regularly crossing this increasingly busy right there is no safe crossing point on this road until you get to Cranford Street which is about 1.5 kilometers in the other direction and that 's not really very safe some days either now the board is requesting funding for a pedestrian refuge to ensure that our children and families can safely cross Westminster Street another part of this issue of traffic and related to traffic concern across a number of boards in our Ward and the pnina 's Ward we have 15 primary schools two intermediates and three high schools we have a very very concentration schools and in fact we have a very high concentration of families and children living in our Ward the Papa Nui Anna 's Community Board continues to support the citywide 40-kilometer in our school zones and that they be maintained at 500,000 for the 2018-19 financial years to allow the program to be accelerated and all schools currently on the waiting list need to have speed zones and stalled still with traffic and the Christchurch Northern Corridor or the C and C is one of the biggest Road in projects in the city bringing more than 20,000 cars I think I 've heard the figure mic up around 28,000 through that honest Road intersection how many the this is not being my strong point 55,000 through that intersection into the Ward from the north and that 's clearly going to have implications for the residential areas in which the project ends which is that earnest Road Cranford Street area high residential area with a lot of families and children now we call less than it 's been called by by the council as well the downstream effects to the CNC to the Northern Corridor and the board 's contention is the funding for the work to counter these effects is in the LTP at the wrong time now the downstream effects will be felt as soon as the project is finished in mid 2020 but it 's currently the bulk of the money is in the 2021 component of the draft LTP and we suggest that work needs to be completed before then to ensure that we are ready and and it 's currently in there too late right major cycleways routes the completion of the circle way program in our ward specifically the northern line cycle way this is partly built already in as well used by residents and to across the water however it 's missing a vital link between Tucker 's and Starks Road and cyclists are currently using a grass beside the railway line to get to where they want to be obviously this is meter away from the railway track and so we want to see that soakaway finished as soon as possible and that 's an unfenced as well so they 're right there up against the track the board 's concerned that slowed the delivery of the program will cost council more in the long term I think that 's a really key point and I know one of the issues across the we understand that the issues across the city around quality of roads and pavements and we 'll get to that in a minute particularly in the Shirley part of our Ward but the Greer 's Northcutt sawyers arms roads and such intersection the highest accident rate for pedestrians in our Ward we 've had one footer fatality and a significant number of car accidents Northcutt Road will become busier once the CNC the Northern Corridor is completed it was actually meant to be completed already around about two years ago but it keeps being deferred and again this is a health and safety issue the new subdivisions around hi state Cavendish and gardener 's roads are creating more traffic because it 's so it 's not going to get any better and we have a couple of streets in Richmond which we are pushing for to get included in the LTP and Nichols Street and also Randall Street and we 'll talk some more about the issues in this year of Shirley ER in a moment however these particular streets need to be singled out for urgent inclusion and the renewal program they were on the program Nicholls Street was on the program but he 's now been pushed off and we also support the remaining one-third of Randall Street two thirds of it has been done but the other third isn 't so we want the whole lot to be done residents have come to the board on more than one occasion about this and we are hearing from them regularly as well by our email and phone calls which is you know that 's our job but we need to raise it with you well in August 2017 the mayor has always been passionate about the resilience and well-being of community said and I quote the most that end our Ward needs facilities for our community there is nothing in the draft LTP new community facility wise for our Ward for the next 10 years nothing zilch nothing for the next 10 years this is despite parts about Ward in dire need of such facilities there are projects and train and we 're grateful for those however they 're a long time coming and they still not complete some have been delayed it 's an all-men 's part the best use Park in our Ward has been unusable since February 2011 and was in poor condition prior because of drainage that is now underway and is looking fantastic can 't_''_561.99 wait for that to happen however of course with the Windsor here now it 's going to be at least another 1 to 2 seasons before or you know autumn and winter and into the summer before it can be used and we have the very reasonably priced sand albans community center which has been delayed because of an objection to the resource consent our Ward and Papineau ENS Ward has been forgotten in many ways particularly but not the East we hear so much about no big pool complex or hot pools here I won 't tell you what you already know but we do want to emphasize that this area particularly contains continues to be to struggle to be stressed by ongoing major land drainage work which combined with major roading projects has seen residents deal with noise dust vibrations roadworks closures and general disruption for almost 5 years this is where we need community amenity community facilities hence the top priority of funding for a community facility to replace the well used and much-loved Shirley Community Center at 10 Shirley Road now this may not be replaced as a community center but it is a community facility needed it has been in and out of the LTP an annual plan like a yo-yo of the five years the community has been consulted they have an expectation and that expectation has been dashed more than once the funding of more than a hundred sorry the funding of a hundred and fifty-three thousand dollars was originally allocated in the 2020 2021 financial year to begin consultation which is where we thought it was at the end of our last workshop and there was to be subsequent funding however when the draft LTP came out it was nowhere to be seen for the next ten years that means nearly 20 years until this community gets a replacement facility on this site we would like this reinstated we have a list of people in the area who support the reinstatement of this community center or community facility and we can leave those names with you I think an important thing to remember too is that there are eight schools and surely again reflecting its residential and family aspect sixty-five percent of residents are families with children it 's one of the highest percentages in the city and census figures show that twenty-one point two percent of the population is between zero and 15 years compared with a city average of 17 point eight this community is close to breaking point they need a place to meet and together to repeat the funding of a hundred and fifty three thousand originally allocated in the 2020 2021 financial year to 2019 plus subsequent funding and we would like this reinstated the board requests a further three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in funding as we 've had the opportunity to purchase the section next door which will fit future proof of the project for the community providing much-needed green space in this high-density residential area this wasn 't that something investigated four to five years ago with the backing of the council however with the house on the section it became problematic and was not progressed and we would also like to reaffirm that the original funding is carrying forward from the current next year moving on now to Belfast there is a new school being proposed for Belfast which we see as an opportunity to work with the ministry in the school to build a new library for the community and these have been built around the city before and they work well and so we believe this is an opportunity and it not should not be missed the Belfast library has been included in their long-term plan for a number of years now but has been completely pushed a significant area of christchurch to experience growth over the next eight years and the Christchurch City Council has in fact acknowledged that with the establishment of the Belfast area plan now the edgeware community pool the board is requesting that the council fund five million dollars to the each Mayport group to enable this asset to be completed and the each we 've pool is not an aquatic facility like the council pulse it is a community facility a great gathering place a safe place for people of all ages to meet a place for children and adults to learn to swim and a warm pool for the community to use for exercise and relaxation year-round and the some of the Earth 's outdoor space which will be landscaped and there will also be an indoor teaching pool they have already been inquiries made to the pool group for people who want to provide the learners pool service that 's actually an income stream for the group and there 's certainly interest from providers in the ward and this is one of the issues in the area around here that will sort of change the focus in the area traffic wise as well but we we do want to say that this group has worked incredibly hard to get to this point they have spent a huge amount of money out of their own pocket and when you talk about community partnerships this is a an ideal example of exactly that type of partnership but a partnership is two-way and there has been some support from the council to this point but we believe that there should be more and financially that is a big part of this as well remembering that there would be no operating expenses that would continue with the poor and this also demonstrates when we look at what 's happening across the city with other birds for pools this is about equity this has a budget of around five million dollars to be up and running so you can see it 's good value for money with no operating expense and certainly improves the equity of spend for these types of facilities across the city the council put funds into the long-term plan for such as a skate park or basketball court and this steamed from a meeting we had with a group of young people in Papa noe who more recreational space there are a number of playgrounds lots of open green space and packs but nothing for the youth of the area well that 's our submission I just want to reiterate again or we would like to reiterate oh no we 've got strengthening communities funding sorry this has been obviously an issue for a number of boards as well with the reduction over the last financial year it has not been an increased cover inflation in the last ten years for strengthening communities funding we have a very engaged Ward as far as community groups go and as a very active board working with these community groups and we cannot continue to absorb the costs that have been reduced or the cost that we have to absorb because of the reduction and funding our communities and the strength and well-being of our communities actually make for a stronger City and if we cannot continue to support these groups we believe city across the whole of Christ thank you right Glen Jimmy thank you for your presentation I 'm just curious over are the chili rope facility you 'll notice there 's a you know obviously the temporary facility at McFarland Park Emmett Street 100 608 the Community Church as well so I 'm just how much needs analysis has been undertaken by way of provision you know the needful provision for community we 've been doing that and staff have been doing that for the last four or five years and what we 're finding is that the church facilities are now basically fully direct versity there 's a new one that 's just been set up at the truly working men 's club on Hills Road fantastic what they 've done there has basically got it and completely you know redo it they are at capacity and there are still groups in the area that requires space to meet this is not a casting aspersions against those who are church-going people or Christians but there is a perception sometimes that people want a secular space and so that is as well we met a couple of groups one I can think of which is a Probus group so this is affecting older people as well as younger people particularly this provost cube group is based in Shirley and was sorry was based in Shirley before the earthquakes they now travel to New Brighton to meet and they want to come back and meet in the area that is one of around about eight groups that we 've heard from and we have information from all of them and staff are still collating there so there is definitely a need and we 're not going to argue for something that we don 't believe there is a need for yeah well we can get yes of course concentrated area of high need and Shirley around that McFarland Park area sort of founded by Queens Road Shirley Road and housing new zealand 's about so we believe start a new building plan there as well and that will increase the density and the number of families they 're using that facility so they are very different and should not be confused for the information and we 'll get it Jimmy regarding to the proposed long term print increase we haven 't taken a view on that counselor team because we 've been focusing very much on the community facilities okay yes eventually because the based on your presentation if you seek an additional sum of a project like you mentioned an age where community poor they were happy for the five million dollars another two cent opens the community facility offers library service for total together why not about 5.5 million dollars they prop increase the rates about a 1.2 percent eg+_:_1208.52 you know I think the point that we made that I have to reiterate is that we would very much like to put something in to counter the funds that we 're asking for unfortunately unlike other Ward 's we don 't have anything that we can swap because the spend and our board is almost entirely infrastructural projects Road and land drainage multiple millions of dollars but actually when it comes down to community amenity and facility there is nothing there so I can 't really answer your could look at more equity across the city and maybe there are other Ward 's that might be able to cut back what they 're asking for in order to enable our communities to get a bite of the pie okay thank you Jonnie just quickly there is a cute amount of money because quickly you got away with it the northern arterial the downstream effects have you looked at those budgets and terms of budget savings because it does seem like some of them like the beta straight have several million on dollars for Street sorry but beta the street and Madras Street have several million and it 's quite hard to know how that money could be you know it 's been I mean it seems like a lot of money you 've got for those roading projects so I just wondering if there 's any of those roading projects that you 've identified actually could be reduced in scope to fund some of the things you want we have already gone back to staff to ask that and some of those projects in Barbados area that you obviously so there 's a award ship when we asked for it we asked for information back but the consultations already gone out so yeah but we 're well we it 's we 're still we 're just about to consult on that as far as getting traffic into the other into the city that 's the downstream effect stuff yeah I 'm not entirely understanding what you 're saying yeah I don 't know we 're quite with that boundary Oz but you know just who 's putting some lines on the road several movements not just lines on the road I mean the problem and this is what we 've raised a lot when we 've looked at the cost of some of these works some of them have seem to be very basic road renewals but what and you know this yeah need to once you take out gutters and you put new guttering in and all that kind of stuff as well as why during widening the road traffic lights at 250 to 500 K a pop it 's it 's frustrating but it 's very roading engineers I can 't answer then yeah thank you very much look thank you for your time and presentation it 's very good it 's very valuable having all of this and them to their LTP thank you and _"

    "text": "more than I could invite and Stuart for the coastal period Community Board submissions committee along with Tim centers and income money thank you all for coming this morning and as usual stunning photographs to greet us to your submission you might call it an annual plan like of Christchurch to a house with a huge panoramic window the family that 's everybody here made a great start on the living room with a new children 's play area just outside the room and a few other improvements and pipeline which we appreciate however the family revised its LTP budget for the house and unfortunately the issues in future potential of the living room were not reflected on the family 's new budget the question is does the family really appreciate the full potential of this room currently near our budget item is missing the living room requires an MTP commitment from the family in order for this room to catch up the commitment and investment would attract residents visitors provide huge with creational opportunities increase rate tape bring value and words to the recovery and regeneration of not only so what does this potential actually look like the LTP talks about areas of growth here are some of our current and potential growth areas on top left we have two hot new high schools got residential red zone system subdivision qe2 lured hospital near Brighton foreshore developments and your Brighton master plan and we appreciate and acknowledge your support for DCL and the work that they are doing the question is do you see us as a growth area community initiatives we mentioned this because our community do not just have their hands continually held out but on the contrary their hands are continually getting stuck in after me amazing community have raised and contributed millions of dollars towards events and fantastic community facilities well done to them we appreciate in and knowledge you as a sense of their existence there are existing and proposed LT items are retained for our board and our TP question has the council got the balance right our board sees no polling Prout primarily because temperate flood protection and sealant permanent no budget history each earthquake repairs replacing what we had no budget budget on the slide above you see here Thompson Park car park and graphic the main tennis courts Thompson Park is a highly utilized park and skate park by the beach safety issues need addressing and are a great concern to us the community and the police we require additional budget next year to concurrently address the car park in the safety issues rapidly domain alongside Thompson Park has an 11 year old management plan other than two items of sports two from the tennis court renewals which the board weren 't retained there was no budget to implement the plan the board request 350 p.m. for the next five years we have also highlighted other things in there and Submission like the new brighton bridge for me on a plague of biblical proportions the majors Lynnwood central his Curt very pleased to see budget allocated however for the call and much management plan to be implemented this needs to be increased to three hundred sixty year fourteen years program reprioritization for earthquake ketchup is needed for example up on the screen this is cocaine reserved by Wayne Tony bridge to store current construction material a real ice other examples the New Brighton breezes Road potholes and flooding on pages and New Brighton Road Transport on the Lester 's lift as I 've just explained this is what we have on the right is what we would need to be quite right however we note that the priority prioritization of works is based on condition in traffic volume this is a concern that the east current low traffic volume roads that are in poor condition may not meet this meet this threshold where does earthquake and regeneration start with this criteria through community conversations in the OTP engagement our community repeatedly told us that the 206 million on cycle wave is not a priority given the day-to-day issues they still face an our board agrees a higher priority for our community in relation to transport was invest and improve and public transport connections in services you can 't get a whole family on a bike but you can get a whole family on a bus in principle we support cycleways here we believe a queen said council asked the government a coma stage indirect impacts of all the aforementioned issues to our community are and have been social health and safety economic psychosocial and social degradation to name of you this is in direct contrast to what we the council are aiming towards I quote the LTP heavy AusAID document Christchurch a place of opportunity for all a place that has open to new ideas new people and new ways of doing things a place where anything 's possible this is a great vision this is the positive lens that needs to be worn when finding budget and solutions for our temporary flood protection this is an aerial shot of the South Shore showing the temporary Bund which protects about 500 families in their homes next photo is on the left-hand side you see a picture of a existing wall bubble that was there and got pulled down after the earthquake got damaged and you can see on the right-hand side that 's what it looks like now next page shows what a big time looks like it 's quite nerve-racking for the residents and after this is it some February she can see the temporary bunker Hobart opt lucky there wasn 't a big weather event with it a real real worry even though we are thankful for the temporary bond and has given little Tim little long-term confidence to the family settled up there they are now finding out that some people are trying to build to bind their section and getting these playing they 're playing stoner having trouble getting their resource consent this is this is not good for the community this that is trying to get itself back on its feet this this is to do with being in the high flood area zone let me remind you that a big part of Christchurch would be in the zone if it was not with the stop banks and the ymax Sumner and Haven River temporary stop banks do not give anybody confidence would you go for a long drive with your family and if your mechanic had said that he had done temporary repairs or no brakes as you were seeing the latest slide thus Asheville residents asked a coastal engineer Gary tear to do 've talked to that later we fellas plan as exciting as it covers all the needs protection aesthetics net for locking with a soccer walkway on top what is it concern in the region strategy plan for South Shore South Brighton is there is no budget this is are wearing on to South New Brighton you can see in this picture here this is a picture of some Reno mattresses that were damaged in the earthquake and they were performing very well you can see the trees behind her an excellent condition and of course the next photo will show you another particular bit where it 's undamaged and don 't very well there next photo this is the example of the problem we are now facing we have lost approximately 20 trees with another 30 at risk of going this year with another 6070 behind them apart from being unsightly these pose a big danger to the users of the council walkway alongside the local campground is next to this and has visitors from all over the world what an impression they must get when they see this see that tree there it 's falling over that 's falling towards the pathway it could hang up there another tree this is happening all the time and this is what we can end up if we do nothing about it there 's so many trees there this is not a quick fix we don 't protect it we 're gonna get the Smiths river each tree cost between four to five thousand dollars to remove there 's approximately a hundred trees they 're at risk contractors who have been doing the work on the nearby GE and surroundings have quoted five hundred and fifty thousand to repair the history history yet if we don 't do this we will look at this danger we face for many years to come and you can go back to that plan there Gary tear coastal engineers plan and mention this showcasing our area with adaptation to future weather events an amazing cycle walkway nature visit as we all know the vistas are stunning and the amount of people appreciating there is amazing this could link out to all the cycle lanes walkways around we could have a bars like they 're doing Nelson that takes people and cyclists to ricklefs to link up with the cycleway yeah you see in the next photo yeah this is Gary 's plan it 's a soft age that he 's even throwing a bit of a plane like it could be a god bird island the yellow place there this is the vision it could be actually fantastic working party consisting of pepernoten US coastal Burwood community boards and the community this working party has been meeting since July 2017 to provide community input into a decision making about the Styx River catchment particularly in a slower richest fix the catchment extends 24.8 kilometers from here to Bishop tower through to Belfast and more recently request preston 's development drainage exits into the Styx River concerns have been identified and we can go to those different questions later the recommendations one an increase of 400,000 annually between 2018 in 2021 that is to defer the dredging of the river blockages areas were identified as appropriate number two long-term budget requirement for 600,000 for a long-term strategy River master plan for a hundred year plan with staff and community engagement involved in number three long term budget requirement of 40 million and we asked you to refer to the gdh report a one-off action over three year period to compensate for the under maintenance of the river since 1993 more recently we 've learned of other concerns the board has fielded concerns from the community that point to the visit the Aranui pumping station and the water systems under providing and it seems that the build was not to manage future growth this also includes evidence by reports of groundwater entering the sewer system and celebrators into their open River this means increasing pollution breaches will be a serious environmental and health issue and moving back to bare wood again an area-wide community meeting facility for beer wood three suburbs equal one community facility eivol nurse studies suburbs devastated by the Canterbury earthquakes beer would have Avondale and Downton will hit the Far West by the West they lost their neighbors shops churches and schools and more than that they lost a sense of community belonging as major concern there is no meeting facility and any receive these suburbs there weren 't prior to the earthquakes the subsequent Residential 's red zone and followed by formation of regenerating health the community to ransom however there are no helping no recovery projects that have been planned in all this time these communities the people have really suffered last year the board aware of these concerns auctioned a research study for coastal bare wood boards the showed very clearly a need for a community meeting facility in the west of the board the board has also received a deputation seeking support to save the Burwood school hall for community use when it was publicized that the Burwood primary school would be demolished the concerns go back that fire earlier this year with funds from the community resilience partnership fund a feasibility study has been approved to scope what this community facility could look like fried that study is underway and will be completed before year-end very recently the board received a letter on behalf of they would even down and don 't and organizations these include three respective residents to request council register and interest and purchasing the land currently and disposal process by the Ministry of Education the site was previously the Burwood primary school the board is fully supportive of this location in fact that is likely to be the only potential site for an area-wide meeting facility therefore it acts as a council to expedite the process the purchase process I believe that is underway and to set aside funds for a community facility build project Council along stone a myself I wanting to continue working together to gauge potential for public-private funding project and there is potential for other entities to be included after almost eight years of being on hold we feel this project should be expedited to allow the broken communities to rebuild and moving to Azusa Kirito Park we ask that a feasibility study on demand and supply of a 50 meter deep water facility be added to QE to existing we 're waiting for to be opened pulse and we think the timing should be 2020 which would give the high schools time to impact on the 25 meter that we a bail post posted by prospect planned for 2021 a whole generation of children and the East have missed out on one of the most significant life skills to master swim capability a child aged 6 and 2011 is now attending high school while our Eastern communities in outlying districts look forward with excitement to the opening of our new facility the pressure on capacity planning for the needed Paul is already a concern for the board children youth must be given every opportunity to become equal proficient and have access to deep water sports so must adults especially honor people who were big lane users the board has concerns with the pool promote programming for the 25 metre pool and already season limited access for community use from opening day onwards as user groups dominate this deep waters pool space and community providers provided with only three lanes while except that some of the user groups will transfer to the sports Metro we see the increased demand will be from the new residential developments and the three high schools and particularly the pressure added by urban side girls hi concerns us greatly that community will lose access to the schools very few from the East will transfer used to the sports Metro because it does unaccessible and time and cost to do anything other than an occasional visit thus disadvantages coastal and Eastern communities from many quarters community have expressed their concerns loud and clear letters to the editor media reporting Facebook groups in deputation direct to board and recently the Qt master planning event which attracted a great number of people registered their concern that qe2 will need a 50 meter pool the aquatics facility plan assessment informed that the eastern aquatic facility needs to cater for a population of 60,000 clearly as community have been trying to tell us community board and council another deep water of pool is required and this board stands behind councillor east and councillor lemons call along with the community 's call for another call to be fast-track belt Eadie Ritu graffiti and vandalism lead to these current panels the New Brighton RSA community and our board believe they have created a visual barrier and detract from the memorial the board would real and spoken would not only create an attractive space for reflection and commemoration but more people to use the area therefore reducing the likelihood of vandalism 300 million dollar capital acceleration front you can see up there with suggested a couple of things there on the board would like to be part of the discussions with Council one was funding LTP documents sourcing LTP information specific before award was extremely difficult in the time-consuming time-consuming for us let alone the community we appreciate the improvements that haven 't_''_1153.64 been done but there needs to be more improvements must be made if there is to be greater active and well informed submission participation in for planning transparency and future community boards Lyon items need to remain an aps and LT peace and weary Chris their action award host local national international events which I show you every month in their board report before ever because our for short as a metropolitan SEF there is increased usage and hoc way that in event times therefore greater levels of maintenance and subsequent budget is required for and in this unique environment so our board requires greater investment to give us equity with the rest of the city thank you I 've got Vicky Glynn and Sarah but I don 't think we 're gonna get through all of those because we 've got 23 seconds to go so if Vicki you a number one top priority in the redzone given that you can now lease the land for five years what would you most like to have happen there as quickly as possible really good question we haven 't discussed it for a board but we know that the song I think I 'd be feed to Sonia now greens fighting would be used well it makes my set yeah and hit the st. briefings we have over government changes over no no no no it 's not the point the point is is that the question is in relation to whether you 've given some thought to temporary use within the residential read zone as a community board no thank you all right well thank you very much that 's um to the end of the time so much appreciated and know you 've obviously gone to a lot of trouble so I 'd like to thank you on behalf of all of the councillors thank you and if we could narrow it during the meeting until 00 00 a.m. thank you _"

    "text": "could I invite the Ross mcFarland for the horse war Hornby Brookstone Community Board to come forward look we 've got 20 minutes per community board I allowed 20 minutes so people want to ask questions then please keep the questions focused and short but also can you let me know that you want to ask a question early on on the piece because if I don 't write your name down then you aren 't going to be added to the list at the last minute if we get to the end of question time so I 'm trying to be fair to everyone we 're under a strict timetable and I did allow our next to two minutes for that one and one question to end into three and that happens from time to time so I apologize but that 's the way it 's going to be rough so thank you for stepping and I know that Mike 's not well and we really appreciate you coming today thanks for the opportunity I also like to take this point to thank the staff I think their levels long-term plan has been superior other years and we 've been able to make more informed decisions particularly relative to costs a teacher and particularly across neighboring boards we have a better idea of what our neighbors are doing so our Board considers the council 's approach to be pragmatic in its goal of seeking to strike the balance between the many competing demands in funding increases cysticercosis the board acknowledges the big issues for the council over the period of the plan the focus taken by the council and generally adopting a medium approach and budgets for key infrastructure projects is understandable the board is pleased with the levels of intended investment is recognition to the intensification and growth occurring and the greater set up with areas of air board some of those examples obviously the reckonin community center the plans aren 't finalized but going forward the HMMWV customer services and Southwest leisure center ongoing project the chains Road couple issues the year which is mainly to do that the prostitute southern motorway to and the interfacing of their areas and those roads a teacher one area our Rachel tears we 're extremely disappointed to know that it 's been slept outside the first three years of the LTP it came into the LTP and 2013 I understand we 're often asked to suite assets I can absolutely assure you of visiting this area yesterday the seat is deep there 's nothing left to come out of it it 's back and I think the promises that we 've made to the community to restore the level of service back to that area as as well overdue indicative costs tears on your agenda yes it 's but it has to be fixed we 've got to carry on maintaining our board regarding the making progress question and the prosecution 's heed as such would sort of see that at 18 point two million dollars they 're receiving anyway perhaps some alternatives to raise their proposed 1.4 million maybe um the ability for error council holding companies to top those points up and I know we like to take the return of them but that 's an area we react so holding companies actually return better by having these that we cannot support that additional one point for the question boy approach to changing our residential rate rises that 's the Tuffy we all know what we 're up against there there 's a borders concerned though tonight the compounding effect of the projected rate increases over those coming decades example would show I understand dear boards followed since 2014 through to 2024 under this long-term plan puts a reasonably priced house at a 51% increase over that area that I 'm sorry period so um if it takes it from four thousand seven hundred and ninety five to seven thousand two hundred and forty one and there if you 're on a fixed income at sadducees absolutely unsustainable rates policy rule rates effect self wisteria because of their own boundary to obviously in formulating this submission the board is reflected on the inconsistencies evident in employing the remote rule rates component of the council 's current policy but graphic on you over here dear this is an area and the Southwest that has undergone the revision by the council 's writing staff this is what they see is the ones that received that remote rule rule right the ours are the ones that pay the residential rate so these are similar sized properties doing similar things in very close proximity yet just by being the neighbor to an hour or twenty five the year that person 's receiving on a base general rate of four thousand dollars about a thousand dollar rebate and it makes it you know pretty it 's a costly it 's our policy it 's wrong this come before us and the 2015 long-term plan as well they proposal and I think councillor Galloway therefore here sorry for bringing that will be coming to the Finance Committee I understand we need to review this policy this is the staff doing the best they can was bad policy you 've got hours and 25s as neighbors the substantial amounts of money and it it needs correction it will have to be custom but yeah it 's wrong so we asked the board respectfully requests that the council initiate review of its president 's policy the aim to be clearer and more transparent the traditional property the years covered by this plan and we do have to look at our other alternative forms of income not an easy one this obviously we can 't keep taking off here um Council hold companies to the degree we are but some things that our Board considered potentials were the tourist bdx Airport landing charges or review there the free admission for visitors to our museums and art galleries perhaps we could buy our Airport landing church text in there and give them free entry by default so here museum was in the the board offices full support for the indicative funding in the lat and the draft long-term plan for the multi-purpose arena pretty critical to our area I think we 've seen it it would be good for air city in the greater regional area you find mr. Broughton we 'll be submitting from Selwyn District Council tomorrow he 's offering that perhaps the regions should be paying the greater share for that as does happen in the Wellington area Andy Oh target array I understand the board also urges the council would open it optimize the the growth demand I do know Thea though that we yeah developers are ALS we need to get our city to the population we had Priya 's great we 're not there yet so these guys help us get there by their developments it 's an easy hit on development charges and we have got to help them across the line they have this appearance of being fat cats I would suggest that 's not the case it 's pretty hard marketing development at the moment flood protection this is a big cost a lot of this is residual work in futures works to be younger gone and mainly the halls will Ward but for the protection downstream of Kashmir sprayed and Linwood central out towards the is true on completion of the Hendersons basin has proposed its surrounds will equate to the area the size of Headley Park these important retention and detention assets located primarily in our Ward will contribute much to control the flooding for those downstream communities accordingly the board fully supports all such flood protection critical related projects and we fully support the strategic Glen some of those 15 20 year old purchases of properties and areas in the southwest not being made 20 years ago we would not have these options to create these type facilities here what we pay now all obviously for what we could if not more in the future our board on drinking water totally support the council and its initiatives there and obviously that 's got to got to be our priority that 's as good as a picture on our own as they transport our board fully supports the inclusions of some major projects in the transport area and the written bus priority and public transport these are major works and that 's the effect of it that graphic there they deep down trench works across or slow down our most used but Stroupe and it 's going to create major people but the resultant effect which is on the overhead near is a real improvement on the street appeal of the area and yes it 's gonna be a tough project that one thank you for the funding it has to happen the infrastructure underground is as the board also note that there 's a number of other strategic corridors one of them being that Lincoln Road corridor our board reiterate its view on the importance of the strategic and transport link and this is to gain access to new yep if we don 't get public transport priority down to down the road corridor towards Falls Road we won 't have the ability to service these new developments roads are clogged now it 's a very small section of that we 're talking about and it 's the link between high road and good that 's true it will fully support that Waterloo business part we air board very much thank the council for including this increase this is a critical Road link to a first developing industrial area the road presently services that is totally unsuitable it has gone a wee bit higher than what you 'd like obviously on projects and that 's primarily because we have to deal with them Kiwi rail into the the Waterloo Business Park developers they have been very forward in and added considerably to the Iran required development like that any business that we can get in this business but is one that probably won 't go I cased the south and go to the would also like to ask some long-term funding annual plan funding for some strategic corridors and here we 're particularly talking about the issue in the road corridor we have had some initial briefings on this this is one that is very very he really used by cyclists it 's it 's one of those runs that goes up and it 's ghost and they love the obviously appreciate going up on this real gown dear it is an unsafe length the deef theory at two years ago the whole area how the traffic comes and that link needs to be you can see the scars in the middle on the hill see it as we 're getting more development up on some of those help suburbs to the south of Westmoreland we 're small in Kashmir Road has no intersection about it or no good intersection at the bottom or east there 's another four hundred homes going at the top of and we would like consideration in a pretty short term that we get some better access via roundabout or integration going back to facilities is thanks for the record in Community Center Hornby library obviously we were so very supportive of their dreams and for replacement of the pole which was like the one in stock when it was removed neighborhood project for Aaron 's Peninsula team just regarding benefits in the southwest we get a lot of amenity area which comes with the areas of stormwater Chinchin etc the tends to be a perception that some of that is reserve lend its able to be used all the time for recreation unfortunately it 's not it 's flooded for a good percentage of the time it 's very wet the board has the view that if we are taking reserved areas that we take the land as opposed to the money it 's easy to take the cash once you 've taken the cash it 's gone or it 's a few have the land you 've still got the asset and the benefit and the humanity level that the future the board repeats the support for the continuation of the strategic acquisition index primarily as a future proofing of our areas the board also think the council for and support the council when the 1.9 million towards the landmark grant family a heritage fund and and we in the record in the area have just been grounded some funding for Teahupoo Lodge which is terrific thing that will add a little historic area to a new development at the other side down a bit and I suppose there are other comments and these are very aspirational we would like some funding to initiate appropriate this investigation towards the needs of an indoor velodrome cycling is one of our most popular sports performance cycling as it 'll live all that the facilities we have it why should you sadly lacking we all know that ember goggles got better house was a shame we didn 't give the national performance so I can 't seem to win soon after the years where they spray tional things that we 're very much like the council to look at we also thank small little bradster people really bring out the best of some of their citizens and the actual benefit of this is probably uncalculated also thank the council for returning some of those some maintenance issues and I think that 's been touched on in the previous presentation we are giving me a citizens of 5.5% rates rise potentially we would all like to think we 're trying to get something better in the levels of service back so you 're happy to take questions I don 't have a gown for time two minutes twelve so Sarah and then term I think that it 's probably all we 're gonna get to so if we get to you fellows after if we get to I 'm Sarah thank you and it was it 's a really competitive one and I thank you for that just quickly the exam just a bit of a disconnect between two of the comments here I was trying to understand with the UM the main map here at edge and I can completely understand going to be able to do those once in the central you 're very firm that you 're really reluctant to hit the rates increases was the board aware because the wording isn 't particularly clear in the document I don 't think that the continuation of the 1.9 million per annum to the lair Maki grant fund would mean a rates increase on top of the five point five I didn 't read it yes the moment it kind of reads like we 've already budgeted for it and then should we continue it but actually it 's not in the draft currently in eating the 1.9 would mean probably a point four percent on top of the five point five with the border we 're there I think in relation to Heritage it 's it 's a difficult one similarly to the cross two genes in figure about point four can we afford it well anything hurts obviously that 's I was just checking on how that question was written whether you thought yeah yes if it could be slaughter than but we 're those are the savings and they that 's the tip okay thanks thank you Tim would be acceptable at this point I think probably if given that the level of investment that we 've taken and land acquisition and the very specific point between rights and Curless right the designations been in place for some 15 odd years we own most of the land there 's a few more properties to buy we 're buying a component of it as a designation and requirement from the Health Board for the frontage for the nor we search which links some domain t receiver in X row we 're doing that now the area is changing predominantly to commercial by the Medical Center and a new to me it is a feel like it 's the neat between the the sandglass we 've got flow one end and it flows out the other it 's technique of the scenes and the endlessness that just struggles I think we 've made preparation for it so high on the list people in the team that presented well I think we 've got to go ahead with it but I don 't like the word for laning to me if get a better level of acceptance and obviously the subsidies to that we get by putting in public transport remember the section sales in divorce with state highway 75 if we do out that means ETA will do the above and I think we 've seen that of recent government announcements it 's excellent look thank you thank you Bronson thank you for stepping in and in playing this role what 's been greatly appreciated and it 's been a very valuable submission so thank you very much deliberation thank you won 't be seeing you before then _"

    "text": "thank you each of the community boards has has 20 minutes and how you choose to use that as entirely over to you but I would advise you to leave a little bit of time so that counselors can explore with you some of the issues that you want to raise all of your submissions have been read by counselors and so it 's really important that when you come to the table that you really touch on the issues that are important to your community so could I invite Sam McDonald and I don 't know the others I don 't know if you 're bringing your deputy up to the table as well Aaron Campbell if you come to the table and welcome and your new role as the chair of Pendleton my mighty here woods Community Board what I think it 's quite an articulate and well thought-out_,_72.63 submission to you today also acknowledge Aaron is a DP each year and he 's also spent a lot of time working on this but what we thought we 'd do today is provide before we go into the our wards and it 's always important I think to remind you of the demographics we have over an hour part of town and I think that really plays a role and the projects were advocating for so I 'll do that talk about how we engaged and then a to highly we 'll talk about some of the projects we 're looking at and then Aaron is very keen to talk more about some of the projects and as Leanne said we 'll certainly leave time for questions it 's a fennel to my Mary here with tradition that we are concise and to the point so we 'll leave plenty of time for you to come back to us so if we just start with those community board demographics I think it 's really important to note at the aging population particularly in our findell area and sort of those larger homes I also like to point out to any community group indeed you guys today that we have a large number of house properties and our board ironically they 're actually in predominantly in the phenols and guess the other side that is our deprivation of these so we have a really broad spectrum ranging from a1 and the Homewood area right through the annoying and jelly park so I guess what we 're trying to do is is paint a picture that you know there 's a really diverse population in our area who will contribute to our community what I wanted to do is just take you through just really quickly our wards so if we look at Pendleton first the median personal income you 'll see up there is thirty five thousand and seven hundred the average house price is eight hundred and fifty five thousand and their annual rates contribution is 41 million I was looking through the LTP last night actually and based on that average house price the rate increase would be five point seven two percent based on that at the moment if you look at my ward the one area group the median personal income is in line generally with the city twenty nine thousand four hundred at the average price house prices 608 thousand and our annual rates a half a million based on that we would get a five point six percent rate increase based on the current LTP and then here would ward Aaron Cohen 's work we 've got a median personal income of thirty two thousand an average house price of nearly seven hundred and thirty and via annual rates contribution is nearly thirty three million dollars based on that we would get a five point six seven percent rate increase on that average price I think this is quite an interesting graph if you if you 've got a chance to have and look up at the screen and it breaks down are the proposed capital expenditure versus the rate take in those rules and obviously that 's just capital that 's not optics but I think it really signifies that you know we practice what we preach and we don 't ask for a lot but we do contribute significantly to the city obviously you 'll see Lynwood Central and heathcote is substantially higher and I think that 's you know everyone will understand this predominately due to the central city rebuild take away from this that 's certainly a really good step for the day for indeed the rest of the presentations I thought I 'd just touch on briefly how we engaged and I 'm sure that as you 've all been working through your TP engagement you realize that it 's a lot easier to go to the people than have the people come to you we found that the culture the law was a really effective way and we we hit over 15,000 people come through in a couple of hours and indeed you 'll see the picture up here with ref and the two arrows outside Bishop Delta Mall and I think it 's really important and we certainly made it a product to be seen in our communities wanting to genuinely take their views on board so you know before I hand over to Aaron I just wanted to touch on a couple of the key concerns from our engagement are the first one and again don 't shoot the messenger we 're passing on the feedback from our communities was the concerns spent concern over of view there 's been three things that have come out of this process you know the rate increase we consider is quite high the cycleways obviously is a concern that people are raising with us and I think the water chlorination which and you know is obviously an issue you 're working through at the moment so if we look and I will pass over to Aaron to go on these and go into these in detail but just at a really broad level we want to focus on the regeneration of Bishop Dell we want to look at and you know we 're obviously in full support of traffic lights in the brains and he would and governor 's Road intersection we really want an emphasis on road maintenance and core infrastructure and we would like to see some toilet facilities at the lake along with the deferment of the wheels to win cycle ways and then obviously as I pointed out at the beginning with the rate increases across our wards based on the average house price we 're really keen to see that rate increase driven within our area so look I 'll pass it over to Aaron to go into a wee bit more detail then we 'll conclude and then happy to take questions on that slide is probably these two things I 've just like to highlight here and one is the used to be the site of the former of winery council landfill it 's a fantastic area to go to these two lakes both basically correction lakes one predominantly for the jetski in Canterbury group as well as the other Lake has a huge variety of recreational uses from dragon boaters motor sail what 's just goes on in summer it is open for public to access it 's had a tremendous amount of demand to swim there are there was five portable toilets the three that were supplied paid for by the recreation groups two supplied by Council when you have two three four thousand people here in a day those has quickly become overwhelmed these issues around just a management of its space and try know that staff working on which we certainly appreciate 12 months ago the the were getting kind of security and that kind of thing now it 's just the the amount of use that it gets is is trying to say in the LTP there are two toward facilities on budget ones and the north ones to the south about 3,000 per unit we would like to request that one of those facilities be brought forward and the LTP so that that 's installed you know a little bit sooner than what 's currently beer and then that would go on to the regeneration of Bishop Dowell particularly the bishop Dowell more fears are currently like a grim sight there that is earthquake damaged it 's beyond cost-effective appear as well as the use of this facility it 's just not really suitable for much so the proposal there is to use the money and the RTP from deferring one of the tort facilities at one of the links there and bring that into the shutdown wall so it be a public facility public toilet facility that 's available 24 hours a day as you know the bishop Dale Moore library and community center only you know during effectively like reopening hours and things like that so that 's major drivers for this fantastic so look just in conclusion right through it sorry I 'm not the best PowerPoint mover so you probably missed a couple of these as we 've gone through but just to conclude and I think our submission genuinely articulates and the views of norway 's Christchurch know we 're strongly advocates for minimal rate increases a real focus on core infrastructure and services and we 'd like to see the annual general charge inflation improved and that hasn 't moved in a couple of years so we 'd like to see that we generally aren 't supportive of the bridge or of original fuel tax and we 'd like to commend I think Leanne Carlene in and fuel for your continual drive for efficiency within the council I think that is showing real dividends the last point there is just greater delegations to boards and would continue to encourage there I know Leanne 's very strong on it and we genuinely would like to see more are being done for your time and I hope you can take on board some of the points from our presentation I 'm happy to take any questions with any other time we 've got remaining right plenty of time Mike Jimmy Phil Glen Vicki yarny I don 't know but I suspect cycleways Yossi requesting for us to defer it in the long term is already part of you want the money spent on decisions here would road a couple institutions on Huard Road where actually if you did the cycleway those intersections would be upgraded and so you realize obviously with the cycle ways that the funding is two for one and but of course just the road in project it would actually be wonderful 1f in ZT they agreed would actually lose funding so my understanding was that there was a cap on that funding we get each year in turn sideways Suzie not well for the wheels to win so there is some kept sana but with the wheel still wins obviously quite ad well you psych away so therefore it would most likely get the two-for-one funding and know yeah but we know for sure so so therefore if that 's the case if it 's the will stir wins wins the world was to get two-for-one funding would therefore your board still want to defer it or would you actually want to bring it forward so we can execute those intersections folks and actually a bit of cost for the right path well I think the first point is that with the traffic lights at here with brands which we get a lot of feedback on locally I mean look if that was the case and if we were putting that in and they were coming as part of it that may be something we 'd consider I think that the the general point in that from at the engagement we 've had was that you know when we 've got so many financial pressures as a city we were looking and being pragmatic and our community is an area where we could save the city money and with that be deferring it for some time so we 're not saying we 're opposed to it entirely you talk to general if you 're talking to the public in our communities it 's the fact they can 't drive on our roads properly and that they 're facing some severe rating process so we 'll probably always disagree on that essentially because obviously the soccer wave goes through through my ward as well and actually I 'm hearing the difference ring from my community they 're actually very concerned that these cycleways have been deferred because they 're actually a really good thing for not just people trying to get to work on a bike but also a lot of a lot of kids I 'm here in an opposite thing from from my agency but when you look at the actual funding mechanism in trying to actually make the the rate payers dollar go even further the soccer waves actually potentially does their because we get a lot of side benefits from just doing the cycle wave which would be the intersection improvements that your community board are actually calling for so to me if we 're looking for actually trying to improve these intersections which potentially trying to defer the cycle weights not the best way to do it actually bringing it forward would be because actually we 're going to help the rate pair out in many ways by fact that we 're getting more funding from both NZTA Oh kind of don 't wanna interrupt this wonderful speech let 's ride think the the one aspect to that is depending on where the rooster went cycleway actually goes which intersections he actually goes through some there 's probably two or three different routes that it 's currently being kind of looked at and at least a couple of those it doesn 't go through specifically the he would Greer 's intersection the amended LTP a couple years ago had a 2.4 million dollars for a intersection upgrade because it 's one of the most dangerous of high-risk intersections along the he would Road corridor and so from a safety of all road users point of view the reprioritization of spending money towards improvement safety particularly if that one now that that 's also been now to fruit from the current LTP yeah that the reasons why we 're saying look at deferring we don 't think that the money that the government of subsidizing will disappear the national government obviously started that the subsidization process of cyclist and the current government I can 't imagine that removing if not increase so yeah if that if the current government wants to come to the table with even more subsidy and yeah hey it 's let 's discuss the thing but under the current budget constraints that the council is in right now obviously it 's developing day by day and the water chlorination issue the well it 's issue is is day by day this is this is one aspect that we can say it 's pushed us back out for now Jimmy one patient and because your particular no recommend the rates to increase the fat percentage rather than 5.25% GTG but if we review even percentage e popular for hungry in the four and a half million dollars so ha so point of five pocket wind up to five four million dollars but here you could um fossa you still have a other higher priority particularly you mentioned like the regeneration pichia tear more and the for intersection of you know the your roading etc but you proposal is only learn winds two wheels cycle will party beautiful to spend most part to support those are for intersection loading area just questions poppy the parties they 're not sufficient so do you think of what kind of particle either in your port or citywide puppet can beat up in full I mean you make an interesting point the reality is we didn 't come here today were the list of things we we want and things that we we can 't that we won 't have that we can 't fund so what we 're saying by the deferment of the wheels to wins is that actually substantially we contribute a lot more back to the city than those local projects we actually want in the community want so we 're not coming and saying you know here 's twenty three million back or whatever it is and we want twenty three million more in our community we 're saying actually here we 're kind of like we 're being responsible in that respect and sort of demonstrating that we 're not wanting to take take take we 're giving back as well which hopefully reduces that burden on our ratepayers so as a board we did discuss levels of service around very local and specific projects I could rattle off a couple in our field like cure on Creek Road there 's a cheers installation art work in twenty twenty seven twenty eight it 's up for renewal it 's 85,000 there is a it 's a Western Reserve learn to ride a track of myself it 's a fantastic facility for children to you know learn how to ride with finger rode Nathanson slides and all this kind of thing again it 's up for renewal out of 220,000 it 's really really good so when it comes to levels of service and renewals having a smarter way of implementing and you know doing some of these things is something that you know we 're certainly we 've certainly discussed and we 'd love to be able to bring these note you note from the discussion that we had with the external advisory group last week that we want to review levels of service for precisely that reason so thank you for those examples Phil so parents and you 'll be aware that two of our strategic priorities one is active travel and the other one is Safe Communities so like if we take you 're referring to wheels doings if we take your part of the city the it you 'll be aware the airport is one of the biggest employers are in the city a large number of people commuting to the airport in from your area so if you you 're saying don 't do that we lost awareness but how can you actually in doing that how can you actually ensure the safety for people who want to commute to work to the airport at by bike is compete with those in cars I 'm probably looking at the catchment area for the wheels to wings there 's two access roads to that 's obviously just been improved it was still currently is you know the the new absolutely so this is two access points there now that why recce roads been closed off and that 's up here Wood Road and underneath the underpass and in the second ones through memorial if you 're looking at the catchment for the people to use that underpass and then also the distance that people will cycle the numbers that our cycling team cycle from Crofton road north sorry West right now I don 't see it I don 't see major cycle a would likely lead to an increase in children biking to school and the impression is they wouldn 't lead to a dramatic increase I really would like to know whether other people that have questions are going to focus on the on the one cycle way or where are we got other issues yeah I put another essay in Glen on social housing my question so at the beginning you pointed out the house in New Zealand council units in your ward you talked about the aging population given that baby boomer bubble is coming through will need obviously to provide for social housing you got any ideas over it where extra funding would come from for more council units yourself yes so our submission wasn 't advocating for more social housing we were just explaining that there is a demographic within our society that is supported by the council and the government yeah so the question is around council supplying more units my well that we didn 't actively discuss the set of board level but if you were to ask my opinion I would look at upgrading current council units to make them more liveable so you 're looking at upgrading its elation to make making them a better living environment for the current tenants rather than expanding the program right now and waiting to see what the government will bring along from its I I am actually gonna give you another two minutes because I should have pulled up another counselor before so Vicky Yanni Erin efforts within the two minutes so very brief questions and when the toilets can they be done within the existing budget by reprioritizing I believe so yes exactly the second one the fuel tax is if for example there was a four cents per litre fuel tax that would reduce rates by about three percent so you 're still not looking to have any other sources of income apart from the home is it that people own fuel tax is regressive it 's gonna hit low-income families hardest it would be similar to increasing GST yeah and low-income families will have vehicles that will be least fuel-efficient and they may even need several vehicles because the public transportation system isn 't efficient enough they could well have three vehicles with a family is rather able to display all the costs we 've gone to their house sorry you 'd rather all the costs we don 't right I think it 's around reprioritization of capital so as we brought up the EAG last week they certainly summarized what the board was thinking and discussing basically we believe the money is the within budget it just needs to be spent better particularly around procurement Johnny I think you I 'm just a very short question in terms of the groins roto coyote master plan is you for that being complete okay I 'm just really keen to pick up the issue of the toilets and I 'm not quite sure thing is we have to wait for that plan before we can make a decision on the toilet yeah when I say drawing I think the staff of obviously doing the work and they 're gonna come back to us once they 've done their but we 'd like to see this though yeah the biggest issue here I think is around the transfer of 30 years of surplus to the extinction of these issues around surveying their land and bringing it into the larger groynes Regional Park so I 'm just trying to think what resolution that we can pass that would help you get the toilets we can we can deal with that separately we 're dealing with the hearings today we 'll be working back again through the community board chairs prior to making any resolutions so don 't worry you 'll it won 't be lost and Aaron I 'm sorry but you 're going to be able to have your discussion very much for presenting to us today and we will weave well that 's not helpful actually really it 's just yeah thank you very much dude could I _"

    "text": "number 18 that is the one where we had a we received a memo with a sort of progress update so perhaps the staff want to which I just getting start to present on that on the purpose an amendment to was it well nobody 's moved to eat so yeah no that 's that 's fine so moved and seconded okay Sarah and Mike had moved and sickened at the resolution so you 'd like to move an amendment to option two what in a minute drive a seconder for that Glenn okay so Pauline so when this came to the UT committee we considered the new information that was developed during the south and short term management projects for subsequent investigations have now identified that is a lower above floor flood risk than previously reported the updated analysis is considered more robust as if somebody 's a greater generation of events recorded and results show any one house is at risk of above floor flooding and seventy they 'd risk of under four so the AG committee supported the recommendation that works the reprioritized from C field places immediate vicinity of registry will be retained the reprioritized works could be progressed via the South Shore and South dividing regeneration strategy if regeneration kalajzich identified this as a project noting that any surplus of funds be returned to the land drainage recovery program the community board the neighborhood coastal Burwood community board made a deputation to the committee now they did agree with the recommendations but they sought to retain the funnels locally but we have to realize that the land drainage recovery program has a list of priorities for flood reduction citywide and the funds are allocated on a prioritized basis so the committee did not hold the request that the funds be be retained locally so that 's the resolution that we came to and I 'm happy to support [Music] taste is the negative of the motion so therefore it should actually be a foreshadowed motion right yeah I mean the thing is that he did move it first and but he moved it as an amendment whereas he should have moved it as the motion so actually the motion that we will consider as his technically perfect when it comes to standing orders but he did put up his hand first to make to move a motion and I said he couldn 't move an amendment to something I sorry I hadn 't read his Amendment so it wasn 't occurring to me that was the the alternative as to as to foreshadow a motion well well you didn 't move the correct motion so it would be helpful if you had just agree that a foreshadowed motion is the way to go you 're not okay so the motion will be that that council adopt option to continuing the work has originally approved I 'll sorry okay so so you will cover you you were being more helpful and on to it than I was you see it amendment and yeah okay the best time he moved emotion that if any individual counselor wants to move something that is completely contrary to the council decision they can do it by way of a motion at the council meeting yes of course he came of it as opposed to give another recommend as long as he moved the motion first right so so you 're presented on it yeah Helen do you want to speak to your report that you 've provided so and thanks very much for doing that at such short notice um and the things go to DB Hogan because I was away in Wellington on leave so givi did the work for this so the question was to give an update on the South Shore South New Brighton regeneration strategy and that is work that is being done jointly with regenerate Christchurch and the Christchurch City Council and also with Environment Canterbury and we have my Tahu involved on the steering group for that work so there is a broad project that 's looking forward so it 's not dealing with present-day issues of flood risk is the IT committee reporters that 's talking about what we do in the future the first part of it is around developing a strategy to adapt to the impacts of climate change because South Shore and South New Brighton are clearly out on the coast the second part is to plan for the future the there will be a second stage of the strategy to develop an implementation and plan for their strategy so it will follow the adaptive planning approach that is being recommended by the ministry for the environment and the updated guidance to local government around climate change and the guidance of community engagement so we 've had a team called the how team which is a group of people from the community working with staff from the agencies that have developed the engagement plan for this work and that was presented to to the two agencies Thursday last week and Brendan Anstis went along to that presentation for council so that is the first delivery and this project that is how we engage the community out there and then the second stage will be developing that strategy so that 's really where we 're up to on that and will they come and present to us in the community board and the terms of that strategy because I just I just think that whole concept of getting the local community to design the how to engage with the community strategy 't nailed down a day for that briefing it great but yes we will be doing that okay thank you so David you 'd like to some questions maybe I 'm best respond to that the 50 year or two person in York students probability as the standard that we apply across the city and considering Landry and recovery program projects in conjunction with Tim seen ap or 10 year return period event that 's the combination of those that general used to inform decision making this project itself is somewhat more challenging because we 're talking about temporary short term infrastructure question still arises about as a two percent ap appropriate note event we thought it was the project team considered it appropriate to retain that standardization and reporting for this project given that it was inside the night recovery program structure yep any other questions I 'll put the motion oh you want to speak to the motion strategies are achieved nothing would have eventuated in this area not for severe storms in july 2017 and January 2019 that resulted in emergency routes being instigated the board understands northern Bund as outlined by the ldrp staff but notes it 's a concern around the following points one was the which we 've just answered a moment ago the 150 year design scenario the second one is the removal of budget and we would ask that budget be retained for the bun to be completed at a later date or is able to be excuse me transferred to other flood protection work within the South New Brighton domain area the consents of continued vulnerability and lack of surety that residents of C feel place Craddock Street in South New Brighton school will feel with the deferment of this project they 're still of concern to our board we note that flooding potential is still a major concern for a sizable council asset the South New Brighton camping ground and the temporary repairs following the January 2018 event will still require resource consent or removal the board asks that the budget deferred from the northern bun be allocated to effecting permanent repairs between the jetty and the boardwalk which effectively will prevent the campground from flooding LDR P staff have jetty and the boardwalk requires erosion protection however a quote from small contractors who effect of the gabion arrears repairs around the jetty and the end of the boardwalk states that the work required a 70% flood protection and 30% erosion his price was 535 plus GST thousand we 're also mindful of the management plan for south near Broughton domain being at odds with the board odds with the board proposals and local residents desires and signally our intention to revoke or slash amend this proportion of the plan at the any committee meeting on the 11th of April the deputation from the board was asked whether option 2 was preferred the board had not had the opportunity at that stage to discuss this at a meeting but at our meeting of the 16th of April the board affirmed by majority that option 2 would have been preferred well thank you my take on this it 's not so much going back on a council resolution because occasionally the council has done that and does do it and probably will in the future it 's I think it 's which has had some measurable health effects following the the earthquakes which I outlined in the informal this morning that the measure that we use and here in terms of inundation says that that one house may be inundated it also says that seventy you know it could be at risk of underfloor inundation is with any community that 's not good either in terms of a housing habitability perspective so I take I ask that you please take that into your consideration as far as the push of those from the this part of christchurch and although this hasn 't been raised today it has come up before I think it 's fair to say that those in the East actually have considerable empathy for those in any part of the city that they creep the Heathcott over flooding over risk and so they 're forced through their representatives to get what they see as protection from flooding is really no different from any other part of the city and so I you know I 'd like you to consider that to consider that in your decision-making today as David has already pointed out along with the fact that the residents may continue to still feel vulnerable one house may be at risk of an addition but I think for many there it is as if they all are such as the kind of deficit approach that we 're coming from post-quake in those areas so in that area so I ask for your support for this today yes I look at the land drainage recovery program aims to reduce the flood risk with priority being given to above floor flooding in people 's homes when the board chair and DEP she made a deputation to our committee they agreed that because there 's only one house at risk that the work could be reprioritized to be directed to other more vulnerable areas than Christchurch and that determination will be made by the land drainage recovery team was the multi criteria analysis and that 's where it needed to stay so as much as the board would like to retain that funding that is not really a viable option I just want to note that an recommendation for their this should the decision this resolution the substantive the supportive that it has communicated personally with the residents out there so they understand fully that actually we 're looking at the city as a whole and I think I commend you know David East for standing up for his community and wanting this to retain Vestavia however the data does not support that decision to be made so the the Itchy committee discussed this at length and you cannot argue with the data we have to be fierce that he wide they 'll not be supporting the additional notion just well I put up three motions I moved a motion and my second and I okay now I want to probably signal an amendment to as I said in my paperwork to Joe over there before I said of option one of my original me agreement failed I wanted to propose an amendment to items 2 3 of the left ear because my amendment to item 3 was not an indifferent as a matter of process here a point of order I don 't think my my rights in terms well no doubt my community will be earlier _"

    "text": "this is Pauline would you like to introduce this in move it so this is a program that 's been underway for quite some time and as a result of the hair block North incident we requested that this be fast-tracked the report details this certain things that are holding it up and slowing it down a little bit and it 's requesting a review time frankly pushed out to 2019 sounds scary but natural effect all the shallow wells in the northwest are now turned off and the factors that the ones that won 't be completed to 2019 not required just just a request to the other program to be pushed out to 2019 so I 'm happy to move it yeah but just in terms of form for these council resolutions I don 't want them to say approve that revised time frames that are provided in this report I want the time frames written into the resolution so if they could be noted afterwards so that at least it 's got noting that these that the time frames are and it just means that when you can actually see what the new time frames are and the and the resolution that would just make it easier to follow so it 's someone like to second that mic Yani two questions one is we 're spending a considerable amount of extra money on our infrastructure provision particularly to some of the green fields growth areas and I just wondered have we looked at our DC 's policy in line of the changes to the time sorry so sorry tell me what part of the revised timeframes for the completion of the Northwest Christchurch well Drummond program that question relates to so it 's just if we 're bringing forward funding so it says we 're not pushing it out and that financial provision is made to match the accelerated delivery program we did that we did that last time we 've already proved that that 's what we resolved on 22nd of September 2016 so your second question is so we Britt okay so just so we 're bringing forward the funding no funding and 2016 we are now delaying the second part of the program the 've got consistency across our dc 's program for whatever we 're doing in terms easy fun nothing to do with our d C 's program right okay cool um the second question was around that even hid well which isn 't here I even hit pump station seven point four is that the same one that we were briefed on in terms of the above-ground but not being able to be secured because it needed work done or is that a different piece of infrastructure there 's a note on on Aven t97 Ian you ever looked there that the shallow ones we 've turned off but the deeper ones were online with deep well five can you contemporary relating well six and seven have been drilled well six needs a repair tina 's four remaining hidden works planned to be live in March yeah I 've got these plans to have new deep wells connected by end of December 2018 so I 'm just trying to understand if we 're doing other work before then as part of the other report or whether this is this will be to put into the resolution because basically you said you wanted them finish by June end of June 2018 so this one 's going out six months so sorry it 's just so unfair so the report that we 're looking at in terms of attachment a is the old time frame and you 're gonna come back with a time into time frame to attachment I know there were new ones so the new one is December 18 for a veneer but with the other report that we had earlier we 're gonna get information in May around whether that can be different projects yeah it 's not the same all right so it 's fin yep right thank you so 4.3 it says here and I 'll also refer to my fellow councillors from the ward on June 7th 2017 staff provided an update which moved the overall completion date for the upgrade project December 2019 that 's the first time I 've heard of that was that reported to the community board so okay well that 's you know I 'd like to an answer to that to the community board yeah Lucas community is under the impressions is all basically gonna be done it is been done yes at a certain time yes no no but it makes no difference at the time then the new timetable makes no difference just making reference to the fact that the disabuse I 'm accepting there so could we have a committee which changed the project timeline or completion date and I 'm just wondering did that yeah I think that it is important as a matter of process that if there is an issue that goes through a committee that is reported to the relevant community board as well I think that 's really important and this one it 's only an one community broad area that we 're talking about so it should have been reported is it the Northwest right I think maybe as part of the blood delegations is gonna be picked up our board said repeated concerns I thought none of these were and I thought they were all on one Ward no no it 's not the question of the water the water oh oh I give up okay so we 'll find out which Community Board say or sit within will just notify them of this report the issue the issue was was that this was raised specifically by that community board originally so I just think as a measure of course there needs to be a reporting mechanism to the relevant community boards if it is more than one community board then it needs to it needs to go to the it needs to go to a combined meeting but from my understanding of this particular one was that the problematic shallow bores were within the here would why am i whatever it 's called I don 't know what it 's called now that board and I thought they were the ones who had originally had concerns from their communities but this phone this phone will have a mechanism for reporting back I agree so so can you just put notes in and future that that 's that changes to time frames will be reported to the relevant community boards any changes to agreed program and small timetables are reported mover and a seconder so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried and then we have _"

Edwards or Murray Dixon and appropriate staff on that particular topic our findings are comprehensively covered and the report in front of you and I 'm just going to cover some crystal cover some Kieran or cava so but the first point that we feel as a eajy was there you have sent some very good strategic objectives as a council but they all see as equal and are they all in cool or are they not should you prioritize some over others should you not and our first recommendation would be that you actually go back as a council as the governors of the city and say these are our strategic objectives and this is the priority order now you may in and the exercise decide to leave them all the same but you 've got to make that call a really important point is that a lot of your expenditure has driven by levels of service and most councilors will never have been through the whole list of service you know the big people within the organisation that this is a street and it 's 17 years since it was resurfaced it 's supposed to be resurfaced every 17 years and it goes into a plan and you need to actually go back and they had look at those levels of service and decide what 's critical and what 's not Chris you had some service yeah I think levels of service it 's a measure which is very movable and there are some things which you have to do and there are some which you don 't there are some for example and it 's not strictly level service but if you get a crack in a road like Y Ricky Road or something it 's actually quite critical to facts there at the time because and I know people have east will say hang on our streets are still bad but a 60,000 appear suddenly becomes 600,000 because water gets underneath and you 've got a didn 't do a total rebuild and so little service is something which is in some cases almost a you sit around this table is counsel us across to it 's City Council and sometimes you have to take off the community you come from and acknowledge that if you want to spend a lot more expenditure then ignore some of the issues that are in front of you but in other cases and I have to say that when I was here in Christchurch as part of Syria was criticism justifiably in some cases we work was done on memorial of in Pendleton right which wasn 't necessary but it was on a work program and we 're still Road southeast that went done and so you have to think very carefully in the staff and be open with you that levels are service something matters it 's not as gary said just because footpath 17 years old doesn 't mean you have to go and do it and so there are numerous examples where has been done but there are other examples where it needs to be done earlier and another level or service also covers something like bleeding air suits and again christchurch during the earthquake to pipes which had been living beyond their expectation because nothing had happened there was no earthquake and so therefore the pipes were still fully serviceable but you get a disaster and suddenly there the pipes that actually caused you most of the problems so there 's a balance between level of service and bleeding and asset as well so it 's not an easy solution and I know that you know David and sonko are actually sort of we 're off that issue and so it 's just something we found when we were going through that at times we ignore you know good asset management and level of service work and and so it does need a review of some sort so the we believe that the levels of service you need to actually go back in detail now we 're aware also of the difficulty of getting the whole council to do that and I would recommend that you look at a smaller group to do that but the councilors like you will have received submissions on the LTP that will be a really good place to these as important but you will also have other areas where the levels of service look at the council table it 's really important that you actually say this is really important we want to have a look at these and I think look at those first but that that 's then going to require quite detailed work where you actually go right down to them onto each page and say is what that level of service is relevant to this 21st Century City and it but that drives hundreds of millions of dollars worth of your expenditure that 's your drive your levels of service the strategic framework needs to be also driving your asset management plan now the asset management plan I know is I can remember sitting at this council table when we decided but something was really important but and you 'd pass it and nothing happened because there 's not a lever for councillors to pull often enough on actually we want this is really important and that 's why you 've got to get your asset management strategy driven by your strategic plan so where we think the city should go and then you have your asset management plans that come underneath it but the levels of service as what 's driving this organization right there and and I think everybody look I can remember sitting at this council table thinking how the hell did that happen and it was because it was driven by a level of service there was miles away from the council table we had to go back and have a look at them so what we 're saying with the asset management strategy as we 're saying you need to look at all of the items on your strategy and decide what 's required by law what 's essential according to your strategic priorities what 's business as usual and what 's nice to have it 's actually quite a good test and so we need to our recommendations you know and page after page after page and here is is the plan on how to address those issues now Kiran you were going to yeah so I mean you 've all got the recommendations and front of you so the section 17a reviews a suggestion that they are actually on a rolling basis reviewed throughout the six year period and to take some of the burden off the planning and I think that something that yourself to you 're already looking at we 've also got the that counselors review the our financial capacity and capability to make sure that these adequate support around this process next time for the financial modeling that 's associated with the long term plan so that that can be done in a timely and an iterative fashion so that counselors can be fully informed of the financial impacts associated with some of the decisions that have been made around the infrastructure strategy just going to the skirt biggest scene one you gotta remember the skirt didn 't touch anywhere near half of the city and so I sort of go slightly off topic here we 've reached the stage where the council actually and staff technologists we need to draw a line in the sand and say this is where it now I didn 't say nor the crown tram will come to start thinking forward this is the city you want to be able to welcome people and do people want to live here they want to work here and do all those sorts of things and the scoop repairs those various views on how well they were or went down and so forth but it 's the position the cities are now and so the planning needs to be looking forward rather than continually going back all the victim mentality of you know we 've had earthquakes so we need to do this you know line and the scene needs to be drawn now that says this is the situation the cities and how do we move forward now I said ignore the crown the crown does kind of come in and give Christchurch assistance but I think the city itself needs to be planning on what is it that it needs to be doing and if I was being honest with you I 'd say there 's some more stuff out east higher priority than cycleways in the middle of town don 't take them off the the plane 's just my personal view if you 're looking at getting the city back up so that it 's welcoming and so forth let 's do the things that have to be done before some of those other nice to hear you know one of the best things that the city did right at the start was the AMI Stadium outer Eddington because it was a community facility and some swimming pools and so forth but there are other things that are a higher priority at the moment so the skirt repairs there over and done as I said there 's a view on how well otherwise so we 're done but the city now has to move forward we 're also recommending and being mindful of the whole of life and costs so and the infrastructure strategy has a minimum statutory period to look at of 30 years but of course some of these assets last much longer and you shouldn 't lose sight of that fact in the planning and it 's really important in their planning that all of the whole of life costs including the Opera are fully considered and also as governors and it is your role to set the strategy but also to monitor as permutation strategy and so we are suggesting an overview of the reporting requirements and to monitor their capacity and capability of the organization to deliver the capture program and it 's important not to lose sight once that the strategies being found has been set in place it 's really important that betters delivered and monitored accurately and throughout the life of that strategy so marry counselors that 's a very brief gallop through our recommendations we did we it was an iterative process with the staff and so I think a lot of the reports that came through to you were beaten because of the og questioning how things happened save tasks at this table but that 's our report before we do that the chief executive has just done a an acknowledgement which will circulate with the report as well and in table officially but I 'd really like to invite Colleen to provide that an initial acknowledgement and response if that 's okay with you presentation us with some very valuable feedback you can hear me down there and helping us to improve the way we work in the work that 's done at all I think it also gives the public a different view of the complexity and challenges that the council has to do into preparing a budget of you know 10 billion dollars over the next 10 years and year on year capital program with five million dollars which is extensive for any council and it 's that 's been delivered successfully and will continue to be so I think my sense is this long-term plan I 'm a veteran of tuna is probably one of the most complex in New Zealand it 's challenging it 's difficult we have to balance out the issues or the councillors have to balance out the issues of you know the pressures on the community for increasing rates but also pressures to not only deliver business as usual but the repair and regeneration of our city as well as building the resilience of our city in the future and those issues about how you prioritize those think thirty years out around some of these as well you 're absolutely right in terms of having the strategic priorities and that was a really strategic framework which is really useful we didn 't hit that last time so that 's been really helpful we 've been embedding that in the organization but it 's also part of the LTP consultation so the framework will actually inform also annual future annual plans as well as the future long term plan I think we 've worked quite closely together so it 's been really helpful for me to come and hear your discussions and answer some of your questions and get some of the feedback so we changed some of their processes away along the way as you 've mentioned and probably gave a suggest a better report to counselors and bit of information and refocus some of the things that we did as a result of their the executive team also did our own review of the process to date which aligns with quite a lot of what you 've talked about and so we 've already started some at how we improve our program in project management preparing a rolling review of all of our documents so it 's not just in the last nine 12 months that we have to start looking at our infrastructure strategy and and section 17a reviews but actually we do that over over time and so that it 's actually more of a living document netsim 's and really creating a potential framework for the review of the service pains and I would agree that look at what the community values and their submissions and really focus on those things first and what we 're cleaning to do is to make sure that when we report up there we have some external facing ones they 're really the ones that matter to our community and they may change over time but actually really focusing on the things that we can be really transparent about and that make a difference to our community so we 're working through that process as well so this is one of a number of ways we continue trying to improve these processes the challenging and difficult so and just before I go to questions because I am going to sort of slightly challenge across on the old copies that you made in relation to scourge and I actually agree with you that we have to put a line in the sand and we have to move on because we can 't_''_1155.049 I mean we will relitigate various aspects of what has occurred there and I know that the uncommon government has recognized that there are there 's a deficit and with respect to data and using land drainage as another example of that as well earthquake related damage but what was covered scoot scoot was promised to deliver and I don 't like to use skill because it 's not really be a fault I 'd rather say that the horizontal infrastructure component of the cost-sharing agreement with central government signed four months before I was elected as the mayor of the city promised a 21st century resilient City that 's what we were promised it is not what we were delivered but it must remain our ambition so the there were three elements of how the a very strong disconnect between central government and the council in terms of what was covered and what what people felt was covered from the send was that all of the earthquake related damage would be repaired under the skirt program in relation to horizontal infrastructure that was not the case second standards were changed during the course of the process unilaterally by central government and in fact we had to request the cabinet paper doing so under the Official Information Act which caused cost consternation to the orders of general when she reported on it and the third was pet repairs and as I have said on more than one occasion that has left a hole in our budget bigger than the holes that are left in our streets so it is something that we have had to cope with as a city but I agree entirely with you we can 't change what has happened we can only move on now the one that what I want you to help us with because I found the report is incredibly helpful but you 've just described to me one is how do we measure something that is necessarily movable as you 've used as your example you know you don 't want to see roadworks on my rocky road because people will say well that 's the West giving preference over the East but if you can say we fix this crack for this amount of money and we save ourselves six hundred thousand dollars down the track in terms of there appears and I think back to the project that Orion undertook where they spent six million dollars on a number of resilience measures but in particular the earthquake strengthening of these small substations which protected nearly sixty million dollars worth of asset more importantly meant that the power wasn 't off for three months instead of the three weeks that it was off after the earthquakes so tell me how do we how do we actually measure the you know that and how do we have a governance mechanism that ensures that we 're constantly able to provide their oversight so that we don 't get into the BAU mentality around renewals but actually are focusing on just capital it 's the office if you don 't do it 's the office if you do do that we made councilors have to set a strategy of waters way as an example it 's about how much you 're going to spend on new or improving what you 've got to leave sufficient for what if you 've got a good asset management system it should be identify where there are weaknesses in your current infrastructure and that 's hard to do i I wouldn 't work and David in some position that just reseal just south of west of Otero or in the milk tracks of character pieces NZTA won 't have that on the work plan because they 'll have assumed that they 've sealed them and they won 't need to do anything for another four or five years but um take the milk trucks because at the moment they 're not railing milk trucks have been using it on this the writer and so it 's the same with your local rights and so it 's how and and it comes back to Gary of service and then within the levels of service there are always going to be things were checking outside of there and it 's it 's how you identify and whether that 's an active Council program of going around reasonably regular streets and in having a look if you look on motorways and so forth you 're quite often find that they 've poured that sealer through all of their cracks that 's because Fulton Hogan and Higgins and so forth are doing regular inspections of roads whether that you can afford to do that as the City Council that 's another question I think it all comes back to service and be determining within your strategy how much you 're going to spend on road surfaces so that you still have sufficient funding to do some of these urgent repairs no but actually that 's been very helpful with the levels of service it 's not just roads and it 's not just any pair that 's comprehensive and you actually have to have every area and I can remember many times sitting at this table saying if and so we actually you know it has to be there has to be a really good test if this was my money what would I be doing because it 's very easy to actually say oh it 's via money it 's not all of their money and it has to be measured and it has to be prioritized yeah no no I pick the there 's crystal clear around the table because a big focus of this ltp as you know is the trying to keep a lid on the rates increase because you know in a post disaster environment when there 's so much to do there is still a desire to keep the the level of the unn crease down as much as we possibly can so that 's been a driver you know and that may or may not be the right approach but that 's the approach that we have adopted and I 'm down in one of the ways also you know people referred to regularly as business as usual maybe a test for some of this expenditures businesses unusual you need to items mm-hmm Dion din Sarah Glenn Yanni yes I 've got a couple of questions for you Gary and thanks for bringing this report to us and also thanks to the mayor for leading us to bake this in public because it is quite important I think people need to sort of get a grasp of we are at where we are at and and how we 're going to be moving forward understand as you see it but I mean a common theme about you know your reporters money obviously is the long term plan and from the work that you 've done do you think we 've got enough money to do what we 've seen you want to do I actually think so I actually think that you do have sufficient resources I think it 's a matter of looking at the management of them and that 's what we were talking about with the levels of service some of the levels of service you 've got are not relevant there and need to be looked at very hard so yes you do have enough money and I just you know perhaps moving and the focus on from just pure cost and cashing and prioritization or deferral and to looking at other ways of doing things and we 've mentioned some of those in the report and ways of working smarter or collaborative you know in partnership multi-use those things which staff at which the council already focused on but I think that the costs have been capped probably as far as they can be so and the focus needs to move to other ways of and being more efficient and another one your report basically says we should go back and redo our long term plan well it doesn 't away it says you know you need to let me talk please we need to go back and you know look at the the long term plan and those priorities and stuff I mean in the auditors past obviously that the long term plan everything was fine the draft the draft yes I mean is there a disconnect between what you 've seen and what we 've presented as the draft and is there something better of the two reports are quite different so the audit was in compliance and focus so looking at with the requirements of the legislation have been met whether the documents compliant where as we 've tried to take quite a different approach and in looking at the value of the of their unfettered access strategy and for councillors end and the council and general to see as this does this and give as much value as it could and I guess our recommendation is that it 's worth going back and and having a really hard look at your asset you know like your strategic plan how it 's that your your asset management plan needs to be oh sorry infrastructure plan needs to be this complicated fifteen hundred and sixty hundred and seventy pages I think Wellington 's fifty and so you need to get that documentation quite differently and then and then you need to actually say this council has to decide is your asset strategy compliant with what you think the strategic plan for the city is you know and that 's quite a challenge but none months it can be done recommendations it 's going forward so that we can go into the next annual plan process what they don 't mind draft infrastructure strategy as it stands is compliant it is better than the last one yeah these are just suggestions for moving it forward yeah and and I really appreciate the comments around value you know adding value I 'm Sarah thank you um there 's a lot I like about this report including the desire for us to potentially you know rien khao strategic priorities for me personally that would be able to supply in climate change leadership and that would make a lot of things but when i look at our strategic priorities and then i hear and those of you who have seen me around the table won 't be at all surprised to hear me say that cycleways was a bit of a trigger word and it 's they mentioned twice I don 't recall seeing any sort of detailed analysis at the cycleways in your report no I 'm just wondering when it came to background information for this Christchurch transport strategy the long-term transport strategy the business case behind it and actually how much money since we 're talking about saving money along to him how much money they will save the city long term and did you hear that information when you were going through Sarah focusing on that one yeah they felt that the levels of service in that area were reasonably good and they 're scratching my memory to try and remember what exactly that 's it could we get back to you on that one yeah just because I 'm just the way that it tends to be something that 's reported and to have comment made in the public forum from a group like yours who 's commenting on our long-term plan and a capital program making a comment on the side ways as a nice-to-have without the full background of stuff with fury these are likelihood that that potentially could be reported in a way that doesn 't have all of the contents around us and so it concerns me when those comment to make that aren 't in the report we is because even apart from the climate change leadership 53% diversity 's emissions come from transport for the long-term financial beneficial for example was we get 800 people out of cars we 've saved ourselves a 32 million dollar that field streetcar parking building it makes a lot of financial sense as well going forward as a city and when the government are pitching in two for one for the dollars we spend that also makes a lot of things Chris when you use the wrong example yeah I think I think it might have been do this for hours those who know me know this the officials were very helpful to us they gave us a lot of information some of the things like for example the cycleway if they were the sorts of questions that we actually put back to the officials and said well do you balance your cycleways with some of the other priorities that you 've got than your infrastructure so some of them are questions that we asked the officials to think about and so I 'm not sure if you look at our with a full analysis of cycleways versus fixing pages I think that Sarah would have rather that you used another example then cycleways because because it was the it 's that why why did there are multiple issues I mean the point that you 're raising is correct which is it 's it is the ability to set priorities but the reasoning that sits behind that priority isn 't an analysis or a comparison between streets and in the east and in cycleways is a nice-to-have it 's it 's actually do we want to get people a safe option for getting on their bicycles to get into town which would have a flow-on effect and though all these other areas which has got nothing to do with streets between yes but it 's got nothing to do with fixing streets it 's to do with it 's another set of objectives which actually time with our strategic priorities but I was a given I was a cabinet minister under Helen Clarke and she always used to say when you 're in a hole stop digging contribute nothing to the but cause as much damage as those powered by petrol solves another problem that creates one they are lighter they are lighter the roads are fixed from petrol tips I paid I paid for mine first clean thank you Jonnie and Jimmy thank you just on the procurement policy key observation number one you 've got there to include the office of the auto JIT what is the generals guiding principles they were included when the policy was first drafted up so are you saying here you know make that more explicit or you know and given those small his life cost savings okay it 's really Princeton the existing policy orders of generals infrastructure test of something that 's actually quite a good cheap list which we hit at one stage on this report Jonnie yeah thank you I had three questions one you talked about procurement bias to RCC oh and I just kind of wondered as part of your consideration you seem to be inferring that a competitive marketplace will deliver I was quite interested in whether you 'd considered actually bringing some of those operations that 've kind of thought other things and you 've talked about cycleway so I use that as an example we 're hiring consultants to effectively do what school council business for the next ten years and I presume that 's at a huge premium so have you had any consideration around things that we currently contract out or procure through a competitive tendering process that actually may be better we just directly do ourselves again that 's part of your asset strategy you 've got to actually look at what advice do you give so this is the operational costs of the advice you get now it may be much much cheaper to engage staff in-house and and giving you good quality advice than it is to bring a consultant and you 've actually got to look in your lists you should be looking at the lists of consultants and seeing where are we spending our money and could we do it cheaper that 's a question we also touched on it when we looked at identifying critical assets and dresses associated with them in Michigan 's and I think 'm just trying to think which one of the waters it was anyway considering whether or not critical services should be contracted out whether they should be and has about generally no but that 's something we could consider we should actually make a decision you know we should consider that as is an option as what you 're saying we should actually review that it 's part of your financial strategy I was interested in your 6.2 of your report which talked about our procurement policy which seems to make an assumption that the trading see CTOs differently result on other competitors receiving a tilting of open competition and that compromises market interests to compete and it goes on you know reducing potential for innovation and may lead to paying more for goods and services I don 't see anything that 's sort of sowing actually if you own a company and you can directly procure with them the smartphone in terms of a financial thing would possibly be to to look at using it like that and I can 't quite understand where your rationale is you don about anywhere in this report yes about in-house or about not contracting out yeah but if you are contracting yeah I guess you 're talking city kid then you need to be testing them against other suppliers or otherwise it gets very soft and they see the council as an easy touch your but Karen 's just picked up on another point which I think Nana is talking about which is perhaps and in terms of criticality criticality you 're wanting to look at whether it should be in house as opposed to contracted at all no I understand that I just didn 't see that other sides in your report I only saw that one side to say we shouldn 't be having a preference to assist you implement recommendations coming tonight within the context of the procurement policy but and so I 've raised the issue also on the back of it I 've had a conversation with the chief executive around some of the the critical infrastructure but also things that we require for our cities you know Garden City Street so I really particularly would like City to be doing the work rather than thinking about whether they 've but meet the minimum requirements of a contractual rate relationship with the council to the other two areas that I wanted to just talk about um yeah reading through your IT leadership comment it it kind of seems to imply that you 're concerned that we 've under invested in IT now I mean you know sort of for the 16 years that I 've been an elected member I just recall constantly being asked for more money for IT huge amounts of money going into systems that would solve all the problems and would be you know they 're the magic bullet but but yeah it always seems to be an area that needs more money the cost just seemed to be going up and up and up so I 'm just trying to kind of understand it just wondered if you could just kind of give a snapshot of what you 're thinking is around IT cuz I thought you 'd be saying actually you 're spending too much and you should look at reducing spent enough and we should be spending more possibly but I 'll let you talk to it because there are recommendations that is that you should be briefed on the IT strategy and it be developed and implemented further the i-team the point we the point we got to is is EAG as we 'd be having a look at okay that 's pretty IT seems to be impossible in every family or nothing and the final question was um you took a little bit about delegations doing things differently but it doesn 't sound having much discussion that I can see around the idea I guess those external groups you know we 've we 've transferred a lot of functions to crush it indeed we 're funding development Christchurch to give advice to regenerate Christchurch we 're funding regenerate Christchurch to give advice to development Christchurch we 're funding both of them to give advice to us and this seems to be this kind of development of a whole bunch of entities that seem to get paid to do pretty similar things and I just wondered if you 'd of board of directors chief executives consultants in terms of a budget in a long term plan and what out you know if you had any comments around what a strategic approach that looked like or how it might be improved I have very personally very strong views on every single thing you 've raised however none of it had anything to do with the capital review so but it is thank you correct answer so but but I mean it is something that we will be looking at because we do actually have to use this time as an opportunity to think about whether we have got those structures right I don 't think we have but form follows function and that 's that 's the next little bit of work that we 're doing behind the scenes but thank you for raising it absolutely often a feature of discussion at the Tuesday Club and you can follow them up there in may not be clear about know if you I 've got I 've got a different numbering system from the risk you I 've got page twelve good lesson and all right you know if I look at them there 's not a lot I did to them I 'm aware that you age forty on out and a long iterative process but I think it 's it 's for the staff that 's difficult if the council table doesn 't say that 's our top priority and that 's down there so the because that 'll drive your capital budgets and and it 'll drive your levels of service as well and so you know you could you could just about fit anything and for those as a level playing field but once you start and this was something that Sarah simply from Auckland City was really strong she said you know the impact of global warming what is that how 's that going to impact on your coastline how 's that going to impact on and she went through various issues for us that they are doing an Auckland and it was really helpful because you know that 's something that 's going to drive costs way beyond the ten years but you 've actually calling made a really good point earlier that and sitting the strategic framework is only the beginning it 's the first step actually embedding that within the organisation as the hard part and so that it gets to a stage where it is actually forefront it 's clear and forefront and the minds of those that are starting to set these plans in place and that 's you know that 's the real challenge and strategic discussion and one of the things that will happen out of this exercise in as some favorite projects will fall over they will be this you know because you prioritize things something you know the result of that is some sacred cows because I reveal the strategic priorities you put your emphasis you 'll report need to power test which one 's first vision is the last essential but that all these a sixth are the strategic priority a trees is to achieve a community for instance like strong community this highly in relation to the enabling active citizenship connected community in chief those outcomes regarding livable city this kind of the developer vibrant I just want to know if we put our ties reaper our ties no strategic priority whether regarding to the highly welcoming outcome will still need to prioritize which one is mostly important like the health environment is most important or stronger communities important or equally important this might be yeah look I don 't think it 's possible on a session like this to actually answer that question I one of the one of the important things when dealing with strategic priorities is to actually have somebody working with the council in going through a process of what does this mean and then as you defined each of them you say well actually after our consideration but you can 't just looking at them I said you could fit anything into into those but actually when you look hard at these and you define actually that 's what this means then you can say we can rank them and some you might have second equal or third equal or whatever but you 've you 've you 've still put turned your mind so that that then enables your infrastructure to pull on and off which you don 't have right now you can say actually we could rank them but the situation that we find ourselves and it 's going to change so for example the water situation we at the moment a safe in sustainable water supply and improve waterways is top for us right now so if we had put another one it 's a top priority in responsive rather than and maybe that 's what we 're trying to do by having them but that 's what we 'll debate I mean like you know that that 's the debate right we don 't need to debate all of these issues now it you know that we 've been presented with a report we 've had some time to start to absorb but I think we 've got quite a bit of work to do I 've been working on some recommendations for us to to debate today but a lot of it 's going to be about what we do with the report in the future so Sarah you have a question I just lastly on 13 because you 're right that 's the next thing like we 've got them they 're embedding them into the organisation so that they do Drive and pull those levers is really important but then the next thing is is holding on to that so that they can so that we don 't switch from Council to counsel in the new ones each time so beauty but any thoughts about how we keep these as a sustainable vision across maybe multiple councils because it 's only when you 're able to have them long-term but those livers actually work because if you keep pulling different levers all the time you just kind of stay where you are and the organization starts to ignore you but how do we embed those so that they are sustainable priorities that culture yeah that 's a question for the chief executive really because it is about the culture of the organization but you can 't_''_3197.68 you know what no council combined a future Council you know council always has the capacity to over tune a decision that others have made but I say we 're not going to sort of say this is what we do but this is you know this is us doing this this is us doing this and response the strategic directions it 's embedding the strategic directions in the context of everything that the organization does that 's how you change culture so I mean I think you know I just want to congratulate you now lean foot but for taking that that approach because I think that 's what 's going to make the difference but I think you know can I just sort of kind of wrap up on the questions and just say thank you so much for the work that you 've done we have a series of recommendations which I 'd like to now move on to and I have you know sort of like pre-prepared them it 's like one of those cooking programs but you say I just happen to have a cake that I 've already prepared earlier on so you can see what it was like after it comes out of the oven but anyway I 've got want to personally thank you Gary and you know not just yourself have come here today but the whole team for working together in such a collaborative way working with staff in a collaborative way and ensuring that we were able to take on the challenge of what is an extremely complex and yeah a challenging budget over the next 10 years but it 's not for the next 10 years we can review this every year that 's what the annual plan process is for and I think that what you 've done is given us a really good framework for taking this board so thank you very very much and please pass that on to your colleagues thank you so the recommendations and I 'd like to move them as to receive the EI G 's report note the eight recommend a recommendations grouped across four strategic themes noting the acknowledgement from the chief executive which highlights the complexity and challenges of the council 's work program and in particular and then looking at the early response and particular ongoing improvements to program and project management preparing for years ahead of the next LTP and creating a potential framework for the review of service plans agreed to prioritize levels of service within the draft service plans in accordance with the submissions received on the draft LTP including the recommendations on climate change so I pick that one up specifically and ensure that they are reviewed prior to the 30th of June so that 's that 's to focus on the absolute must do before we come to the conclusion of the LTP and then consider all remaining levels of service after the LTP has been resolved with a beautifully diverse into the next annual plan consider the draft asset management strategy with a view to ensuring that it provides Council with sufficient oversight of the capital program with respect to legal obligations strategic priorities and renewals and then notes that the AIG report makes other recommendations across a range of areas related to their review of the infrastructure strategy and the capital program and invites the chief executive bribe feedback with recommendations to Council as soon as practicable no later than the end of October so and I small lead to a series of reports so it 's not that we 'll wait till the end and then report on all of them it 's just as we go through them and it makes since then there 's a reporting back mechanism to the council and we thank the members of the EAG for their work in a particular thanks the Auckland Council and development West Coast for supporting saris and clear and Chris Mackenzie 's participation which we 're very grateful for so okay can I get a second generally thank you just wondering with number four when I couldn 't see it again yeah so prioritize people 's of service within the draft service plans in accordance with the submissions received on the draft LTP can I ask that we include end strategic priorities so prioritizing the labels of service not just on the submissions but also on our priorities so for a in accordance with the submissions received on the draft LTP yes I have directions or strategies I 'm not yet convinced that we need to prioritize them no no no no believe it of it it 's fine without prioritized but it 's prioritizing the lives or levels of service in accordance with our strategic priorities oh yeah yeah yeah that 's fine yeah in accordance with the submissions received on that well in accordance with our strategic priorities and submissions were saved on the draft or anything yeah but I don 't want it to be exclusive No so our strategic priorities [Music] no that 's our legal obligations as well so and they 're not and our strategic priorities but the strategic priorities were in the dirt and the consultation document so we know no I understand that but it 's exclusive it stops being inclusive so just prioritize levels of service within the draft service plans in accordance what the submissions are saved on the draft LTP we are going to be looking at the strategic priorities but I don 't want prioritizing levels of sewers to be only in that context but currently it 's sorry currently it 's only in the context of the submissions what if we want to look beyond the submissions we 're not able the words in accordance to taking into account their submissions received on the draft LTP and including the recommendations on climate change change leadership climate change leadership yeah so it 's just it was it 's just like requiring that yeah so thank you that very helpful so so I 've got the me and moved deputy Muir yep second does so so we 're just generally quite happy to put the resolution I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "we 're coming back to the debate on the well he had security improvements the resolutions and just who moved and seconded it it was moved in second accounts the Cotton Council at Clearwater so I 'm just mindful of the fact that there Pauline just hasn 't come back into the room so so would you like to start off the debate on this maybe I think that in fact as a council we 're at a good stage with us I think that staff have done a lot of work also as councils we 've had the opportunity to actually talk with Environment Canterbury and the DHB at our water forums we are getting some very good information and it seems to me that gradually that the you know that the the best option in terms of the mechanisms will emerge and we 're having those developed and it with the different reports we receive so I don 't think that this is like an ad hoc type process at all I think that clearly we we as accounts are receiving a lot more information around our water the responsibility so I think in fact we 're ensuring that there is good governance around us and it will achieve our objective of and ensuring that we have it air water safe but I leave that full of comments supporting Abdi on I wanted to talk just quickly about the paper in front of us I think you know we just have to get this done we just have to sort of divert what we can to actually make sure it 's done especially as we do the long term plan there 's going to be some implications around that but I think you know when we talk about priorities this is one of the priorities that we actually need to focus on and actually really have a soul search about you know we 're we 're other priorities certain how we actually manage that under the ten year and 30 year long and infrastructure strategy but I mean when it comes to this I I just wanted to sort of I need to get this air off my chest is I think we 're getting a bit duped the in New Zealand I mean there 's a there 's a New Zealand group who are lobbying to have permanent cleric treatment of all water supplies Council and private and the people who are informing people about stuff linked to this and it 's causing so much fuss in undermining the work that we 're doing so we need to be very clear about the work that we 're doing there now and in the work that you know other partners are doing and also the supply of our water so that we don 't find ourselves in this battle between what a lobby group wants because if you follow the money you can see clearly what the intention is it 's disgusting you know if we need to get to the facts of what 's going on and they you know if they should actually just come out and say this is what we 're thinking but anyway we need to be very clear about what we 're doing here I do look forward to in May getting that the the timeline and actually so we can tell to happen and what we 're doing in the future Aaron yeah okay to receive the information and have a look through and look at our ways forward and it does feel like a bit of a gun to the head what we 're doing and I just want to start by saying aye because I do sit on the DHB and I 've set through seminars there and I want went to the water in see a presentation and they 've got over seen those here as well and I did ask Alastair Humphries about people getting sick crow stretch water in his answer was no one has ever got settled from Christchurch water well not to the point that it comes up in hospital anyway that is the position of the DHB so it was strange when the DHB worth asking us to look at disinfecting our water because disinfectant is the term that water indeed use which really was just about the legislation that applies to the delivery of water and treatment of water doesn 't actually pertain to the quality of the water we 're drinking in Zira behind the recommendations that have gone to the government there 's 53 recommendations if they are adopted by the government I 'm not gonna use to see weird it 's not necessarily corruption but it at best it 's a scheme because there 's a tomb coined in 1974 by an Kruger called rent sinking you see ek ing look it up this is rent seeking and it 's beer states with particular industries set up a situation and it 's done really well now with the media where you scare people enough that they will throw a lot of money at it water in New Zealand is going to be worth billions of dollars because people are going to pay to protect themselves from something that doesn 't exist and there is no and Christchurch to zebra got sick from our water I do have confidence and the staff that deliver our water I don 't have confidence and putting disinfectant in the water as is in the recommendations to the government I hope that we never do permanently I realize it 's there now I didn towards doing it permanently it is I think revolting I thinks the term we 're looking for here quite Vicky back I the water at my house smells like a swimming pool it 's quite good when I clean out my pole I just fill it up but I bother chlorinating it never goes green I can 't work out why the kids smell like the been to a pole when they dive in it so it 's a good thing I suppose but because the water tastes like that we have other issues that will be coming up and that as our city will now be creating a lot of extra plastic waste for water bottles being sold you 'll notice in garages and supermarkets water bottle displays have gone to the front because they 're moving really well and of course lots of sugar will be added to our water to make it more palatable for the people of Christchurch that are used to drinking the most pure water in the world which are currently isn 't so look up rinks seeking I I just plead with you a legitimate tomb and it 's and it 's what 's going on here clean thank you obviously our staff and elected members my colleagues here we 're taking this matter very seriously part of that is curiosity is beginning to grow and I 'll come back to that later I wonder whether we could if we haven 't done so already explore looking at map updates for residents on Newsline so that they can see the work progressing on the on the well heads that could provide some degree of comfort the risk about mandatory treatment was already signal as another point I want to make today before today 's front page of the priests so if we look at page rather 6.20 that was already there that the that the slight risk of permanent chlorination really exists so in that sense it 's not new news permanent chlorination could cut both ways so it in terms of the for well-beings some would see that is obviously a clear kind of candidate if you like for you know social community well-being_._468.4 but it could also go the other way our residents in my experience goal posts are usually dug into the ground and they don 't move I 'm now seeing goal posts on wheels and I have a sense in which we 're part of a catch me if you can process whereby the goal posts keep shifting from one field to the other and so back to the first point curiosity is beginning to grow in a question that I have is who stands to gain if permanent chlorination was to proceed so we know about the risks on the other side of the equation we 're taking those seriously but who stands to gain and some of my colleagues Dion and Aaron are starting to ask that as well and I think we need to keep asking that I have a sense in which we might be being waterboarded by the New Zealand waterboard so keep asking the questions we 're elected to ask them we 're elected to take risks seriously we 're also elected to ask questions and I pour my colleagues to keep doing that thank you thank you we are where we moving it so simply floating around the place we 've it 's essential that we walk hand in hand with the the DHB and the chief officer of health Alastair Humphries because at the end of the day the new standards of the well heads that we require to do will be a good thing that they 're going to be better for the future a bit of future proofing and as though it was mentioned before there has been no one recorded that has got sick from our water as I 'm Erin pointed out through the District Health Board so our water is tested constantly it 's good water it 's pure water but to get us in front of the government where if they are or when they are required to change the rules yet again earth we are hand in hand with the chief officer of health saying that we can be exempt and confidently so then that is where we have to go to get to keeping a pure water of the future so we can the debater we want but we all know where be and it 's about giving us as quickly and efficiently as possible thank you yonni [Music] I 'm really concerned we 've heard today from staff that basically the risk this is based on risk and that in the hundred years or so we haven 't had any breaches and well no recorded breaches into our well heads that have caused us concerned so what we know as a city is our biggest risk is our reticulated system post it with quake post skirt who didn 't repair things properly in terms of the standard that I would expect in a modern resilient city and we 've had the graphs from our staff previously that show the number of water mains that have been breaking because of the lack of repair so if you actually weighing this up in a sensible approach spending money where the biggest risk is rather than where the hysteria is you would not be spending money doing what we 're being asked to do or looking at doing you would actually spend it fixing the areas where we are getting a bit ice you things getting into the reticulated system and that 's what really concerns me so I really welcome the fact that some of my colleagues have today question what 's behind us who 's going to benefit from this because it seems to me very clear that there 's an agenda here that 's building up in New Zealand and that is to basically take water away from local communities being able to make decisions about it and to put it into non elected corporate and probably private structures that mean that local people don 't have a say in how water is handled so you know I think this is a really delicate issue it 's really clear that there 's a whole bunch of games going on in terms of trying to back us into a position and I 'm really not happy about that I think you know the reality is that the heavily North hysteria that 's been caused is totally unfounded in terms of history and Christchurch from our past experience the the risk has been incredibly low and we 've got much greater risk with 're spending money to try and fix that higher risk well in the short term in the immediate we 're spending that money on this there 's got a lot of risk it just to me makes no sense at all I think we really need government to actually start to communicate with us about what they 're doing and what they 're thinking is and I am concerned that we 've been asked to spend a lot of money for something that yeah it seems to be just doesn 't make sense from a common-sense point of view yeah okay and I think the reports from the staff and the work that 's been done has been excellent I think the information that came through there and Infrastructure Committee was excellent and it seems to me quite basically quite simple that we have three pillars that make our water secure for us to drink one is secure bore heads which is what we 're dealing with now second is the regular testing here between four hours which is more frequently than is required and the third is the Geo purity of the water underground so in our aquifers so those are the three pillars upon which we base our security of safe drinking water instead of just looking at one option and this report for fixing the warheads we 're now looking at four potential options fixed below the ground put them above the ground at UV and or potential closing or cutting off of some boards I think that 's very sensible that we look at all of the options across the network to see what works what works best in each area and I think that 's a very sensible rational way for us to go and I think it 's much better than just looking at the first the one option of fixing below the ground so I like where we 've gotten to in terms of what what we 're doing in terms of where we 're going it 's very clear to me that what we 're doing is seeking within 12 months to get back to a none chlorinated water supply and that seems to me to be incredibly basic and actually almost for people in Christchurch it 's interesting to see in the submissions that have come so far how important people regard their drinking to be and how important is for them to feel better there 's pure but not chlorinated so we 're making what we 're doing is very clear to me we 're making our ballhead safer so that we can get an exemption if we don 't do it we have no chance in all at all assuming the government does decide that you have to get an exemption we don 't know what the government has yet decided because it hasn 't yet been decided but they have locked north enquiry has put some interesting spinners and all sorts of works yes we do want the medical officer of health on our side beside us when we and if we have to make an application for an exemption so I think that 's incredibly clear I like the fact Lian that you 're going to fight for now I noticed what house it 's already slightly chipped is very clear there is a very clear agenda Ian 's rabbits that and he said it quite publicly he does not want elected councils controlling water people who are elected do not know anything about water and should not be controlling it and he 's totally opposed to any city heavily exemption so he 's very forthright and his views they 're not necessarily thick they 're definitely not the views of the people of Christchurch who drink the water and who want it to be safe so I think what we 're doing in terms of the work on making the securable heads through a poem through a package that means that we get the best outcome at the best cost for our community and within and still aiming for the 12-month period is very sensible so I like all and I like the additional recommendations that we 've put as well yeah Andrew yeah I mean this clearly is one of the most important issues facing this council is something that needs to be resolved there are essentially two different areas of consideration here one of which is the requirement for temporary chlorination until we get the government 's response to the have along North report and the two at some point may become combined but for the moment we need to do what we said it was we were going to do and work with our staff and advisors to do that which is to get the chlorine out of the water within the 12 months that we originally indicated that would be the case and the recommendations that we 've got in front of us certainly give us enough scope and flexibility to continue to work to get the chlorine out of the water within the 12 months we 're hearing loud and clear from the people of Christchurch that that 's not what they want and we know that as elected representatives that that 's not what we want either and we 've made that clear but you know obviously keeping an eye on government recommendations and changes coming out of the have along North inquiring I think the recommendations we 've got in front of us a not inconsistent with steps that we might need to take in that context as well to work to resolve the temporary chlorination issue get the chlorine out of the water as quickly as possible yes I think is opportunity because why Yamaha 's do concerned council should strengthen their communication because if we back to the January in there can we particularly have a kind of announcement of all the problem mainly focus on the pillow go under water hey there 's one oh sweet if we repair we have a further improvement this one capitally and also we particular lungs of this kind of the temporary coordination what will be within 2 months by you will reason with review media note if an experiment if and the view etc so we need to speed up the progress of the per quarter 6 you know if we bring all those a possible solution to teehee we need to immediately no open to the public not then because wider it because topical community that they 're here from a different source you know they the more or less you know lost the confidence to Tula Council is mine and it 's in my view so how also we are all aware majority of the people not only in culture chief father property in the Kanto area we are very proud we have so la-based the water how to keep it so the mayor nation would like to stand against the least ones you know stand for this one that 's very good but we still need a kind of sufficient information comprehensive version to support this way then we can challenge you will argue or negotiate with the central government if all the kinda nationwide would like to lease a permanent mentor to read coordination water father why the project end up with we are exempt clearly in the face to the topic this is a resource that we 've had for forever let 's air water and I 'm absolutely confident in the approach that we 're taking at the moment to to ensure that we become absolutely compliant and really just revert back to a non-chlorinated source of water it 's the best source of water in the in the country in the world and I think every citizen encouraged to get back to untreated water for granted as a result of the hemlock North outbreak the standards used to test our water changed and suddenly we were at risk of having unsecured wellheads leading to unsafe water drinking water the confidence in our pristine untreated water was questioned as we were faced with the very low risk of contamination this was the first threat to the best water in the world as a council we responded to this by making the difficult decision to temporarily chlorinate for the next 12 months while air well heads are chipped and our staff will work incredibly hard on this we are now how we were faced with another possible threat is central government has it mandating having to every drinking water supply to chlorinate I believe are responsible in quick actions to temporarily chlorinate communicates to central government that we are perfectly capable of managing our own water supply thank you very much our response to the initial three actually is actually going to work into our advantage because it 's moved us towards looking at other solutions we 're actually along the path to exploring so we are in a much better position to argue our case against hearing to chlorinate then we would have been without our first water crisis if central government directs us to chlorinate we will stand with our communities and the trenches in fight treason now is our Muirhead seed against a permanent chlorination this is a city our water and permanent chlorination doesn 't wash with me oh sorry did you want to contribute no serious Mike you you could move move move Sierra 's my face I think most of my colleagues have actually said everything I 've sort of gonna say but I just sort of want to touch on a little bit what councillor manager was talking about you know this is to two issues we have here two serious issues one that obviously we 've got a 12 month time frame around to try fix and that 's getting our secured status back which is really really important but obviously the more important thing is to make sure that actually moving moving forward and into the future we actually have water that 's not permanently and so we need to make sure we actually do things right not quickly we need to get all the advice all the information and make sure that the decisions we make to actually give us the best possible way of maintaining our pure clean water is taken and I would hate to be spending money a lot of money because it 's cost millions of dollars when potentially we 're actually missing the point of what needs to be done and when their information comes to us we 've wasted a lot a lot of that their money and I do support the work we 're doing and in making sure that we get everything done and our water supplier drinking water supply it needs to be it needs to be gold plated you know it comes before a covered stadium it comes before repaired roads it comes before cycleways it is one of our best assets the city has you know it sets us apart from other cities in New Zealand probably the whole of the world it 's what we pride ourselves in and you know the we have a possibility of ensuring that our water remains pure and clean in there that 's for an exemption we need to make sure if we do get that glimmer of hope hope we grab hold of it and we take it is so important for this city to sit ourselves apart from everyone else and maintain the water that we 've cherished for such a long time the water that no one has ever got sick from before I come because you 're gonna close the debate pool and I just wanted to add one other thing to the comments that I made earlier and that is is that the that that the very person who said that he would require us to chlorinate the water if we had not made the decision to chlorinate the water was the same person who had the authority to issue a boil water notice he didn 't and he didn 't for a reason so I think people need to keep everything unperceptive here this is about the the big guns and can I just say that and it 's to first but if all your if the only tool that you 've got is a hammer then all of your problems start looking like nails and if the only tool that you 've got is the full treatment of water then the only solution looks like chlorine smells like chlorine taste like chlorine and that 's what we need to focus our attention on but I agree with Mike in reef that it is about ensuring that our pristine water supply that sits underneath the ground precious that it is is able capable of being delivered to people in accordance with the standards that will be applied and that means that we have to do this anyway so I think investing and assessing the UV option is something that we must do and that 's why I was very pleased that council staff had proceeded to do that work as a result of the recommendations that came out of the 30 committee so I 'm pleased with where we are at the moment I 'm not pleased that others have entered into the into the fray with comments that are population so and another comment that I 've just finally made it 's against my dude final comment and that is this that very early on in the piece and it 's really to cook up something Aaron said very early on in the piece and I mentioned this to the press reporter when he came the other day somebody said to me follow the money if you want to know the answer to the problem that you 're confronted with as a city follow the money beer as there are big dollars involved in chlorinating water supplies and the advice that we are receiving is based on those who believe there is no alternative but to chlorination and there is a lot of money that sits on behind that desire so but we have an obligation as a council to make sure that our structures and our delivery systems are second to none and I believe that even despite the earthquakes that we 've been through the processes that we have in place in the city are second to none so I 'll hand over to you Pauline to well heed renewal program and it 's not just since he blocked north it 's a rolling program 3 3 4.1 million in our LTP we also have stringent testing as Vicki 's alluded to and it 's far more than us actually required but we have willingly taken learnings from have knocked north and we 're upgrading our infrastructure according to strictest standards even though we 've had no transgressions a staff will remove chlorination from the pumps on it from the world from the pumps on a case-by-case timeline as the assigned office secured and the report coming back to Council in May will include a multi criteria analysis around the four options including the 12 month time frame in affordability in Vicki 's alluded to those four options but it 's not one or the other at SAC on nation of sort of a pick-and-mix between them so we 're chlorinating it at lighter degree we 're lucky there and we have therefore we have less residual chlorine in the system our investigations into UV UV is welcome and we 'll have more information next month and are doing an incredible job stepping up to this program and we need to acknowledge this and we already have generally but they 're under so much pressure given the speed with which this is blown up the resolution before us today allows us to continue the remediation and upgrade work to our well heads and as I said previously it is right that we do this at a sound investment in our infrastructure it 's improving resilience of our network and it will put us in good stead should Christchurch City Council ever be put in a position to request an exemption for mandatory chlorination and I trust the people of Christchurch have got the message that this council wants our pure water to stay pure and that they will support us as being the organisation that makes this decision not an independent regulator thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much right we 're move on to the _"

    "text": "Jameer for cheering the meeting in my absence I had a meeting off-site this morning which was very very worthwhile so the next item I 'd like to go back to item 14 which I asked the deputy mayor to hold off until I was here so item 14 as well he had security improvements and Pauline I 'd like to invite you to introduce the report status the City Committee sought a report from staff to provide the costs and in time frames for above grounding all of their well heads we felt this information was necessary in order to make good decisions around our air water supply safety this report contains that information that we sought staging 21.5 million and up to six years to do the above grounding this is helpful but unfortunately wise the costs and the time frames are unpalatable due to our overarching desire to remove the chlorination within 12 months so the committee noted that below ground well heeds are compliant with the drinking water standard New Zealand but in order to comply Dan must be well sealed to prevent any ingress ingress a combination of mitigations that will under the current standards give us secure status including the use of UV at the pump stations of which there are 53 so we 've requested that staff provide a report back in May and this will probably I would say come directly to Council due to the fact that there 's no AC committee meeting and may because we 've got a lot of LTP hearings and also because we 're treating this issue is a top priority so each wellhead will be investigated on a case-by-case basis and currently is being investigated the work is ongoing and therefore will expect to emerge a package of different options in scenarios ensuring the 12 month time frame will be meet the options will include above grounding we prepped practicable affordable and timely below-ground appears UV treatment at the pump station or even abandoning some wells that are not really needed or the shallow or the rolled pause so staff will come back with an affordable option that will enable us to cease chlorination within 12 months thank you and see our drinking water comply we want to put through today from the committee is that we 're standing by a decision around the temporary chlorination and yes we do have our foot on the pedal to get there appears and renewals we 've done and no matter what the outcome we need any announcement that may be imminent or not the work we 're doing is necessary its right is responsible and a sustained investment in our infrastructure work that will ensure that our drinking water is safe in the future so I I just want to reiterate that the the program at work is ongoing it is not halted and no matter what happens in the future this work needs to be done to ensure our water safety thank you just before I open it up for questions I just wanted to comment that there are two other measures that I think that we have to keep our attention on one is as the chief executive has commissioned a review of what has actually occurred in terms of losing our secure status just prior to Christmas and in the sequence of events that inquiry and any other elements that will be of importance to the council in terms of how it monitors progress and the future so that so that 's being undertaken by mr. Bruce Robertson and we 're expecting a draft report by the end of next month and is up by the end of next month or sooner and so and and so then perhaps a final report by the end of end of May which is actually quite a tight timeframe that he 's operated under but he has been interviewing all of the relevant staff members of the governance team members of some external x '_''_285.9 as well drinking water assists are obviously medical officer of health so it 's it 's an in-depth report and I think it 's going to be incredibly helpful in terms of what has actually happened so that we are in a better position to judge steps forward in the future the second is that of course everyone 's now waiting for the government 's announcements in relation to the hewa lakh North enquiry itself and it 's quite clear that certain standards that the the way that they are being applied now is much more stringent than perhaps they were being applied prior to have locked north and and so that has an element of contribution to where we 're up to but what the government decides will obviously impact on what we need to do in the future but I think as Pauline has said quite clearly in her comments this is best practice this is what we have to do we need to protect the mechanisms that supply our drinking water and and so that 's this is a stick that we have to do regardless and and with those wider issues that will be really important I 'm I 'm hoping that the government understands that there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to drinking water supply around the country we take our responsibilities really really seriously we test every day that is not required under the current standard but we do it the we want to protect our drinking water supply so and we do want to get chlorine out of the water as quickly as we can this morning I know that there were elements of that story that were written before Dave Adamson myself and the chief executive were interviewed and it is of concern that somebody who is not an expert as making opinions statements in the public to create a sense of concern around two different things and I tried to explain this and I 'll try to explain it one more time there are two issues that have been conflated one is the aquifer from which our drinking water supply is obtained as it comes up through the through the many layers because as the deep aquifers that we 're talking about with bore holes bore heads that we are required to fix in order to to supply the water with bore heads that may or may not have you need to reach relationship with it assuming that something from the surface can travel all the way down and then find its way somewhere in the in the mix back up into the system I mean it is actually quite irresponsible for somebody to be presenting that as anything other than a unvalidated chief executive about how we might resolve some of the concerns that obviously will be raised by people who might read that and think that there is any element of that that is worthy of further consideration then the dismissal that I would give it so on that note could I perhaps open this up for questions I attended the attic committee that considered this everything was really worked through I think in a in a in a detailed way but if anyone has any outstanding questions on it I 'll take those views but there is one other thing that I just mentioned that arising out of all of this there remains concern and the general public about the about the decision that we have taken to temporarily chlorinate our water supply I 've put it on Facebook yet again early hours of this morning you know the medical officer of Health would have directed us to chlorinate the water if we hadn 't made that decision I want the medical officer of Health standing side by side with me when we ask for central government for an exemption that 's why we chose to go down the path of chlorination on a temporary basis it 's temporary decision that we 've made we 've given staff 12 months if that 's going to take more than 12 months they have to come back and tell us why and ask for permission to continue to chlorinate so there 's a lot of water to go under the bridge yet before we get to a final conclusion but because I want to send the signal out to the public as strongly as I possibly can this may be something that I will elevate to the status of a mural Task Force as we did with the flooding when we were under extreme situation there and I am going to consider that but I want to do that in the context of what the government decides in the context of the Bruce Robertson report when it lands and in the context of the advice that we get back from staff on the next steps which will be coming directly back to Council so I 've just abused my position as the 'll open it up for questions Rev was quite useful in terms of elevating this to a more strategic approach because what concerns me here and certainly when I look at resolution number three where it says proceed with delivery of works blah blah blah within the solution is obvious due to its economic timing the problem I have is every single report we 've had on this has been different every time it comes so which suggests that actually the solutions aren 't obvious and I 'm not seeing a clear strategic framework as part of long term infrastructure as to how we should approach the management of our water supply we keep coming up each time with new solutions to problems we just found out a month ago and I 'm not sure this is the right way to approach this this is gonna be a much bigger issue so I you know raising the world heads here that absolutely makes sense but in terms of having a strategic approach that takes into account you know obviously the report on the maintenance but also the government 's position 's just my thank you well yeah yep okay yes it was to ensure that anything that has some some wells cannot be an over ground and above grounded they might be in public access ways or in parks there 's an obvious one get in the mitigate there some of them need to be renewed that 's a no-brainer so that 's there 's to ensure that the program is continuing as we speak yeah because we really try to reach that 12 month period the usually committee is also calling for a report on the program as he suggested the whole program and monthly updates or even fortnightly updates to keep ahead of their progress on the project well I guess actually cuz I probably didn 't actually ask the question specifically in terms of to staff and when I look at a report further down around the northwest and how that timetable had been moved out and I I don 't think I didn 't know about that but are you confident that actually the the current approach which seems to me to be sort of slightly at the level that we need to do to deal with it the May report is likely to put forward to the council a number of options and we need to in terms of weighted attributes in terms of money in time above ground below ground continuing chlorination or putting UVM and I think the view of the staff is that we 're for any any set of options the solution is still the same that 's where we run a strategic point of view a good example we are out in the market at the moment to give expressions of interest around UV equipment because basically till we get that and that closes on the 3rd of May until we get information like that I can 't actually give you a set timetable I don 't know what the delivery times is I don 't know the availability I don 't actually know the availability of temporary UV equipment that may be able to come through as container but we 're hoping so those are some of the works that we are proceeding so we can actually get you five years to do well it doesn 't become an option but I 've actually got something solid and so a lot of staff are working on those kind of so that we can bring you back in May a a very clear strategic approach to what there is there are also some examples where you 've got maybe a pump station with three above above-ground well heads and you 've only got one below basically what 's the most economic option in that kind of scenario it may be to raise that one above the ground as the mayor said we are unaware of what the government 's going to do in the long but I think we 've made counsel aware that we have asked our consultant speaker to do a report for us around what would meet the current drinking water standards which are risk-based and what are likely to meet the future now I think the future drinking water standards will be risk-based any safety system is respond so you know I don 't think there are fundamental underground it 's just we there 's a report coming back to you in May will have a lot more strategic feel to it and some of the the options be actually a lot clearer about why they 've been applied in various cases which will give you a lot better feel for where we go from you yeah because I think you know that the risk-based approach is appropriate and we have discussed that ad ordered and risk and so I think the question here is are we rushing to meet some self-imposed deadlines around the chlorination which is you know to meet that goal as opposed to make a bigger goal which is actually the critical maintenance of our water supply and water delivery system which is what should be driving the behaviors that is the approach that we want to adopt so and I think that what what 's what what has happened is that I mean with the with the temporary chlorination decision because it appears that this latest sort of opinion that 's floated to the surface has emerged from somebody brought in specifically to peer-review the temporary chlorination not to look at feedback from the market in relation to the UV option how quickly could that be brought in on a temporary basis on a lease basis on a permanent basis you know once they 've got that information then we can make the assessment about putting something in place which then enables the chlorination to go while we maintain UA program of bringing the wellhere 's above ground because that seems to me to be call critical to the effective running of the infrastructure so it is a major infrastructure question but we 're going to be getting the external advisory groups report this afternoon and that really has identified how cool critic orders that we have a far more detailed approach to the governance of our capital program and that may require a committee that 's focused 100% on our capital program as a whole instead of the separation across different committees so there 's there 's quite a lot of as I say water to go under the bridge but I think David 's right the next report will have a lot more of a strategic feel to it thinking Merrill task force because we need to lift this up out of the out of the ground like the world needs and we need to really focus on how do we make sure that we continue to deliver our pristine water to the households of Christchurch without having to chlorinator because that 's got to be a focus for who we are as a city yeah and I agree the chlorination piece is important but it is not the most important piece so I just don 't want the goalposts to keep shifting every time we have a report on this would set the goal posts at the beginning like what are the outcomes we 're looking for yeah and then drive but the goal posts shifted when Peter changed its approach or we 're not reported finally on the well heads that had inspected so that shifted the goal post and then the golf post goal post was shifted again when the approach that was adopted by City Kia was determined to be and sufficient to meet the standard as it has now being applied even that 's is why I want to kind of hold things until we 've got that report and we 've got the government 's feedback from from the inquiry but anyway I 've got Yanni Vicki Phil I 've read through the bicker report it 's quite hard to read it electronically and I don 't know if there 's a hard copy that we can have access to because you can 't follow the pages because the way it 's laid out and it 's very small print but um there doesn 't seem to be when we 've had briefings on us you 've identified the map that shows where we 've got above-ground that doesn 't need temporary chlorination and you 've showed ones that are above ground that we 'll need it and you know there was three or four areas I think that possibly with a little bit of work wouldn 't need temporary chlorination but there 's no sense in this report about what works being done or knows so we 've got a very generic resolution to proceed with the delivery of works but can I think last week or the week before around the ones that I 'm aware of which were even had antennae I 've read through the information and hear about tenor there 's no mention of it in the report can you just talk us through what you 're doing around individual work the individual wealth heads to get temporary chlorination out of where it could be a relatively low easy solution we 've gone through the pump stations that we can run with only above-ground well heads have been the priority and so we 've got the well it 's declared secured by the drinking water Assessor because they are the person that has that authorization we are also got a program of going through every other above-ground wealthy and get them signed off as secure so that we 've got a suite of sign offs ready to go as soon as we know there may be some well hints there oh sorry some pump stations that might have two above-ground well needs and one below for example where we may get enough demand from those may be able can turn off the below ground why we fix it and those are some of the things of the multi analysis criteria that the teams working to in the next couple of days to see what do we need one of the real problems and you will see that in the northwest reporters sometimes you go deep the deeper aquifers aren 't as good quantity wise far better quality was and secure wise but quantity wise they don 't match what you can get out of the high or the the lists tip so sometimes we have to replace one ball with two balls when you go deeper just to get that flow so those are all things that the team 's looking at but they are looking at the priority the idea is to well we 've got all chlorination running by the end of all temporary chlorination running by the end of this month we intend as we get secured status sign off from the drinking water or scizor that we then aggressively turn that chlorination off I understand that but you know from two weeks ago when I don 't have any sense of the work that 's been done around those ones is that there 's no information on tenor in this report and yet that was one that you identified in the briefing to us that was above-ground that didn 't there were certain things that I think you know that now that and again it 's a bit like the previous question as the goalposts have now shifted again and there 's extra work that needs to be done on it because I 'm signed off quite beakers at this point in time and so we are doing that and as we 've mentioned we are getting that peer reviewed so that we can work through that in the meantime we 've like I say put a contract together for UV we 've looked at that we 've got people doing a water model so that we can work out on what are the in dependencies around the different pump stations are different well here 's we are looking at what can we do around demand management because again as we mentioned to you our water even days for sprinkling for example so those are all things that staff are working on at this point in time they are looking at the supply chain what is available through and I think we 've mentioned it to you of using our panels to get all that and those are all the pieces that we 're going to pull together the questions been asked and answered it 's absolutely clear they 've got clear direction to move ahead and shut off the chlorination whenever they can get a pump station completely cleared because of all the well heads that are feeding into that pump station by the drinking water Assessor they can 't work faster than the sign-off process so your questions been asked and answered I 'd like to move on now can thank you can I just do it I 'd like to move on now because you 've asked your question and it 's been answered Vicky who answered I 've had a chance to ask lots of questions but intriguingly as this becomes more and more public there are a lot more the difference between head lock north in Christchurch City we put up a report when the the first report came out from have Rob north explaining the different management structures we had in place a different monitoring a different regime across the difference and the catchment areas that we put up now look I 'm sorry I can 't remember the detail of their report but look can we get that report we actually perhaps put on the council website on on on the peps on the Newsline site so that councillors can link to it because I 'm crystal clear that there is an enormous difference between Christchurch and Havelock North ones of rural constituency that has had the ingress of contamination from a nearby stream that was contaminated from the agricultural sector this is not this is a city water supply we we test every single day so you know it 's I mean thank you for raising that as it 's an excellent question but I would really like and I 'm looking over to the to the terrassa and the team over there a summarize of people can read it if they want to yeah thank you your second question an advocate who statement that chlorine is the biggest advancement in the 21st century and cats controlling water and clearly has a clear agenda around it and has a toe and has also been quoted as saying he 's a total objection to any city having its exemption and they had like north after they have up north of authority so his statements about the 1850 private boards could you just explain how the private boards actually linked into the two if you have a look at what came out of Havelock North their recommendations not only to district and City Council 's here as recommendations to the Ministry of Health there was two local CEC hp 's but also two regional councils now those bores are controlled really by the Regional Council we do work in partnership with the Regional Council we 've got a joint where natural fact I 'm just trying to think of what it 's called a joint reference water reference book that incorporates all of the local authorities in Canterbury right regulatory raising the right irregular to regime ensure that you do we you can protecting those resources as as is needed as you can see there are a huge number of boss but a good example is we 've just recently put down a couple of bores for heat exchangers one for the library or two for the library really and two for the town hall and they have gone down to the appropriate standards that I said today I think within the report we 've said there 's a couple that have been put down to that standard into deep bores that now are not going to be used for heat and they could be actually used they are a good investment they may be able to be used for drinking water so that shows the standard that some of those goes down so anything I don 't know the numbers I 'm sorry I 've I haven 't counted the numbers I can get it you can get a map of Canterbury maps that go down certainly we 've got five or six aquifers under here and issue and we put down multiple balls on similar sites you do them in such a way that you make sure you try to make sure that the flows from each one of them don 't interfere with the flows from others sealed so that you can get surface water tracking down the outside of the board and to the airport we 're taking water problem if we successful in doing that we have a secure wellhead the issue with the unregulated wells in close proximity is if water is drawn from our well which can create a kind of depression then the aquifer surface would have made track down an unregulated well casing Elsevier said though we monitor our water sources we in actual fact have never had a transgression in our water says for the last hundred years and so the risk while it may be there is not being materialized in any of our networks and while the mere says we monitor daily we actually monitor in multiple places right across the network we don 't only monitor our water sources we also monitor our circulation network what you see the that the standards for private boars and permitted by again exactly the same as what we would expect for ours I don 't believe so because our was governed by the drinking water standards one so that we are putting down and I know the ones that we 're putting down for heat exchangers meet exactly our standards other ones and you know causing me some concern about just so how do we ensure that those private wells for example or private pools actually if they use constructed and used in the same way as we would expect if they could even remotely and I appreciate it 's completely remote have an impact on our drinking water that 's part of the working party that we 're working with II Ken and that 's part of the recommendations that come out of the Havelock North around the responsibility of regional councils to ensure that those are appropriate regulated and appropriately considered if you can 't take an action on it I don 't know be a question that would have to go to weekend so I that we can do better than that I think we can eat them too yeah yeah no but we can actually have a we can invite them to provide some information for the next report but I 'm happy for that to be included and in the resolution but I mean you 've just alerted me to comments that this under Virgil has made I guess but but it 's but it 's we need to remove the ability of water suppliers to supply uncorrelated water we need to remove political interference from water supply we need to give strong regulator to give a strong regulator teeth to an sure that compliance with the standards is better than all practical steps he doesn 't believe that we should ever have uncorrelated water no absolutely and that so if you research it further not only does he believe that chlorine is the best thing ever the biggest advancement in the 21st century everybody should have chlorinated water and he does not want elected councils controlling water he 's actually says why should people who are elected every three years have any it 's obviously far better in his view that some controller from Auckland so but why wasn 't that reported in the paper this morning with those comments because okay well I found them now I only only looked up his name on the internet to find out who he worked for yes all right coming back to there are three issues around secure water supplies and I think there is the wellheads which is why we 've lost our secure which we are doing the work on the money there is some modeling of also the the geological modeling that was done in 205 and we are working through the through that with the drinking water Assessors at the moment and the third pointers around monitoring looking at variations and aging things and so those are the three things now probably councillor buck when the hydro geological model comes through that will actually address the kind of issues that you are raising I 'm not sure but I think that 's probably still 12 months away and that some of the sampling especially the aging of water and we age just the average age of the water it can somehow tell you the percentage of young water and the percentage of old water and so it 's quite complicated but I think one of those tests takes something like six months just to perform we have to do that on all of our wells and so that seemed motionless yeah okay so I had I had Glenn Deon well thank you my question we talked about New Zealand standards David obviously in the World Health Organization guidelines it says chlorine disinfection of drinking water has limitations against the protease and pathogens in particular Cryptosporidium and some viruses the outbreak and headlock North was Campylobacter if you look at both words the symptoms seem the same in terms of effects on the population so pouring is no guarantee of you know is a barrier is a barrier there 's no doubt about that but does need a contact time if it 's actually in contact with preserve for a long period of time it does have an effect on them but basically that 's a long detention time and we in there and so that 's why some of the you know one of the great things about UV is it does take preserve but when I say that we have never and I don 't believe there 's been a record of any protozoa and deep groundwater recorded as according to our people so basically it 's a a risk that is very infant issome el it 's a little bit like unfortunately if there if something went wrong those consequences could be big Norman normally you would attempt to have a of chlorine contact time in the order of 30 minutes because of the risk the low risk regarding proton Dylan my question is around the the amount of or the implementation of the preferred option yeah and because this is a public document it says here that it 's 15 to 20 well hits per year we 've got to do 80 I just want to explicitly I mean that would assume it would take four years to above-ground the wall I just want us to to be very I mean I just wanted you to explain resolution that we have around 12 months and the exact work that you 're thinking might be done to sort of you know mitigate that in the report it talks about that was what I 'm going to take the P I you I think counsel it 's really important that councils recognized the need to upgrade and they 've actually had a progressive program of upgrading the but and below to above ground and this been going on for almost a decade now so you 've been doing it those timeframes is if we continued BAU we 've business as usual basically if you have a look we have reported back to you that we 've got construction panels in place which means that we can secure quicker we can actually get people in there quicker once we know what we want to buy and that 's the real issue about what do we want to buy my understanding is the timetable was probably or the difficulty in timetable was probably not around the supply chain it 's more around the inter dependability of our pump stations in our impact on our timeline but until we know exactly what we want to do what could we do what could we do by just taking can we just take one well hit on a pump station offline have one of the others will go out take the whole pump station down do I have to take it down for one day or can I you know do everything and then take it down for one day or do I have to take it out for three months those are the things that the people are the team is looking at all those probabilities so that was some timeframes if you going to do a one approach in principle and the other the other point in the report that 's written here that it 's out in the public as the five percent which might be a requirement to you know for the water loss and in 2015-2016 we 're at eleven point seven percent I just wanted to just explain the work that 's going on to reduce our water loss but also to answer what was the water loss we have any transgressions in the water supply because of the increased water loss from the breakages that we obviously had after the earthquake post the earthquake I think that we close to something over twenty and this Goodwyn through a program of returning the water loss at a point of time to the the comment regarding five percent is something that I think is what is being achieved in the northern hemisphere where they have a none chlorinated supply and that is one of the KPIs to maintain to continue with that just can you can sorry just one subsequent question that so you after the earthquake we went up to around 20 percent and we didn 't have any of the transgressions in the water supply that are potentially and you know one of the issues that may come through probably around gross breaking of the pipes brittle brittle pipes which is why what led to the tea nation at that time and to boil water notices for a period but after we fix those none none okay I think two things so in your LTP you have you have put in quite a significant amount of investment you put more investment as a percentage wise into your network of water pipes and any of your other networks because it 's been recognized as a priority to look at that unaccounted for water as previously mentioned we do use a lot of water in Christchurch but we 're coming up to the adjournment at 12 o 'clock so I 'm going to suggest that we are June and come back at 30 which is half an hour prior to the EAG turning up at 2 o 'clock so that 'll be enough time to conclude this paper so so we 've got two more minutes so Pauline the regulatory standards yep and we haven 't already wired yeah so okay so nine continue to work with central government in relation to the headlock north for quite enquiry is that what you mean well they haven 't made their announcement about what they 're doing it so continue to work with central government in relation to the findings of the headlock north enquiry David did you have a question trying to do is a citywide approach to do it so we can incorporate that into our male reporter am i all right okay so so yep do I have a seconder Phil all right so I 'll adjourn the meeting until 30 and we 'll come back for for the debate I would like people to read the that the newspaper article from mr. rabbits and the New Zealand Herald on the 8th of December where he does suggest that this is about me not wanting to chlorinate the water and I shouldn 't be allowed to be influencing the decision at all I know he specifically names me I 'll send it to you thank you _"

    "text": "item 16 heritage Street Cambridge tariff Balfour Terrace and East frame traffic controls and pauline if you can again introduce this item for us thank you roadways suggesting that the bike traveling west across the European Street Bridge have an easier access onto the she 'd footpath of their tuning step onto and the other thing was so started they will address bit and the other thing was that will be losing his provision for taxis on the bridge but staff for working with Oh taco for temporary taxi provision which will be he referred in Oxford Terrace area around there and looking at more permanent solutions we needed later on and the other thing is actually started really proud of this but the language going through the East frame near the Rodya is going to have one mobility Park for every block they wants to move this thank you are there any questions on this Yanni yeah of the works to do that section of kill Wall Street ahead of the tunnel and so many of the works my understanding is that regenerate are currently reviewing the accessible city were expected from it have been delivered and I 'm just trying to understand if we know what the timeframe is for us to get that review reported to us because we 're being asked to make these individual decisions now sorry are they reviewing the Kindle 3 recovery plan rather than the accessible city we were told the other day that they included the accessible city plan I would imagine that would include the accessible city had a program business case were developed for it accessible city is the transport chapter of the we plan this of course if the recovery plan itself is being reviewed then its transport chapter and so still be an issue therefore whether accessible city in its current form in its current order is still best placed to deliver the transport elements for a recovery the second question was in regards to we 're being asked to approve some resolutions around the Metro sports facility and there 's I don 't know is it are we able to make mention of you know not specifically what 's happening but the Metro sports facility report needs to be public excluded so so I 'm just concerned that you know at the moment saying the minister and council are reviewing the Metro Sports we haven 't had that decision but we 're now being asked to make a decision on some of the transport layout where we might come up with a different scenario depending on you know whatever it 's gonna happen but we haven 't heard that information yet perhaps that section of Belvoir Terrace is a new section of road business premises that previously did not have access from Stewart Street to access the Stewart Street direction so in fact the resolutions before Council this morning months ago those two parking spaces are there on the street this resolution merely enables those to be enforced and as that the main is that one of the key entrance ways into Metro sports into the car park no it the other section of Balfour tennis from the east was subject to a road stopping although which council approved and so that is within the metro sports site and so with stopping that road to those of road from Stewart Street that services those premises so this resolution before council this morning is merely to enable council to enforce the parking spaces on that new section of street right so it 's gonna be clear if we wanted a multi-story car parking building built at the Metro sports facility that wouldn 't change this stretch of road that weaving asked to make a decision on thank you deal you 'd indicated you want to ask question no no question anything and you 've cleared the questions on this report Jamie yeah just around the the here Hood Street one and took you the bridge so that the taxi rank is going to go on originally it from what I gather in the diagrams there so you 've got six new bars of open up in the city 's major hospitality precinct six or seven more to come we do Texas go because it 's pretty important yeah we 're you didn 't know you didn 't you see that they were going to come up with something okay so I question that Jamie zest is also 't_''_419.37 I mean Pauline thanks for your comments in your opening statements around this report I am quite keen to know what the result for taxis could look like might look like what the thinking is great Harry hood Street Terrace intersection so the resolutions before council this morning include the intersection of Oxford Terrace with every good Street council scheme would then pick up those works for moxford Terrace and run through to Manchester Street effectively so council will be consulting over the details of that shortly but early consultation over the scheme designed for Herefords Street which are quite well advanced with frontage premises there and land owners and businesses there provisionally at the moment is proposing six Northside on public service fee record space what used to be known as taxis on the north side of the street there between 8 p.m. 8 a.m. and a further three taxi stands on the south side between 00 p.m. and 00 a.m. so that in when workability earth no.1 Herefords Street so when that work is finished as part of councillors plan in fact there would be more passenger actually at the moment so I don 't understand what 's the south side of here if it 's Street because it runs east to west yeah near either the food premises are on there at the moment so so as I say just repeat 6 proposed at the moment on the north side of Herefords Street a further three on the south side and so the feedback I understand our colleagues have happened scissors and the taxi Federation 's that they 're happy with that level of provision okay what we are talking to our Tucker I was the chair of committee said earlier is about what we do ahead of those Herefords Street works taking place once the work start on every third Street Bridge itself and we are now looking actively where we can temporarily accommodate taxis in the general okay that 's helpful the the only thing so is there will it be the visitor that could be confusing with time limits for different areas though because the thing having a taxi stand as a taxi stand is quite helpful for people but if some of you know during night time but even during the daytime there 's no longer it takes extend is that could that be confusing we already have a number of time limited taxi stands around the city there 's one on Litchfield Street for instance outside the bus interchange which also doubles up there 's a servicing bank during the early morning yes of course when some of these changes take place they take a little time to settle in but in a way one of the benefits of traffic resolutions in this way is that we have the flexibility that comes with amending the operation of these individual streets to ensure they continue to provide best balance and in each one of these places it is a really fine balance between the needs of servicing mobility parking taxi ranks and the overall they get rid of the street scoping things for specifics on there and if the business owners as you say are happy there then that sounds like a tunnel and they will get a further opportunity to make a detailed submission on that when we consult over that councilor well thanks and what one more question that one name is gives you and it 's just around the signage the no write the note earnings into Oxford from he referred but there 's more no turning signs and there are bars and it 's a lot of a sphere is that is that over Kilauea and so is that always been the planet I always from my recollection I thought that dr. Terrace was seen as a shared space not a no-go yes the the the signage there is to enable Oxford Terrace to operate one way in a southbound direction it also accommodates the travel of course coming across there and so parts of the signals are directly associated with the safety of the tram moving across the street there the intention of Oxford Terrace is to permit legitimate servicing and loading to those bars and premises there outside the peak pedestrian hours but my understanding is there 's really good agreement with the cafe and bar owners there that for that to work really well during the times of the day and evening that lots of through there is an absolute desirable objective so again the balance struck there is early morning light so has there been a change because that sort of it 's kind of been used to me a wee bit throughout the whole is this was anything I 've seen it is you know that European shared space Starlin now when I saw this document it was know to and accepted authorized vehicles which was slightly different than how I 'd always and visited it buying out not really when the tram extension was resolved through there just before the earthquakes on that section of Oxford Terrace operated in the opposite direction so it was one boy northbound there you could access it from Litchfield Street so there even at that time it was envisaged that it would be one-way southbound only my question is so much around the direction of traffic so it 's more just around the banning of particular vehicles yeah I mean my understanding is that the premises there are actually very supportive of that being at largely pedestrian zone providing that they can get access to service and just just finally is as far as how I 'm reading this is that this is really the beginning of the process there 's going to be a wider conversation with with people around this so we can we can see how okay thanks thank you Tim and then deal Tim thank you just just to clarify your comment before about the long term planets so that the Texas teens moving into here for both north and south sides there 's no money currently in the budget and they no money for that work to do to sit those two stands up both on the south and north side of here of it Street will be as an application for and into the long term plan for that funding Street I was merely saying that the detailed proposal as to where the taxi stands would go would be part of the consultation over the heritage streetscape so it 's already in scheming there in terms of draft design we would expect to be going to formal consultation over that with councils agreement in the next few months and at member of the community to make comment on the detail of that draft design and at the moment the draft design includes proposals for that number of taxi stands so there 's no question about the funding that is already on board as long as the Herford Street scheme stays within the long-term plan program which he features in at the moment then there is no intrinsic question over the funding how would it fall out of the long-term plan because I mean the Freak gonna move the Texas stands off the bridge if you can 't_''_943.82 wait ten years to put Texas things and Kenya if council make the decision to remove the heritage streets already on schedule on budget well it 's not part of the long-term plan sure it 's part of the current long campaign but given what we 've just heard of course staff would be providing advice around the taxi stands and other features if we were to think of making that decision we would be receiving some advice on what the implications of it were if indeed anybody was to to propose that from the long-term plan because it takes a stance of already who are being removed so therefore that be yeah yeah I mean that 's the debate we would have if anybody were to move that we did remove this from the LTP and I 'd suggest it 's unlikely to happen it 's being made to remove those so that the decisions already been made yes the city there and then there are things that flow on from there and which of that piece of work was been referred to in the LTP hair of the street piece yep deal I just had a quick question about the east frame traffic controls why has it always been the intention to have parking and in the in the East frame [Music] shared space north-south Street and so there was always in village there would be some limited parking in servicing lane way of course it 's because it 's adjacent to the again it 's a balance between delivering a good pedestrian cycling and walking environment but actually there are also north-south dedicated lanes so in our view some limited space street with that and we 're very pleased spaces yeah I understand that but the question that I have is we 've taken all the parking off what 's the street Gloucester straight Herefords Street what most of them up here if it 's true all of it off casual street and made those streets no parking at all which are streets and then in the park and the in the actual park and the youth frame would put car parking in there and we 're putting 12 signs in what we 've just been 32 million dollars on making a really nice park so there 's a bit of overload of signs if it 's a bit of like I think it 's been backwards actually we shouldn 't lift the parking on the streets and actually had them head there the park was it 's you know she had way but why do we need parking there and not in street the the changes to the parking on each cross east-west streets is primarily been around visibility and and turning traffic way in and out from those has been initially to remove the parking from them and then add parking back in commensurate with maintaining safe intersections between that laneway and the streets so it 's it 's not been a case of removing parking from the west streets just as a point of principle it 's been moved where that laneway meets those strings to ensure that drivers can join and leave that laying way in a safe fashion so some parking has been removed yes close to that Lane way it really doesn 't make sense let me let me explain you 've got one two three four five six six car parks and one mobility Park and a couple of scooter parks in the lane one in each in each section of the lane way it on Castle Street you 've got no parking and you 've got several hundred meters of uninvaded space after and before the the intersections which if you actually thought about putting parking several hundred meters you could put a get twice as much parking space I mean I accept that you know servicing them so service service spaces like that that 's happening there but I think you know just for we 've spent thirty two million dollars to make a great park and we 're putting parking back in there and we 've taken it off the actual streets where people wouldn 't normally assume they 're compact and also it also supports the residential developments they 'll go through there as well so twelve spaces so say you 've residual properties being built along there we 're sort of this this parking to our paid parking and despite those residential were having you know they should have been on the street streets for parking I suppose if you want to do that they 've got off street parking as well I 'm not going to get anywhere with this so let 's go leave it okay thank you Jonnie location question on the concerns that Dion 's raised is there any reason why or anything that would prevent those parks that were putting it in the liens being turned into residents only car parking for the housing that 's going on we wouldn 't wish them that and they maintain and enforce that we avoid a situation where council is managing parking so what happens as residents come to us like we had it with high power apartments for example where the developer goes and changes into a residential use the reason it 's come to the community board and say we 've got no parking can we have a residence parking permit so there 's so there 's a policy that enables the individual not the developer to come for these ones that we 've we 're doing with there 's no the policy wouldn 't justify that or it wouldn 't allow for it or it 's still a decision that the board will have to make he 's from if they felt parking was essential to their needs associated with that dwelling then I guess they would make their own decision as to whether the amount of parking the developer was able to guarantee them with those premises was was gonna meet their needs or not it the old street parking is is a facility that council manages all of the community and decision for an individual person choosing to purchase a property that sorry I just I 'm not being clear enough um the local community board approves Rison 's only parking on on street parking where residents don 't have access to two-car parking off straight I 'm just trying to understand whether anything in that policy if we put these certain these on street parks would enable the then the new unit owners to come along at a later stage and say we you know even though they 've bought them knowing that there 's no off street parking coming to a community Ward saying well I need parking so can have a resonance parking approval so the current policy the policy you 're referring to is really to support these people who have no access to to have any off street parking on their property so so the examples are often when it may be applied it would be around the old workers colleges which the bill brought to the front of the property and boundary to boundary and so the current community of the land and to Austrey reasons parking not for their property but for that area so anybody that could apply for him we generally don 't provide reasons parking where people have the opportunity to either park off street or developer park off street so they might have some room beside their their building where they should be able to drive onto the onto their property so it 's the I guess how we sort of work that thank you so I 'm Pauline you 'd indicated you were happy to move this do I have a seconder for this place Mike great thank you any debate Yani um can I just ask that you put the resolutions in regarding here if it 's straight Supra just to record opposition to that as per the attachment H or whether it 's a bitter way of doing it just to speak to hear if it 's straight a bit like kill more straight this is the absolute worst place you can put a cycle lane on straight through that inner city if anyone 's driven through here if it 's straight at the moment with I its being developed between Columbo in this corner like the buses that come in for the hotel the delivery vehicles for the fast-food outlets their cars are returning to park people crossing the street this is has to be one of the worst places to put an on street cycle lane and yet here we 're doing it on a bridge which will have huge queuing tract issues again if you go back to the accessible or the inaccessible city planners I like to call it it 's taking away access through the Central City on a number of key streets like Gloucester possibly armored possibly Litchfield and casual with the stadium Herefords Strait is going to be one of the main thoroughfares from the east to the west of the city or the west to the east so putting an on Street cycle lane when you 're gonna have a huge muddle of heavy vehicles private vehicles pedestrians to me just seems like the worst possible design so I think the cycleway should be off street so that it 's safe and I totally concur with a comment that that are safe and I cannot see in this design particularly over the bridge with the number of traffic that 's going to be using it and types of traffic how this is going to be for for anyone so I won 't support the hair for the straight one I think the others are mainly you know a lot of the works being done I do share the concern around the private lanes but given that there 's a lack of on street parking because of those other changes I think it 's good to have that on street parking I think at some stage we should get that residence policy reviewed certainly you know I would hate to see it opportunity where local reasons who buy these properties knowing there 's no off street parking able to then come to council and get us to turn these on street parks into private residential parks I can understand the historic need for it but you know this is a brand new development that has no off street parking and I 'd hate to be able to see a loophole really against the Herford street design think it 's crazy the cycleway should be off street not on strip thank you dealing could you also put the the east frame separately as well because I 'm going to intend to vote against that because I really don 't think I think I think the whole thing is actually back to front we took all the parking off the street and then we go and try and put it into a park I think it 's I just think it 's backwards and also putting 12 signs in each of those blocks so there 's 48 signs because there 's four blocks coming into the East frame I think is just silly and and they 're also parking restrictions are 120 minutes paid even on Sundays and the weekends we 're lacking parking in the city for people just occasionally come into the city during the weekends and you know I think people one of the things that people complain to me the most well not the most but a lot is that they have to pay for parking on Sundays a walk around check things out and stuff like that so I won 't vote for that and also here if it 's Street if you 've ever been to sort of the strip and that part of the city at night it 's chaos the parking around here especially for taxis is chaos so I 'll be voting against it as well because I don 't think moving them up here if it 's Street is the answer I actually think the answer is actually a shirred way around on the bridge where taxes are going to naturally be and actually naturally where patrons can go I think that 's I think we 're trying to design a city more in some of some instances design some of these parking solutions because it 's what the engineers say but actually is it what people were going to do and actually naturally use and I think there 's a you know a good book that I 've read by jean girl was you know follow the sightlines will follow the lines of where people are walking and then design the people naturally are going to are moving backwards and forwards because of this the activities on either side of the other and that seemed to be a logical place to actually fix it and actually make it better and the other thing is the cycle way along here the cycle way you stop at the intersection for the cycle cyclists but when you 're actually going to a shared path anyway so there 's the connection between the shared path on Durham Street and the cycle way on here a food street is actually not working I don 't think it works that well because you stop the year and then you all of a sudden going into the into a shared way we 're actually the whole thing could be a sheared way but this I just think there 's there 's a lot more work that should be done here and actually looking at how people are starting to use that part of the city thank you so I 'm just to confirm I can put the horrific street resolution separately and I can put the East frame of me here so now we 've got an Pauline and Mike 's are pulling or might you want to go first and then Pauline you can wrap up yep think we 're actually designing our city for people and it 's a little bit frustrating when I hear some of the comments because I just don 't think some people get what we 're trying to to achieve you know when we look at this area of here of the street there 's actually high pedestrian use so I don 't know where you 'd want to put the cyclists you know if you put them in with the distance there 's gonna be conflict there it 's actually a slow zone it 's 30 case having a cycle lane is actually very important to get cyclists you know it 's like with some safety you know ideally you 'd love to have cyfle waves all over the place but it isn 't going to happen so what we need to do is go down to the next step and actually put in a cycle lane I just don say oh we shouldn 't be put in cycle lanes in it in our streets we should just actually just let the cars take control that is just going backwards actually we want to design our streets for every person that needs to use them whether they are walking whether they are cycling whether they 're in a vehicle and that 's what we 've been doing and listen to this conversation about actually oh no we shouldn 't have a cycle lane on the straightest it 's ridiculous it 's absolutely revolting it 's time it 's time we actually look forward look to the next generations look where we 're heading you know this city is going to keep going and going and going we know by 2040 there 's going to be simply says an additional vehicle movements within our CBD you know we can 't just lead cars dominate our city we have to encourage other use of transport and that needs to be around public transport bikes and walking we need to make sure that those people that choose to cycle and choose to walk were put it in there because I believe as our city grows there 's going to be a lot of conflict between cyclists and pedestrians so that 's why we actually need to do as many cycle lanes as possible where we can to actually separate every mode of transport I support this I support this upset we we 've already had comment about how the cycle and stops and there 's this year pain shared path right there that 's already been discussed right the very start of this item it 's been acknowledged and will be be sorted but this city is actually going to be really really good once we get through the roadworks and we just simply fighting it all the way to the end just actually ever look what we 've done and what we 're achieving actually start celebrating our successes Thank You Aaron okay so they 're just on this a couple of things I want to to just go over one is I don 't support the removal of the on street car parks on here foot street I agree FD on actually Cambridge Terrace there but it feels like down and when you come along this cycling and as a pedestrian that works really well so why that doesn 't swing around the corner makes no sense actually got a really good vibe about it and I agree with Mike on that that some of those finished bits are really really good there is a lot of on street parking here that 's been removed that 's very heavily used and the thing that is being missed in use theros a lot of inner city car parks and a lot more in parking buildings my problem around that is what the council 's not addressed or looked at is there 's a lot of our population who have a real reluctance to use a parking building and this will be psychological and it comes from the earthquakes because a lot of parking buildings post-quake were shut people 's vehicles were locked in for days weeks and months some of the parking buildings collapsed people have a fear of that using parking buildings and this is a genuine fear that does exist that feedback from some people that they just don 't like parking buildings they have a genuine fear and we can tell them there are safe as they want but fears exist for a reason just like people are scared of sharks more people are killed in New Zealand every year by cows then our by sharks but you don 't see my making a scary cow movie and the meat comes out in a few weeks yeah that is a good one now it 's made cows sometimes now my other one is around the East frame and the disability car parks there yes there is one inside each block but the goal that I was trying to push this council towards was that we had one disability car park per block meaning on the street which is this design here is 8 of that because you 've got four streets that go around and if there 's one car park on each side that would be x times 8 not the one per block and if we 're to have a successful in a city and I know the big ones like Paris New York or San Francisco but we compare ourselves to Portland at times and some of our staff have looked at Portland Portland has a population of just over 4,000 people per square kilometer and stirred am another one of our favorites is four and a half thousand per square kilometer Christchurch is two hundred and forty-one per square kilometer and we look at those cities in their designs and we 're applying that to a city that 's just completely different we don 't have a city anything like this and so if we want to have a successful inner city we 're got to stop blocking people out and changing our designs to something that we 're not currently so that I just can 't_''_2212.47 can 't support this I haven 't had any feedback saying take away car parking it 's all thank you and Pauline back to you to wrap up Oh Glen sorry yes and I did have you on my list so we 'll come to Glen and then we 'll go to Paul Glen Jamie and then Pauline I support cycle ways and cycle lanes there 's no problem there I just feel though that every time parking is taken away it starts to buy into a narrative that the council is coming down hard on people in cars and I 'm not sure that that 's actually what we 're saying we 're promoting cycling but we 're not coming down some people need or a lot of people still need cars and so what I 'm trying to say is we need we I think we need to more take the community with us I have a question over whether we 're starting to get a bit dogmatic over the promotion of our cycle ways and cycle lanes and our planning to the point that it 's just getting people 's backs up so I just wanna say look let 's just try and find a reasonable line this doesn 't look too bad to me but I think in all our cycle ways in Lane planning going forward we just need to keep listening to the community we might think we know the right way great but we 've got to take people with us we can 't you know just give it the remember there 's a lot at stake for the council at the moment and the wider council narratives so just is just go easy with the community Thanks okay so Jamie Sarah and then back to Pauline Jamie okay I 'll keep this brief I 'm fine with the East frame treatment but I 'm really voting against the to hear if it Oxford portions of you put it separately it would be most appreciated a few of those reasons why is really the taxi congregation I think they do tend to congregate on the bridge because it makes sense it 's intuitive and I think we can tell people what to do or we like but if it 's not intuitive then I think it will be problematic it 's a convenient access point and drop-off point for the Terrace bnz and centre the farmers market and I think people want to go there because it would like to be dropped off he just because it does make sense so going to go somewhere else where they probably might not feel as comfortable being dropped off there will be problematic the other the other aspect of it is and it 's a theme that 's come up many times which is just trying to do too much in one street and that 's what I feel we 're doing again with her of the street here you 've got the buses you 've got a cycle cyclists you 've got pedestrians you 've got private cars I just don 't think that and that you need to the street needs to be a you know jack of all trades master of none I think that you should put different roads for different things you 've got a South frame which runs east to west where I think would be far more logical to have sprawling cycle ways down I 'm here if it 's straight way too much going on and with the amount of development that has gone on there with Terra 's being completed being said Center is completed ANZ completed it 's just gonna be overload and the good development has happened around there and finally the overload of the signage I just think that it 's like redoing confusion corner down outside c1 again so I just I just think it looks ridiculous and it 's confusing to look at it and we confusing forum for residents so the here of it Oxford and section there looks utterly and accessible so I won 't be supporting it Sarah and then back to Pauline Sarah thank you the central city was dying well before the earthquakes and if we simply go back to the old way and ignore all of the International and national evidence in future generations are going to look back at us and say what the hell were you thinking we are rebuilding for the future we are rebuilding a city that is going to be shared it 's gonna be electric it 's going to be low carbon and it 's going to be sustainable we need to think big picture we need to look at how all of these connect and with other parts of the city and we need to get like us we 're embracing no choice so we what we do is when we 've got any Street that we 're renewing war making changes to we must put a provision for people who are cycling down there to be safe it 's not a it 's not a cycle way it 's not a see Fred it 's like the way we 've got to be if we don 't mix those two things up but it 's providing a safe lane for cyclists to be able to cycle around the city and and we are designing a city for the future I hope that councillor johansson decides to support that because otherwise you 're asking cyclists to cycle dangerously on a road that they may choose to cycle on and they have every right to choose to cycle down their Street and I hope they do so I think the me had put me off who knows and so I know we are building a city for the future was modal choice we need to keep people safe um also I don 't see any issue with a couple of steps away I 'm here for the street they 're gonna be walking or stumbling around there and they 'll find the taxi I don 't think that 's a big issue I think the bridge is gonna work really well and as I said we have addressed the issue of getting onto the Cambridge Terrace she 'd the cycleway the deal and so all in all and I think this will be a good outcome all right so this has been moved and seconded I 've been asked to put some resolution separately so I 'll put Herefords Street separately first which is items 1 to 11 and 26 to 29 so Herefords Street all those in favor say aye right against No can we have that recorded place so the the nose can you just raise your hands please so that 's councillors you 're hence and Kym swigs Gulf and East and manji against so that 's carried and then I 'll be nice to put the East frame separately which is resolutions 37 249 so on the East frame all those in favor against and then the remaining resolutions all those in favor please say aye against that 's carried thank you very much now the mayor is waiting so I 'll vacate the chair so man can take over and we 'll move on _"

    "text": "so now moving on to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee items item 14 we 'll come back to once the mayor has arrived item 15 an accessible city Kilmore street colombo to durham and town hall pauline would you like to introduce this item please wanting to be done obviously in time for the Town Hall really completed by July 2018 the has been consulted on and the main changes of course loss of parking came up and started additional spaces and of course mobility parking came up we had a deputation at the attacking subcommittee meeting last week as well so there is one mobility impact to read me outside the town hall and is planned to be at least the intersection median Colombo and kilmore one on each side the parking subcommittee requested staff look at putting two on each side the one on the eastern one on the west and that 's within a hundred meter walk of the Town Hall and we 've also our staff to look at the possibility of putting another mobility pack on the north side of Fillmore opposite the Town just having a look at there so those were the main students that have been addressed by staff and in the committee Thank You Pauline so I 've got some questions indicated from Dion Glen and Jonnie Dee are the issue will on Colombo Street the Hammond it goes down and it gets very narrow at the Colombo Street entrance in the other town hall for cyclists here 's that you know it was initially that we raised when we spoke but it betters part of this word we 're not doing that intersection at all okay so not part of this project Glen thank you notwithstanding their councils priority over promoting cycling and obviously building cycle ways how much consideration was given at both staff and committee level over the loss of the parking that used to be in the Crowne Plaza building so that you know obviously that was a major source of parking for events at the Town Hall but everyone 's on me yes we 're still working through a solution for parking in there in the city so with the new facilities also bill another it there is a potential for some maybe some parking yeah so generally we 'll look at do you know how many parks we did have in the Crown Plaza thank you Yanni and then Tim thank you I just wanted to check out the community water asked if we could get written confirmation from the emergency services over there feedback on the design have we got that we 've met with emergency services on this they 're happy with this design we haven 't actually got written writing back from them yet I 've written an email to them that haven 't had a response that would just the other thing that would ask her I think at the community board was a copy of the traffic signals plan which I haven 't seen I yell for the intersections in terms of traffic signals this comes out of the concern that if you look at two on straight high street if you look at a number of bridge of remembrance we 've seen a huge proliferation of traffic signal poles and paraphernalia and it was quite concerning in terms 've got arrows now in lanes where people can 't turn saying that you can turn on on the pole when the error on the ground is going straight ahead things like that just seemed really bizarre to me and I sir at the community board there was discussion around it would be really good to actually see what the signals plan was and the final question is um well this too but one is the heavy vehicle movements the number of submitters have raised concerns and again we haven 't seen submissions I don 't think has counts as having circulated the submissions okay but the heavy vehicle concern turning the way in which I think a number of the submitters have said that that concern that the traffic if there 's a major event on at the town hall will start queuing into the transport wave and over the cycleway so can you just hope we can understand at a high level how with model day the high traffic generation that will occur on the street space and in particular the conflict between heavy vehicles buses and trucks would have taken that into account I know that the build outs that are on the southern side of Kilmore Street near the Colombo Street intersection we 're taking account of the vehicle movements that could happen there and the fact that they could be queuing to come onto the loading zone and so that 's why the build outs were put there to give protections for cyclists so that vehicles wouldn 't be queuing up to go onto the loading area yeah I mean yeah I get yeah just um it was interesting going if you go to the KFC in East Gate and what you see is people get so busy people cube back into the traffic into the lane so traffic can 't actually move anymore because you can 't access it because there 's you know six cars or something so if we 've got major events on at the Town Hall and people are coming in to drop people off in taxis are coming in it just it really worries me that we haven 't actually got enough space particularly what 's the Peterborough development but you don 't have any concerns no intention of building there to drop off in any way to keep those vehicles by building that slipway effectively creates a space for people to drop okay thank you thank you Tim thank you I just you know like traffic management and terrific designers perfect science except for human beings so we all know that so and I 've done a few myself person management plans that humans are a different breed all together with regards to the plan on page two five one did you lose the comment that the part of Colombo Street is not part of this design so that too but they are interlinked so one would presume that you are talking to the other group that are doing that so kind of leading on from what 's being said already have there been discussions with the future operator of the Town Hall with regards to loading access to the book of James hey theater it has always been an issue at the Town Hall end but to get heavy vehicles on to enter that area I 'm does affect that corner in total we 've been we 've been discussing this with the project manager for the Town Hall refurbishment project about that access so the stall a loading zone at the back there comes off Colombo Street who doesn 't sufficient for one large people to get down so it 's no different than it was previously is but we 've been having a discussion before I can just to clarify that we have been speaking with otaku about the design for Colombo Street and the design for this intersection okay thank you thank you Jamie thanks just around the road with so looking at the page 250 one example I guess of the accessible city even I don 't think looks there well and it 's probably no surprise to anyone else of Street just purely comes to narrow I see that currently the the road with 3.8 meters four meters is that on the current layout and I see this is proposing going to three point two five can you just help give me a feel of how that compares to so near so but similar to what 's out here on Cambridge terrace there 's probably three point two fives all so let 's do three in places so it 's it 's it 's really this okay so you don 't visit that there 'll be the same sort of problems around the road width with this treatment is there wasn 't some acid the difference is that on sudesna Street you haven 't got adjacent cycle lanes each side of the three point two five meter wide lanes so that because they 're not separated they 're on road cycle lanes and you 've also got car parking downstairs of street where people can open the doors and hereit 's that 's not okay now thank you for that thank you Mike do you know what the width of the traffic lanes are on Fillmore Street because there 's obviously all been done recently is it it 's three point about three point two five hours as well yes so when that was done it was done as part of urks thank you so Pauline you 're happy to move this yep sure and it 'd be good if people indicate that they want to debate before we move straight into passing resolutions so Yanni you want to debate this plane yep Yanni Glen Erin Yanni okay be good if you could just ask if we did want to debate thank you but like you know I understand the need to get this straight I 'm just really concerned you know to me this is just like the inaccessible city all over again the road for the purpose of what it 's going to be used which has thousands of vehicle movements a week sometimes I guess if we 've got big events on at the Town Hall we 've got a massive development proposed right across the road which will have no doubt a huge traffic generation and not quite sure where that 's got to I cannot understand why we 've put cycle nominees through this part on the road we 've just heard the advice that the roads narrow but the cycle ways are attached and not separated so that if you know if it 's too narrow concerns me we 've just been you know well the government have spent a lot of money putting wider paths through Victoria Square it just seems to me that this is the case of we 're trying to do too much and have too many different types of activities on a street that is gonna be one of the busiest streets in the city because actually Gloucester streets now going to be closed for the convention centre are my streets got limitations with the tram and this street really is the destination Street in terms of getting in from the east into places like the Town Hall and other parts of the west of Colombo so I just am really concerned about this design you 've heard that I 've had a number of questions where we haven 't actually had the information through but fundamentally I think we do need to start thinking about the huge impact of heavy vehicles and traffic coming into town to help events happen buses etc and how that 's going to interact and you know I 'm just really concerned that this design with a limited Road corridor and it 's not going to serve the function for this area so I won 't support their recommendations today as much as I understand the need for this work to happen I don 't believe that this design is adequate and I have to say I will be really concerned if we get anywhere close to 15 to 20 traffic lights been put up on any of these two intersections that would just be really really sad Glen thank you I guess when it comes to the official opening of the townhall we want the headline to be grand opening of the townhall we don 't want opening beset by parking problems so the problem is there 's a wider context here part of which is the loss of the Crown Plaza building I can 't find the number of parks we had there or the public had access to there but it was a multi-level building I supports cycleways not everyone cycles particularly some some of our residents in the community so I 'd like to see a plan that 's gonna cater in time not only for the opening which isn 't that far away but going forward so I will support it but we do need a plan because what this whole thing to go really well Aaron yeah well I 'll start by saying that timing is right that the timing of getting this road finished prior to the opening of the town hall was perfect because it would be even worse if it not only there wasn 't parking but you could actually get through the roadworks to an event but that 's where my positives will stop on this one I looked at the maps I 'm just gonna highlight a couple of things the on the removal of on street car parks I mean but prior to this the inaccessible city designs that the there was a lot of on street parking in this area so the Town Hall people used to be able to park very close to the earth it was the ones Glenn mentioned next door in the building I think that was in the vicinity of a couple hundred just ballpark that the around the corner and Cambridge Terrace we had the opportunity in these designs to have at least a hundred on street car parks they could have been perpendicular because it 's just a slow through route they 're gone completely there 's I don 't think we have a mandate from the public to remove this amount of on street parking in the city I don 't recall us ever going out and I 've certainly had a lot of feedback over the amount of on street car parks being removed so I think we 're sniffing on their balance when it comes to that there 's a lack of mobility car parking I raised this all the time there 'll be one outside the Town Hall and two around the corner so if you 've got a concert you 've got three people with disabilities welcome at that event the rest of them will have to take public transport or maybe get a taxi but it will be not as accessible for them and I realized that some of the distances is only a hundred meters 100 meters in fun I don 't know who 's tried it but it it wouldn 't be that enjoyable and so there 's a lack of mobility parking and then just finally the removal of the free tune at kilmore street gang into Durham I 've never seen a problem with that in the past in fact it works quite well and if we are a council that is pushing to be to reduce our carbon emissions by making more people stop at an intersection and wait to turn instead of Gowen then increases your carbon emissions so it affects traffic flow that way and we should be mindful of that and all their decisions unless you 're an electric car paying no road user charges Tim thank you and the time is absolutely right it has to be done before the opening of the town hall totally agree with it I just AM concerned with regards to putting a cycle lane in front of the town hall with regards to we knew were openings of whatever sort there was congestion and serious congestion in front of the Town Hall or the one of the prime causes of it I have to say so it is very clear in my mind and fresh in my mind what used to go on there but not only the openings of the events but during pickins of all sorts you would get different contractors of different sorts whether they be florists or technical or whatever using that area and parking all over the place so I guess in a bad night with lots of traffic lots of pedestrians crossing roads etc with vehicles and then you get cyclists as well I I just have concerns about their cycle lane going through there I don 't think it 's going to be safe at times of those key times and I think a cycle lane should be safer all the time I would suggest and it 's obviously probably too late that the cyclone should be concentrated on the other side of Kilmore Street I don 't know what 's planned on the old convention center side I 'm sure we 'll be told at some stage but at this stage I just see it 's just a problematic situation full stop so I just yeah I 'm really concerned about that side of things so sorry Mike and then deal like I guess when you 're trying to transform a transport network to actually cater for every user whether they be in a car on a bike walking taking public transport it takes a lot of political well what I 've seen actually developed from accessible city is actually quite quite good once we remove the roadworks it 's the road works the ongoing road works actually causing issues a lot of that is out of our and controls we 've seen on Cambridge Terrace in Manchester Street but once Cambridge Terrace is open up and I still got a little bit more work to do down Dempster it 's actually turned into a really accessible area people can drive down there people can walk down there quite well it 's actually for people where we 're design in a city that 's actually for people it 's not for cars just to drive drive around and have their their way it is a much they 're not safe where 's their cycle lanes so actually they 're not the high standard for cyclists but it 's important to realize you know whether you 're on a biker and a car you you have a right to be on that road and so therefore X the safest option for for someone on a bikers to have cycle lane if we can 't put in a cycle way and and obviously every time we come up with something in town we touch on on parking and the removal of of parking we 've all seen the stats and so it 's a little bit disappointing we keep talking about the loss of on street parking when there 's actually ample off street parking in our city at the moment and we know there 's going to be another car parking building coming into the area I think we need to focus on actually what is happening positively in the city and actually look that there is enough car parks in the area I do agree fair and we need to make sure we have enough mobility these these places but actually people that are able to walk shouldn 't be a problem actually parking a little bit further away and walking to your destination this is this is a really good step forward and I 'm glad I 've seen this design because I 'm happy with it deal for once I 'm not actually opposed to the cycle cycle lanes there I think they 're actually a read hearing and the whole thing it 's there 's a couple of things which I personally am concerned about on on this one is the left turn on to Durham Street I think because is you know just go into slow traffic down and there that area and I know we want to probably slow traffic down but I think there 's you know I think it 's just unnecessary to do that from my perspective from what I 've also been hearing from the residents but my main concern is actually the work that 's not on this plan and that 's the Colombo Street intersection so I mean I know that they don 't have to be doing all the work here and then all of a sudden at some stage in the future the intersection at Colombo Street will be done for the MC our work is it right we 've moved beyond questions we know it has to be done so I mean it 's just I would have liked to seen the whole stuff actually done at the same time is why I think I 'm a bit worried about this one because that is you know there 's a few issues there that I hear so but I know it has to be done at the same time but there are pulling the mobility parking that we 're really supportive of the ability parking thing and really close proximity to where they need to be and we have it resets through the subcommittee and as I see to hopefully we 're going to get to on the east side and two on the west side at the Columbo kilmore intersection and it 's very close walk to the Town Hall and hopefully one more I 'll kill more all going well and it has to look good with the opening of the town hall I know that some part of the problem is the disruption is some like the food too and it 's hard for us sometimes to see past that that that will be a good outcome and we 're quite happy with it um the free tunein to Durham Street has to go for the interception safety it 's actually quite a complicated into super to net one and I think that 's to do with the cycle lane going through the youth well it 's not a cycle way it 's just a cycle marking on the road to keep them safe and the I don 't think there 's going to be a major separated cycle way at the at the Colombo and kilmore intersections so I don 't anticipate a huge disruption of intersection and it will be completed fairly soon so Thank You Pauline I 'm so moved by Pauline seconded Sarah yep oh that was already moved in seconds right okay so that was already done that 's fine okay so all those hands for those in favor and those against so those in favor first of all one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven yep and those

    "text": "so that now brings us to item 9 the community development approach to street based sex work quarterly progress report this came through the regular performance committee II David Easter do you want to introduce this item please Lucas there 's been a collaborative working group established between residents street workers and a number of other key organizations to just understand the issues and develop solutions just some salient points at the moment there 's been a decrease in there 's a recommendation that future reporting goes back to the social community development Housing Committee unless of course there 's a need for further regulatory intervention so this reports just an update the group has coffee so far there will be a lot more all right thank you very much are there any questions for staff on this report okay so did staff want to make any comment on this great thank you very much sir no questions felt just that clearly there 's a number of Christians in relation to accommodation and Chile to help facilitate the working party on on begging which is report to the safer community work and if it could be joined up with it in some way rather than having a whole lot of different strains of we are looking at how we can do the reporting together but also just be mindful that the issues that are are around street basics work are quite different to homelessness they are some areas that will overlap and so we 're meeting to look at where are those overlaps and how do we make sure that we 're not duplicating efforts so we we do have a project working together and I just might add that the new manager of housing first came to the last collaborative meeting around the sex work and we 're certainly going to be time her into the beat the street being in their house if they work so we have got that at the moment thank you Yannick they 're just two things I wanted to follow up but one was that the community would we discuss them applying to the crap fund for funding assistance is that underway and the second one is there 's also discussion of a were three items to ensure that whatever resident concerns are they are being give us in so win that application will be submitted to us given that we do have these concerns and also we 've also got other pressures on thank you yep thank you okay so can I get a mover for this first of all so move by Dion seconded by David East and Dion you want to debate this so I 'm dealing I just wanted to make a few comments really around this issue because it 's you know it doesn 't pick a lot of residents within the the work that the staff have been doing has been you know progressively great and and it has been you know making people more aware of of where people can go to get more information and also sort of encouraging the people who are street basics workers to you know be a bit more mindful of what they 're doing and so that non regulatory approaches you know having some impact in that respect I still personally believe that we should be looking to the government I think it 's it 's just something that 's always going to be an underlying issue for people in residential areas but I think that you know is an ongoing piece of discussion that can happen over time and especially need to sort of you know include the prostitution our sorry the you know the the prostitutes collective into that piece of work as well because they 're the people who are on the ground but I just wanted to sort of say one story and it was in relation to homeless people who are you know also on the street doing six work one of the people that came to the council a few months back who spoke to us about being homeless I caught up with decently and she said thank you for getting us a home I had to be on the street to help support my daughter and it was quite a wake-up call for me to sort of know that these issues are actually interlinked and there is there is an intrinsic link between homelessness people on the street having to either do sex is going on with them connects connecting all of these pieces of work together is actually going to have a good benefit to the city for everybody in my one number one thing that I think we all need to be aware of as safety for people on our streets and it 's not just the people who are doing the work or the you know the sex work or the Biggers but it 's also for residents on the streets as well and people who are using our streets so I know that work is great but I just wanted to share that story because it is a good story but it 's also one that actually humanizes this issue and actually takes it to the next level to say that these are intrinsically linked so again thank you to everybody and also acknowledgement sobriety who is here as well thank you so this has been moved in Jonnie just looking through that the Board discussed and I thought what 's gonna be changed but hasn 't been changed in this report so I don 't know how we board okay we had moved on from questions and interpretation I just want to get it clarified okay I 'll move amendments all right now let 's get the closure government so in the report this talk around the street cleaning and it says that NSAID PC does some things and street cleaning and we were told at the communal actually that 's not true it 's not accurate and it 's still in the report it 's one of the things that happens we are talking to internal staff around getting the reintroduction of more thorough street cleaning in their area and particular may be looking at cleaned up in their diría staff for doing that so can we just should I just move an amendment that um sorry might think rush so I just have to go and read open it up again but um I think it 's on page so remember all we 're doing is receiving a report the reports actually incorrect so on page 65 under action 7.3 enhance the quality of life for residents can we just have an amendment an additional resolution action no staff have been asked to yeah note that staff will yeah and that the request from the community board that our levels of service of street cleaning be be looked at in terms of enhancement yeah can you just repeat that again you only so that we can capture it well just noting under action 7.3 that the Linwood central Heathkit commute I think the board asked for there was a formal resolution on formally like um Delano sensual note the Linwood central Heath community board request for staff to review the levels of service for street cleaning with an aim to improve if it live it cancels that don 't know they used to be manual letter collection and the central city I think there still is but it only went down certain streets in certain areas and I think it used to stop at the kill Mott Street Bridge I 'll mentor stir Street so the idea was the maybe look at that and whether that could be further up to Colombo or to Billy all right so we 've got this some additional noting item points ring the Linwood central heathco Community Board request it 's not frequency SS straight cleaning methodology might be the best thing to say and also that the report is corrected in terms of the information okay so looking at item for you honey now that captures what you wanted yep that 's great all right some and I 'm assuming that the mover and seconder are happy with the additional noting clause been added but you 're comfortable with it yeah all right great so this has been moved and seconded all those in favor against that 's carried okay now moving on to item 10 doc registration _"

so we 'll move on to public participation and I 'd like to invite Peter Richardson and Genevieve Robinson of outer or Water Action to come forward for a public presentation welcome so you probably know what it 's about I just want to talk quickly about why we 're bringing these proceedings first it 's not really about the economic interests of playing around it 's about who 's the water safety and secondly the sovereignty and you they 've slipped up in terms of their processes so we 're wanting to hold them to account make sure they follow a proper process so what a safety that 's really about making sure that we have sufficient high quality water supply of America prefers to supply not only this generation and the generation to come but seven generations at the so we 're looking ahead for the future of Christchurch making sure that we have water safety it 's also about environmental safety making sure that the completion of the aquifers making sure that contamination of the aquifer doesn 't an issue that 's going to affect neighboring water bodies into a 50 environment because it is a very sensitive environment that went out there as we 've already seen with that contamination of captain extreme water sovereignty is about making sure that the community can meet its needs itself and not be reliant on water bottling companies to meet our need for drinking water and generations to come that 's a problem that 's evident right around the world people are unable to turn on the to see that happen in Christchurch we have brought we have brought these proceedings the crux of our argument is that he can fail to follow correct procedures in fact it failed to even follow its own procedures it adopted a device we would say that enabled it to grant these consents in a way that wasn 't authorized by the Resource Management Act and wasn 't authorized by its own land and water regional plan so that 's the crux of our argument at the moment we 're challenging consents to take water from existing bores some of them are several 3d meters 33 meters but we are aware that one of the applicants is also applied for and been granted agency to Singapore at 170 meters we know it 's public knowledge I think the council has pledged its concern about was potentially affecting across futures drinking water supplies and there is a concern for us too consumers also there 's a huge amount of investment being put into into these applications by the water bottling companies we believe there 's been a lot of consultation with each lot of will to ensure that this goes forward we 're hoping to head this off of the path and we 're hoping that our proceedings will be successful we 'd like you to get on their pages to share our campaigns widely and to do what you can to support us thank you Genevieve I 'm actually here on behalf of a hundred and twelve thousand people in December I actually started a petition on the campaign just mentioned by PETA a hundred twelve thousand people have signed a lot of them New Zealanders a lot of them contemporaries they also are very concerned at the situation with the Bachmann plants a lot of people I 'm sure has involved in that and we 've got foreign investors and we also got New Zealand investors the two well heads and boars are adjacent to each other and they have consent to draw 24 million litres a day so I 'm quite visual imagine a one liter bottle 24 million times and that 's every single day so yes the legal action we mentioned we need 40,000 dollars to run campaign to cover our little blue cross we 're actually all volunteers running this so the legal cost is pretty much the only thing we need to cover so far we 're around twenty four twenty five thousand dollars we need another 15 or so to cover our costs so we 've got pledged me up and running we 've got a bank account up and running oh dear what an action you 'll have all the information in front of you electronically which was handed out this morning thank you and just follow us on Facebook this is really a campaign for everybody including everyone in New Zealand that that 's our president we want to be the voice for everyone here thank you thank you that 's um the the documentation that you refer to as as on the hub so if people would like to have a look at that I think that the the message that we 're getting from you is that you would like councillors to be sharing that information through social media I mean obviously this meeting is being live-streamed so it 's I 've got it 's got a couple of months for a quick question Yani I think thank you for what you 're doing the used to be have fun that the government had I think an environmental legal aid Assistance Fund are you aware of any sort of funds that exist to help communities go to the environment court or the Court of Appeal around these sorts of planning matters the problem with their funders for the environment yeah this is this is a judicial review it 's actually a bit of a gap in the system yeah I was just gonna ask if you 'd talk to our staff as well about being able to get kept council funding I mean I think I 'm not sure we have a policy around yeah there are sent council funding for for actions such as this but I have made the offer open for council staff to talk to talk to you I think some of our legal people we 're going to do so but thank you okay well thank you very much for taking the opportunity for presenting of petitions which we have none we 've got approval of a conservation covenant consent for the property at 14y Street Eddington this went to social community and development Housing Committee so Phil could you introduce this one please this is very straightforward it 's really about just a readjustment of of a boundary and involving a very small piece of land so in effect it 's almost like a I understand like a land swap so I think it 's a very straight forward report and you 'd like to do I have a seconder Glen Syria you wanted to raise a an issue around the potential for this to sit is a delegation yeah I think it makes sense for the delegation over the covenants to to sit with the committee themselves I mean Council approves any of the funding about 150,000 although I 'd be happy with all the funding to sit with the committee and I think it makes sense for the committee just to do though is it a paperwork stuff okay so can we just add a second item to this I think Clearwater to report on the delegation on where the delegation should search with ennui that the delegation could sit with the Committee on matters such as this and as part of the work that they 're doing on delegations that required a bit that are covered by statute you know that this is a statutory one so yeah request staff to report on with whether whether the delegation can serve with the committee they don 't do because we 've got yeah cool all right so I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you Thank You Brendan you 're stunning contribution to the meeting the next item I 'm sorry I missed all of the minutes so it would someone like to move all the minutes Andrew seconded Mike put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know it 's carried next one kept it on down and fund two that went to finance and performance ref just in time yeah happy to move it do I have a seconder Mike I 'll put say no it 's carried and the second one again over to you ref we 've just changed one of the recommendations at the end number eight number eight so just asking for advice on the previous allocation such as for the inflation-adjusted component following the earthquake by the end of May 2018 and that way the decision that comes back to Council on that matter can be factored into the LTP yep are you happy to move do I have a seconder Jamie fill a question like it is it 's in relation to the recommendation 5b and just clarification for the civic and community projects part because it just seems to me that with government having support of the four well being there if possible we should include well can we include concepts like social and cultural well-being as part of the benefit I guess that 's a question of staff just to make sure we get that right well the first one the first category picks up economic or environmental benefits so quite do pacifically this second one yeah we could put social and cultural benefit as 's the question and I just wonder if just like staff view what what I don 't want is to limit it precisely i 'ma say and so the question I would I would ask back to you as do we need to end and social and cultural given given debt a benefit include social and cultural well it should and I guess I was really just wanting clarification it 's not put it that way hang on evidence that the project demonstrates a benefit including social and cultural for the city of Croatia and including the social and cultural well-being including social and cultural well-being now in brackets including groans strengthening communities this is split between economic development and civic and community projects yeah I know I I don 't think it 's necessary oh I 'm trying to be helpful well there is a fear that it would limit it well I wonder if the start I wouldn 't the staff you though as it be out there that was my question really I should have seen look because we accept we are the ones who make the as to whether from a legal point of view that weird including limits or framework excludes or exclude oh yeah but be my point needs to come out so take it out and I can 't think of a social or cultural benefit that is not included in the words our benefit great my reason for asking this was so that in people the fund is linked with the Local Government Act and those four well-beings that 's all but I don 't want to exclude any any benefit either this is not rates and come at all it actually enables us to go way beyond their in its and and innovation and what 's missing from a as the word innovation so evidence of the economic or environmental benefits it should be evidence of the innovation economic or environmental benefits because innovation may not be necessarily an immediate economic benefit yeah Jonnie and then gleam I mean we 're requiring evidence before these projects are even done I would have thought evidences car when it comes after you 've done the project so you can monitor but I just staff had any advice on when the fund was established we with require a rigorous public consultation about how the city wanted to spend the money and people we had specific SCP and given that we 're making some significant changes process and possibly around the inflation adjustment have staff considered once we get that further work back that 's sort of public process to engage the community about how they see this money could be spent so you could feel whether this consultation needed whether there 's whether they would see any consultation needed around particularly going into the inflation adjustment but also if we were to change some of the things we already have provisioned to go on to the inflation adjustment with eighty percent support and that is going to come back to Council for a decision there is no need to go back out for a special consultative procedure because this is simply formulating a set of criteria that that were assumed rather than explicit so we changed the definition last year no I understand that but if we were making changes so people have proposed was asking is do with the staff say you need to go out and consult if we change the committee when you when this was discussed there was no suggestion from the officers responsible that consultation would be needed that this was all within the board policy we could move an amendment to change some of the criteria without any consultation to change right so I 've got someone moving this resolution Jaime 's sick and desert good glean new hit oh yeah thank you obviously in the schedule of what it has been used for you know big money 's gone to things like golf tournaments so would those get through with us is that the fund that is so broad that we 've asked for advice on the previous allocations following the earthquake for precisely the reason that we don 't want to get into a debate today about any of those elements we are not making decisions on allocation the funders fully allocated that is why we 've asked for advice on the inflation-adjusted component for the next three years and that will come back here before before the LTP is concluded can I also comment on that that that there was a working group about two years ago that went through all of the criteria for this and the council was accepted and changed the criteria the golf tournaments pre predate that change in criteria yep all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they no that 's carried performance reporting for February 2018 that also went through finance and performance Rep over to you I think could you introduce the report the main thing really to come out of this is a monthly report I 'm not sure it 's actually delivering that much because it 's only reporting the levels of service which are not being met and they seem to be the same ones every month so that 's not really telling us a great deal but what we did discuss the committee was actually reviewing the levels of service go as we would have liked during the LTP process so I agree I think we should get on with that I mean what I see so we may actually have a bit of spare time that 's been allocated for hearings yeah and we can actually get all the work with that and I think also it 's not just reviewing the levels of service for me it 's actually reviewing how we present this information yeah you know the financial information and in the lives of service accessible for the public to understand spending money on why we 're spending the money and what the outcome of that spenders yeah at the moment I just don 't think you weigh at the moment it 's reporting by exception yeah so um so you 'd like to move the report yes seconded by David East is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no that 's carried thanks very much that was a good committee actually it was it was a really good meeting health and safety committee the quarterly health safety and well-being update Who am I inviting to check Jamie yes there 's only one part a to actually just the changing that it 's health and safety talk about culture so I think having an alignment of terms inside the organization is quite important so internally in a management operational level it 's referred to as health safety and well-being so we just thought it made sense to call the the governance monitoring body the same as what it 's called inside the organization other than that really what we 're focusing on is continual improvement in benchmarking also leg indicators are really easy to report so the challenge to staff is to place an emphasis on those lead indicators and finally we 're also really keen on getting follow-ups in the remedial action so silly people doing silly things isn 't kind of cut the mustard or someone slipped on a step end of story that 's it 's not enough we need to know what you learn from it and what 's being done as a result of it so it 's really we were and just for privacy obviously for the privacy around employees the names and and made public but I think you can appreciate why so David ease um I was just gonna sort of share with you it was a an item that I picked up on a course that I was on and it was one of the participants who was describing how difficult sometimes it is to change the culture of a large organization to get them to take responsibility for reporting and what was described as near misses and the reason was was that people didn 't really feel that there was a need to but actually you learn so much from near misses as much if not more from them than you do from actual accident late indicators like we 're talking about as well but our reporting culture I 'm pleased to say is actually really good and I think you know this started a couple of years ago so we saw a spike if you look at our trophy or the total recorded incident frequency rates they they were higher we way back in was a big spike and it was really around that reporting so it 's not a bad thing to see it means that people are how they turned it around to get really high levels of reporting and then as they changed the language from near misses to good catches yeah and even just the change in language actually gave people a sense of ownership of of the culture which is it was a good catch and so it was a positive to report or a negative there is a good one for the suggestion box finally an you mention it because I 'm quite keen to say commercial years as well a good lead indicator to is and about engaging the culture and getting people thinking about as the suggestions you know what are some safety suggestions and when people are thinking about it and putting suggestions for this and exactly the culture that we want to say thank you I 'm very pleased it wasn 't my idea but it 's a great one all right I shall put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried the next one is the community organization loan scheme and the bit go through a committee know do they so would someone like to move this this is an over and the Kashmere direction I suppose Tim 's gander it would like to move it and fill Clearwater would like to second it is there any discussion oh look it 's a strong club with a strong financial background and in the application that is fine what what I 'm interested in though is that a number of organizations you know apply for this and I 'm just not sure from staff how widespread the loan scheme fund is is made to all other organizations and clubs that 's all so it 'll be useful to to get a steer on some stage we can 't good here we can 't you did but we can send you an update on how many applications and how what to success percentage successful and where they distribute it yep thanks they 're good Glen Pauline thank you just a bit curious 490 and accumulated funds outstanding low with the council net cash of 30 pavilion depreciation is in there I mean it 's been assessed but they appear to be quite prove that they can see they can finish alone and take on the capital work so that 's what the criteria is not this is not a grand this is a degree they need to know that the group 's sustainable enough to be able to build the project and repay the loan yeah yeah Pauline I 'm just wondering that when we get our strengthening communities applications people can only really apply to one for the year otherwise they 're to double dipping and they already have a loan right is there any further discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much the next one is the draft submission on the land transport management regional fuel tax amendment bill the the notes that I will just bring to your attention as the way the draft submission is weirder doesn 't impact on councils consideration on this issue through their LTP process we haven 't actually formally consulted on adding a regional fuel tax a specific proposal what we 've done is we 've gone the way the bill is drafted is that we wouldn 't be able to take advantage of that in this in this tomb so we we would we we 're making a submission that just simply sees we we want to open it up for consideration if if we decide to go down that track but that is not something that we can do under the bill was drafted have I got that kind of correct excellent right so would someone like to move this I think Vicki would like to move this one wouldn 't you the draft submission on the regional field takes but he 's not here Deon 's late well he might miss the whole making at this rate Pauline Sikandar I 'll put that motion all of David or a level playing field over fuel costs in the country anyway and if you drive through the middle of the bloody war you were paying fuel probably the livable fuel tax less than we are paying now and miles away from any distribution centers and you pay fuel level that 's probably anything up 15 to so was we looking for methods to fund things through other means than rates I think it 's quite unfair in the country there we in the South Island are already paying a higher premium than other places in the country and in you know our residents may be asked to to fund things through a regional fuel tax on top of there we 're in them and places to other places in the country they 're already playing fuel at substantially less this process than we are now so I 'm quite in favor of considering other means of funding territorial authorities and this could well be one I 'm not saying that you know absolutely under support but but I think we need a level playing field for a start and we haven 't_''_2384.87 got that so I have some reservations and supporting regional fuel taxes when the price of fuel across the country is not on a level playing field for a starter yeah I mean it 's a matter of you know but the lack of competition and the South Island is compared to the North Minister of Commerce we did a we did a we did a control we didn 't control and sorry we didn 't inquiry into it in it there is more competition with more companies and the North Island then there are in the South Island we are a victim of the lack of the competitive market down here if goal was down in the South Island prices would be cheap can I just propose that we actually cuz I I do have somebody what you with what counts is to say can we just make a submission point and that regard to that to the submission transport management regional fuel tax amendment bill we cannot add a submission on a completely unrelated measure we 've done this previously that with the alcohol submission we actually put at the end of the submission and that is outside of the specific but just a note you know things that were capable of being included in that and then in the legislation not on the proposed draft so no no no but it 's not capable of being included in this bill it Land Transport Management Act trust me there is nothing in there about the competition around petrol and my understanding was that the government had already some sort of inquiry into it again so that would be the Minister of Commerce it wouldn 't even be the same Minister then let 's get another report and make a solution to that other process whatever but not but not on this not on this you know I I know that there are counselors that don 't agree with going down this path for this reason so but it 's not something that can be resolved in the context of this particular one so if people don 't support the submission then it 's actually just easier to vote against it rather then rather than seek to amend this submission because we cannot fix that problem and this piece of legislation but thank you for raising it and Dion will be very grateful because in his absence we 've got to this before he 's got to the meeting but it 's precisely the point that he 's been making all right I those opposed say no that 's carried so Gulf and East I would say yo sorry swigs and his absence but I can 't_''_2579.91 so he he could he should have phoned in now yeah too late now item 16 local government New Zealand 2018 conference and awards this is just about attending agreeing you 'll move move the first recommendation is agreeing the members to God I mean the second recommendation here is appointing you as the presiding delegates yeah and then either delegating to you to appoint the alternate delegate or at this time appointed appointing you I get no power normally on here but there 's no names do we want to write names in and if so how many names previously you 've seen yourself in five to six counselors and it is in Christchurch yeah there 's no there 's no travel cost and my registration is actually covered by the conference because I 'm the host Muir so so it 's actually an advantage to to Christchurch and the Queen 's already indicated to me that he would like to attend so I 've like a delegation thank you there it goes and we 're also authorizing Melanie as the zone vibe can community board representative to attend the conference and for us to pay her conference registration which we have done in the past for Mike Morra and authorized Alexander David 's again as the zone five young elected member representative to attend the conference and that the council pay here conference feet we 've done that over the last few years as well very supportive of that so that 's moved and do I have a seconder okay yeah that 's a good idea scanned ripped I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried can someone send Jimmy a text you 'll be pleased and then we 've got item number 17 which said the local government New Zealand remotes and we 're confirming a number of remnants I 've got the note to that the proposed remus on improving water quality by banning copper brake pads has not been prepared as Environment Canterbury is planning on making a remit on this think we 'll just put in crush it City Council will offer to second it because I 've spoken to well by email with the chair of Environment Canterbury this morning who 's confirmed that they are working on it and that they 're working with our staff who have been doing some work on it for us over the last week Wow now is everyone comfortable with the generic sort of way that these have been described someone like to move them the way they 'd been described but we just added a point on was the electricity one that it 's about driving the market so prioritizing the completion of renewable electricity generation projects what 's the it was actually just going to be in the content of the agreement is there anything wrong with the generic description what would you put sorry no just say I mean no it 's easy to change prioritizing the completion of renewable electricity generation projects electricity procurement process to aim for it being fully renewable because that would drive the market for renewables and drive more investment and renewable sources of it 's innate through but it isn 't but it 's not in there the initial but okay so so it 's an oyster thing we wanted that change gate to ensuring the all of government procurement process for electricity exec prioritizes renewable energy yeah renewable it 's not a generation yeah double right now so yep yeah yep but just looking at the one on reducing the use of single use plastic bags and plastic straws there is a much bigger issue now around recycling and that is that China is not accepting any materials that go into our anybody 's we take out of that and I 'm just wondering if we shouldn 't add to the intake our project and that we ask the government to push for a regulatory action from central government or facilities for processing all recyclables within New Zealand because the world market has changed dramatically in the last two months and there is now the plastic bags and the straws are actually the easiest yeah but why have we brought in reducing shouldn 't we put minimizing or elimination I mean eliminated you 've got the entire issue of what 's in everybody 's yellow bin and the face ok so change reducing to eliminating so that 's this that 's our objective as to eliminate yep and then if we 're seeking for action from central government we also need it for the creation of facilities to process maybe if you put sources after the word generation sorry I 'm just trying to just trying to get this right and so if we can add another one after reducing the use of single-use plastic bag so just adding another another if thing or recyclables within New Zealand the world market has changed as you know well well to adopt a New Zealand wide approach to process the priestly seminary recyclable materials yep to adopt a New Zealand wide a New Zealand wide so wide so it 's New Zealand wide so it 's a New Zealand wide I 'm sorry you 're over there to adopt a New Zealand my approach to processing recyclable materials within New Zealand weather museum yet because we don 't have the facilities are yep yep with it one yep it 's change the word views to concerns and to review policy levers to strengthen the community 's voice and reducing alcohol related harm it just ends a bit sorry so you want to say watch and to review policy levers but what has been sent what of communities support you know particular and I think views as neutral and it enables concerns to be expressed yes from the view that we were wanting to empower community local communities more and dealing with their local issues rather than just a general kind of thing well well maybe maybe it 's better to brighter a meaning the sale and supply of alcohol way to ensure that community views reflected and local decision-making so that so that I think that 's the intention yeah to ensure that communities are affected and local decision-making but it 's it 's local decision-making that we want we don 't want multiple appeals unto the thing into review policy levers to reduce alcohol-related yeah that 's right great thank you yeah appalling subsidies themes because that 's really where the well my that 's the issue that it 's it needs to be competitive in the market so I think it 's an important thing to address because the environmental benefits a huge mess of when you think about potentially running the buses on the biofuels and see does the diesel that subsidies come up on the actual wording yeah it 's suddenly actual wording so that 's fine supporting the production and procurement of bar fields including including the reintroduction of subsidy schemes subsidies subsidies we 're appropriate those subsidies schemes were appropriate subsidy schemes full stop yep thank you subsidy all right substitute schemes I know we 're moving towards electric vehicles but you know it will take time and there will be some vehicles that will probably stay on diesel and if we can keep them on biofuel be a huge help yeah yeah Lee very happy with power vehicles sir but um just under the remit we 're gonna get additional information around background for each of them and just want to check the process yeah they 've been circulated okay I just wanted that the appropriate time any other questions or comments on the framework would someone like to move it or have we got that moved um Sierra Mike so Jonnie yeah I just wanted to strongly speak in support of gee this has been an issue that has been around for a long time and particularly in Christchurch I 'm I understand as New Zealand has one of the highest outbreaks in the world of Legionella and in Christchurch and in Canterbury we have one of the most represented with the New Zealand this is very real people who have died and people have been hospitalized as a result of these outbreaks and I think it 's absolutely shameful the lack of progress from the previous government on this issue and we 've tried to talk informally with MB and with working groups in the past but we need to get on top of this as much as possible and it 'd be really good to get LG and Zed support if you compare this and I know that we 're having to do stuff based on what happened in the Hawke 's Bay over that needs to be seen as a priority because of having a very real impact on people in communities in our city and there has been a real lack of making it a priority so I really I 'm putting this amendment forward it 's a shame that we have to put an amendment through LG indeed to try and get government progress on this but we 've tried everything else and it 's come to naught so I 'm very happy to support these remotes I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you thank you very much is that is there another item on the agenda but you can 't believe you finished this no no it was another item and and I can 't open it yeah oh right right okay right all right so I 'd like to move now that we house the resolution to exclude the public set out on pages 1 to 4 to 1 to 6 of the agenda is this a record or yeah in that Paul Monroe Lea scales and the draft statements of intent and the recommended appointment etc so I 'll move there seeking to by Andrew put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so just if the people at the back can

    "text": "again over to you ref we 've just changed one of the recommendations at the end number eight number eight so just asking for advice on the previous allocation such as for the inflation-adjusted component following the earthquake by the end of May 2018 and that way the decision that comes back to Council on that matter can be factored unto the LTP yep so you 're happy to move do I have a seconder Jamie Phil just a question like it 's in relation to the recommendation 5b and just clarification for the Civic and community projects part because it just seems to me that with government having supported the four well-beings there if if possible we should include well can we include concepts like social and cultural well-being as part of the benefit I guess that 's a question of staff just to make sure we get that right well the first one the first category picks up economic or environmental benefits so quite a glue the second one yeah we could put social and cultural benefit as long as that 's as wide as a benefit that staff view what what I don 't want is to limit it precisely on the same and so the question I would I would ask back to you as do we need to Ed and social and cultural given given that the a benefit includes social and cultural well it should and I guess I was really just wanting clarification it 's not put it that way hang on evidence that the project demons it 's a benefit including social and cultural for the city of crashes and including the social and cultural well-being including social and cultural well-being now in brackets including this is split between economic development and civic yeah I know I don 't think it 's necessary oh I 'm trying to be helpful well there is a fear that it would limit it well I wonder what the start wouldn 't the staff you though as it be out there it wasn 't a question really I should have seen look because we accept we are the ones who make the decisions fell so there 's no point asking staff advice as to whether from framework excludes or exclude oh yeah but my point needs to come out so take it out and I can 't think of a social and cultural benefit that is not included in the words our benefit great my reason for asking this was so that impair the fund is linked with the Local Government Act and those four well beings that 's all but I don 't want to exclude any any benefit either this is not right and come at all it actually enables us to go way beyond their in its and and innovation and in fact what 's missing from a as the word innovation so evidence of the economic or environmental benefits it should be evidence of the innovation economic or environmental benefits because innovation may not be necessarily an immediate economic benefit yeah Jonnie and then gleam I mean there 's a bit before these protests even done I would have thought even this is kind of when it comes after you 've done the project so you can monitor but I just given that it 's being raised I just wondered if staff with require a rigorous public consultation about how the city wanted to spend the money and people we had less of it SCP and given that we 're making some significant changes process and possibly around the inflation adjustment have staff considered once we get that further work back a sort of public process to engage the community about how they see this money could be spent so you 're asking how the money could lead or whether this consultation needed whether there 's whether they would see any consultation needed around particularly going into the inflation adjustment but also if we were to change some of the things we already have provision to go onto the inflation adjustment with 80 percent support and that is going to come back to Council for a decision there is no need to go back out for a special consult or procedure because this is simply formulating a set of criteria that that we 're assumed rather than explicit so I changed the definition last year I understand that but if we were making changes so people have proposed making changes to some with the staff say you need to go out and consult if we change the committee when you when this was discussed there was no suggestion from the officers responsible that consultation would be needed that this was all within the board policy we could move an amendment to change some of the criteria without any consultation as long as it 's not a significant change right so I 've got someone moving this resolution Jaime 's sick and alert go to glean new hit oh yeah thank you odd obviously in the schedule of what it has been used for you know big money 's gone to things like golf tournaments so would those get through again with this is that the fund that is so broad that we 've asked for advice on the previous allocations following the earthquake for precisely the reason that we don 't want to get into a debate today about any of those elements we are not making decisions on allocation the funders fully allocated that is why we 've asked for advice on the inflation-adjusted component for the next three years and so we can make a decision before the LTP is concluded can I also comment on that that that there was a working group about two years ago that went through all of the criteria for this and the council was accepted and changed the criteria the golf tournaments pre predate that change in criteria yeah all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they no that 's carried _"

's about I just wanted to talk very quickly about why we 're bringing these proceeds first it 's not really about the economic interests of playing around it 's about firstly water safety and technically water sovereignty and thirdly also calling our regulator to account where any of you they 've slipped up in terms of their processes so we 're wanting to hold them to account to make sure they follow a proper process so water safety that 's really about making sure that we have sufficient high quality not only this generation and the generation to come but seven generations at you so we 're looking ahead for the future of Christchurch making sure that we have water safety it 's also about environmental safety making sure that the completion of the aquifers making sure the contamination of the aquifer doesn 't an issue that 's going to affect neighboring water bodies into a 50 out there as we 've already seen with that contamination of kappa Tony extreme water sovereignty is about making sure that the community can meet its needs itself and not be reliant on water bottling companies to meet our need for drinking water and generations to come that 's a problem that 's evident right around the world people are unable to turn on the tap and get clean high-quality water we don 't want to see that happen in Christchurch we have brought we have brought these proceedings the crux of our argument as that he can fail to follow correct procedures in fact it failed to even follow its own procedures it adopted a device we would say that enabled it to grant these consents in a way that wasn 't authorized by the Resource Management Act and wasn 't authorized by its own land and water regional plan so that 's the crux of our argument at the moment we 're challenging consents to take water from existing laws some of them are several 3d meters 33 meters but we are aware that one of the applicants at 170 meters we know it 's public knowledge I think the council has flaked its concern about what 's potentially affecting across futures drinking water supplies and that is a concern for us to you know consumers also that there 's a huge amount of investment being put into into these applications by companies we believe there 's been a lot of consultation with etn in the past and we believe there was a lot of will we have hoping to head this off of the path and we 're hoping that our proceedings will be successful now we 'd like you to get on their pages to share our campaigns widely and to do what you came to support us thank you Genevieve I 'm actually here on behalf of 112 thousand people in December I actually started a kemper petition on the campaign just mentioned by PETA a hundred twelve thousand people have signed a lot of them New Zealanders a lot of them contemporaries they also are very concerned at the situation with the bottling plants a lot of people I 'm sure who 's involved got New Zealand investors the two wellheads and boars are adjacent to each other and they have consent to draw 24 million litres a day so I 'm quite visual imagine a one liter bottle 24 million times and that 's every so yes the legal action mentioned we need 40,000 to run it so the pledge me page is part of our campaign to cover our little cost we 're actually all volunteers running this so the legal cost is pretty much the only thing we need to cover so far we 're around 22 for 25,000 we need another 15 or so to cover our costs so we 've got pledged me up and running we 've got a bank account up and running under hotel water action you 'll have all the information in front of you electronically which was handed out this morning thank you and just follow us on Facebook this is really a campaign for everybody including everyone in New Zealand that that 's our president we want to be the voice for everyone here thank you thank you that 's the the documentation if people would like to have a look at that I think that the the message that we 're getting from you is that you would like councillors to be sharing that information through social media I mean obviously this meetings being live-streamed so it 's an opportunity to link it to the presentation I give something that 's got a couple of months for a quick question Yani I think thank you for what you 're doing the used to have fun that the government had I think an environmental legal aid Assistance Fund are you aware of any sort of funds that exist to help communities go to the environment court or the Court of Appeal around these sorts of planning matters the problem with their funders excellent reason for the environment cool yeah this is this is a judicial review it 's actually a bit of a gap in the system yeah I was just gonna ask if you 'd talk to our staff as well about being able to get kept council funding I mean I think I 'm not sure we have a policy around but I have made the offer open for council staff to talk to talk to you I think some of our legal people we 're going to do so but thank you okay well thank you very much for taking the opportunity for presenting excellent thank you _"

is made by the statutory console TV New Zealand police the medical officer of help and also the dictation is made by hospitality hospitality New Zealand and community members notes that one of the strong themes of these deputations was around issues related to consumption of alcohol from oft licensed premises including concerns around the density and location of off-licence premises C does not pursue a local alcohol policy and the existing term noting that the default provisions in the sale of in supply of alcohol remain in place do you request staff to provide further information to counsel on how the provisions of a district plan could be used or strengthened to deal with issues arising from off-license premises the request staff work with the statutory console TV the relevant background information and identify any alcohol related harm issues evident in Christchurch especially as they relate to areas of concerns of a report to the uncommon council at the immediate commencement of the 2019 to 2022 term notes that staff are working with community boards with regards to their role industrial district license license and committee hearings and requests that as part of this work staff and community boards examine options such as education advocacy or support programs for communities to enable them to better engage with licensing processes and to submit on applications as necessary request staff advise on the makeup of the district licensing committee and suggest options to ensure accessibility in appropriate local community and community board representation on the committee invite hospitality New Zealand to partner with residents associations to collaboratively work to minimize alcohol related harm in residential areas using the Christchurch alcohol Action Plan framework and engage with government and local government use Zealand to effect policy or letters that have changed that better ensures community views on minimizing alcohol related harm are taken into account actually I wouldn 't mind adding another little bit to that last one which says so instead of finishing on alcohol minimizing alcohol related harm are taken into available to central government are utilized in order to minimize alcohol related harm because I mean one of the issues is that we don 't have the tools that central government has that would really make a difference in this area yeah and you 'd like to move there Andrew oh okay I 'll move it okay I 'll move it and you Sikandar all right so yep yep that 's fine yep yep no it 's fine um couple of things here just looking at that number five they 're requesting star work with the stationary console tease together evidence and just chicken we 've been told previously that it was unlikely that the police medical officer of health and others would be likely to put the time and energy into doing this work if we weren 't if we hadn 't confirm that that we were going for our local alcohol policy is that right yeah so number five is it 's going to be difficult because because we hidden to see that we were going to start only if we 've started I guess that would be state okay that you need to start it just states that they need to provide information relevant to preparing okay because what we do previously is that they were unlikely to engage with these weed seed made a resolution to proceed providing information okay thanks and when we 're looking at the evidence and what is allowable you know what and what work needs to be done and we had clearly last time sufficient evidence to be able to settle provisions that reduced off-license hours and it reduced unlicensed hours and we were able to settle that in the previous iteration when we were developing the previous levers there right yeah but we did we choose not to look at density notation because we couldn 't get the evidence or we didn 't look for the evidence last time it goes back to 2013 Yeah right and so once we got further down the process that was really too late so in 2000 but now we 've got much more accurate information about where all the off licences are in the density and location proximity to schools and other sensitive on those I 'm clean Mike and then Phil if we were it made the decision to have a lab there 's obviously there 's plenty of decision points along that process where the council would decide whether to proceed with it correct and I think the earliest one would be probably late June according to the timeline we proposed that would be at the point where the research had been undertaken the issues related issues precinct in Christchurch have been identified so we 'd be in a much better position and June if we elected to go Ford now and be in a much better position in June to actually make that final decision whether we should proceed then actually right now well at that point you would have a better understanding of any issues the report that has been presented so far was simply a process driven that doesn 't pretend to have the research and analysis behind it on which the council would make a decision to heaven la Paix is though can I just ask you like you just referred to the possibility likelihood of a it just seems to me that the previous lab was really ruled out by appeal so and it was sort of like a point more than a point of law to this just is that an area which we should be asking or working with central government is in the last recommendation that we develop so in fact when we get that we 're part of making sure that the legislation actually works in the interests of the communities thank you and since in the report it 's quite clear that in all the major metropolitan areas have been issues around passing a lamp is that like related to the fact that there it is fraught legally and particularly appeals are easily virtually easily allow okay and while I 'm asking questions I just might ask you a question in relation to one an area of particular interest in and that is how in fact a district licensing committees how they might be broadened so is it workable my understanding is that in fact the license and committee is something that as a council we we we set up we just making sure that in fact my suggestion is feasible and that is that in fact the committees be widened to and and made more accessible really by having for example a community board representative on those committees we run coming from is that recently ice by setting on hearing it just seemed to me that in fact while it 's a judicial process that in fact having it more kind of like open for ordinary people to be able to state their objections would be of use so is this part workable well I think the request for staff to consider whether or not I speak to you satisfies the full extent of where the community boards for example committee board members could be on their committee speak to your first question yes the district 's license in committees or effectively Council but we just want to understand if we were to go down the path that suggests what the implications and arrangements would be make sure that I understand thank you in my last question really is what would local organizations in the initial through actually for example them to be involved to assist assist residents and in those some hearings yeah so tomorrow we are speaking with the community board Cheers about the process so hopefully that will provide some more clarity but I see that you are requesting some work to be done and they were speeding um Jonnie I thought we just recently had a report and we just appointed a whole bunch of just licensing people yes so I 'm not quite sure like why we would be then looking at again it 's we 've just done a hurt and we had a bit of a robust debate at the time what 's the point in doing it again requests for staff to consider whether their existing provisions upon which you appoint to the district licensing committee the same ones that you want going forward and you ask you to staff a voice effectively on whether you make any changes to either the my capital proceeds for watching my performance would be a metaphor Council so my understanding from that report is that they appointed for a certain term yeah we 've got district licensing committee crash it 's City Council ways of 18 December as appointed for DLCs for the period listed below each made up of a commissioner and two persons from an approved list so the commissioners are appointed for five years five years three years three years and then there 's a list of members who 've got three or five year appointments depending on when they were appointed I 'm just worried if we 're asking you to do a whole bunch of work that we this material not could actually make any changes because we can 't make any changes in the next three years question that we can answer that 's what your own TV we 're happy to do the work if that 's what you wish but we don 't want to predetermine the outcome of that work what we 're saying is we would report back to Council and ultimately this Fair Council to exercise your judgement on what might be that we can and say actually I consider different skills and the makeup of the district 's licensure committees but what they people okay so we could expend because they 're made up of a commissioner in two persons from an approved list so the question is how long 's the approved list and can we expand the list so I mean there 's no harm and requesting this information because that will assist consideration of the of the committee as it stands or the the list of people who can form a committee and also could support the next council were making decisions as well just like I 'm still kind of like if I look at five I 'm just a little bit puzzled about these two separate processes so how is this process tying in with that process the LAV is a regulatory tool in the strategy is a non regulatory collaboration between the councils police and the DHB so the two I guess are seeking similar goals but taking quite different approaches to achieve those goals the evidence that was used as the basis for the alcohol election plan is well referenced in that plan and we can quite easily use it in any consideration towards an L for debate in Andrew thank you and this is a question I 've wrestled quite a bit over the last few days clearly the question is whether we attracted and expensive process of developing an L AP and starting that now or whether we leave that to a future Council and in my view there are three issues that we 're that we 're really needing to deal with here the first of which is that communities are fully involved in both decision making and outcomes in licensing decisions the other and this really is responding to the submissions that we heard last week is dealing with issues particularly around off licenses and density and proliferation and I would suggest particularly in suburban areas and maybe in certain low socio-economic suburban areas which seem to have been a target for applications for these type of licenses and then the other issue is if we are to develop as a council in LA P we want to do that in an environment which means that we get the best possible policy outcomes and the best policy that 's most appropriate for there are a number of a number of these resolutions deal with the issues as I see them quite effectively they certainly ensure that we do the work to see where the community can be more greatly involved more effectively involved in license licensing decisions that affect communities at the local level we 're obviously going to be looking at where there might be the opportunity for community board men as a community board members to be better represented on the district licensing committees and and what involvement the community boards might have in delivering better outcomes making sure that communities are better resourced and better educated around what their involvement in the processes might be we 're also taking the time to do some of the work that would need to be done in preparation of embarking on a local alcohol policy in time for the next council to start to consider that at the very beginning of the term and that certainly would be my expectation that they would want to be looking at at the very beginning of the term to give them time to go through out with those good policy outcomes and in my view the best way to achieve this would not be to embark on this now with limited time because of an arbitrary date at the end of this triennial which is the 2019 council elections that inevitably means inevitably means that it would need to be a time-limited process to achieve an outcome by that date that quite possibly means that there would be a limitation on the amount of community engagement and involvement there could be in developing the policy and it also means that we would be reaching the final stages of developing the LA P at exactly the same time as we were going through the final stages of a local body elections campaign and I don 't believe that 's the kind of environment that would produce the best policy even if every councillor around this table was fully focused on that rather than in election campaign I don 't think it 's the policy and it 's an environment where we 'd be creating the best possible policy long term around local alcohol so to give something that would be better handled by the next council than this council in a time constrained environment and I think we 're doing absolutely the right thing by responding to the most important issues as I see them as quickly as we possibly can and in fact probably more quickly than developing a local alcohol policy at this particular time would allow us to do I support having a local alcohol policy for the city because I think there are issues we are you know communities do need to have a little bit more involvement but the reality that we 're facing right now with making a decision on the LA P is that we 're going to be fast tracking an LAPD scuzz we have to start from scratch again and there are two big risks with that for me that I don 't think are acceptable at this point in time and one of them outlined in the report is there 's a risk that stakeholders in community members will not sorry who want to be involved in the process to prepare the draft local alcohol policy 's a big red flag for me the if we 're going to do one of these things we need to do it right and we need to do a well and I think if we get all of the background information that we do need to do an L ap ready for the new council it 's a sensible way to move forward number eight on the resolutions is one that I put in there because we do have communities who have been in this process for nearly seven or eight years with this LA P Central City residents that that I you know represent who do need to be recognized that they 've put a lot of time and effort into contributing to whatever way of the argument that they 're that they 've been on that they need to be involved in the interim while we don 't have an LLP and I think that 's a sensible way for using the Christchurch alcohol action plan which we signed off on last year to actually get those communities involved and actually using the non regulatory approach might and having a regulatory approach especially in areas where bars and restaurants and entertainment areas are close to residential locations so I think this is a sensible way to move forward we 're going to do the work the background work to get this done right so that we can start looking at this in the new term and actually get it done so that we can actually then move forward with a vibrant heart of our city because we all do want a nice night for now city but we also want to have safe environments for for people to be able to enjoy the city life the city culture and I think we 're you know this is a very sensible way to move forward so I 'll support those resolutions anyone else Sarah Vicki I don 't want us to give up on a local alcohol policy and defer it to into future Council we don 't need to fast track this I know there 's a there 's a a stated position that we would need to get it done before the next election cycle but strategies that that organization and in the governance approves go over several council terms and the organization doesn 't just stop work because there 's an eviction elections every three years in the middle of that period there 's an L AP and that takes up lots of time and energy as well and so every 18 months there 's something huge for the council to do and I would be happy with us getting started on this now and potentially leaving it to the next council to notify but actually doing the work for that council many many of us may be around next time though it 's not going to be you know seventeen new faces around the table I wouldn 't think there will be some institutional knowledge and we 've done that through through several large planes at this point including our district clean the local alcohol policy is not a silver bullet it 's one tool but it 's the one that we 've got council chose to act when the medical officer of health recommend and chlorinating our water supply even when the risk every weekend ane is full of those have been impacted by the misuse of alcohol the injuries car accidents and domestic violence and abuse of hospital staff when the police tell us that they don 't have the resourcing and won 't be able to enforce it by law or on street based sex workers we believe them as controversial and difficult as that was and we look to the evidence about actually works and here the police are telling us that they want this that this works to reduce harm in our communities and our communities are telling us the same they come to us time and time again asking for us to regulate off licenses in many ways this is the same issue that we 've faced as a country before with the hand that smoking caused those worth vested interests fort changes the way the manufacturers of cigarettes in the hospitality industry yet only a few years on and we marvel that it was so controversial and we recognize that we are much healthier for it at both an individual and a national level we know that to we were able to settle provisions in the last el ap which limited the off our the hours of off licenses and the evidence is now likely to be available about the density in proximity to sensitive places such as skulls even if we end up not being able to alter their density location we already know that we can shorten the hours that each of them are open by 21 hours a week and that will make a difference to our communities I 'm not going to support number three many of the other provisions I have no resolutions I have no problem with but I 'd like to ask for number three to be put separately please I 'm Vicki Yanni so glean oh god I might as well just go around the room a no but you can do it in debate that most of us want to have to make changes in the density in the hours of operation of it off licenses medical officer of health even told us that the safest place to have a drink was in about and that 's fine to go into we want to go into the fact that there are or fly tsatsis everywhere particularly in low-income areas and in since so this does sound like at the spec but what I want to know is the bit that sarah said about we could limit that from our previous el ap was there any way legally that we could just pick up that bit and do it the limiting on their hours at least I think we made the decision not to proceed with their I can 't do it better okay we made the decision not to proceed so any part of it either with a I know but yeah oh no no we made the decision not to proceed I don 't know the answer to the question that you are asking because I can 't recall but but what 's the what what is the point we can 't we made the decision not to proceed yes no we 've already made the decision not to proceed yeah okay I 'm just gonna go around the table yeah II think so a lot of agreed to do under the alcohol action plan so you know it 's good to reinforce that that stuff is happening but I do hope that we can get a joint up process around getting this information I did wonder whether three should be changed to do not pursue a local alcohol policy at this point in time because I would hope that the work will begin and it 's already happening I would hope through the alcohol action plan that if the evidence was asked to point in a direction where it is clear that there 's things that we can address through a lap they 're not like us to start it I don 't want us to I mean personally my view is that this is not about whether we 've got an upcoming election or not it 's actually about being able to support through the process the the with evidence to get the outcomes that the community are seeking and at the moment it feels to me given what 's happened in Auckland Wellington Donita that we don 't have systems in place where we conversation with our community over how we address developing a layer so I just think that um there 's a lot of work that has gone on as someone who sat through the process last time I I did think it was a missile debate so I did think that we spent like thousands of hours looking into this this will be a very if we agree to do a lap now it will be a very intensive piece of work and we 've got major pressures on us in terms of I think the next at least six months at least at the end of this year around things like our long term plan our relationship with central government a number of key infrastructure decisions and so forth so you know I think we need to keep doing work around getting the evidence that can show that we can develop a really arrant plan but having said that the irony of course is that our submission initially in 2011 asked government pleaded with government to be very clear about what evidence was required because we were so concerned at and I think if you look back to our solutions you look at what 's happened around New Zealand and whether our our plan you can see that the legislation was amiss and it didn 't actually help it made it very difficult for people it 's wasted a lot of money in time and I think it 's a totally unsatisfactory process so let 's get a bit of process and spend the time getting that the things in order before we agree to do a lap I don 't think we should be doing it because of this term I would just say that we did hear comment that we could proceed and justify the 21 hours a my understanding from what we went through is that we basically had to go back on the hours of operation that we proposed to reduce because we couldn 't support it so I 'm not quite sure where that argument is coming from because my understanding is we we couldn 't justify the proposal that we put in which was to reduce the off-licence hours so I 've spoken since the second of the resolution we 're quite happy to change the words from in the existing term to at this time yeah Tim thank you I was going to say something along those lines so three changes that when our communities not only our communities what communities throughout New Zealand have made it very clear they want to take control and have a say in their communities of where these places go so I think it is essential we 've been been proven to us that last process that we went through that it we but we are not able to do it for whatever reason and it hasn 't worked so I think that this is essential especially nine to go to government that we 've got a new government to say hey look legislation isn 't working your communities our communities throughout New Zealand are saying that we need control and want control and should have control so I am going to reluctantly support this at the stage but to make it very clear that our communities have made it clear to us and we have a it seems to me there there are problems here on different levels one being inherently that it 's called a lap a local alcohol policy and it could be that the price could be that on that live order process has been flawed from the word go we are passed a lot of things from central government that have been in the past and some things we 're still waiting on for instance you know a climate change policy direction so my views on well I can express it better my views on this are that actually it is time for the council to say win for our city on the abuse of alcohol but it 's how we do it and if not support for a lap you know I think we can do it or it could be done through the district plan provisions if you look at the the kind of the preamble or the introduction actually to a district plan including our own plan that says that a district plan must state the objectives for the district the policies to implemented the rules to implement the in which our policies are contained being the district plan so that 's already there so this could be another tool by which to give a fit to it because I still believe that we we actually do need a position we can 't just put it off and kick it into the Nevernever we actually need to get on with it at some point so let 's do policy another way through district plan provision provisions but please let 's get cracking I don 't sense any real change in some drinking habits from from decades ago you know that the students down south that they 're still the same from 30 years ago you know they 're still the same here and it 's it 's runs through all age groups as well so we now we actually going to grasp the nettle and take a position as the local leaders certainly let 's go for it I 'm very keen on the provisions around off licenses specifically we 'll be dealing with density and location I hope holistically and there 's a wider picture over the cynical two things are outside the remit of what we 're doing here but actually it 's all part of a picture of some of the things that can that are really unhelpful in some of our communities so let 's just get into it and not you know not put it off do policy but do it a different way so look counters there are a lot of issues here but I think the bottom line unfortunately is that the local alcohol policy is not sufficiently supported by the legislation in effect if we continue down this this route alone without the changes than legislation we on continue to be on a hiding to nothing and what 's happened to all the four metropolitan areas just proves their point I 'm aware that like this being comments that and still the lack could be at all which we could develop and use when we can but the fact is right now the lap as a tall isn 't strong enough it just is not working it lacks sufficient strength and so that we 've put up in a number of on well III think clearly like the whole objective as a lip of the lab is it has to reflect the views and wishes of the people and currently it 's not able to so that we are taking some measures I hope that we 'll actually be able to strengthen the local community 's ability to actually be involved in make decisions around for example the local its in the area I was fortunate to attend a very strong case that the local people in Barrington put recently and they won and they had good support from Council certainly good support from the community board and and a number of other groups and Christchurch have done there now I think we need to look at how we can empower our community groups so in fact in the interim they 'll be able to take these steps so I think that altogether the the the recommendations here are sensible practical steps that we can take and they will make a difference and I look forward to getting more specific information there as to what we can do to intervene little to serve our purpose today I agree that the resolutions here we have and to face really well with the alcohol action planners eonni pointed out so well in Dion as well and in a way to address I think the issues of the density and the in the locations of the off-licence are definitely an issue it 's been brought to our attention loud and clear by local communities and these are the people who are directly affected and they 've that made that known to us very clearly and I think that we 've actually addressed it quite well in the resolution okay we also agree with Dion Rican turning along the non regulatory path by advocating strong communication between hospitality New Zealand and local groups and I 'd like to remind councillors that back in the day before the quakes I think we used to run hosts hoist responsibility Awards and they were run by the community boards initiative is a really effective way to maintain contact with hospitality venues and to encourage and remind them and to be proactive to promote harm reduction by undertaking good and it was a really really really good practice so we could look up you know reinventing that again and so today I 'll support this resolution and they have a strong emphasis of empowering the voice of our community it 's a good way to start mark thank you know the lip it again is another example of a hospital pass from central government local government you only have to go to the hospitals any no weekends to see the issue it 's just some of it you know it is a tool that we can utilize and I think it 's important that we actually carry on and create a lab and I won 't be supporting items three and I hope others don 't_''_2376.24 I just don 't buy the election year is a reason not to pursue this actually important tool that we can actually use for local communities and it 's very very clear if we look through the framework in the process that actually there 's many points along the line that we can make decisions not to proceed in fact the first one be okay so actually collecting a lot of information a lot of evidence of working out the next bit so I don 't know why we wouldn 't right now so let 's go off the lip and have another look into the June it 's not we need to have that courage to move forward and I come back to the elections in 2019 why do we not make any decisions in 2019 because there 's election year but it 's just not a good enough excuse I won 't be supporting three I will support the rest I hope others also follow at least humphreys recently said they 're a global evidence base of detailed research and analysis of alcohol supply and impact data tells us the simple obvious truths that the more alcohol is made available to the population the more exists that is hazardous levels of alcohol use will be consumed and the more harm will be experienced by the population so we all recognize that alcohol is a toxic substance that must be treated with respect to protect the health of our communities the physical HD an opportunity that provides us in a way to respond to communities that have sorry the local conditions that have developed and are developing and a city in district so I 'm making this decision we must demonstrate that we are listening to and valuing this the voice of our community boards many of who are expressing great concern at the proliferation of cheap liquor outlets near schools and in communities that are already paying an unfair price because of the easy access to alcohol it 's an opportunity for us all to acknowledge these concerns regarding alcohol related harm and proceed with urgency to provide resources to community boards who wish to challenge the proliferation or in density of off-licence premises so I am supportive of these resolutions I including specifically the establishment of maybe a specific staff role to manage the supporting of community boards is they engage in this process so I wonder if we could to maybe consider that there is a designated role people community boards can come to legal advice for support and their fighting taking these cases on thank you thank you the LAPD process entirely the LAPD process is the effective way to deal with that issue we 've noted earlier over speakers who have noted that the medical officer of Health considers that the bars there are safest places for alcohol consumption and their previous la peace that a broader attitude to dealing with alcohol when in reality I think it 's pretty well recognized now that there are two issues that are giving rise to most of the problems that we have in the city and they are a proliferation of off licenses and secondly the pricing structures that some of these off licenses are able to indulge in so I actually believe that the best way that we can be dealing with these issues the first one anyway the proliferation of off licenses is through the district horses we need to write to in the district plan as we see fit and to actually restrict the areas where these off licenses are generating to impose density of of off licenses in particular areas and it is no hidden secret that the lower socioeconomic areas of their city has arsenal that I think we could be using more effectively as well people have mentioned the alcohol Action Plan and we also have the ability through our boiler process to have alcohol bans in areas that are posing particular problems to our city I have some reservations look generally I support the resolution that 's here before us but I do have trouble with reconciling probably three and five really prefers not to go down in la pre-process at all in five you know we are committing a large amount of staff time to process which if we are now looking to defer this decision to the next term of this council we could realistically end up in a situation where that new council decides not to have an L AP at all and we 've expended time and if staff expense in a process that may not be picked up on in the next term so I would have preferred to vote it for a resolution that indicated that we were not going to proceed with an alcohol policy at this time and we deferred any decision-making on whether this area until that council made that decision so I will support the motion before us but probably would ask for number five to put Supra be put separately and I can 't support their one at this stage thank you Harbormaster go till in the regulatory the performance committee meeting in that time I already in favor of option 2 rather than the option 1 because wider as a council I always thought we should take the Putin way now to make a recommendation or make the decision because it will back to a 2012 anterior 2000 the 13th temple I was the hero in pain pain oh I was kind of member we take at least when they have 18 months to establish the after they become the probation or local auto policy they spend upon at least 1.05 to the two million dollars so we need to take the food away but even you know today we take the option to an tier for the letter income in the country it means we are not we another in order to nothing because you reveal all those items probably evidence were aware is very important this said this paragraph summary paragraph ages collect those the sufficient information to learn extra income in the council no they can to establish the these local auto policy smoothly effectively and efficiently this most of the very important special regard into the those Astatula consultative police PHP specialist I still remember back to our several years ago those the state York so T they make a presentation well impressing to remember but when those information after several years of any kind of a change now we need to collect a update information that 's very important the other one is a particular time frame it because the last time we step is the local aqua palaces theaters and take the eighty eighty month they sample we mention a give to the letter the incoming counsel so so it will reviewer 9.19 in here one of these advantages of option ones these options unlikely to provide an opportunity for the incoming counsel to have significant input policy then if we review all those the option Wanda those eleven the process steps every evidence September 2019 these are the local policy will be put to the puppy not notified I thought because we already you know have this kind of experience so time friends we need to consider us as well now so I think this one is a quite holistic way and also robust distinct thinking so I supported this way thank you might as well free hit you look I 'm glad to see that the council has come to its senses on this and you know I very much support not pursuing policy at this time I think the problems that we 're trying to solve which in the main are off licenses in local areas can be dealt with through either the district plan or district licensing committees and we definitely need to be a bit stronger there the other issues really need to be dealt with by the government I mean the law commission was very clear about this they made the recommendations about minimum pricing government needs to get on with it and save us all a lot of time and money so I think when you put another local alcohol policy that the next counts we 'll have a look up where the government is on this and from there and in the meantime we should do some work on making sure that we 've got the powers around off licenses in community areas and that 's where we should put most of our energy is really a central government issue thank you I 'm really glad that somebody finally referred to the law commission report because I did recommend to everyone that they read it before they come here for the debate today so did me just quote from us that is recognized in the international literature that there are seven major policy levers available to reduce alcohol related harm regulating the physical availability of alcohol through restrictions on time place in density of outlets regulating conduct and commercial drinking establishments taxing alcohol and imposing controls on price regulating advertising promotions and marketing imposing penalties for alcohol-related anti-social behavior such as drunk driving education and persuasion with the provision of information and increased availability of treatment programs with screening and brief interventions and health care now need a combination of those you don 't get effective change and behavior unless you use the multiplicity of tools that are available we 've been sold a pub the communities been sold a pub they think that they 've got their ability to determine local alcohol plans and they don 't because the one thing that the community you know kept putting their hand up about and saying we want more than anything else over and over again is we don 't want bottle stores in our neighbourhoods selling cheap liquor in our neighborhoods that 's what we don 't want and it 's the one thing that our alq local alcohol plan couldn 't have delivered anyway because there wasn 't sufficient evidence available at the time when a council thought it was a good idea to get on with the job ahead of the city getting back to situation as normal they might have had the the right heart for it but they weren 't engaging the brain they really should have waited until our city was settled down but the requirement of the local alcohol policy that it has to show the connection between its impact and alcohol related harm and minimizing alcohol related harm has set a bar that is too high when you consider it on its own and you know if I can walk into a supermarket and seek lenska and wine or clear skin wine whatever it is for 6.99 a bottle it 's 750 mils of alcohol Oh God I mean but but but when you see when you see that that 's the problem when you see the proliferation of outlets that are just driving down the price of alcohol that 's the problem we can 't solve that problem so I fully support their holding off of this not because there 's an election going to happen next year and in fact I actually resent the fact that it has even considered that that would be the basis for putting this off a previous council developed a plan and then left it to an uncommon council to notify we delayed notification because we could see that the city was still developing still forming and still going to face a of some of these establishments occurred I thought that the medical officer of Health gave outstanding deputation to our council and he said that the safest place to drink is on licensed premises and it is true that is the safest place the drink we have a very good working relationship in the city always have done with hospitality New Zealand we 've got a we 've had a one-way door policy operating in the city before they were operating in other cities that I was certainly aware of that before I became the mayor having been to many meetings I 've been out on the streets with the police before midnight and after midnight I 've seen what the city was like I have to say that the fact that our city was the front page poster child of the law commissioners report is not something that any one of us should be proud of but our city 's coming getting back on its feet and I want us to be able to work with central government to develop a suite of tools that they will implement and then I 'd end that 's not all of you have read the law commission report I just thought I 'd end with the the what they had proposed should be put in legislation which is restricting the times alcohol can be sold restricting places etc etc preventing a growth growing proliferation of alcohol outlets but it said providing for local alcohol policies to be decided by councils so that 's the that 's the key to making them successful and financing liquor licensing monitoring and client compliance through license fees not a combination of fees and rate payer contributions and that sheets home the costs where they belong so that 's why I support the resolution that we are now presenting but there is civil want to vote on number three separately so I 'll put number three or number five okay so sorry what just to take out the reference to the report is it okay yeah okay so just just you know take and afterwards yeah okay so I 'll put I 'll put number five all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so it and I 'll put number three all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so that 's Davidson and Templeton it 's at all yep and I 'll put the balance of the recommendations all those in favor say aye

that we deal with together and we 've got a did we put some wording up yeah we 've added some wording which has requested after monitor the effectiveness of the changes on diets Pass Road from hackathorn to Governors Bay for a full 12-month period from the installation of the speed limit signs and the no overtaking lines and report the results together with interpretation and thickness of the treatments so good so presuming we proceed then we we review after 12-month period we 've got the all the data that comes forward in that period clause for education the issue of passing cyclists on when they 're at yellow lines even though it may push you over the yellow line is legal and the staff thanks very much staff have identified their and and other issues associated with traveling on dice Pass Road we 'd like an education yes so relation to the decisions on the changes and Di 's parts are you alright so um fell I 'm assuming you want to move it and two months to second it so are there any questions Jonnie both Pauline just through well hang on do we have staff for the questions yeah come forward sorry I 'm not gonna expose the cheers to technical questions for her just one to nine on section five point 13 the lower section of dyers Pass Road on Governors bay side has a lower level report accidents compared to the balance of the right however the accidents along the section are considered high relative to other roads in Christchurch so I 'm struggling with idea that we only do this on one side given that you 're telling us in the report the advice is that this area is still actually a high risk compared to other roads in Christchurch so can you just help me understand why the distance being made not to ok well whoever 's made that decision nor can we just get some understanding of why that was made yeah were considered to be quite different in part and certainly the theme of the submissions from each side of the hill were quite different there was a very strong view expressed particularly by the Governors Bay community but others on the diamond harbour the diamond harbour side of lyttelton harbour as well that the yellow lines were not appropriate for that part of the road apparently because of the narrowness of the lanes and the state of the road and also a big part of the consideration was around the understanding of the ability of a driver to be able to cross the yellow line to pass a cyclist and whilst we heard from our staff that that was in fact the case under the road rules information was presented from the NZTA website and from other sources that showed that it wouldn 't be easy for a member of the public to realize that that was the case and the thinking of the Banks Peninsula board was that the loose gravel on the road they overgrown vegetation the narrowness of the lanes and the general public understanding that it it more dangerous for cyclists than if the yellow line was in place so this really responded to submissions that we heard and read from the governor 's Bay community in particular so the banks peninsula board decided to support the lowest speed limit and that certainly was around matters of road safety but not to support the yellow line which we felt could easily make the road more dangerous for some road users rather than safer certainly to support the monitoring certainly happy to support the community education program and I think it 's fair to say the Banks Peninsula board would be very happy to look at this and quite possibly look at it differently once we 've seen some further information that sets some of our concerns with that part of the rotor side so it can can staff just give a breakdown of the submissions if you took out each section what the percentage in support of the double yellow lines would be for each side yellow lines isn 't a decision they 've already made that decision yani okay so this is a local right so that 's the speed limit changes and it 's the education and the now the review after twelve months so we 're good with that Phil I just want to make sure because this came up at the meeting as Carol indicated and just to ensure and I 'm sure the staff will develop a plan around it because it 's clearly a crucial part of the process but Rev can staff want to comment on that now the Plitt know the plan for the education part of the in understanding by the public john got a team of three or four people involved from marketing communications undertaking a undertaken provider construction during construction and post construction it 's one of the key messages that we 're getting across social media and media resume the importance of cycling vehicle safety slogan thanks john that sounds really clear and I guess the other complete pack two though is clear signage being part of this correct yes as part of this game there 's going to be past cyclist safety soreness which is permanent feature on the right locations across the alright so um if I 've got a mover and a seconder right Tim and felt any discussion Taman Andrew right Thank You Phil that 's very generous of you I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you thank you very much comment that they were a couple of remarks made during submissions which were directed at staff and the staff acted with great restraint in the expertise thank

report straight after there 's this sounds like a bit of a sickening road but I 'd already written down that I just wanted to comment that the experience was a really good one it was disagreement agreement was a good experience and I enjoyed it thank you very much Melanie we 're going to ignore diets Pass Road entirely because how are we going to come in do you want us to comment about anything else other than come to the council do you want us to briefly discuss the yellow or just wait no no wait wait for the joint yeah so you leave leave the party yeah yeah yeah we 've got a small issue in Kashmir next door to what used to be a Masonic Hall we 're just now under new ownership we there used to be an access road which involves the school occasionally primary school and now into how it 's been blocked and whether it can be whether the bomb is illegal pedestrian pedestrian access restored to the community the Sint Maartens roundabout does everyone know the corner of dies person hits on road cuz there it was a part that people can use and so lots of people would use that pathway going around since that was bought I think it was sold in 2013 since it was bought the people that owned it the footpath part of it is on council land like road reserve and part of us on privately become annoyed with people walking on their private property so filled it with rotten big huge rocks and gardens going over the top to change us and I 'm sure John is going to come up with something absolutely excellent no masses at you mean yeah I 'm talking about this but I 've never been there which I feel quite guilty so hopefully we go when they have here to Jake next time so the the trustees of the motto much house came to talk to us and they told lot of what they do because it takes quite a lot of money to keep this place going so that kids can come on school tours and people from all around the world who are great things of no mashes particularly folks they come to it and they come to New Zealand especially for the papers of actually coming here so it 's a it 's a really wonderful thing in our ward that I 've never been to before but I 'm going to so they were just saying that they 've got money they make money off a property that 's on site like they 've got a sort of carrot or something that someone reads within they can 't engage in too amusing and potentially but they 're just talking about the cost of having to replace the roof sort of something quite unsuccessful for the obviously for keeping it going I don 't think they came to see us but nothing I think they 'll be back please Edington history book and this is a project that has been 15 years in the making John Wilson and there it is near to fruition the board has contributed to it both in knowledge and in small financial donation and it 's likely to be published in June that 's a very big production that 's got a lot of photographs it 's and it 's been printed by Caxton priest so it 's going to be quality and we look forward to that we 've done in the community can review and you 're quite right Dylan we should have brought it to the board we should have brought it to Council or attached it because it really is a good idea to have the community plan drawn to the council 's attention and we 've gone through a reviewer but embrace was just saying how much of the stuff that we had in the plan that we brought you down so we will attach it next time because that 's a good idea and I did want to mention about the playgrounds we 're having a playground built at the moment that is the staff are aiming to have it as pitch perfect we are hoping playground at some renewal of the fairington park playground and they 're aiming to have it as accessible as possible for people with disability and children with disability and and so the discussion around it has been enormous ly complex but I so agree with all the other boards who have talked about having access to the kinds of things that you can have in playgrounds and it would be nice and all playgrounds of kids could have access to water because I think that 's the crucial thing when you look at them playing in magnet main here my grandson was struck naked within seconds of arriving there and twirling the buttons and tuning all the tapes and that playground epitomizes that relationship that to apply it with water and lastly the Pacific Series which was run over a weekly in Mecca November but which and in which we probably discussed at the time and I 'm sure we did and but it involved 600 participants over 30 teams and there were three community boards that contributed financially to it and it was a celebration tration the Pacific and communities for comes to their and it was a huge success and it just sort of doesn 't they didn 't get the media at the time but anyway it was nominated for the Canterbury sports and recreation event of the year becoming and finalists along international events like the Canterbury Crusaders vs. the British and the Irish Lions and the International Hockey tests woman 's Black Sticks versus the USA and we didn 't win but in the end we were the Canterbury sports and recreations rugby league at the end of the year and especially Solomon and Emma and our team and it was just special really special and then followed on from hunain that 's to Easter and the same weekend great so now do we invite that 's what are there any questions on the report Yanni thank you um just in regards to that Pacific series do you think that 's kind of citywide but if we can all all about wards think about as a contribution to be made not just the Pacific community we 've got a we 've got a week we at the moment and that 's the sort of thing that we 're looking at at the moment is are these some events that actually should be made as a decision between councillors and community board representatives so that they across the city yeah and so we 're working up a program that 's around there so that really looks like one of those and just I just wanted in terms of no marsh house I mean McKean like it seems the sort of thing that we 've just established a city foundation and I know that they 're not you know completely up and running yet but you know when you think that causes people would like to give to it did seem something that maybe there 's an opportunity there to kind of connect the two yeah that would be C that 's very sensible idea yonni [Laughter] well you look we agree with you and the extraordinary think in the presentation which went through the house room by room so either really could look at it the extraordinary thing whoa was those things overseas who treated like just like other people come to New Zealand for Lord of the Rings these people come to New Zealand to nomads and of course it 's a name that would be going out of the vernacular of younger people but nonetheless it hold sway I 'm sending an email to Amy Carter as we speak right very good how did they publicize it because I 'm aware of its existence we actually asked it no Sid math and literature societies both of these people who came to see us I 'm just wondering if there 's some way that we could help them to publicize it do you pay when you go to visit it so that 's where they get their revenue from Maliha and from that house next door the original so I 'm just wondering if you could ask them what they would like by way of help with publicity do you remember how much it was to go in money from selling merchandise yeah as opposed to entrance into that can we just take that can we take this offline because we probably will be treating how we can assistant for exclusion in the supermarket last night no inside and side o submergence the best new world in Christ they always we always get really good welcome we 're allowed inside most people that just does that paid so as they paid you right okay thank you yeah just with the two terrific things I think that it 's really important to with the heck thorn dyes pass there 's a really good example of where staff should be coming to the community board first because we 've got some of the wording that came to us was quite concerning with regards to wheeling and dealing with property so I mean there I think that should be a real highlight because that is a real issue in our community in it specifically that corner with young kids and preschools at cetera and there 's a busy corner and when you 've got traffic going downhill it 's always harder to break and we have seen a couple of cars trying to visit the cafe for a takeaway coffee when there is actually no drive-through the issue using the area we did a and thank you John for that information there was a traffic plan safe travel plan done in 2010 and living it 's particularly hard time for everybody in it but I in others coming up and later this year to look at the immediate area but the issue is it 's slightly wider area so I think we 've got to start looking at each area outside the box slightly because it is a real concern especially with their bigger tracks in the in the morning those am that designed to be you know residential community but they are ran by commercial vehicles it 's just the way we Tim that 's your way of moving the receipt of moves and seconded by Phil and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and eye-fucker them fight _"

move to the next one is about Accra or wastewater yesterday afternoon we had an update on a corral wastewater we had well after that net meeting we had a long-term plan drop and forum which was very well attended there were 25 odd at that but in between that we said farewell to the cruise ship season and as I stood outside welcoming guests I heard the last cruise ship season and they played with their their stacks and we had two cruise ships five thousand passengers possibility of five thousand in the harbor and they blew as they went out of the harbor so that was a lovely close to the season but just getting to the the echo all waste water and they have been particular challenges with that for the community I 'm not quite sure whether you 're aware that there is a wastewater working group at the moment that has been working for quite some time and those people that are involved in that program have been had to be very committed they have attended the meetings that we 've had and read digestive things and we 've got some of that communities that are very able to to search for further information about wastewater systems table so if you remember last year we had a problem with some meters that were required recording appropriately and we now find what we 've got the double amount of the wastewater that we thought we had so it has created some extra problems for us and that we need larger areas to trial and disposal and of course we 're working under an Environment Court direction that we need to look at land disposal so we have been directed what we need to look at and that is what we 're looking at along with cultural significance to an OCO and night are whoo so we 're working through that we have come up with a new process that they 're looking at which is deep well injection which it so it sounds it 's not freaking and all and they reiterated last night but it is about putting the treated wastewater back through a bore down into the down below the level of the sea down below sea level it hasn 't been done much in New Zealand but it has certainly done with putting water underground it is a way it 's been done in other sort of situations but not using waste water or this is clean waste water is treated so yes so that 's what we 're moving through at the moment we are looking we 're working towards a consultation period and in July August I think followed by a hearing process that 's if we can find some agreement around what were the options that will go forward with this and the funding is currently included in the LTP so we need to be moving ahead with that as soon as we can get an agreement to it so there is great interest in that it 's not an easy decision and we look forward to the next round of consultation with the community that has been a challenge and we 've just been very thankful that we 've been given the opportunity to have a working party so the next issue is freedom camping while freedom camping won 't go away an echo last night as I drove over for the meeting there were 40 parked in the boat park 's only four toilets pretty ruddy toilets there 's no dump station down there and they were a mix of vans from the the self-contained the cars and the little sliding door vents so we have had we have had a continual pressure on us to resolve it and we are looking for a fast-track of having something in place for next year to resolve the issue and we 're looking focusing on a car in particular at the moment with further and looking at further review on the bylaw so we 're looking at further work and a started work already with the council team looking at a survey in our community and we have some ideas already what we might move forward with so we hope that the council will be able to support us with a when we come forward with a recommendation the next one is something exciting I thought we were tell you about something exciting which is a little dance skatepark upbraid which is an amazing amazing project and it was funded also by Southport so there was funding available for the Asian that little project that there 's still some murals that will be done around the outside wall and that 's just going through some engagement process of project at the moment so these Andrew in the middle there I think he what I don 't know what you 're holding there Andrew but Andrews in the middle of that [Laughter] hundred someone celebrations going on over the over the peninsula with Alan Dale hall coming to its fruition of its and a reopening we 've got spades and the ground with the social housing we 've got a spade in the ground with the ekor are integrated Family Health Center and Hospital there 's an amazing number of things going on we had an amazing program and pigeon bay at the weekend with some discretionary response funding a rock or a aurora not foie gras walker our pigeon bay art and trial exhibition you know just with a little bit of mumbling what communities can do so I won 't talk about I hope you 'll read through our report there are a lot of things in there that should be are where we are within our board plan and the things that have been done with it so Dion looked at me before and said I had to be bright and breezy so so not we haven 't got the time to go through all of those issues that are down there but there are raft of issues in our community that we are addressing I 've just wondered around the free the freedom camping and I see that your board are likely to come ask for a review of the bylaws and that makes sense from from what you 've seen but I just wondered what to be and I know boards have got a lot to do this one would be useful to compile some of the information from other community boards too in terms of complaints received and members observations so that in fact we received some of that together what I would imagine that will be just dealing with majority of the major issues but it 's being discussed nationally as well and Andrews going to be attending a national seminar on us that 's LG 19th that 's right and Nelson on the 19th of April I 've also been invited to be a member of a national working group on the matter as well excellent so we have prepared him well yes behave and he 's on absolutely the right community board to be taking up the issues for Christchurch do mine yeah so yeah just in closing I just need to say Oh Donahue is the Deputy Chair of the bank 's financial community board unfortunately his daughter has just been knocked off a bike he was duty was going to sit here beside me this morning but her daughters his daughters being knocked off a bike by a tourist just as he was entering a laneway so he didn 't take she say was a cycle way but they 're disappointing to hear but we wish Jaden his daughter well yes absolutely I 'm Glen oh thank you you go over there wastewater process again Pam you just mentioned at the beginning we actually haven 't had a briefing on others account so and it was raised at the tea horn on day so I have our staff to put together a bit of a presentation on it because it 's early days you know no decisions have been made and it is a technique that has been used in New Zealand it 's that 's been used and tarpana up on the far north but it does require for sensitive consultations with with the local Runanga and it does require the community to be fully engaged in the process because it isn 't the same as heat transfer from one level of equity to another it is the disposal of waste water which is the issue you can say it is treated absolutely it 's treated it 's a very high quality but we can 't discharge it into the harbor and so we 're looking for alternatives but we do need to have we do need to have some well at the moment our consent to discharge into the harbor as on hold so we do need to look for all of these opportunities but I 'd much rather that we had a proper briefing on it rather than ask us see the Green is the website but you can go and then it 's got a raft of information a huge Andrew could circulate the link to the website and people could have a look at it but we will get a briefing on it so in that there will be no decisions made yeah I can roll wastewater scheme just Google but Andrew will send the link to it Jian you were pretty pretty all right actually you 're pretty fabulous I just wanted to actually make a comment so it was really helpful having your board plan and your updates it 's actually really like that that was really good I actually when I was reading that it was very helpful and good to sort of know where the cords are at on these occasions or things yep Andrew he 's taking a picture of that 's all right thank you the one thing you didn 't mention Pam was that since we last saw you in your role as acting chair yes we did have an election at the community board for chair and Deputy Chair Deputy Chair but what you didn 't tell us of course that you 've been formally now elected as the chair of the bank 's panel which I 've now realized that I 've just just highlighted by calling you that congratulations to do is just to add a further acknowledgement you showed us the pictures of the Middleton skate park opening which was a great event but I just wanted to once again publicly acknowledge the very generous donation that were received from Southport so the port in Bluff and that was really an act of solidarity with the people of Littleton that came about after the earthquakes is taking us some time to get the skatepark finished so that we were able to unsee that money spent for the community but they were very keen to see the funds spend on something that would benefit local youth and it 's certain certainly the case that that skate park will and the check that you saw me holding in the picture was actually a further contribution from Southport so I just wanted to acknowledge they 're very generous do to move that the report be received thank you Jonnie so should we just formally record and maybe get the mayor to send a letter to South Moore just thinking them okay that the mere be sure it 's not been done before yeah yeah but anyway I don 't mind you can never say thank you enough so the council formerly records it 's thanks to Southport for its generous donation to support the Littleton skate park donations plural and so you 'd like to sickened at what Giuliani the resolution thank you right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now if you could just stick on _"

    "text": "Thank You Wilston part transportation improvements project but I have got an answer on the question in relation to whether we have to see the original submissions on theirs and I didn 't appreciate that the last ones were their actual submissions I thought they were just taking elements from them so in would you like to provide advice on whether we are competent to make a decision on this meter given that we don 't have all of the original submissions in front of us but they are fully described in the paper yes there are two points one is that the staff leader two submitters are to the consultation invited submitters to the board meeting on the 14th of March and if they wanted to be heard they could come along the leader didn 't specifically say that there was a final step and that was sign-off by the council but I don 't think you know you asked yourself was anyone disadvantaged by the lessor and I would have to say no the community had plenty of opportunity to be heard if they wish to at the submissions themselves and attached to the report but there are three detailed pages of an analysis of those submissions and I think the council could quite reasonably say well we 're sufficiently informed about these submissions to make a decision today without actually seeing every single submission that was made this month you thank you so it 's someone like to move that we adopt the recommendations Sara seconded dion is there any discussion a question have person prior to the meeting and that was have we had any information back from the Ministry of Education about what traffic safety improvements or funding that they will contribute towards us given that this as a result of the merger of the two schools and it was a decision of the I 'm not sure that they 've been approached but can I say for the purposes of this vote let 's assume none and if there is something that 's a plus can we write to the ministry like we 're doing for ricklefs where there actually are going to fund some of the traffic safety improvements yes funding I think council decision encounter stuff we 're in a contact the most happy were on the merger yeah I thought that we 've had some advice on this earlier and that the Ministry of Education is position was that because these were part of the suburban master plan these are you know W improvements that because council had already planned these improvements prior to the school issue happening that it wasn 't willing to contribute because council was already going to do some work those later on in writing from them I don 't know that it was in writing but I think it 's advice that we 've got from with the ministry Oh Jonnie Jonnie Jonnie I thought has spoken to you about that a school in time so we 'll reassess I think it 's different because of that well it was additional that we should read this was that it is not entirely down to the master planning on Ferry Road that the particular changes are proposed so I don 't see any harm and perhaps adding to the resolution that that the mayor right to the regional manager of Ministry of Education to request a contribution towards the cost of the church should be doing it not just for the school but for any school with with these changes have happened resulting and extra safety improvements routing improvements yeah the same will happen very cliffs with the ministry have already indicated they will contribute yeah because of a change so we should be doing it for any school towards the cost of yeah yeah yeah we wear the wear changes to the we changes yeah we 're adjustments have been made to the I mean it 's B races that have moved and brought people to a particular part on the site but if you could say not adjustments sorry towards the cost of transportation improvements we 're with the weird school developments have contributed to the need for the changes we can play around with that 's the G mineral just about all right okay any discussion of yes councils will recall that the school children came in front of us I think it was during an annual plan hearing and we heard repeatedly from cars going through this area reduced and increased traffic safety I think it is a real shame that we can 't lower the speed limit through here and I think we should still be trying to do that a number of some others have have talked about that but their concern I have and if you read the submissions I 'd encourage you to read the submissions the school is not happy with what 's being proposed the after school program across the road is not happy with what 's being proposed a number of people in the community have raised concerns it 's not that they don 't want us to do something but the concerns really focus on the location of the proposed crossing being too close to Hopkins Street which is causing huge problems for the school and people accessing the school part of the issue here is with the merger of the two schools there was no extra land acquired to deal with the increase in traffic that the merger generated and so it 's a bit caught that was a bit galling at the community with the school to sort of attack us for not doing anything in this area actually the ministry should have had some planning towards the merger that provided a safer traffic environment and so as you go through the submissions there 's a number of people that one of the crossing moved further along and if you think about that oh and then the second point is a number of people also wanted the cycle lane Smith Street as a connection they wanted the local connection to connect into Woolston Park and you 've got a nice path going through Wolfson part there could easily have come to the Sheldon straight and the river cycle ways that we 're looking at but this plan does not do that the shared pathway additional theoria stops outside the school it doesn 't connect into the park which i think is a real lost opportunity also we could I believe move the crossing further away from Hopkins straight satisfy the concern that the school is add as to where the accidents have actually happened and get a better outcome that more people are the local business on the corner of Smith Street who has been through a horrendous time with the skirt work that took well long over Jo and just absolutely crippling and that business is now going to lose its parking which will probably mean it lose its light loses its livelihood and I think that 's a real shame if you extend the crossing further to where actually it 's no man 's land you 've got the park on one side and the old Korean church that has no driveways has a huge connection to our urban forest you could have a much better safer crossing so I just I support the idea of doing the traffic safety in this area but because of the concerns that have been raised in the proposed location I will not support this I would ask that you put eight separate and I also just raised the concern that you know I do think it 's unfair that the submitters were not told that this was going to the council there have been other cases where we 've had Ric residents from record to us about things that have been via community board and then to counsel and I think that 's good I think people should be given the choice and have the opportunity to come and talk to us because we as councils other decision-makers and I do worry that the president the seats with us not citing these submissions from individuals when we 're making decisions if we agree to this today I 'm Sarah thank you the community forward who I think we should be trusting and in this situation he 's seen the submissions and he 's heard from staff and council your Hansen 's concerns were raised at the board meeting and the the staff were able to answer those ones completely to the rest of the board satisfaction moving the crossing from where it is currently recommended to be simply transfers the problem yes it could be potentially safer for those who love further down whom might not walk as far to the crossing where it is currently but conversely those people who currently use the crossing and that 's the majority of them would then without it and so it would just transfer the problem end and so to keep the crossing in the desire line for the majority of people who would use it safely to highlight the area is a crossing point to get the school to do and encouragement work with their students to educate them say use the crossing all of that kind of stuff will be really important we did make a change based on reputation of the day and that came through actually in a memo and I need to just make sure that that 's captured by the resolutions today the minutes of our meeting would change at our board meeting on Tuesday because they didn 't reflect the the noting provision the board made on the day we didn 't have the screen in front of us on the day we 're at a different site for a board meeting and it was that staff are going to work to make the cycle lane through the intersection improvements or the safety improvements 1.8 metres the whole way through by slightly narrowing the median in slightly narrowing the because the cyclone had gone down to us at 1.6 meters around that area and so that 's going to be changed can I just make sure what does that put it was in a memo that came that 's also an era Jean two documents okay so dude it should be it 's an agenda documents if you go take it word for word yeah it 's been incorporated to make it the whole way yep it 's the additional make sure that it was yeah all right but the board were satisfied by the by the staffs explanation and answer to a council your Hanson 's questions at the time okay well the only thing I want to add is in relation to the point that councillor Johansson raised about whether or not people should have an opportunity to make a deputation to the council when we 're just simply being asked to endorse the decision of the community board I think that if we 've got a commitment to delegating decision making then a stick to that is actually trusting the community board to hear the submissions required in exercise their judgment and I want to back the community board the community boards made a decision and that 's why I want to support the whole of the resolution I think that one of the one of the things that perhaps hasn 't really been made crystal clear is that I have a discretion as the chair of dust meeting to allow deputations or not and if people have had the opportunity to make their deputations to the community board which is where appropriately should be made then as a general rule and I can 't have general rules when I 'm exercising a discretion they would help there is a relatively high bar that you would have to reach to show why it was not possible to make a deputation to the community board and why making a deputation to the council just before it 's due to make a decision is actually required because I don 't think that there would be many instances that would fulfill their criteria and I 'm going to ask the legal people to look at the standing orders again the standing orders and make it crystal clear I do not believe it is a good decision-making process when you 've had hearings when you 've had submissions when you 've had opportunities to test these things at a committee level or at a council the community board level and and then you basically get a second bite of the cherry even though you 're a different individual to have the case presented in a particular way just by those who turn up on the day making a deputation I don 't think it 's a good decision-making process we had that occur with the local alcohol plan and actually in a way deferring the decision away from the the whole of the presentation the deputations that we had on the day has enabled people to sit back and take stock and think through their issues and I think that makes for a better decision-making process so I am going to ask staff to work on the the wording of the of the Standing Orders to make it clear that the that the deputation set with the with those that end of the day can I just say that no because we 're in debate we 're in debate so yeah I normally look at these things with a fine-tooth comb generally because of the cost that 's involved in these type of Road in projects and the need to get them done right first time but in the community board and we 've gone through this a fair bit and and yannis concerns are there and in some of them are valid but the staff have done in my opinion a pretty good job of actually getting this one sorted out and so from my perspective when I was looking at it I was pretty comfortable and I think it 's it does it does look at those safety concerns that the school was head as far as I 've been told and seeing and it will address some of the issues that are around there so I think it is good to get this just done sort it out and if there was some savings to be found in the in the budget it would be good to so hopefully maybe we can keep working on that if there is a possibility of finding some savings in the work but yeah I mean I do look at these things there 's a bit of a fine-tooth comb because of the money that 's involved but I think it 's a good one to get done _"

would be really quite good to have a few speed restrictions around the hills at the 30 or 40 coming through their community board decisions and a delegation the Linda Boston Paul de contas gone out for site selection the following one actually should be there 's a she under I and we 've got if there template alcohol being still in England village and we 've got a question here out at the moment asking people in the area what they think of it and from what I 'm hearing back it 's got full support to continue either as a temporary or a permanent ban in that area some of the changing sheets and water founders project in we did the Sydenham quarter we put some money into getting a person to help promote that area walleston park upgrade that is going to heat but these pieces of extra equipment that you see there they are to be funded by the board just some extra equipment and near for accessible player equipment to go in the year there extra pieces we allocated some funding to for youth development several different people and we also reallocated funding to the Mount Pleasant Memorial Community Center residents Association there is the park transportation improvements project we 'd really like you to vote on this today because we feel that it 's gone to a community board and it 's got nearly the full support of board and we also feel this all the submissions that came into this were analyzed by staff and on your report you 've got the staff analysis even though you haven 't got the actual submissions you 've got a staff analysis of them and we 'd really like to see this go ahead because it 's that 's a huge safety risks down there down there and kids trying to cross and the sooner we get this done the better Penfolds club cottage sits and they 'll see people ready to be done we 'd like that done as soon as possible and we agree with staff recommendations we just want to hurry it up because it 's deteriorating quite rapidly and significant council projects and the board area we 've got some the master plan which is scheduled to begin in May we 've got the apparel volunteer library we rebuild I think the last scene that 's on that Sears we wait we meet bi-weekly I think that should say bimonthly and we 've got a little working group which is working through that and we 've got some of the first stages of a design going to go out in Boston community library it 's a paired they come prepared us down for that now and then we 've come to the alcohol ban and adonus just got to let us through to say that support for this to continue or experiment one I think I think that residents want a difference to the area that were and also the activities that our staff Dana and the other staff I 've put on around that area is making a really big difference isn 't it we have been having some really there 's a lot of work going on and the community by local community groups and working closely with local organizations in the area and there 's still a couple of zom from the park sessions to be here until the end of term one until end and we 've been on a regular basis getting 50 to 60 people coming along to those which is being fantastic and it 's just wonderful to see people even just walking along the street and just being uplifted by the music and joining under a bus and then carrying on so issues Vince projects we 've got a a networking forum for all the youth agencies around learn what and will be given regular updates on that though I 'm out of food Commons if you 've never been to Radley Park you could appreciate that this part virtually will be transformed lot of fruit trees in there and and they 're doing a heap of work that can be a community group for doing that but they 're working with counseling office to get a good design for the area as well and they need irrigation to go in there as well our life festival was held on the 17th of March and we did it from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. this time as sort of you during the afternoon and it seemed to work really well that timing didn 't it was a bit cold and it day but but there are heaps and heaps of people there and a lot of fun we also we also had a whole lot of LTP consultations we just report meetings that we had to but we actually had five and we had we also held a tent at the life the life event where the young people put on consulting with young people it was really good and all of them of submissions and naturally you 'd be we 're that the biggest interest it behaved in the biggest mission amount Paul and water community facility so it 's it 's really top of everybody 's mind and we just getting so many submissions on the commendable measures of interest simply skate went but it 's already been installed and I think it 's been very well used serum I 'd like to say something about that from what I 've seen when I 've been over there it 's been very well used and we made a presentation to district licensing committee on the set of alcohol applications on off-licence and the results of that the decision hasn 't been made yet I won 't talk about it anymore I only did the garden Awards as well and they 're always popular you know wonderful we did them at some that this time and very well very well team did everybody seen so the stuff that you 've got in the pictures and it 's a twisting part where you 've got the talking tubes and things like that yeah a grand playground yeah yeah do you have costs for those on top of what was already going to go you have access to something that said here are all the interesting playground initiatives no we didn 't only come back with and we should actually have that for all the community boards should be given you know sort of pictures and an array of what can be incident there in any program if we could have something like that all the community boards because I think what you don 't know you don 't know yeah and so you 're choosing from something that is only what you 're familiar with one of you thinks I 'm just I 'm just passing on to the chief executive that maybe you know presentation on all the options that are available to for equipment to go and community playgrounds would be helpful for community boards that are considering particular playgrounds I 'm Sarah you know Clara following on sorry this is following a border we say the the playground it 's helpful when to out like so did the community consultation what we 'd like to see here 's some ideas that sort of staff and when it came to us what we can do the board went based on the feedback that we 've had from the community who had said actually be really good to have some of this as well once they 've seen the plane we went well what could we add as a board and what could we pay for that 's to do with accessibility stuff so we asked staff to come up with some things and then we said here you it start to add to what counsel had budget for it would be really good exactly unfortunately not all because there was some brain taking we just get so excited by it will be really good to hit in the meantime in the meantime just in case it doesn 't happen overnight then week what we could do is we could actually get the information about what is available because I agree and also don 't don 't think for a minute that you have to be restricted to your own expenditure you know within you know calling on the ratepayers of Christchurch Sara I am speaking to the we don 't have may well be that a local business would want to sponsor you know a couple of things you know so it 's not just it 's not just about what 's available that we can fund or the community board can fund but also what are the sponsorship options as well absolutely and it was briefly discussed but for this area in particularly and the way that community operates it was the quickest and easiest way for the board to fund some extra boats yeah yeah yep yep so you know I just wanted to ask silly about Cobb Cottage I don 't know if you want me to ask us no I know because I see more leave pate is complicated mmm Jonnie just in regards to the playground the other thing that was discussed at the board which would be really nice to get the children actually involved in making some of these um playgrounds so that you know there 's been some very successful models up and I think is it Masterson where they 've actually built a kids playground saved a lot of money and got get some way forward on that and so we 've got all these amazing men 's sheds but they might just be sheds and making stuff in our city but there 's also some fantastic work happening it very made with Juliet from rekindle around what would being turned and using old methods to make new things out of wood from our trees that and so it would be I think really good to look at how we can do more of that because those are resources that exist but we we do tend to struggle when we get the reports to the board around being able to get that sort of interaction with those community type projects so we 're getting information back on the equipment can we get some information back about those other opportunities yeah I agree we 're not waiting for a strategy no men sheets a ahead of the strategy means sheets are an obvious place to engage so I think they 'll be good but I mean there are others you know but I mean we 've already heard about the lines you know rotaries are always looking for projects to get involved on you know that they 've done some amazing work around the country city you know in country anyway there was somebody else that had their hand up no okay so with Sara and Gian move second ders will receive the report we 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried and now we 'll move on to pee _"

but I 'm sure she 'll be watching ready to tell me something wrong resident etc around to look what 's happening hey you notice the blue sky it 's a fantastic day people really got involved in it and as you can see it was tested this is Dan at New Brighton seaside market how there 's counselor East their shopping tasty cooking telling people helping people what a few people who are interested this was a drop-in center this is above the the community complexes coming up it was a forum the reason associations it was really good it 's these type of things are really good because it gets the reasons associations in the look and they appreciate it and we appreciate some it was held in the red zone and as you can see the numbers just amazing just goes to show what you can put on no thrilled to say that many people close to my house this is that right white Juke festival of surfing that we helped provide some money for this was the outdoor movie night this juke Karamoja festival is omits the beach surfing event in New Zealand now 250 70 entrants from Australia ignites in New Zealand all ages and fantastic amount of kids of course with kids you get the parents funny enough we had a bit of wind on the last day to weave windy but it was a fantastic event and they said it 's the biggest one in New Zealand now this was the this was to celebrate the opening of the boardwalk and the GDP we hit the community come along we provided a bit of barbecuing and sausages that was just to celebrate our new boardwalk and just celebrate living in the area the other one there is their garden pride Awards great turnout it 's interesting to see what 's fascinating to see how many people are still getting into their guns and and under very difficult conditions that some have been very dry and some beautiful gardens and still lots trying to get their gardens back in order okay exam this is about consideration oh if we 're trying to get things sorted out in New Brighton like with contracting rubbish tins have been a big issue for us and I believe other places as well so we 're trying to get one contract just to specialize and we 're cleaning up because it is leaving our area down particularly a good thing we found we were doing things on the day rather than the day before this is appointing we got through it you always do what 's got involved and another thing that 's come up to is the the bus stop the bus is pulling the buses out of some important areas it 's a real struggle for some people it 's their only way of getting to some of these places like the pumps so the board is actually and we actually made our position known to stopping the buses so we can work on now I 've mentioned before about the difficulty in getting resource consents in the high Flender high flow management zone and into their properties believing they could build nice houses next to them and then finding out when they go to get their resource conceit and they cannot sum up speed 250 plus on sections and contained plans and G ot reports it 's very distressing it 's not good for the community I 'll make it I 'll say again these are not six instead of standing on their own these are six that perhaps have got a million-dollar house alongside them brand-new ones so it 's very concerning also the we the board received an independent abra assessment of the hazardous trees on the history each of the separate and domain we 've agreed with the recommendations in the report to mitigate risk but which is this stage only looming but really if you 're looking if you look at the comparison like I showed before here 's the stumps I was talking about previously this is in Rafferty golf course so dumped honestly me not avarice but today Lehman 's eyes they look pretty okay compared to the ones on each of the South bright in the East trees we 're about to lose another row we 've got probably two more rows to go yeah it 's a creeping unsightly analyze think extremely dangerous there 's a walking track right alongside event weather event it just breaks the whole thing this is for dementia with the board supported again another thing a sick thing and we seem to have all these have been some beautiful days this is coming up shortly it 's always a big event from New Brighton we just actually had their monument protected from we 're troubled graffiti but it looks fantastic now surround around it always very very popular and it 's crowded so I 've got a video yeah this is the highlight we 're probably out doing everybody in this one [Music] [Applause] [Applause] you like playground your favorite and [Music] [Music] [Music] honestly I think the point you mind guess we were trying to get across the or Kim was once there look it 's used by the whole city it 's fantastic they were plants people they were actually no honestly we we often go down there and come from you know everywhere so been a great success and I think a big success has been they and the temperate water thanks so much for you the council supporting them by the way in 6 a.m. we hit a partay Wayne Geller is here if there 's any questions I 'll be coming up shortly thank you that 's a very comprehensive report time questions David I 'd like to just elaborate just a tiny bit on the qe2 consultation that we engaged in a couple of weeks ago in there for me it was a fantastic concept that we delivered in that area where the key point was instead of going to a local or the community board and putting up some displays and inviting the public to come to a venue to discuss their thoughts on a development of the new area we went to the area and invited the public to come to us put on a barbecue and frankly I expected we might have got somewhere around about a hundred people turn up I was absolutely gobsmacked that we we got somewhere close to the geology of the place and what couldn 't couldn 't be done in various areas so I really commend that sort of process to council going forward if you are looking at doing some consultation around the development of a new facility Theatre Park theater building whatever that we actually go out on-site and invite the public to come to the venue that we are considering to engage with them there it 's great they give a hands-on appreciation of what your what the area is what the potential could be if it 's a park or a building but just in general commending that sort of process to council going forward when we 're looking at consultation process community so it was such a wonderful way to do things and Pauline thanks David that 's helpful I 'm just wondering if the commercial area has noticed you 've particularly the kids are playing and I think the best thing about it is it 's introducing people that wouldn 't normally come to New Brighton and mini shops are actually knows to pick up but it depends you know people because it 's across the road and so easy while I 'm here I 'll do the shopping so that 's the whole idea of it it 's the revitalization of New Brighton so bring people down show them the phones and they will come may just the post-it notes on the date qe2 had to be changed three times but the staff there were that many kind of you know ideas put forward which is preventers but yeah is Tim and David have said that the street was full I suspect live great community by and as a result just on other matters the residential red zone we don 't we used for children 's day Brian Fairburn was delighted and I think he 'd love to see that area used again the corner of Locksley near Brighton Road and the board has funded some of his operational costs going forward and my sense is that the communities along the river are open to the conversation over through the temporal use working through loops there 's a kind of a broker which wraps up a whole lot of point I the point in your report 8.3 the the resource consent it is quite a concern when I hear that stuff and I just wonder if there 's anything we can pick up from this they could actually just strengthen the work that we could do as a council to support the community board in these matters because it is quite serious well there won 't be the only affected community board so I 'm actually sort of slightly side treat myself and gone on to the district plain website I can 't open the map on on my iPad so yeah what we might do is see if we can and I know that the staff are going to be meeting with the community board chairs on another matter and it may well be that there might be we to kind of instigate that for the community boards I think that meetings on tomorrow so that would be a good place to raise it but I think from a council position it would might be quite good just to get a series of maps together and then have are affected by the high hazard flood areas planners and to a community board meeting and we 're in and and there is a co.design process that 's being developed and I don 't know whether I think councillors have been briefed on it but there 's a co.design process around the whole regeneration strategy for South Shore and South Brighton which I have to say as as a as a process that I 'm really really interested in because instead of council going in and saying this is what we are going to consult you on council and regenerate have gone on hand-in-hand and said with the community what is it that we collectively would need to do in order to progress this so they haven 't they 've gone on not not with a clean slate because they 've got you know of obviously ideas ideas on both sides but they 've gone on with a with an open mind and in an open heart a real willingness to engage the community in the co.design of the process that they 'll be going through so that might be 'm actually sneakily I 'm thinking that that there may be some people that purchase properties before the district plan changed and they may have thought they were able to rely on existing use rights that had expired but existing youth rights have actually been the bane of future planning and high hazard environments all around the country so Christchurch is not alone and and trying to resolve all of these tricky issues so if we take some advice from the staff will we 'll work out a workshop approach to this where we can certainly help community boards understand their way through it as well somebody who approached me and did say me just sold a section and they believed they could build on their you know I think they were told they could but they might before the district plan changed you know they say yeah but they may have sold in the last week they may have sought advice earlier you know so it 's just we don 't know so we do know it 's a problem in other areas as well and we will thank and Glen would like to move and sicker than the receipt of the report I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried we then move on _"

Watson this is really really good so congratulations to the staff and just like here 's very much part of the formation of this cultural organization 16 years ago and halls will quarry green flag award now this is something I don 't know why it never got on the front page of the paper it 's quite amazing that the horse look that the horse will quarry has got the green green flag award for being an outstanding outstanding park and sorry 70 pack of the only Park and clean debris it 's got been awarded and I can remember I can recall hearing on the radio back in the day with dear old Ron right saying he fired the last shot blasting at the quarry and what it was going to turn out like but but division for the Council of the day was for the site and and it 's a reality and to think now that it 's got that very very significant green flag award is is congratulations to the council 's following and to the Rangers in the community that have made this and made it such a a very very special place and our community pride garden really good about here our community and the work that they do and the enjoyment they get in coming together to receive their awards and it also like to acknowledge the sponsors that have some bit of given prizes yeah what we did was we a sort of a a raffle we drew we gave pic of people tickets and then we drew numbers out and people then came up and took them took me a peck of fun of a range of lovely lovely prizes that were presented by different community groups and organizations yeah come in your garden interest the community board continues to be contacted about quarrying issues and the altars Templeton areas and it 's interesting than these important local matters is ongoing and it is something that is not going to go away but it is something that I think as a city we need to be very very conscious of is the effects of quarrying and the environment around quarrys it 's the people 's ability to be able to live safely around the quarry areas and continue with a quality of life and to air parks and and and Road areas and and tightness and I did receive a call from councilor Johansson just last week I think and saying what what Missy entrances we have into our city from from the south and it does need to be to be tidied up so it 's a work in progress and the other thing is they 're on at this month 's hyper helpful random facts goes back to the to the horse will quarry and you can see if we look out the windows of this building actually we can see some of that quarry stone around the Art Center and and provincial chambers all of those places and and it was a the deans brothers actually found notice that that quarry area and then the rot fear when they were going to to backwards and forwards to occur our to get mail into post ear post email from from a Corral back in the day and they stumbled across that and thought so when they came to brief settlers were starting to build Christchurch they said will we know where there where it came back in the 1860s those are any questions Jimmy well no question I remember in communal meeting expert Eva pointed out one of the key the event or miss out here hello hello so the problem the problem with them not being in the supporters the timing for the report to get to council so the event hadn 't happened when the report needed to p.m. so we will put a next time but it 's a it 's a timing issue we struggle with so that 's I had to look forward to in a much time man I 'm sorry are there no other questions Aaron oh it 's just I noticed your yellow signs behind you Mike on the chair there no quarry signs the tip on that arm for marketing no quarry no worry no quarry no worry okay thank you who 's that thank you I 'm just I 'm just in the process of heading send on an email but I just thought that I would read it to you as part of this meeting dear my this email is to resource consent applications to other territorial authorities or ikan where the application is of particular concern to the local community this is outlined in the delegation register and I 've included the relevant section for use at the Templeton residents association meeting on the 26th of March the community expressed a high degree of comfort and confidence and the delegation for the submitted submissions sitting with your community board the council will provide you with the resources required to submit on the application as a council we can then consider endorsing your submission as a separate process so I just wanted to say publicly that the delegation sits with your community board but will back you all the way yep that 's what we will help provide you with but I 've also spent quite a bit of time explaining to people the difference between the council as an organization and the council a governance body which is what we are and staff who appear at resource consent hearings who do so because of their expertise which is independently provided and cannot advocate for the council 's position so it view to actually go through the legislative framework there 's actually a code of practice there anyone giving expert evidence and the Environment Court and apropos that the the consent hearing itself when they give evidence they actually have to say that they have accepted the code of practice as an expert witness and they are not allowed to advocate for the position of whoever 's paying the bill whether it 's they are an under pendant contractor to to a chlorine company or whether they are an employee of the council they cannot advocate a position they can only present expert evidence so I think that clarification is quite useful if people understand that when a council employee gives evidence expert evidence in the Environment Court or in front of a resource consent hearing they are not representing that Council they are representing their personal professional expertise thank you because I 'm quite keen that we make very strong representations about this quarry can the community as the community broadband by the same rules know so it can actually be more flexible and they but experts that chooses to when you go experience it makes it sound like you 're talking about people that aren 't experts they actually have to state what their qualification is and what expertise they are relying on an order to provide evidence so there 's a standard format to the presentation but we do not necessarily believe as well the advice I 've had from staff is that there may not be sufficient expertise within the council to provide evidence on this matter and it may well be that we have to look outside the organization to find that exactly a separate expertise outside of this piece I was a member of parliament for 23 years it doesn 't make me anything [Laughter] anyway but so so that I 've now sent you their email so the delegation sits with the community board I know that the community board had a discussion about that the other night what you haven 't_''_1096.07 referred to I do please have a further discussion based on my email once they actually see the delegation written there in the fact that we then come on behind and support an issue with that then please feel free to come back but I would be really reluctant to propose that we in any way interfere with the delegation I think the the message I got from the residents Association was a very very high level of confidence than their relationship with the community board thank you so Jimmy chin has moved it and has been seconded by Bucky back and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thanks very much mark _"

    "text": "this community board port council Eddie Jones morning good morning hi all righty seems a bit old news now but I guess that 's you know it 's a month once a month we come back and talk to you but one of the major things an award in the last three weeks four weeks or so is the placement of the Lions transitional well it was the transitional sand albans community center in McFarlane Park and there was a great celebration with a large number of people there community board members Andrew tuna we were very grateful to have council representation there as well with our counselors Pauline Cotter and Mike Davidson other board members and of course the Lions representatives and the thing about the Lions there they were having a International Conference and crusher so it was fantastic to have them there the kids first kindergarten entertained us and were extremely excited about the size of the cake and all the peace afterwards so that was awesome the papanoida Bush at Bridgestone Reserve this is one of our major projects at the moment in the ward we we are going to reinstate the Papa Nui bush the area is known as Bridgestone Reserve it 's on Langdon 's Road next to the railway line if you can picture that there it is there are two plantings planned 1,100 square meters and a thousand square meters we have some funding for the first but not for the second and we will be putting in a bird through the LTP for that this is a board lead project with many in the community involved which is fantastic paavana we neighbors day a few events actually in the ward over the last month or so and the weather 's been good too so Pavan we know today was was the same weekend actually as The MITRE how community Day and The MITRE how community day was that might have helped primary school and we had some great photographs but it didn 't make it into the into the presentation in fact it 's not there at all it was there when I talked earlier it 's disappeared now so and it was the same day as the holy day with had a lot of people turn up that looked like rainbows which was awesome the Rutland Street reserve this was brought to us by a member of the community and we are finding that we 've got community members coming to us directly more and more and what 's really satisfying is that our staff are actively engaging with civic and getting these issues sorted which is fantastic this was overflowing getting Boggy there was a safety issue with the amount of water so this is now not only been cleared up but we 're also looking at a long term solution with the drains there and putting it on the maintenance we had a fantastic presentation from the edgeware pool community group as well and these are some of the images of this community driven project this would not have any operating expenses as it would be run by the community which we think is more than admirable when you look at having to cut your cloth accordingly at the moment with the budgets available this is an indoor pool that wasn 't originally in the plan and this key income stream for the project as well this is on the site of the original a jury pool which was demolished in the early hours of the morning a long time ago I 've got a photograph of my now 19 year old at 2 years of age standing in front of the gates with me on the local paper so that 's what always gives me an idea of how long this projects been going it could be a small gym area as well which has been included in this now Apollo pools are the provider or the organization the company that has done a huge amount of work on this what I might do because I know that pooling can take this away with her this is an incredible document hugely professional and it lists everything and they 're including what is being proposed as far as the building materials the costs at the moment the budget would be between 4 and 5 million dollars tops and I have to say and I know this is controversial too but we do have some projects in the city it would be good to see this kind of project happen in communities allowing more of these to be built where there isn 't any operating expense for the council and it 's run by communities so I 'll just pass this around the Q s and project manager has asked that the final cost is fine at four to five million there is a trade breakdown in the air if that could be kept confidential I 'm just thinking if you take any photographs and that is about all we are still dealing with issues with our roads and the ward we are continuing to have potholes and and some flooding and just basically damaged roads potholes opening up and that 's causing a problem for for our community the CNC projects the Northern Corridor is now very visible in our ward with fences having gone up and the first part of the work starting on the Innes Road intersection and that is going to be very challenging for the community over the next two years or so three years I can just see a whole lot of nods learn my ball stand pause well you know to see what they are proposing and what they are able to come up with granted one is an indoor pool in it as a learner 's pool so it is smaller so this is still an outdoor summer pool but it provides an income that they have included in the business plan which helps that stack up makes it stack up and I think that 's really important and I mean this community group let 's acknowledge them they have spent upwards of ninety thousand dollars so far on getting to this point that is included resource consent applications that 's included I mean you all know the hoops you have to jump through when you put a project like this together and they have in in the face of insurance issues EQC issues land issues this has been a hard hit tc3 area they have kept going it has affected their health and actually I think this will be a legacy for them and I 'm very proud of how hard they 've they 've worked and I must acknowledge that interface between the community board and the council and the group and that 's been very important yeah well it 's you know the you know I have I do sort of make this point a few times in that the sort of theme of the LTP this time as we run this together that this is this is something that a community can do so much better you know with support rather than having it just provided I don 't know why but we end up with a at least a 20% loading on every contract for the reason that we are the council and I know central government faces the same thing procurement rules that are designed to protect the ratepayers or the taxpayers interests actually work counter to that in some instances so the more that we can do in collaboration with communities and its really positive example in city qyz and project manager email me last week saying because they saw it in the local paper that had have been presented to the community border which is great to also closely with the local media small Caroline talked about that this morning and he rang me from seeing that story and said we actually live in the area as a family I would very much like to be involved yeah and and that 's really cool and this is a guy whose skills the group could use very much yeah I 'm Dion and I work with the Sydenham Business Association last night and you know that you know we had a discussion around buck and park and we see bull you know don 't don 't be afraid to actually submit that you take it over I mean don 't you know don 't don 't don 't don 't hold back think of ways that we could engage collaboratively I 'm looking around the table at all these smart and highly networked people and thinking gosh you could help build community at the same time as restore the park to the values that you want and your neighborhood so I mean it 's just I just think it 's a new way of thinking and doing communities must have the support and in and the staff as well yes that 's right as long as we plan front and can manage that it 's a no-brainer but these guys to limit the end yeah any question so make sure having really done this had some discussion with the West sprayed in school Paul committee they built these for around a million dollars in to be some good lessons learned it 's a wonderful success so that you could be good potential I 'm sure to collaborate and would talk with them thank you I 'm sorry I didn 't say I 'm sitting with Christine Lane either who 's now I 'm community board adviser and has been a governance manager sorry for some time now well she did there you know they we 'd it 's like a revolving I mean as far as the roles that people do now it 's sort of what makes your way of saying welcome and it is my behavior alongside no she 's often I 'm messaging me or emailing in the weekend or at nights and stuff like that so you know I know a wee bit under-resourced and are working incredibly hard so we appreciate that yeah thank you and I love your story about engaging around the Bridgestone I remember when Firestone was this certainly a good name for the reserve any others Aaron yeah just like to say as having been a former member of the board with Ellie and Pauline and Mike God I do congratulate them on sticking past and present members of sticking with the project and Edgware it 's been a rough road for some of them especially and so congratulations to them and I do think if this council 's ever to keep and their rates too close to the rate of inflation we would have to partner and have more of these projects pulled off not just with poles but with halls with all of our facilities with parks and things so it is truly the only way forward for us to rein in the rates but with the to square meterage differences because I like to quote your Erin that you used when we went to visit the will winter the opening of Fish a community center that we build yes so as we 're coming in will depends on which one you 're looking at that are closer to 6,000 a square meter and this was half that right the one at Fish Game which was a really nice building up on Jon 's Road and so it 's these partner inks that have to happen for us to reign in our spending it 's the only way around it you know when you when you adopt an existing model like that which is essentially a house that 's been redesigned as a community center but incredibly simple you know and and and beautiful I mean it was a beautiful Center didn 't take much to add to it to make it really feel like it was a fashion game headquarters it only had one fault there was a one-inch eyelet the wheelchair door which I was a high school no but I was incredibly impressed looking about that second it was the one fault yeah thank you thank you very much Shelley that was great David Koch right oh sorry with Paul second does put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a big no bit scary _"

    "text": "we move on to declarations of interest I don 't have any public participation Robert Huffman if you 'd like to come for please thank you okay Wellington where some of the buildings experienced masonry and broken window damaged what are the immediate results of that quake was the response of central government to pass urgent legislation to enable and allow the Wellington City Council to our building owners of the multi-story commercial buildings in the Wellington CBD to have structural engineers conduct detailed inspections of these buildings these inspections were subject to peer reviews and assessed the buildings on the basis of percentage compliance with contemporary building codes an arbitrary value of 33 percent of the current building code has been set as the minimum acceptable value of which a building must achieve in its inspection evidence to be allowed to be occupied a number of Wellington 's downtown buildings are at present fake it as remedial work is being done to bring these buildings up to a standard above the 33 percent minimum at least this system of assessments will allow genuine inspections to be conducted and accurate downtown buildings to be made available to the public in New Zealand we are subject to the tectonic forces at an area known as the Ring of Fire and consequently the chance of seismic activity is far greater than that in areas where tectonic plates are not colliding with each other another area of high seismic activity is Emily earthquakes are not uncommon in many parts of Italy and in the town of Okuma there was an earthquake in 2009 in April there was a 5.9 magnitude and the situation in Okemah has some strikingly similar circumstances to the Christchurch earthquake in February 22nd 2011 there was a group tribunal in Aquila of scientists and y 'all_''_223.03 may recall that this group had made the statement there that there was quote no danger oh it 's going to burn however oh that did occur within a week after the tribunal had made this statement and as a result there are over 300 people that died who had moved back into their apartments the reason I guess they made the statement missed as they wanted business as usual to continue and may also recall that in the international news in October 2012 there was a judgment given by a an Italian magistrate his name was Marco Billy and Marco Billy found six scientists and there was one local government official guilty of culpable homicide and in October 2012 in 2013 on the anniversary of the February quake there a seminar here in Christchurch on disaster communication and that was attended by at least one member of council who is sitting here today I went to that that seminar and there was a professor from Italy who teaches disaster communication what he said was the most important thing in communication in disasters is giving accurate information to the public and I 've been communicating with him since I 've met him and anyway that 's the there was an appeal of that decision and in 2015 it was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Italy that the six scientists were the guilty decision was quashed and the one official who had been found guilty that was upheld but the sentence was reduced from six years to thank you thanks very much thank another councilís here today speaking as a guardian of the New Zealand firefighters memorial which is located on the corner of Kilmore Street and Madras Street as most of you have all attended a celebration each year at the memorial I 'm sure you will familiar of it this was created by firefighters for the support of the community in this Christchurch City Council back in 2002 there 's an International on 26th March this year a Vodafone sell tear was erected on their reserve as as part of mishel communications rollout this is an insult to all firefighters as we stand and particularly firefighters have lost their life which we have had obviously in Christchurch this park is dedicated to all fallen firefighters throughout the world in particular Christchurch firefighters and regards to everyone in Christchurch it has a memorial to the Christchurch earthquake which was constructed by the firefighters from Australia and gifted to the city County Council and the firefighters of New Zealand I would just hand around a I only have a few copies of unfortunately if I can get the gin just thank you question 's against this in terms of if it becomes life it 's a lot harder to do anything about I 'm in terms of we 're just like to know as the council in agreeance that it can stay there or our feeling is that it should be removed as it as an insult to firefighters and also major impact to lovely reserve which is also a international tourist location thank you very much for this morning thank you but that this presentation models not really appropriate for you know responding but we 're certainly we are a bit and we 've asked our chief executive to to look under the

    "text": "the members of the panel thank you so now moving to the last item in the open agenda which is the regenerate Christchurch report item 18 so Ivan is here great okay welcome Ivan thank you for joining us this afternoon apologies for keeping you waiting a little while yeah so I 'm gonna just pass over to Carlene who 'd like to make a couple of comments before we start thank you so this is a report that went to finance and performance but just mentioned just in the attachment one 4.4.3 the comment comment made an assumption by the organization 's council that the appointment of the new chair and the election of the new government actually impacted on regenerates ability to stay on track with its produce and it 's not it 's not a comment that regenerate christchurch made so just really clear about that and it 's good to get their clarification thank you very much so Ivan you 're you 're comfortable with that of course as well is thank you great thank you very much indeed thanks for clarification thank you coming now that you wanted to make first sure thank you a couple of things to the report that you 've received progress they 're planning for the avon river corridor and cathedral square we 've all but pretty much finalized the design we know that we need to come back and have one further conversation with councillors we 're working to confirm an opportunity to come and brief you on the work that we 're undertaking around the central city increasing momentum we know there 's been significant interest in that if possible we 'd like to come and brief you on that next week but we 're just working with your staff to be able to confirm a time in terms of the Avon River corridor the board is considering the refine shortlist within come in and brief you as well we 're looking at options for planting in tree nurseries as and it was great to see the area being used for the high schools Polyfest festival in the weekend in terms of South Shore we have been working with your staff and with Environment Canterbury we 're on March which will form the basis for community engagement starting and May and we 're expecting to receive a engagement plan from the her team which is a community leader in ishutin by the end of this month as you know we submitted the proposal for request to the Minister proposing to use the egg to change the designation for the school that 's currently with the minister and the minister 's decided to seek public comment and we understand that the council is doing work at the moment considering the opportunity to use section 71 powers of the ACT to advance a opportunity by Canterbury Sports limited and our board were briefed on that and are looking forward to receiving that as early as possible thank you very much so the committee adopted the staff recommendation without change that you wanted to make on this one whilst there 's been some delays and deferrals of projects at this moment certainly we 've done thinning across the four-year period the funds are required to carry forward and move for those projects so while we 're planning a forecast under spend those other projects okay great thank you so questions Dion Phil do I 've asked this information outside of after the committee I suppose it 's it relates to the central city budget because in this report it still says 1.9 million dollars year-to-date actual but when I asked a question and ended up in the media saying it was only eight hundred thousand dollars I want to get explicitly why there 's that difference because when we see the budgets here and we get told something else I just want to know why it 's fine the way that we report through to council through the performance committee is on the basis of outputs so we have two outputs one as residential redesign and the other as regeneration cleaning the way that we report outputs is that all costs for the entire organization have to end up in those two plots and so a lot of overheads and costs accommodation sorts of things so we have directly spent eight hundred fifty five thousand dollars on Cathedral Square and surrounds but when we wrap that up into an output that to allocate the overheads to specific projects and much the same way that council does with the creative activity pages so those outputs that you 're talking about are they specifically related to the Cathedral Square of surrounds or could they be are they ripped up into other parts of it 's been much wider so regeneration planning includes Central City and so as a part of it that 's Central City momentum at Central City for revenues its Cathedral score in surrounds but it also includes new bright and other regeneration areas like Cranford in anything else that may come out I mean personally and I don 't know if this is something that we can do for a bit of improvement but it would be nice to know exactly the specific budget for that project because otherwise it does raise a lot of questions for media obviously sort of stuff but it 's you know separated out a little bit more and that 's our preference when we report to our board we report our project level for the same reason because once you throw the overheads and or less meaningless so we would welcome an opportunity to report to Council in a similar way by projects which do make slightly more sense against the budgets yep Thank You Phil and well thank you for your report and for the clear information and like clearly though there 's still this reference to the delays and in between the lines it 's pretty clear in the way that you need to work with others collaboratively and it 's all part of the processes but I 'm just wondering do you have a plan as to how to speed up some of those processes so and thick these things are delivered more on time absolutely so across two other key approaches so Cathedral Spirit surrounds and Avon River corridor we 're interrogating the remainder of the program to see where we can accelerate momentum in those areas we 've provided some advice to the board which the board is currently considering which will look at how we can crunch down some of those time frames and we 're also trying to work as closely as we can with our strategic when we submit the plan to them we respond so that require means the other strategic partners being part of their playing to and buy into it and developing some new approaches absolutely thank you Thank You Glen thank you interim usage ivan of the tackle Aven River corridor clearly it is an appetite for there and I just wanted to see you know how large is that tide across the agencies Lyn 's the generator secret for interim projects yeah so we 've pulled the organization 's together lenz who have noticed the crowd no delay and on behalf of the crown as well as lives who are currently coordinating some of the interim community uses we think there 's a much greater opportunity for community involvement stewardship and interim uses we think that the approach that lens is taken today whilst appropriate within the framework that they have to operate is probably more constraining than enabling and we think there 's a greater range of opportunities as well as the opportunity to consider longer term arrangements which are the current and the current arrangement as I understand it working with him at the moment and we 'll be providing some advice to the minister who makes the ultimate decision to look at providing some more flexibility and options for interim uses thank you yeah Lee thank you I just wondered if you could elaborate on the evaluation and progress and provision of advice on what is required to increase momentum and support regeneration I think we were previously told we would be getting a workshop in November I just don 't quite understand when we are gonna get a sort of chance to see what what works being done or proposed to be done and how we have any say on on what it might look like yeah absolutely yeah that 's the workshop that I was or the briefing that I was indicating earlier that we 'd like to come in here with you next week if possible yeah so so it has the board agreed to something and you 're just going to present what the boards are great to or are we going to be able to sort of provide feedback on things that we a broad approach so the board has agreed to a broad approach and there 's one we want to come and discuss with you right and just so I 'm think you have privacy advice it does not include the accessible City it includes elements of the accessible city so there 's probably a conversation that we can have when we come and have the briefing yeah let 's let 's have the briefing as soon as we can figure it in so that we can get that detail that I just wonder how we can get better alignment like we 've just had a report to council about the accessible City and which says to keep doing it and then we 've got this review it 's happening you know in a week or next week we 're getting a workshop and every like there must be a smarter way of where we can work together so that we 're not duplicating if it 's in a different direction absolutely agree Jonnie so in initiating this work I was in contact with each of the chief executive organizations within the last week and this week to understand the work that they 're currently undertaking because the last thing that we want to do is duplicate work but we need to understand where the alignment is in terms of the work that 's currently underway in regards to that specific project are we likely to be in a position before we sign off on our draft LTP to have concluded that work so that any information or advice can be taken on board in terms of the projects that were either funding or not funding so we 're aiming to have the advice that we 're currently developing provided to our board its meeting in April cool so definitely with us before the end of June subject to board approval use grace Thank You Vicki and just in terms of their planting that you said it was going to happen we bit quicker what did you mean by the oven so we based on all of the work we 've done today the community feedback the chemical analysis all of the studies that we 've done indicate lean towards a areas of the rezoning was damaged what we 've been doing over recent weeks since the last conversation that we 've had is exploring an opportunity that would enable there to be realized with some funding attached to it as well and so we get it close to landing that as keen as anyone to be able to confirm that and we hope to have never confirmed or in place by the end of this week next week awesome and then two more questions and one of which was tiny-house society who are looking sorry who were looking to create a space in cash or even side area who 's been talking with you to place and even I think is that likely to lend tiny houses adaptive housing floating housing are all options that being considered within that the land use plan it 's just a five-year lease that they required four months as an interim use yes I 'm sorry so that refers to the earlier comment that I made about what they were doing with loans yes at the moment I think you mentioned that they could to make it financially but absolutely I agree and so we 're aware of that knows that that 's what we 're pushing through wetlands okay and in the third one you were called that rainy Mario from too far oh okay oh how to came to see you and that came up again yesterday at the joint meeting with no taffy and where is that it no yes so we have followed up and meet subsequent to their discussion I think at least twice with salami Mario and other representatives from two paths to ensure that we accurately understand what their intentions are and what they 'd like to achieve to determine how we might be able to accommodate such users within a plan all good all right so I 'm happy to move the recommendation rafts happy to second no debate all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much indeed _"

    "text": "okay now moving to 1927 in the hearings panel on Summit Road debut chaired this panel I 'll get you to introduce this if you 're happy to what was being considered essentially was a time restriction of 00 o 'clock p.m. to 00 a.m. in the morning from Thursday through to Monday every week we had for submissions information from staff and I think the the the final analysis the the piece of evidence that swayed us the most was the police saying to us that they could not affect I didn 't have the resources to effectively monitor this sort of activity even if we put in place so we 've got a resolution today also just back up a weaver so having had that sort of information that the staff recommendation was not to proceed and we agreed we also thought that we needed to address some of the issues that were surfacing in this area some hair on our resolution resolution so we 've come up with six points in a narrow resolution I was speaking to the two to six particularly there was a feeling to some sort of solutions to address in part some of the activities in that area so we recommended that with some urgency or as soon as possible a management plan for the Port Hills area be established we also suggested that there needs to be a reduction of speed currently it 's open through there so we are suggesting that there be a reduction of speed limit there are a number of overlapping boards community boards that are affected by whatever whatever outcomes come through for the port Hills area so through the recommendation to recommend that we brief the relevant community boards on measures going forward there were suggestions that we needed to investigate some sort of surveillance ID mechanisms that we could if need be identify people that were sort of anti-social behavior up in that area there was a fear that you know perhaps if we did implement this process as this policy I should say we would in fact merely just shift the problem from one ear and that 's an experience that the police have had and the we cracked down on on mainly racers we cracked down in one area and we actually shifted to another so overall really whoa while we are recommending that this not proceed we do ignore the police have acknowledged in their participation in this process that they will do everything they can to provide a support with any measures that we come up with but they 're unable to provide a consistent enforcement at the moment so given all of those deliberations and advice from various agency the recommendation of the panel is not proceed with a time restrictions policy on commend the recommendations that we have before us today I believe that there are solutions amongst those six recommendations that will possibly address some of the activities great thank you very much so now we 'll move to questions now these questions to put to staff we do have staff here that we could bring to the table yep great okay so if I could invite staff for this item at the table please and Sarah the recommendation for the hearings panel and four and five considers our lowering at the speed limit on Summit Road to consider how do we progress these in the wording of the report potentially so while we 've been asked to consider it do we ask for a report do we what do we say now to which they make some progress on these I recall the the thinking around those was they relate to processes which in addition to the speed limit one also requires the the guidance from means ETA in order to progress further so to answer that one and also the speed camera one which involves the police and decision making as well sites one option may be for counselors to set a date and for which staff to report back on those meters because they at the moment of his reading open-ended yeah so I 'd quite like something that we could put in there to request staff either provide advice we 'll provide a report whichever whichever is going to be the most appropriate at this time to Council on those two options the lowering of the speed you would need a report if you want to make a decision on it yeah I decision that we do we have enough information but the thing is I 'm not sure we 've got enough information in this report to know where that one of those things is what we want to do it would be probably easiest and clear us to get a report so it would be four and five will be changed to council requests a report considering and five also would be requests a report considering and at least it then puts a process in place for the intention of the hearings panel to actually land in a piece of work yep so if we can just change both of those there in that case request to report considering on both four and five would they be separate reports or would it be one report that would cover the two okay thank you it may be within four months if it 's reasonable how long would it take to pull these reports together would four months be sufficient yeah so let 's actually put then within four months and just on four and five because three is already as soon as within four months and the same on item five as well great thank you any further questions Phil and then deal so my question is really about the urgency of this and I appreciate that the panel want to move towards a management plan but and maybe the speed lowering the speed should be part of the head like in places that road is really windy and we 've we managed to have a lower speed limit on Dyess Pass Road but my question really is around the the residents concerns and it just seems that from the under 513 for example that the breakdown of support but overall that the people who lived in the in the suburbs nearby the portal that they supported the proposal but people who were outside overall people are outside that what that in the white area that they were against it if I got that right or is that too so meaning there was love I guess you 'd agree that 170 ahead of the 221 this is a point 5.3 in fact it 's a significant proportion there was a mixture of there was also that a 4 strong concern from the local community or adjoining communities around displacement which was very real concern for those in Governors Bay which could it arguably be considered local or adjoining to this particular project as well one of the other challenges is that the site is visited by a significant amount of people from from outside the area and and that and that regard is seen as having citywide significance thanks and I know I understand the geographical chef that that isn 't actually gonna salt it soldier come so yep I 'm quite keen that in fact some on part of this like for example the additional speed issue yeah the the hearings panel spent some time considering what weight to give to local submissions versus versus submissions from a wider area and also were very keen in as much as they didn 't adopt the proposal to make sure that some good came out of this reflecting the concerns that we heard from submitters and I think that 's really how three four five and yes certainly three four and five and well I think I think it just reinforces that the police were unable to provide resources to effectively monitor current activities we 're more than happy to come alongside and assistant and so if I get that that would be a camera no but it would be probably a camera that maybe we 'd put up now would that just be used for the identity of people that do say blue nails on their road or could it be used for other issues I imagine they would be the message that we would consider in that report when it comes but I am wondering just in light of your comment whether we might better say consideration of mechanisms rather than a mechanism because it might be more than one thing there might be a number of things that we would consider in a camera may or may not be one of those things my worry is that if we spend on my personal values around privacy and all those kind of issues around you know Big Brother and and whatnot whereas you know the traffic cameras we 've gotten in those areas but not just as somebody passing through yeah we seem to have moved into debating the report that we haven 't got yet yeah that 's fine understand the concern okay any further questions all right now Dave are you happy to move this is I 'm happy to be the seconder any debate all those in favor against that 's carried thank you and thank you to staff that I know did a significant amount of work on this as well and thanks to the members of the pen

    "text": "you okay now moving on to item 23 Linwood Woolston cool delegations okay so we 've got Sarah temple 's an indication to be happy to move are there any questions for staff okay so John if you 'd like to come to the table and your team thank you so questions from Glen Phil and Jimmy Glen and calling thank you thank you look sir but gold-plated but my my question is more around the actual don 't worry better my question is about the the site selection in the scope will this be done consistent with the Aquatics strategy yes absolutely okay so it 's it 's the overall figure is pulled out of somewhere yep what is built will fit in with yep yes and that 's also consistent with the financial and other information on participation that 's included that makes up the draft 1828 lt8 it 's all consistent okay thank you Dave it 's a quick question around the the process is a similar process that the community went through for the qe2 pools good good question and Dave I probably have to think can answer that emphatically now qe2 was slightly different in that we appointed a Community Advisory Group who gave information and advice to the board and to Council on the location what we are recommending to the council is that delegated authority rests absolutely with the the community board so it is different in that respect other differences or similarities I 'd need to have a bit more I think I 've got no it just seems pretty similar anyway there is a similarity and that the as officers we believe the just like the bird coastal community board as he were then the the current board are best placed to understand the community make those decisions so it 's similar in that respect Thank You Jimmy question is particularly you mention if dedicated from Council to the community board to teacher in the kind of scope in the design if in case those the funding party is all outside of the funding limitation and also operational Pesa parties in the scope is compliant counselor view how to mitigate is the effect if I 'm understanding your question correctly the our overall budget and broad view of the facility as in the draft LTP they are and it also says that council retains the delegation to award the final build contract so we would not envisage this at all but worst case scenario if there were differences of opinion between the board and the council they the council has they the last ability to say yes or no we would never envisage it coming to that point it certainly didn 't with qe2 it didn 't with Graham Condon jelly park I can 't envisage it it 's a small risk but it is covered yeah because in order to write a fair and reasonable report it is appropriate that we elude potential risks to council so you can understand them and ask us questions on them we think the risk is very small we 've said it 's very small it 's a small disadvantage but it doesn 't change our recommendation which is quite emphatic regarding to the dedication I 'm not sure whether have any like site selection or scope and the final concert design there on rates registry or some other any regulation depending the site that the community board select if they select a site that comes with a different set of delegations let 's say it 's a reserve or it 's a site that we might have to purchase and different delegations are required we would come back to Council again with another report either recommending or not that the community board have those delegations so it 's probably fair to say that the site that a number of the sites that are preferred don 't have that so it won 't be necessary but if it is we 'll come back and request a small change Thank You Pauline Mike and then Phil pulling my interest on the process really so so when would the I 'll probably be updated by the project team the board began to work on the scope and design probably this time last year we worked with the board and we engaged some contractors and we engage the board support staff to understand all the work that have been done in the community to date to ask and we brought back back to the board the and pulling that informed a lot of the information that went into the product strategy and the draft LTP on this so it 's probably just over a year ago now so what I 'm trying to get at is that there is a risk to the community board that if they 're going heat now with scope and design which directly impacts on the budget and if the budget was either reduced or eliminated I hope it doesn 't though there was a risk feared how do they mean I think that 's a risk with every project they are a project has to has to start has to start the best intentions in officers belief the this this project has been in the 2015 25 LTP updated by various annual plans of the there is always a risk that circumstances might change but we have to be in a position to work with the board to move forward understand the scope and nature of the project so if there are any changes that need to be made we 've and we 've got enough information to wisely inform change so it is a risk they are and it 's a risk with any project any other community swimming pool or sports project there might be a decision in the LTP process that changes it we are moving ahead with vast majority of our projects and we 're not we 're not stopping them because of this risk I think it 's something we can manage and that would relate to any capital project I don 't know if anybody who 'll be suggesting we would stop work on all capital projects just because we 're consulting in a on a draft LTP which after all is our proposal for the final LTP the delegation over the scope in the concept design now the three reason that we 've changed the the scope in design would also have to change careers the the delegation it resolves that it is in line with the the draft and then the the final 18 28 long-term plan so that condition precedent if you like would remain of the and so whatever council 's be subject to that so this is still all subject to the LTP as any capital project is guess thank you Mike thank you okay so this has been all filled you had a question sorry I just wondered do we have choose of the scope do we have any estimate towed but that 's the capital part of the operational cost of running the pool yes we do they they I don 't have it with me they are if we if you recall pre-christmas we presented the updated aquatic facility strategy where we identified and predicted the cost to run all of our aquatic and Recreation sporting facilities over the term of the the LTP informing that calculation was a facility of the size and scope and function currently envisaged so we 've got as accurate a picture as we can at this time and the optics is provided for within the draft LTP this sounds like more like a question that would be appropriate for a LTP discussion and consideration than one about delegating a decision-making process to a community board yawning just wondering if we 'd done with some other facilities to kind of enable progress to happen a bit quicker and if so why was that ruled out is that abilities still able to be done yeah I think it 's a yeah it 's a conversation that the project team would have with with the board yeah and it 's it 's a conversation that we think the the board would be the and because that does have an effect on on scope and concepts so yes that 's absolutely something that we didn 't visit happening in regards to the procurement I know previously there was talk of maybe doing you know the the qe2 the Southwest endless together under one procurement to save costs obviously that 's probably not likely to happen that obviously there 's been a lot of work done at qe2 but is there any consideration giving to any economies of scale without other aquatic facilities in terms of procurement or how we might realize benefits I think that 's a has there been much consideration to date it has been discussed at a high level I think once headed with the Hornby area and the Lynwood walleston area we can pick that discussion up again but that 's certainly a discussion that we can engage with the board and get their views final question is why are we proposing in the LTP to push funding out even further that sounds like an LTP question rather than a decision about delegating to a community board and that 's probably where that will be picked up but just so I 'm clear we 're currently working on what 's in the current long-term plan not the proposed long-term plan correct this the this report the notes the draft long-term plan however I think is palling covered if there are any changes we not in a position to understand what they might be so we 're going on what we know and it 's it 's draft it 's what 's out there at the moment expecting this council to make changes or not as they see fit well then that 's directly relevant to what 's in here because I want to know why staff are proposing to move more have on the project well that 's very different than whether we 're delegating the decision-making to the Community Board or not no in this under two the recommendation I so if your recommendation number two you read the first one 1.3 1 a community consultation based on parameters of the project details on a 2015 25 long-term plan as a minute by the annual plan you go down to the staff recommendation it 's changed from what was in the 2015 25 plan what 's updated in and it doesn 't even say draft mm 28 plan which moves money further out into the final year which I presume has an impact on the delivery timeframe because that 's why would you be moving money up so I mean my preference would be for that to be reflective of what 's in the current plan I don 't think we should be making a decision based on something that hasn 't been agreed yet and then if it changes then it changes but their environment in which we 're working is that we had a 25 2015 to 25 out for consultation which has got amendments to that 2015 25 long term plan we obviously as a council believe in that proposal otherwise we wouldn 't have put it out as a draft therefore that is the most current thinking around our capital budget we wouldn 't have put out a proposal expecting to make major changes to that unless we hear from communities that we should do so so for us to have a project here which is aligned with our most recent decision-making on the capital budget would be entirely consistent in my view no we haven 't_''_932.91 we 've approved a proposal which is currently out for consultation it 's a really good one at the current resolution sees that way to start working as if it was 20 15 to 25 long-term plan where the funding is in a different place to what 's in the book in the draft currently so maybe I 'm a little bit confused then if we look at paragraph 2 in the resolution within the 15 to 25 long-term plans as updated by the 2018 28 long-term plan just frame you know pull up the thing so you guys can say would any of this change your willingness to delegate this to the community board or not resolution and under to you so what you want the resolution changed to if the project timelines that are currently a consulting are the 2015 25 one which has a very clear time frame if that 's gonna be delayed by number two being agreed to today then I don 't want to do it we 've already had significant delay to this project and I can 't see why we should be in the middle of a consultation period with our community around the timeframe putting it at risk doing it over an even longer timeframe will that decision though not be made in the long-term plan final decision isn 't all that dependent on actually having a second I 'll second this motion I think we should keep it in Council I 've got so what happens if the community board makes the decision before the 1st of July these risk and return instead of still having the 2015 to to 2028 plan we 're the actual money signaled to be in the long term play at LAN and there was some purchase or there was something you could do something little potentially if it was in terms of this year 's planned because at the moment this year has been ruled by 15 so basically if you want to do anything before then you 've got to be ruled by this long term plan I have no issue as soon as you approve the humans that we take one be out and revisit that after the LTP because because when you think about it where are we now marching through March because it seems to me that there could be a risk of actually that work should not really be be begun until the budget secured thank you regarding to stop recommendations 3c I 'm concerned if Opening Ceremony work welcome the community no organized spyler i like i 'm not neither the ding whoo he 's showing a community pool however you know i come on behalf less city wider the people were eligible to patrol this celebration is another case of council are potentially not doing what they wish for and like it seems to me originally these recommendations were I thought we were excellent so this is his things have been married um he 's come to us because the council directly requested that staff come back saying what of this project can be to get delegated to the community board and I 've checked it was a it was a unanimous decision by this council to say what can be because we believe as a council and everyone was elected on the platform of strengthening our community boards both in the last election and the one before people were very strong and strengthening our community boards in strengthening our communities and we 've done this for some projects this is probably the biggest one we have done it for at this point for the for this decision making this has been something that the board has asked for the board is very clear on the direction that wishes to take the board is united in the desire for this Paul the board has had years saying at this point that they are reluctant to develop delegate some parts when they are being told by staff that staff Rickon that the staff recommendation is emphatic not even questioned at all then I think that those counselors who are questioning that maybe should look to the other projects that are coming up and their community board areas and whether they should have delegations over those thank you so now moving to Pauline I 'm very supportive of community boards having delegation we had a successful one and our board with that we set up a working party with the community actually which I would suggest that this community board looked at doing it 's their decision but I 'm just really just advising caution regarding public expectation because they know to me you know barreling ahead before our budget is actually approved as it could be a little bit of a dangerous thing because you raise expectations which is why I wanted to put be separately but apart from there I 'm fully support community people it 's heading down the gauge to authority over local projects You Phil I 'll be brief I just think that clearly we are wanting to trust the community board and that that is a significant part that 's the key of all this really and that 's why I guess I 'd have to say to some councils look don 't keep pushing the envelope and and make sure that in fact you know you work with council because it figures in fact point to is is clearly there that in fact it has to be consistent with what council want to happen but there 's a as the points have been made that this planning for the support has been a long time in the making and there 's a whole history to it and overall I 'm supportive but I think it 's an important that in fact councillors work with the board and work with us as a council to to make sure that it does happen in a sensible way just honest qe2 and the origins of this proposal are from entirely different contexts so for for this project it 's been a long time coming center has an entirely different context debt of loss following the earthquakes in 2011 the site selection went well as far as that does go for qe2 but every community board is different and has their own dynamic it 's important and it was good to hear through you John that this will be done hand-in-hand with the aquatic strategy because there is a big question here over expenditure over aquatic facilities in the city and I think we do need to be open to the possibility of revisiting all of them and that includes the proposed facility in the center of the city and I hear a lot about saving rate payer dollars if you 're really serious about that I really want that challenged so that we can make good and make real savings and that 's all I 'll say on that at this point yawning yeah so you know this is a really important project to this local community and it does have an impact on the southeastern communities as well going all the way up from Taylor 's mistake some of the ricklefs Mount Pleasant walleston Linwood so an even site so you know this is a facility that although you know local is very much based in this community boards catchment that is the whole idea behind it as I understand it and it is something that just needs it needs to progress I 'm very concerned to hear people saying it has no confirmed budget it had a confirmed budget in 2015 and since then it 's just been constant delay after delay after delay we need to get on and get this done this is an area of the city that has had almost no public investment in public infrastructure outside of in terms of community facilities outside of things like the the roading and the cycleways so it 's really important that we signal an investment in this community you will recall the Salvation Army report that talked about people feeling forgotten feeling like they weren 't being listened to for the 15 years that I 've been involved in this area this has been the number one issue that has been raised in regards to a community facility that people concerns about delegating this to the local community board given that day for many years with many different members that are currently on the board have been a strong advocate for it there is a process underway for the site selection and you know that will be wrapped up shortly it 's expected by the middle of the year the board will have made that decision so you know I think you know it 's really important that we keep progressing this project rather than holding it up any further than it 's already been held up this is a community that is pretty much together on possible location impossible facilities I don 't think we 're gonna see the big debates that are right a raging in other parts of the city around location or around what should happen we 're so let 's hope that we can get on and get this done this really removes I think one of the final barriers to us being able to fully engage with our community around what is happening in this area in terms of the facility so you know with the budget through the LTP process as has been said thank you and we 've you find the site do the initial scope and design we 've done that and I think probably actually just focus on that rather than exactly what the final budget will be will be so I think just you know take it step by step by step Jimmy because it would council dedicate to the to the side of location no any problem I agree even host we 're home be licked and no they cut in location had kind of a different view contention I think that 's a small issue but II would dedicate to the scope and a concept design I 'm in case the web it happen stop mention to mention is probably the possibilities though if you over the fund in the budget if you breach the operational pays the parties if you are outside of the scope how to mitigate is the effect it is my particular concern you know I agree such as a council dedicate to the site selection to the county board rather than the haven 't already spoken I 'll come back it 's not my amendment so no so what we 're going to do is put be separate or so you wanted it differ so your amendment is to defer that decision until after the LTP decision-making is complete okay so if we can reflect that now put that as an amendment in that case rather than just putting it separately thank you all right thank you for that clarification any further debate Dave thank you okay I 'll just say a couple of words and then Sarah I 'll come back to you for your right of reply yeah I mean like others I 'm really keen to move on with this we seem to overspent when I 'm certainly aware that we 've spent as long as I 've been on council talking about this repeatedly and over over a long period of time and it sounds as though it 's a debate that 's been going on for a lot longer than that so it 's good to actually finally get this proof arrests other comments that have been got a position that we 've talked about a lot in this to amend the previous term of counsel around delegating decision-making on local projects so that decisions can be made in local communities by locally elected members and this is a perfect example of that there 's obviously been some discussion this afternoon about the long term plan and the effects of this at least the decision we 're making today once these acknowledges that there are capital funding decisions that will be making towards the end of June that may change things those decisions may not change things and it allowed us to get on with the work around the site selection and the scope and design in the meantime in anticipation of us confirming the proposal that we 've put out in the draft long-term plan and obviously we 're waiting to hear from the community on that through the consultation process so I 'm on supportive of the original resolution and I certainly am also supportive of the decision around scope been left in there for the community board to get on with straightaway as well it will be funded in the LTP I don 't know how many of you have had experience of working on these types of community facilities projects in the past but the fact that we 've only just started going out for consultation on the site selection currently should give people some confidence that we won 't be up to approving a final design in June so anyone will know that three months isn 't long enough to go through the entire consultation on site selection to get a report to a community board to choose the site to then do an analysis and see what 's needed to get the scope sent out to get some design work done and anyone who thinks that that could be done by June before the budgets approved is dreaming frankly so to defer the decision all that simply means is staff having to come back to this chamber once again with another report on the the delegations to a community board I would love for the process to happen that quickly but the reality is we need to get on to it and that that community were very focused on the loss of their facility post-quake and understandably so this community never had anything to start with they are the most deprived community in our city seek and most deprived in the country lowest car ownership lowers literacy rates and we have as a council raised their expectations and dashed them in the past in the early 2000s we have raised the expectations in every annual and long term plan for the last four years and for us to now be saying we are likely to those expectations is frankly a nonsense thank you so I 'll put the amendment first the amendment is to defer that consider thank you so moved by Pauline is there a seconder for the amendment so Jimmy we 'll second so I 'll now put the amendment to defer consideration of delegations until after the adoption of the long-term plan all those in favor so defer consideration of delegations on scope and design of yep all right great all right so I 'll put that amendment all those in favor against no okay so that fails if we can note that so now I 'll put the whole resolution all those in favor against that 's carried

    "text": "okay so now item 22 the policy register review now this originally was considered by the strategic capability committee back in November last year and as part of their consideration the strategic capability committee requested a workshop which was finally held on the 6th of March and there were three key messages that were emphasized in that workshop the first of which was that the council strategies and policies need to drive progress against the strategic framework and considering alignment to that framework make sure that they 're well aligned to the framework the second was looking back at the existing policy register with the aim of reducing complexity and duplication weeding out any policies that had become obsolete or had been super-sized superseded so that 's actually the policy register review work and also an acknowledgement that there 's work underway looking forward so that there 's well-planned strategy and policy development that 's well aligned to the strategic framework now the workshop obviously took place and then there were two further discussion sessions with councillors and there were a number of issues that were were raised at those afternoon relating particularly to transport policy the community van policy the city scene and rate since its policy and the distinction between policies needing to be revoked and removed or whether that actually could be dealt with as one category so it may well be that people want to raise those things this afternoon maybe we 'll just hand over to staff to start with there may be things that I haven 't covered in that introduction and that you might want to add to and then we 'll move to questions of looking at what we can do to reduce the policy register based on the paper before you today would take it from 250 to 203 and with the remainder of the 203 we will be looking at them over time and we prioritize 77 to be reviewed over the next three financial year so we 'll come back to you with the results of those reviews to try and reduce the register to something a lot more manageable for staff counselors and the public and I think it 's a really great thank you very much questions on further reflection it 's a page two five four and I totally understand why it 's gonna be potentially incorporated into the international relations policy to the nuclear weapons and nuclear propelled ships policy I totally get why you want to you know tidy it up I 'm just thinking though can we have both so there might be the old policy that at the time and even still now was quite significant so you know you have a reference policy but you still leave it as a standalone and I 'll probably leave that for discussion all right thank you the answer is the answer is yes and that would be the options that look at when we review those policies so no decision today that 's four down the track that 's proposed consolidations into the yep into the international relations policy we 'll review that one okay so in terms of today and today 's discussion and debate yes you 're saying that 's not within there no today it 's just about positive that are going to be removed or revoked okay and then we I 'm pretty sure the nuclear ones opala nuclear ships it 's a consolidation yes so that 's that 's proposed all right I 'm back to you later you 're nothing you decide today will affect consolidations on the reviews we 'll come back to you that there is it 's for your approval at the top today 's just about those 47 whether we can yep thank you Sarah and just to go back over the couple that we discussed the other day so the advice that 's come through since the meeting the other day than which and the other day is that rate since it 's City seen the rates in a suits policy should actually be revoked rather than just removed mm-hmm it said that that is still current but dealt with an operation is dealt with operational so that 's fine so we need to reflect that and the community then policy could go as part of the review to be subsumed into a community strengthening communities type one is rather than being so the issue with the community ban one is that if of the community ban or even the fact that we have one would become an operational matter the staff and if we asked for budget cuts that could go without us yeah so if we just removed it now revoked it now that 's what could happen but if we put it into the review then what happens is that can go up on the review it could become part of another one to tidy things up there okay so is there any comment from staff on on that we put the community van policy into the review list yeah and the city seen in rates insert policy is revoked all right okay so that 's that 'll be reflecting or does reflect in this resolution that 's in front of us so that reads correctly all right that 's great thank you so Sarah you 're happy yep great Dave [Music] [Music] the website what I 've asked for is to to go through the remainder and look to see which ones are operational policies that we may need to retain okay can we guess what staff comments on just revoked the ones we thought there could be uncertainty about whether operational policy or governance approved policy applied the others could just be removed where we thought there was less doubt because the the removes the ones about things that have become obsolete but there is no harm and legal advice confirmed that is there is no harm in actually revoking the ones we 've got listed as so we can we can do that it 's just was just a matter of you know whether we wanted to build some braces you know revoke or take just to take our approach to just remove things from the website where we thought it was pretty straightforward that those policies have just lapse because what they can soon don 't apply anymore but we can revoke them with no implication there 's just one exception sorry to complicate it in attachment B there 's 33 listed all of them can move into the revert camp except one which is item 22 and attachment B that still needs to be removed because it 's actually about something that still continues operationally council didn 't decide in the first place sorry it was a management decision that accidentally made its way onto the policy register so it wasn 't originally an elected member decision so you sorry to be so you know right secular but everything else that attention be could be revoked okay so thank you for that advice let me just check that the Secretariat of I 'm captured this yes Joe you 're all right so we 'll just wait for that to happen about the drafting of the recommend you see we could just amend that three to approve the revocation and removal that 's okay yep all right great so I 'm Jimmy accepted international relations the policy a moment no we implement for the kind of deepen the relationship between quite searching all the cities in economic development business a sister city essentially no papa because as I mentioned to you probably a couple days ago particular in I 'm the chair of inter nation relationship working group we have a six or seven external members you know waiting to establish the new international either this more effective efficient and we can set up a principle per hour ties etc so a moment the manager of civic international the team you know he sent an email sent to advisor group no Halen amore all in their concern if in case the Magna happen whether these we need to consider to honor all the new list that 's a policy to be reviewed yeah it 's not on this list here so you 're comfortable with me that 's the want to be reviewed yes good who else we all film you 're good Jonnie um thank you for the work that you 've done on this I just I just had a question well I guess a suggestion for one of the ones that you 're abolishing which is or sorry it 's the privately requested plan changes in the city plan work by priorities and budgets policy and it just seems to me that those are quite important items for us to look at but I appreciate that we 've got a very unusual district plan process at the moment and that we 've just us our briefing on it but could we kind of have some work done around how we could actually incorporate those policies into a single policy or internet workshop so that we do have some some control over or input into how those things are prioritized and dealt with part of our brief discussion before it 's it 's possibly asking staff for advice about what 's the best mechanism or instrument to deal with your concern is whether refreshed or a new policy would actually address your issues around prioritization or not in the light of the new district plan so I I 'm not sure whether it would address all your issues a new policy so I think that 's linked to staff advice on so the the forward strategy of policy work program includes the district plan is one whole area but as part of that we would expect the executive leadership and then the council to consider what if anything is prioritized in that district plan you realize at the moment have the ability to make plane changes we have a there 's a different property some time and I think that 's why we 've asked for a workshop to kinda indeed to be able to kind of go through that and understand the resource that we currently have as a City Council and the kind of process by which we can use it so I mean when we get like for example but the alcohol people coming in today there is a kind of question around the district when this has changes versus a lap yes but we 're not we don 't have the review of that policy on the work program but I found the workshop there is a need to do something well I think you know again like just to look back at history what tends that what tended to have when we had a normal district plan is that there was stuff that staff were working on there was stuff that elected members what worked on and resolutions through Council wanna you know someone makes a dictation let 's get some work done on this and then a kind of lack of understanding about how were either got done the previous councils are try to do is get a framework for that which I think that policy kind of started to do but basically you 're open to the fact that we might come up with a new policy through that to be asking Brendon really but so that 'll be picked up through that briefing workshop process yeah um the second one was in the urban renewal one it makes reference to being incorporated into a district plan but from my reading of that policy it 's actually quite different than that the urban renewal is really responding to the consequence of our district planning it 's not being done as part of the district plan so I just was a bit nervous about removing that one and wonder if we could place that into the review category and given that 's important because it 's superseded by a number of documents one would be the district plan but another would be the refresh of the human development strategy and also aspects of regeneration strategies in region under the new legislation but to be perfectly frank that 's moment is not used to guide work programs it 's no longer relevant to the sort of statutory and regulatory framework that we 're working in and it 's been superseded but it 's quite a good policy and I appreciate it 's maybe not being utilized at the moment there 's a budget that 's we 've reapplied it over in renewal and it might be quite good for us to actually think about if we wanted to achieve some of the things in there and we 've got a budget what 's the best way of doing that so a lot of the intent of that policy has been incorporated into other planning documents and there 's also a lot of work going on in our urban regeneration and urban design area that responds to that policy but as a whole it 's it 's no longer helpful all right thank you so we I mean yeah I guess if I read that the the staff comment advise honor it doesn 't really show you how it 's picked up on those other things it just is superseded actually don 't require good amenity don 't require good urban design don 't get you know just look at some of the developments that we 're seeing from housing news on for example so you know like it to me it 's like we 've I don 't want to lose that policy until we 've got really clear about what we 're doing think to look at those issues so there is the urban design in place there is during pre application meetings for particular developments and there 's also we 've been done in terms of urban design guides that respond to particular locations so there is still work in that area right but it doesn 't guide how we spend the money that we 've got towards urban renewal so you know to me that 's the gap we 've had some really good things like the Charleston neighborhood improvement plan which I think may have come out of some of us really successful program and we 're doing it so anyway I 'm just the final one I wanted to race was the communications policy and I thought we were working on I I thought we had some sort of framework for communications but I would certainly if we 're gonna remove it because we don 't have a strategy think about what we actually replace it with and I would hate for us to have lost that money wasted that money in there and that you know very expensive exercise was what I thought at the end were some very good recommendations around how we can improve our communications and then not have an endpoint for it so appreciate that we haven 't got the strategy is there any other mechanism that we could feed that one into so that we can actually keep the good stuff that was identified so the the advice I had from the communications team which you see reflected in this document this is really more an internal principles or standards but perhaps it might be an idea to get some advice from staff on the issues council johansson raises about if we 're not having a common strategy what else might we be doing so get some advice the question I mean that we thought was a snapshot in time I guess and there were some recommendations that reflected the the time and place that that was put together and how much of that would still be relevant today or how much of it was specific to those times would also be a consideration yeah yeah no sorry it was a very public it was a very public process and document and you know it came through council was approved by council so if you look at the principles the communication objectives the principles are talks about transparency consistency accessibility two-way dialogue you know that 's it 's not stuff that 's I think should just be kin internal I mean it is actually the public facing way in which we want to communicate with our communities so it 's how we would pick that up you know through some other work stream particular we could give you advice I think in the light of Janish comments that so we could just put that one into a bit more of a review rather than I don 't know policy rather than dealing with it as suggested we 're talking about looking at what we would be what all value is contained within that policy and how we could best pick that up and we were looking at for some advice on how we would best pick that up and make sure we don 't lose anything not necessarily reviewing that policy as a policy you just ask for advice about this is a situation and what 's the best way to go forwards yeah okay okay yep so that 's noted all right thank you any further questions Sarah I just point out that we 're it 's the committee being policy at the top has just been crossed output to be reviewed it 's popped up down the bottom as in again oh all right that 's great that 's now reflecting correctly that 's fine so we 've got a set of recommendations in front of us do I have a mover David East seconder Sarah Templeton any debate all those in favor against that 's carried thank you okay now move _"

    "text": "that 's carried thank you could we move to item 24 because I 'd like to get the two submissions to the two Environment Canterbury dealt with as quickly as possible does anyone have any particular questions you 've all got the that the new format of the of the submission on on the LTP you 've all got that so I 'd like to move it by the seconder for it andrew is there any discussion look just a suggestion in the on page 280 number five I know we 've got this elsewhere but under equality I wonder if I think that should go and to the transport and to the transition one year I think it should go wide and they they 're not considering us from there LTP I mean my point about the process the processes as a about see if to to to just to put it mildly and that is because he cans now in a position we are as financially stretched as far as the the public transport goes and so they they 've put on their LTP a proposal to save it but the cuddling and dicing doesn 't look like a full range of options because they 're all involved cutting roofs and uncreate and reducing the subsidy that 's available to people with disabilities so you know it 's um I just feel quite strongly that when we need to deal with that one issue separately it 's okay but but it is absolutely for the regional public transport planning process absolutely 100% Jonnie just to sort of changes and one just suggestion for the the format and I 'll start with that I think I think we 're really good just to separate out the recommendations so just have an attachment that said here 's the recommendations yes and just have it numbered so it 's really easy to see how they respond to each request the things that we 've asked for the other thing is that just in regards to air quality I think the second bullet point acknowledging the original leadership well at the same time we sort of saying it you know they need to increase responsiveness and if you look at the community that just being deleted now right because I think I mean you can see from some of the boards the feedback around here quality has been quite significant and I would I was quite happy with that thing what urn but it 's it 's been taken out so I just think we shouldn 't be I mean I don 't think we should be letting them off the hot for the lack of monitoring around things like the pollution hotline all the dust issues I think we should be stronger on that and I think the final point in that regard the request that 's been put in the bottom around the ensuring the conditions of consent for discharge provide for adequate monitoring and response to complaints that was a specific request to change their charging policy so that those who were getting applying for the consent were being asked to contribute more to the monitoring of it so that was a kind of I 'm not quite sure the exact phrasing but they have a finance policy that talks about how they weigh up the general versus the changed so that the company is like living earth who generate a huge amount of time should be having to put in more towards dealing with the air quality issues that they 're creating maybe an additional sentence that picks up that the II can should look at the the balance of whether you know whether they can charge charge more or a higher proportion of the costs associated with enforcing consents to the consent holders is that we can we can add that section yeah it was by putting in that ensuring that conditions of consent for discharges provide for adequate monitoring in response to complaints it was the resourcing of that so it was intended to convey yeah yeah there 's a really good chart on page I don 't know what page it is there 's a table of some summary of funding policies around air quality and non domestic emissions it 's got you know current policies forty percent you AGC a 60 percent targeted rate and then it 's got Exxon excessive at a pace and Exxon user beneficiary pays principle well it just seems these couple these companies off the hook Virginia you know didn 't write a huge cost so I think the more specific we can be the the more chance of success is it okay to pick that up as a into summary at the front of the document yep it 's really to raise it again and just because I 'm not sure that we 've picked it up or whether it 's appropriate that it goes in this or in some other thing but the whole thing of issuing consents for water for a really long period of time and then I thought we were going to edit but I may be reading the wrong copy but I can 't find it so I think what we 've what we 've put in under the section on Rufus and a second bullet point here we 've suggested that the review of the regulatory framework for considering change of useful water consensus brought forward and there 's provision of adequate funding to enable robust statutory process to protect freshwater resources so we 've put an additional that it 's not direct around change of use okay I just think we should be incredibly direct about it and make it very clear that we don 't know what 's going on sufficiently with our water supply to allow these users to just run on for 35 years regardless I mean you 've been very polite about its severing change of use for water consents from the aquifer as it 's the aquifers that we 're talking about not the rivers it 's the capital it is the kaepa tiny example that 's driven us I think in terms of the results Management Act and the documents that manage the taking induce of water it 's when those are reviewed that council can make much more direct submissions agree but we don 't know when that is but the long-term plan is but I 've totally better so here it 's about funding that review and the process of looking after the water resource its what the long-term planning do we know when they are going to review that do you know how no we don 't but what we 've done Yanni said about attaching or yet teaching the community board submission and two hours something we could do for example we 've got a really good submission coming through our community board about the bus routes and because the community board has really counseled with the ED wait or should that be can that be included one of the challenges with attaching the community board submissions as they are is that you get a lot of duplication and I think it loses its focus so incorporating the feedback from the community boards in a single council submission I think this is a stronger way of doing thank you all right so this has been moved and seconded is there any discussion Jonnie I do for what concern about not attaching the community board submissions given that we asked them to do all that work on them I know at a high level some of those points are incorporated but I still think it 's I just wonder whether what the harbor 's have actually attaching them and given that we want to strengthen community boards and we 've asked them happy to include those as information to e key and if that was possible but I think it 's good that we 're making a submission I think you know water water air public transport are really key issues as is biodiversity and it 's really important I just think in regards to the air quality that we do ask there you can to be much more responsive than what they 've currently been because people in the community are feeling very let down with the way in which things are being responded to whether it 's the quarries whether it 's the odors so I look forward to ek and embracing our submission and I just wanted to comment on the situation that we find ourselves and where Environment Canterbury sort of really forced onto a position where they 're funding us and sufficient for them to I mean they 've got no reserves these to live to draw on with respect to their public transport they 've exhausted all of those and and as a result we 've ended up in the situation where they are looking to public transport plan and its initial stage it will go out for public consultation people will have an absolute ability to have a say over the plan and then the individual routes will be consulted on and that is a process that will take place within a year it will take effect within two years of the stir so John I just think it 's absolutely crazy to cut roots before just ahead of a process that is going to that is going to potentially offer solutions to the communities that are affected by the cuts our staff have worked really hard with egain staff behind the scenes to look at using some of the other routes in order to extend services perhaps not on every bus trip but you know so I 'm really confident that we could find solutions if we had the time and it 's unfortunate that it can doesn 't put any of those options but just simply these are the unfine an alert so let 's just cut them off the list so thank you council as I 'm hoping for support for the that our submission will add weight to those of the communities that have been affected by the proposed changes or would be affected by the proposed changes and I 'm hoping that we can find a happy solution that means that those services aren 't cut so on that point I shall put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's _"

    "text": "now can we go back to the housing first proposal very good mr. Ford Thank You Brendan thank you we 'll start with the housing first food thank you my apologies for not being available earlier it 's a yeah so just means we were going faster than you thought we would yeah we are which is is so great Cantus up I 'd like to start my we 're just talking about it let 's help the housing first initiative as a real issue like I think having a home is something that we as counselors take for granted and the in fact though the term homelessness which were addressing it 's actually about real people who 've got nowhere to live in a city and many of the people are have been homeless in fact some of them have been without a home for over 20 years so and they 're they 're people who sleep rough and they sleep under bridges and they sleep in parks and under trees and clearly you know part of if we can improve the situation the issues like the health issues that the people who are homeless they they won 't have a real family family have been burned off often a long time ago or any relatives who they have had so the only family they have end up being people like themselves who are terms treaties and the people we 're talking about often feel forgotten and hopeless and they resort to alcohol and drugs as the only kind of solace so I guess to though it 's more recently that central government and we as a council and certainly a community are saying that there 's a lot of concerns about the impact on the what on the wider issue is really or of Christchurch and we see those every day and I 'm well aware that the issue of housing first it 's not sexy or exciting but in fact they 're just this program is an opportunity for us as a council to decide on what well and we can have towards people who are homeless and what commitment we as a council can make to actually start to eliminate homelessness because that 's the goal now in the report there 's a there 's a part a recommendation for us today which is from the the committee that we support the program and principle and it 's through a partnership of which our council can be part we were invited by the the housing providers in Christchurch to be part of this program central government have also already become involved through the Ministry of Social Development no the committee made a clear decision to seek a separate report in a further report around the funding options for this so in fact that report will include air air internal discretionary funds or external funds so in fact today we need to be clear that in fact at this point that the funding for this won 't affect the they won 't affect rates in the long term plan there 's already fact there is refunds available for that and there is something that the committee will look at separately to find the best funding resources available I just want to say that a real strength of housing first is that this is the first time that fact they will work in a collaborative and cooperative way and on top of that though they will have the support of the Ministry of Social Development to provide that an essential part of those wraparound services which is easy to say in terms of actually supporting people to retain their their homes on a long-term basis I 'll just make a couple of comments about the champions group because that 's referred to in the recommendation I was asked as a councillor to chair that champions group it 's like a form of governance for the project which will help guide the programme and I think it 's important though what we 're aware that we 're aware there 's a lot of community representatives and government representatives on that champions group like out the the City Mission which no we know well they 're Methodist Mission Comcare Oh total housing trust emerged as here our interferometer all agencies which were familiar with and there 's a lot of other ngos who are also on that champions group as well as the key representatives from the government agencies so got Knight oh we 've got te Puni Kokiri in housing new zealand the DHB and the mental health component of that and the police and Community Corrections so there 's a lot of support in your city for this project and I think in many ways what I 'm describing it 's really like a community of Social and helping agencies and government agencies coming together to solve one of the city 's saddest challenges and I think this is an opportunity for our council to do something that in fact we can be proud of you 've moved it and clean Sikandar so I mean I don 't think people need questions I mean it 's all been debated it 's an approval and principle so let 's just open it up to the debate you have a question stop people asking questions but I I didn 't want to interrupt the chair of the committee who rather than introducing the report produce the debate so anyway and I thought I actually did think that people didn 't have any questions because it 's so open and generic totally support in principle there 's no question I think everyone does but the comment with regards to not being a burden on the right parents each I mean it 's an investment you can argue as well both sides of it but I guess any dollar that we have and every dollar we have comes from a right path so there 's money in the kitty so to speak how will they or could that affect others and as it possible because we have a lot of no funding implications no but less decision there will be though it 's not you know it 's not you come back with another paper it 's not today well we don 't have to we haven 't been asked to fund it but the comment was made okay so if there is a subsequent paper I mean this is why it 's out of order actually but you know if there is a subsequent paper that recommends funding will you bring a paper that that is able to have no rates implications and if not why not the answer is yes paper to the committee which explores in it looks at all the internal options for funding some of them won 't have rates implications in terms of an increase in rates but some of the funding for example grants funding obviously does come from rates not trying to Bobby do i but we do have to understand that grants funding does come from rates yes so therefore in that respect it does have a rates implication well it will will the options require rates increase no right so they 're gonna look at allocating if if money is required because I 'm not yet convinced that we need to contribute to this we 've made a great offer in terms of staff support through community governance and development work and the cheering of the champions group so to me there is no I haven 't actually seen that we 've been asked to provide funding have we 've been asked to provide funding we 've been invited to consider funding in the same way that all the other councils have been does it fall over without it well not received program proceed without council funding yes yes thank you okay question from ceará question from n question from Yanni everyone 's got questions yeah okay you want to go into the debate okay so can I just ask mean since funding came up and well it did because it 's actually in the report so there was an initial staff recommendation to the housing subcommittee on whether it wanted to recommend to council that it consider 600,000 budget didn 't which it didn 't but what was the intent of where that would come from that was going to come from strengthening communities no we haven 't discussed it what we 've talked about is what quantum of funding would support the aspect of the program that would be appropriate for council to contribute to and that 's what we 've been asked to go away and do some work on and we 're reporting back on the 4th of April to the committee yes the initial report did canvass options and not options it came as potential sources but the committee asked us to go away and do more back to it yeah because I 'd be really wary of taking it from strength and communities and that fund is already completely over subscribed to nobody fair to say that was the view of the committee great is that right I just follow up though that if not all the committee okay so say some members of the committee hits the request for more work well so while there is clearly a potential option which provides council support and staffing those kind of things without potentially grant funding is at some point I mean the work that could be done by the group would be enhanced by council funding and we will get better outcomes so that would be the desire of the group to have some council funding yes so would it be a preference that we simply defer this paper until the full funding proposal comes forward I mean is that is that is that the alternate it would be health because I have you seen any I haven 't seen anything that says that we have to fund that that 's right from our point of for the support and principle for the program because it 's not just all direct funding related no and and we 've got staff support coming through this resolution through its community governance and development work so but what I don 't want to do is to give people an unrealistic expectation that I will be in support a large amount of money going from whatever source it is particularly the sources that were described in the paper that 's the key yeah absolutely with that question and support fantastic but we 've got to be really honest at the very start so we should we should indicate and the resolution that we want any any funding options to be you know they have to be quiet yeah Lister knows we were coming from right question well there was somebody else that was gonna ask a question but was it so paragraph 5.5 it says the council funding contribution would be additional to what is to be funded by MSD council contribution would help the help enable the initiative to provide a fully wraparound service while the call multidisciplinary team community building initiative so MSD is funding this call so is the question MSD you 've got this great team this is gonna cure homelessness here but we believe actually there 's a bit missing is that what we 're saying to them and therefore then we 're gonna fund it we 'll be saying to them actually you haven 't quite got the right program well the funding from MSD has been negotiated pretty rigorously by the four providers and there 's been a lot of debate about what will be included in what won 't_''_817.23 what we 've heard and so that 's there 's the Ryan shippers between MSD and those portable providers we 're partnering with the providers or counsel would be partnering with their providers to support the program and are saying to make it more effective than just the core services a viewer able to complement will provide funding to complement what is provided by if you will the core the effectiveness would be enhanced quite significantly in and that 's what we are looking it look developing funding options for those MSD saying team but they don 't think it 's gonna do the job no they 're not saying it okay so where are they but there 's always a limit to what can be done with the money that 's provided and so the experience there he 's in Auckland for example is the additional work with people who are homeless or once have been home working alongside those and and reconnecting them with communities has a significant effect for not a lot of additional cost so I mean I guess it 's the department at some stage says we have to draw the line we can still get some good housing results I think everyone will recognize if you can provide a bit more service in the right place this is about adding to the yes that 's where we complement the program the community connectedness part is what typically happens and it 's covered and in the paper that people were living on the streets for a long time have a have a far now on the street once they 're housed if you will they be can quickly you ensure they remain connected with the people they were and others a broader connection as well as provide all the specialists and wraparound services these people aren 't just homeless they 're suffering from a number of attendant issues which perhaps has contributed to homelessness oftentimes the program is around putting them in a place in supporting than that place in providing that services like I mean in order to you need that connection the question is sorry obviously MSD knows that as well yep the simple question MSD is providing some contribution to that this is about complimenting me and that 's what I was saying before the more service um in activities we can provide the greater likelihood of success success being that people will stay in those homes longer and ultimately always okay so what we 're saying is we don 't actually have people within Council who are already doing its creator this is not something that 's been done by anybody including and council and we don 't have this out the staff which are largely in our unit don 't have the skills do this work are often those that have been homeless themselves so they know what it is like to be placed in the home which your own says isn 't it great enter feel lonely and isolated but how do you reconnect with others in and participate in the broader community so the peer workers as well as the community if you or activity worker are the ones that would be funded that program would be funded through what it is that the council could contribute I just see in the report that this hasn 't been to the legal department and it hasn 't been through the finance department of Council yes it has been through finance it has now yes it has now been through finance there was no requirement for it to go through legal right yeah the finance simply said there 's no money in budget for this so is that what 's been in is that been amended in here somewhere or is that just the secretary yeah right sorry so that 's on here is it yep so and just so just two other sort of two models of housing first one is a dispersed model that 's been proposed the other which I 've seen and see at all in which personally I have a lot more sympathy for as you actually have a central place where people were housed so the issue that you 're talking about in terms of people 's connection isolation and also provision of services is done from a central place that 's got the housing above it so can you just help me understand why that centralized model was ruled out and why the dispersed models been favored by these providers well there 's the dispersed model was the most common model internationally enters the model in New Zealand the interesting thing is that the housing that is use is dominantly privately owned private landlord housing and it doesn 't leave for require capital investment it also means that people are not always all if you will lump together as those who have I think the success rate is considered from the evidence we understand to be better through the despot this model in the cost is followed in New Zealand and it 's the models that is considered preferred by the providers right and as I understand it and obviously the financial stuffs still going to come come back so it 's probably not worth getting into too much questions around that right now but in terms of the the saving of money Terry from overseas examples is that there are significant amounts of money saved on the investment that 's put into doing you know giving with housing and homelessness this way so if this program successful who 's gonna save money well I think the saving is across the board and the sense of currently people organizations that we fund through grants do provide support to these these people so these are naturally if we can significantly reduce if not eliminate then the demands on those services in a reactive way one p is great that would be a significant direct saving to the organizations within christchurch that will take time it gives the intangible benefits of the city is that people aren 't sitting around on the streets there 's a number of 't sitting around on the streets that people aren 't in parks in in dust don 't find it a good place to go all fear to basically a certain that the people that stand to benefit the most in terms of the reduction of costs would be how welfare injustice yep I don 't know why one could assume that these people typically aren 't participants and those services they 're quite disconnected from those services quite disconnected yeah this is why the connections program that we 're talking about now will be so important to actually bring them back into if you will that community without an address you can 't get a benefit but I mean yeah so it 's a it 's a it is a it is a huge issue and I 'm not saying that we shouldn 't participate but I think we should think very carefully about the level of funding and and its sources alright so we 'll just open up for debate but the full look before we do I 'm just mindful of the time and I have a departure deal with the akin submission before I go and then there 's a couple of items that I want to do so that we can then go and px '_''_1374.669 because some people want to go to the same thing I want to go through so clean and been and you wanted to debate I think you like an offer from a housing committee subcommittee perspective just to say that this is this proposal today is consistent with the housing policy which seeks to determine where we as council can play a role across the housing spectrum so as you know we don 't necessarily build all the houses we 're having a social housing space but we have roles to play arguably across this spectrum and this is one in partnership with government over councilor Hanson 's question of overseas models is a certain kind of there will be a co pupper needed with this which only relates to our sitting here many of those without shelter Modi men many have dogs there 's a special kind of situational series of issues that we 'll need to deal with chronic from the Greek cross meaning time so these are long standing homeless people rather than newly housed and that will give you an indication over how serious and far-reaching this issue is which we are endeavouring to grab hold on to I just want to just got that diagram up there for you mess those hierarchy of needs to indicate where the sits right at the bottom and the physiological needs the most basic of human needs someone said to me once if you meet people 's needs you 'll be successful I put it to you this can be conservative as a measure of success for this council that we can build or facilitate the flesh buildings in the city we need all that stuff but actually what does it all mean if we 've still got people sleeping on our streets so that 's my little wee challenge which I 'd like to put to you they also think it could serve either that or the for well-beings as a framework for subsequent decisions including financial there 's another Greek word Kairos which is about time it pressing the street counter indicates 200 in the CBD so it really is urgent we need to get on with it it would be good to actually shake hands with government over this and say yes we 're working with you to address it it 's really serious stuff so I urge your support for this today it 's privilege to be sitting on a couple of working groups one that works Street being in one week that works with the street workers and this is a common thing that 's coming through that we have to have a clearly identified pathway really from footpath to Fadi I call it and I think that we 've got many different agencies working in this space we 've got lots of resource here housing first initiative for me in my understanding provides glue for all of us to come together in to bring adjoined that kind of approach with specialists help to solve this problem of chronic homelessness particularly I think we have an issue with their youth who are finding themselves homeless through lots of different reasons but I believe that to bring all these things together so I 'm very supportive of it and I think that we will find the money for it because I think it 's imperative that we do and I hope that you will all see that this is an opportunity for Christchurch to actually solve this issue of chronic homelessness by targeting this issue the specialist way so I 'm hoping that you will all support this initiative down I 'm very supportive of this initiative one of the the key elements to the homeless people that I 've been seeing on the streets especially in the Central City and Lynwood Village and other parts of our city this issue is a big moldy issue in our country and in Christchurch and I really want to see this go ahead but I 'm going to light a little fire underneath the belly of it that it needs to address moldy issues at the heart and night aho and the moldy agencies that are not necessarily the collective but they 're in the governance groups behind it need to light a fire under all of are we having this in our country at the moment it 's not acceptable when we need to we need to get our mouldy people to take leadership on this issue and actually confront it head-on and go we 're going to thought we 're going to look after our fun oh we 're going to take them under our wing and educate them bring them out of this poverty gap that we 've got in our country and actually go you know what you 're part of New Zealand but not moldy we 're not pucky ha we 're not whatever we 're New Zealanders but this issue seems to be falling into a moldy issue and it needs to be confronted head-on and I really hope that the the housing first will take that on board because one of the key elements to why these people have keep falling them to this trap has trust issues mouldy people seem to we kind of work in and in a in a collective in a way and a lot of these guys that are on the street the mouldy men help and then they 're Tift out and then they go somewhere else and they say no you need this and they just don 't understand or don 't have the the tools to get them to where they need to go and then they lose trust of the system and that trust needs to be built up in such a different way than what is normally done by our processes in local and central government and other stuff which is why the other element is really really important the other element that 's not funded by just getting these people into houses and their specialist support is the trust building for these people that is the key element to actually making this work and we 're not dealing with the funding side of this today but that is what will make this succeed that is what makes us different than everything else that 's already out there because these agencies already helping people in homeless assistance situations is that they 're all over the place and that shopfront is great to actually have a point of contact but the will not work and so hopefully that will come back and we 'll find ways to make that work we already have somebody in our community board local community board who does this Brenda Leigh Johnson with their homeless collective in a small element of her community that she works with is going out and you know she 's asking us to help her sometimes too you know with money she gets a bus and goes to the groins and has has events for these homeless people and then they grow that they build trust with these people that they 're working with so really a you know that is the key element to this and hopefully this will go through a very confident but we need to also work on making sure that that happens as well so when it comes back I really want people to think about growing that trust Sara and then Pauline thank you and I 'd like to agree with Council Livingston when he sees that this is an issue that 's really really pressing and it is and when we prioritize what we in which either way that might be in our community 's valuing our volunteers looking after our most vulnerable providing children with opportunities for recreation all of those kind of things should be at the top of our priority list as a council and so I 'm really happy to support this housing is a basic need and not only does it help those who are the most vulnerable sleeping on the streets but it helps the rest of the city and how we feel about ourselves city that we value each other and makes it more equitable so completely in support of us a little tiny little words nothing thing for number two might be that we could add to help fund the proposed initiatives rather than that we fund them convey when we 're looking at the funding if that 's okay with the mover and seconder because we 're not even getting a report on funding the whole thing because we know the e mister he 's doing that okay it 's got a great part we 're only going to be helping if we choose to but I guess you 'll address that may not need to be an amendment but it is really important when we 're prioritizing things and I do think that it would be doing really really good if we had had this particular report maybe even before the Heritage one so that when we looked at whether we wanted to spend skiers council resources on funding private property heritage restoration or potentially on helping people off the streets that we really could prioritize with it guys thanks sorry who was next is very strongly we 've had people come in here patiently talking about homelessness and including homeless people themselves actually and I look forward to report coming back through the committee and if there 's a recommendation that perhaps we access some funds from the community resilience partnership fund I will not be versed to that either Jonnie sorry who else was over here yeah I mean I 'm strongly supportive of doing something different than what we 've currently been doing as far back as to win council gave the grant the two million dollar grant to the city housing people first as an example of what we should be doing rather than just continuously providing grants or groups to basically take people one and then have them go out you know the idea of night shelters for example when people don 't have access to a home so you know I think this is long overdue but is really welcome and you know we can do it differently I think the discussion around the funding will obviously come back to us but it is very clear from my understanding from overseas that justice and health and welfare save the substantial sums of money through these types of programs and it just makes sense doesn 't it I mean you know you just think about the burden on a any department at a hospital or the strain on their mental health resources at the moment and I would suggest that you know there 's a there is a spectrum a wide range of housing for people in terms of being classified as being homeless and and it 's you know transiency is as much about there as well as a way forward again I would my preference would have been for a central city site we 've heard the concept of farno referred to the research that the board got presented with an NSC East I think showed that people wanted to stay together in a community rather than be split up so I am a little bit cautious about their dispersed model I know that that has been done overseas and has you know there have been examples where it has worked but I still think that having a central city place where we 're integrated with services wrapped around housing on the top some of the other really interesting things that you know have been done are having micro enterprises where people can actually be employed so you 'd have retail and commercial opportunities for those who are being housed as well and you know for those of us who have visited some of the people on the street you know they 've certainly got a wide array of talents and some of them are very very creative in terms of being able to make things or you know this this needs to be done and let 's hope that it 's a success and obviously we 'll we 'll have another debate when it comes back to the funding but you know I think this is the idea of having much more integral approach to housing was important and it 's not just about housing I think it 's actually about providing people with a space that they feel as a home that 's really important and I guess just to conclude you know those of us who read the newspaper around the person that was taken into the hospital and then discharged and left on a bus stop in our Central City if that doesn 't paint a picture of why we need to change and do things differently I don 't know what will so let 's hope that this is the start of something that goes a long way towards addressing this problem but I 'll try and be brief but I think there 's some really good points Henry can it have been made around the this housing issue and like one benefits for example and I think there 's not accounts around this table who 's as agreeable to that you know over 170 people in our city being homeless what we certainly have agreement at this table on on that and and so that 's we know that this isn 't how we want a city to be the the I have to say though that the the housing first model is well evidence it got has had a lot of support in Auckland and from the accounts all its but we can look at those I guess details later the other thing too is councillors might recall that when we did our briefing to the incoming ministers it was quite quite clear we said we would want to support housing first initiative and being is referred to our current policy which is very clear that we 'll work with other agencies to address acute housing and to eliminate homelessness so I appreciate that the debate you know it certainly will appreciate councillors support to passes with the recommendations and I concur wasn 't serious suggestion that we into and will be to complement what amia still you 're doing or not doing you thank you I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's _"

    "text": "I 'm 16 and over to you Phil again reading will explain that the details in this report but like what the committee worked through and it was particularly following a workshop with stakeholders and it was a fourth certainly a form of and gate engagement across the community really but some of the changes where they 're being recommended by the committee are that the the frequency of the grant funding that that be changed increased so that their quarterly now and the other part too though is asking Council to allow any unallocated money from the Hague to actually be the heritage heritage incentive grants to actually be carried over to another year a really great feature in the report is that finally there 's the woods mill that 's quite clear that they 're really progressing progressing well that some and I think the staff for their perseverance with that whole story really of the woods of mill and Eddington which is coming on in terms of its restoration the I think what 's important though is that the counts the Heritage funding for the County Council consultation that 's really a separate part from this from this report yep one but I think it 's important that councilors are aware that in terms of heritage grant funding we don 't have any funding and the LTP for the central city land marking landmark heritage grants and also there is no current funding for the Arts Center grant and previously as a council we have always had there so that 's something and clearly there 's a lot of public interest in that the other will be I think it 's all the public already aware for example that the yeah it seems we would like to great well I guess redeveloped really the observatory building that part of the of the Art Center so and it is clear in the report to that yeah there 's parts of work that have been done is that there 's an increase accessibility I guess to the heritage buildings now there 's an opportunity for there allowing that public visibility of the good work which um which can be done through the heritage grants and when people drive down where previously it was a old corrugated iron fence and now there 's nice railings so you can see through to the Heritage Japan so you know I just there 's only one thing I wore perhaps ask that we know no tonight have discussed this with Benton and in the review we didn 't we didn 't really fully consider aspects of Maori heritage and Brennan assures neither in fact there is a part which has still to come but pizza for today we make a note that there is that some we 're expecting that in due course and just declare last point about Mari and intangible heritage that there is a body of work which is underway at the moment in in partnership with night aho and it 's the future of heritage strategy now we don 't want to predetermine any outcomes from that piece of work and that will include an emphasis and an understanding of Maori heritage so that is definitely underway it 's just it 's quite it 's quite a difficult piece of work we have to establish thresholds it 's quite got the the threshold established by the district plan listing we haven 't_''_225.19 got that sort of threshold for for Maori heritage so that 's just one aspect that we have to explore work through with Naito and that 's that is underway it 's great thank you so you want to move this so okay and do you want to Sikandar clean okay I 'm Sarah thank you I 'm just looking at 7.7 and the report with the under and over allocation of funds from year to year depending on demand and the potential for the carryover what has been so in the years that it hasn 't carried I because it hasn 't been able to what has been the loss very much money it 's been it 's been in the absent excuse me in the thousands of dollars yeah so that we haven 't seemed yeah it 's not been huge but when we came out from the immediate in the immediate aftermath of the earthquakes there was a lot of uncertainty and the fund was allowed to accumulate that allowed us to actually when to allocate funds from the previous years and that saved a lot of buildings what we 're asking for here is that with the that the fund is actually declining both in in real terms and in in terms of inflation because the construction inflation is in the manner of between five and ten percent per annum now that may may decline but us historically what we 've had and that the actual physical part of money has been going down so in order to maintain the kind of results that we 've been getting we need to we need to just make sure that we 've were taken every opportunity to to put as much money into heritage as we can 't rather than just because we couldn 't allocate it one year to not allow us to then say okay well we 'll put that across into next year 's fund but B P to say that the environment that we 're working and now with buildings is quite different to a post quite period there are still Victor more of the BI you well know what we out of disputes with insurance companies they finally managed to resolve their their insurance issues and they 're now ready to move forward into the into the repair phase but we can 't offer them as much funding assistance anymore even though there will be gaps because insurance will only cover you for a certain amount that 's right but these there 's no obligation on council to fund here it is here no it 's something we choose to do because we think we cuz we value heritage but it something we choose to put the fund again we 're not obliged to thank you um I 've noticed in the report now in the policy that now goes into actually that appears aren 't covered by and for items that what it 's covered originally by insurance so if you see pass which is really good to see but then in 7.10 just go up it talks about as as where as houses and how they 're covered so have a slight issue because majorities as is where as houses the the actual property we 're insured potentially repair that work and they 've just taken the money and sold it so technically there was EQC money or insurance money to actually do the work so in one hand we 're saying we 're not gonna pay out people with their zqc money to do it but at some point Tim was saying well we are gonna pay you out if the owner did a runner it 's just what we 're actually saying there is that we can 't do anything about people who take their insurance settlement and then don 't use it to actually repair the building that 's a private contractual agreement between them and their insurance company what we 're we 're saying here is if somebody chooses to do that walks away with the pot of money they do very well out of it but they leave the building behind the building is still a heritage building with heritage values we shouldn 't abandon that building just because they 've walked off with the money yeah but a lot of times women they 'll be buying their building they 'll be dining money put a mirror reflects effect that the work hasn 't been being done so technically they continually be buying it with their insurance money sort of negotiated into that price of contract and we would we would seek clarification on that but I haven 't had an example yet where the insurance money comes with the sale of the no no it won 't come with this sale but what it is it 's the price of the contract will be actually a lot more reduced because of the fact that says as whereas because it takes into effect that obviously it 's not insured enough take done that yet the work you yes so technically they 've already have sort of been given the money just by the lower-right but they 've still got the work and the risk of the work it 's a it 's as if they were starting in in a situation where where they had no insurance and they bought they were the owners of the building that needs work on it so I don 't we don 't see that there 's the building for a number of years do you know how many as we 're as houses we 've done grants not not not tremendous I can 't tell you off the top of my head what numbers there are in often where you might not know the answer this one as well but how many of them like someone 's come along and board it they might apply for a grant down the work do you know not very many very few but some some have I 'd have to check that and find that out but I don 't_''_598.92 I don 't recall too many being sold last question just looking at last year 's funding there was a couple of a quite substantial grants of 200,000 or more and obviously the bigger the grounds are the less money there will be disappear out to other applicants and so therefore the number we get is actually quite low for the for the year which has concerned me quite a bit when we look in potentially at one individual getting us quite a large sum of of money so a cap on it and potentially we can be giving these two hundred thousand dollar plus grants to these individuals hair often like lastly there was to their plus 135 and previous year 's hair often has there been declare to again is quite large sums of large grounds where you can look back I provide you with a six-month but you have a rough idea that the reason that there will be larger grants is that we 're not just looking at residential buildings we 're looking at quite a variety of buildings we 're looking at very large scale commercial so the vicarage is not the vicarage it 's an unusual on that one because they had to they had to physically move the building so it 's a very expensive fix if it 's a residential it 's it 's a residential building so we gave one resident 204th s yep but that that was so that came through thank you came to a council couldn 't can I just move an amendment said the Heritage incentive grants has a Kepler grant of a hundred and fifty amendment because I miss clear water and Lovingston want to agree to include their I mean I wouldn 't support that no no not without a report job I wouldn 't mind that we got some further advice but I wouldn 't support that just such a significant change just being agreed to without any advice well the committee of a delegation I think it 's up to a hundred thousand but there could the others come to council in in fact you know some some buildings significant and in life I 'm not going to take a debate on the subject but you 're not agreeing solution we have it as an amendment that future here 's it incentive grants have a cape of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars so so it 's moved by Councillor Davidson so do I have a seconder for that Sarah it would mean that all of the delegation would go to the committee which would be great because it mean that they could make all of the decisions and not have to come back to council because they 're currently the delegations yeah but but currently the concurrently the delegation to the committee is that they can make the decisions without coming to Council if it 's up to a hundred and fifty thousand nine hundred so we 're demo the decisions but as a council we can 't consider anything more all right well okay so I 'll the committee gets the follow delegations well no that 's I mean it 's not an appropriate I mean can you ask a question of staff that might assist oh well except like I just wondered whether for residential so if we were to support this amendment referring only to residential what impact that would have in terms of the grants that we 've given previously there are some very substantial residential buildings that would require potentially a larger ground what we 're doing by not having a cap we 're retaining the flexibility so that there is your decisions can be can be you can make the decision on on the ground so we 're we 're we 're not trying to restrict the grants in in a way that could reduce really interested as it seems to me that we 've got huge financial pressure on to effects heritage buildings and so we just keep getting you know asked for more and more grants with a limited amount of funding so I was really trying to understand of having this care if it was I can understand that but non-residential there based from really significant buildings that you might want to give more than that but for residential would seem to me that would this enable us to give more funding and support to heritage items in our day because we 're not giving these huge grants to residential which would be pretty unlikely now look at the information that 's put forward that I guess a range of options to be considered by the committee and by council in Dean it becomes your decision I understand that but I also understand or will realize from the applicants that we get is that people will ask for as much as possible and and you know there can be lots of reasons why that they should get that support from a point quite difficult to make sure that we 're spreading it out well we do we do actually make one of the things that is happening is is the the quarterly an assessment of each individual grant so that you instead of having them drip through every month we 're going to put them back so that you get a whole series of them that can be looked at on a quarterly basis so that that will allow you to make more informed decisions on whether or not you grant a larger award to an individual you 'll be able to see well what else have we had in this month what 's the demand in the last quarter sorry and and make that assessment it 's just it 's important to have the flexibility so that if a particular worthy application comes in that you 've got the ability to say okay well the the the the requirement here is is a slightly larger grant because otherwise you won 't be able to save the building so as as we 've talked about st. Luke 's suit moocs was a very large building it was a very significantly damaged building and the repair costs were were extremely high so it 's always important to remember that although it 's a slightly larger grant the the expenditure by the owners of that building was enormous so it 's proportionately it 's actually a small grant so it just gives us that flexibility just couple of quick things on the table for point two that would actually help to I think to make decisions if the percent or the amount or the percentage of the owner putting on so you see that the vicarage is a good example is the overall cost of the restore restoration of the buildings huge and therefore although this is a large amount and the big picture of restoring the building which is why we doing this as the in game as actually quite small but that could be the game changer and this building is gonna be there for future generations which is really what we 're trying to achieve the other quick note the key question I 've got is I can see where my I guess a really clear memo or something of how keeping this it whether it 's 150 or whatever what a feat because if you look at this list just a four point two there are only two above it but that to me personally it 's irrelevant it 's actually about the project so they vary so you 've got variations of hardly anything really in the big picture things to a significant and how that will affect and how keeping it will affect future or your ability to do things yeah well we did it we did discuss that in the or in the workshop remember that that why would we not put a cap on yeah but was over here at Council and someone 's putting them in the nap so I mean it would be really good a for counselors could move forward but they 're really good understanding and agreement it doesn 't always happen that every 26,000 years maybe but but is we move what I think that would be quite helpful I think personally will provide a memo to the chief executive that to them through the workshop okay thank you um I guess for me like I hear the Heritage incentive grants I 've got no problem with but I want to see that spread around as much heritage properties as we can and I find when we 're doing two hundred thousand dollar grants out of a pool of just over around seven hundred thousand it quickly makes it disappear now had we had this cap on it last year we would have another hundred thousand dollars which could have been another one two three four properties that could have had some good maintenance done to them I personally feel that obviously this grant has moved away from trying to upkeep and maintain these heritage properties to actually restoring them back to what they were which as a council we 've got to say where do we stop you know people are taking on these risks knowing the risks they buy the properties now and what needs to be done and it shouldn 't be up to Council to give individuals 200,000 to finish the work off I 'd do one generous just so I can get the full covenant quite frankly I actually think it needs to be lower so we can actually make this heritage incentive grants spread even further but I realized we were for covenant is there 's why I 've gone for a hundred and fifty well you 're gonna you 've moved it the actual resolution so I just I mean you 'll get the right of reply so I just I 'll end with you if that 's all right Andrew yeah I 'm just listening to some of the debate here and I 'm feeling that we may have got some of the purpose of this a little bit confused I mean the the grant is granted essentially to a for the purpose of a good outcome for the building and who owns the building is kind of almost a less important matter the reason these grants exist is to ensure good outcomes for heritage in the form of these buildings and buildings change hands buildings may well have changed hands prior to the heritage incentive grant taking place and it frustrates me insurance proceeds which we 've heard when a number of these applications have been put through application by application and which clearly from the notes in the report was uncovered at the committing is that it 's the building the nature of the building and the heritage in the form of the building which we 're funding not the owner it just so happens the owner is the person who 's made of the commitment to a good outcome for that building so I do think we we probably need to look at this in terms of the outcomes we 're trying to get which is that heritage is retained heritage is protected there are buildings on the list that easily would have been lost had the heritage an incentive grant not been in place and there are certainly restoration projects that wouldn 't have been able to proceed without the assistance of the heritage incentive grants the policy settings around an upper limit on value I would be very keen to see as much flexibility there as possible if staff recommend as they often do an amount which is good advice and we we take that advice into account in making our decisions if there are people around the table who have a view that anything over one hundred and fifty thousand is too much well that can be dealt with application by application but on the merits of that application rather than having a policy setting that may in fact be counterproductive to what this fund is all about which is ensuring good outcomes for heritage buildings and there are a couple on the list in front of us where the good outcome for the heritage building may in fact not have been able to occur how do we been looking at 150 thousand dollar cap we also need to bear in mind that the total amount of funding that we put on budget for these grants is a matter for the LTP rather than something that we would be looking at as a matter of policy or application by application and as we do with a number of funds how we graduate the flow of funds over the LTP a year the annual plan year is something 's left in the pot as we decide on individual grant applications so I think a lot of what 's been discussed here in terms of the upper cap can be dealt with application by application and on good staff recommendation each time but I 'm pleased to see the policy settings on this finally resolved so that hopefully we don 't need to debate these matters every time an application comes in front of us thank you I agree with much of what 's been said actually from even the differing points of view here and I 'd like to address something slightly new that I talked about briefly earlier was that there 's the carryover we are in really tight financial times and while we value the Heritage fabric of our city and we want to help maintain it if there isn 't the call on the that resource in any one year I don 't believe that we should have a carry over into the next year so we asking to put number four separately its operational funding that 's going to buildings which people may not now that we 're shifting to quarterly considering of these rather than monthly the committee will be able to in its last quarterly section be able to effort choosers do be up the full amount between those properties without having to look further carry over anyway so so there is a protection the funding could be used but if it 's not if there is no call for it in any one year we shouldn 't be putting extra financial strain on our budget when that could be used to fix other things which take up our operational money like potholes and roads which was one of the biggest things we we hear about and I would much rather that the funding went into that then uncalled for and heritage um Glenn and then thank you I totally hear they call on restraint on the rate payer spending that 's legitimate if you acknowledge that just a few points here is evident on our visits around the heritage buildings that they are all different so no two buildings are the same they all wear differently their age differently constructed of to nurse it on its merits or it 's situational my concern would be that if we put a cap here we could potentially get eyes the saving of the buildings 150 I know there 's a round figure we often do that just a bit arbitrary though is kind of a blanket figure across all the buildings so I would urge you to stay with the status quo over the risks the same risks are apparent in our public buildings if we take the Rose Chapel for instance water egress was discovered and some of the lining you know this is all been public through the down the track so you do get these costs blowouts which you have to allow for with your contingency budget and if you reduce if you put a cap on that that has the knock-on effect of reducing the contingency amount as well so yeah I would add you really to stay with what we 're doing at the moment some counters I think this is a case of being careful you don 't get what you wish for like for example the we vote against having the funds carried over it 's not a large amount that can make quite a difference that there are its precedent for this of course strengthening communities community boards are able to carry their funding over so where does our kind like penny-pinching begin and where does it end it doesn 't mean that it 's not important that we watch the funding carefully but I think all together like this the whole objective of the Heritage grants needs to be kept in mind and that is is to protect and at times yes restore heritage if we 're going to have it we want air city to be tourism friendly we want it to be visitor friendly we have to support that there happens and there may be some cases where is a figure of above 150,000 will make a huge difference is deputy me recede that those matters will come back to Council and and so I think like if we decide to take away the flexibility of something which is expensive like heritage well we 're really cutting our nose off to spite growth and development of our city which we are all proud of thank you all right I 'll put the amendment first those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's lost so I 'll record those who voted for the amendment Sarah Templeton Mike Davidson yarny Johansson I 'll put item for those in favor say aye well yeah it 's to approve the request to allow unallocated some be carried over no no we 're not voting to take it out we 're voting I 've been asked to pull it separately and that 's what I 'm doing so I 'll put it again those in favor say aye those opposed say no hands up for those opposed so David East Sarah Templeton Mike Davidson Thomas Kendra so so Sarah Mike and tum that 's carried and I 'll put the other three all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "in commercial sexual services silence for 2013 and could I hand over to the chair of the regulatory our performance committee I 'm thinking the end we 've actually got three bylaws today and essentially there 's a similarity between the two of them you know the three core diverse subjects one you could say is white TV a bit glamorous six from the city the last one knows quite deadpan if we did get two and they 're all essentially coming to us today because we required under the LGA to be reviewed every five to ten years and five or ten years and you 'll note the two of them brothels and cemeteries only five years and when a bylaw has been implemented as an initial five-year review the brothels by Lorde lapsed in 2013 he inserts a five-year renewal essentially here we are just making asking staff to make a determination under Section 145 of the LGA as to whether the bile or are still appropriate and or whether any changes may be required we 're not actually reviewing or renewing a bylaw we 're just responding need to whether the bowl is still appropriate and or whether we need to make any changes so with respect to the brothels pile there are some issues with the suburban operated owner operated brothels formerly known as suits so there are some issues around the appropriateness of some buildings to be have Serbs operating in them the public places by war really the significant aspect and that proposed amendment will be is around street numbering yeah emergency services particularly have difficulty actually locating some premises and so there is a suggestion with a report that will come back generally in about July this year to the regulatory performance committee that there is a provision around street numbering in the cemeteries bylaw it 's essentially okay in most respects and a review may allow some minor changes to the cemeteries handbook and flexibility to amend that handbook as and when required so all of them really are just coming to us today with a section 155 report and all in recommending that the bylaw is the appropriate mechanism to continue monitoring these activities and they all will have a corresponding two or three months time which will outline the changes that have been proposed and at that point we would then go a recommendation to renew those bottles well if it 's acceptable would you like to move all three I 'm happy to move all three and second advice but you might want to take some questions yes second goodbye Sara and now we 'll open up the three but we 'll we 'll start with you no one will well just just yeah we 'll see how many questions there are I mean I 'm quite comfortable with with what 's proposed are there any questions on any one of the three there appear to be none done I kind of do have one question around these the the brothels buy more and also the public places buy more is there any way that Street basics work can be we looked into this again I know it 's been read litigated a lot of times but is a the question I have is is a person a sign could you know the question that I had from somebody be as person that 's it soliciting for that sort of stuff be a sign on the side of a street in terms of the public places buy more I just it 's it 's really difficult and I think these communities are still struggling with them there 's an over tension to the brothels by law to regulate any aspect of street basics work because that 's not what the Act allows us it 's just brothel location and brothel is defined as a premises so we can 't expand it to any other activities and the signage there is physical signage it 's separate from advertising generally under there and in which the public places by though there are a number of anti-social behavior issues that have been sort of put outside of that review because they 're very difficult to effectively regulate under the Local Government Act by lawmaking powers and also because there 's a lot of other work that 's going on at the moment to help to look at those issues to basics were loitering and begging other three main inter social behavior issues Diane was saying that there 's a commercial activity in a public place and therefore covered by the bylaw legal advice on previously and throughout the review so we were looking at the street basics work issues earlier and the legal opinion is that that is not covered by the Commission activities close but but it could be in the redevelopment of it so that 's the next step of this process so this is this is we don 't make any decisions today about what happens next but there is something that could be looked at in the context of the battle but is there anything legally stopping it from being looked at in the context of the public places by law there 's no nothing legally stopping us looking at it but we have previously provided advice that it 's not an area that should be regulated under there by law yeah I understand that so the answer is that is that it could be but I think you know with with the working party process so that 's one follow-on question I have is is through this opportunities to bump out regard some end a shion 's out of these bylaw reviews such as recommending to the crown to review the prostitution Reform Act 2005 to include it can 't come out of honestly I think that 's better to come out of working group I mean the this is focused on on there but I mean we 've heard the answer to the question which as Lisa does enough by law to cover it the brothels one isn 't but this one is so it 's an opportunity I mean the brothels by law comes from the prostitution reform ex I mean if we 're looking at it and we 've got issues we couldn 't then say hey look actually we can 't deal with this issue under the current legislation framework yeah yeah that 's right yeah yeah but let 's take it offline it 's not it 's not particularly relevant to the decision that we make today but it could be relevant to a subsequent decision but not on the brothels one on the public place as well yep all right so that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "we 'll move straight on to item 26 and councillor goth I 'll get you to introduce this because it came up at the development forum yeah it did come up in the development forum I trust you 've all read it really anyway so you can take it as read there 's nothing more that I can really say we 're well versed on on how it came up in the process around it so I 'm happy to answer any questions but otherwise I 've got a couple of recommendations which I 'll move otherwise I just take it as rule yeah but I think that perhaps you should indicate what you 're going to move because you all know it 's not the staff recommendation it 's but yeah I 'm following on actually from and I wasn 't sure what the synchronicities business associations view would be on that I could have taken a punt but can consider to be enough my I 'm moving the staff recommendation option to that staff consult on recommence in the centricity one-hour free parking from 1 July 2018 once place with key stakeholders and the trial is initiated sorry that the trial initiative is reinstated so as in that it continues as through to the end of that consultation period and the second part to it which is in addition is just a formal working party which consists of myself all then Cotter as chair of the infrastructure environment committee in Dion swags is the local ward councillor just work with staff to do some of that grunt work and parallel with the consultation that 's a question of staffed if we just concentrated on Litchfield Street alone so we just I just um Zeppelin leagues three months up until the end of this final year I know it 's a little bit hard to actually quantify it 's feeling sick can we just try and work that out whilst them yep okay and Dion beam Yanni I was wanting to put another edition into the recommendation was to actually get DC l to do a financial analysis over this cuz even with Brendan 's the CC bas submission that they adjusted and me also looking at some of and I think there 'll be in a very good position to actually do a independent financial analysis on the lost opportunity cost versus the income revenue that we 're getting because I mean you 've got Connick now sorry you 've got counsel 's revenue by approximately four hundred thousand dollars a year might be lost if we continued it for after the next financial year but it 's it feels like that 's just been kind of plucked from an approximation but I actually want to get some good financial analysis on it I don 't think that 's yeah can we just take some advice on that as well because it just seems to me that I mean the point that Brenda made right at the very start is that it 's very hard to know the difference that 's made when it applied from the day it opened you know so the there 's nothing to compare it with you know but what we 're seen in this is that if you know all the financial stuff that we 're getting them in a lot of of money to give this one hour free away but actually and then they 're saying a few effort increases you know that in point seven point nine s is if the patronage increases that 's going to cost the council more but actually we 're not getting the full picture of that because if we got more what was be the likelihood of actually that costing if we didn 't have more based on if we didn 't offer the freebies we don 't stay for 59 minutes yes exactly so I mean I think there 's a good financial analysis that can be done to give us and Peter Peter information about making the decision yeah but what I 'm saying is that I don 't think that you need to use another agency to provide that information I think our staff can do that but but I do like it independent it 's me well we 'll just we 'll take some further advice on that but so you 're moving an amendment I could just say that in in the paper does it she set up Ric meets in the trial is 400 K per annum as the impact and if we kept it going until June 18 it 's about 100 K impact so the financial implications of the options are siddhart and it 's it 's gone revenue and it assumes that every single person will come if we take the one hour off you can 't answer that question it 's not answerable because you don 't know what the impact would be because we started charging from the day it opened this was always an issue around us but let 's let 's take some further advice on it yawning so except we don 't know for litchfield we 're absolutely not for Rolleston olders gay new region in Worcester Street and I I personally would like an option where for the art gallery one which we know has got low occupancy and the literature one which we 've heard has got low occupancy that we leave those as an hour free to the 1st of July and do the consultation but I can 't understand and I 've got this question really good to understand what was happening at those on grade ones which we 're currently paying a lease to a private landowner so there 's actually a really huge cost and on the information we had last time show that they already had like 90 percent plus occupancy so we 've actually given that is very real measurable money that we 've given away and it would be really good just to get a little bit of advice if we could plays on the cost of those ones a separate two material in the art gallery and how if some of us wanted an option just to extend it for the actor in much good we could do that once every 26,000 years Yanni and I agree and buildings in eighth grade parking are quite distinctly different into perfectly honest we want people in Calvert buildings and we don 't want to really incentivize dusty gravel pits so I would be very comfortable just to say in our council car back buildings briquettes art gallery in the Chilkat back yep just answer the Italian question of councillor Cotter we the our free parking to may be maintained and those two-car parking buildings from now up until the end of the financial year but that 's based on extrapolation of those meters we just discussed okay but if so if we have so adopt that the council adopt option two for the for the Art Gallery in the Litchfield Street car park building namely that staff consult on recommencing well we hang on why don 't we we don 't need to have adopt option two at all you just put that staff consult on recommence in the Central City one hour free parking from 1 July 2018 and that the trial initiative is restarted in finishes on theatres June 2018 for the art gallery and the Litchfield Street car park yeah it 's slightly confusing and wording the what what it fundamentally means is that it continues errors until the end of the financial year it 's just the two but the slight addition is that we only that we only retain it art gallery in which is and in my line in the sand I think is very a car park buildings yeah but they all say the answer is in terms of what are we consulting on yes and I just think that we should put that line in the sand and the resolution so request staff consult on its consult on recommencing the Central City one one hour free parking [Music] yeah but yeah but we want to make it clear that the consultation is on the art gallery and the Litchfield Street car park so it 's kärpät buildings we 're talking about not you know one of the questions has come up is just to run the whole promotion and the the road I mean to be fair the road works have been appalling through that whole area around the chilled straight it is very hard to find out how to access that um we did have a big campaign that we were going to do around that so I just interested we could get some comment on how that success of the campaign that we 've already run was and what the need is going forward particularly around the issue of road works it as we seem to be advertising or it seems to be private car parking buildings that have blue peace signs that give an impression that that council buildings on like on Montreal Street for example and so what sort of coordinated approach are we taking around our own council public ones versus promoting the private ones mmm I think for the blue parking science to try and answer your second question first that 's simply because they offer public parking so it 's not simply for the tenants of those buildings that they 're part of its for so one can come back in the eighteen time so we 're trying to get some consistency across the central city in terms of wayfinding and how people can identify and recognize car parking buildings so while it might not be a council facility people can still use that facility for public car parking in terms of the first question that you had a bus which was around the the marketing campaign and there was a pretty intensive marketing campaign across the central city I can 't speak in any detail I 'm wondering whether Aaron was involved in it and it was in the time leading up to Christmas am I 'm standing that it was pretty successful in getting the message out there but Aaron would you like to we had really great feedback from people and that had seen the marketing campaign the communications team advised us that they had high hits on some of the content that 's online etc I think it was entangled with the lead-up to Christmas though and so very very hard to measure because there were people coming in anyway I still get people who are telling me that they haven 't heard of Litchfield car park and don 't know where it is so I think marketing for us as an ongoing requirement and we have to keep doing it until people actually know about the building and we 're confident that that it 's being used by the people who could use it and whips are gonna finish sometime hopefully this century around Durham Street I think we 've just had a notice of a new way in which people looking at putting any additional signage up to really construct people how to get to Litchfield well the wayfinding signage that 's going up it 's actually going has parking signage that leads you to let 's build in some of the other car park buildings as well so if you 're coming down to you want I need to turn left to go you know counter northwards dharm Street to get around and to Litchfield so there 's good signage there to lead people and I think that actually even starts right out of the Morehouse at the edge of the floor ends Thanks well I linked the report that we have in front of us to my Jamie Gough counseling Facebook page and asked for the public comment around what we should do I had 17 four comments on it all of which Beck that one our free 100% said that we should continue with first our free parking the Central City now quickly read you some of those comments just to give you a flavor Christine said my view is that extending the council free parking initiative to support centricity businesses who have invested in our city and future of Christchurch George says 100 percent keep I 'm struggling to understand how this is even a point to discuss until such a time that the CBD is fully populated only the malls will benefit if you don 't Tonya says I wouldn 't go into the into the city to shop without the free our Vivian says keep the first hour free if you want to encourage people back this is the one way council could redeem themselves from some of the ridiculous things Christine says keep it for me it makes the difference between going to town or not and finally Michael says parking is abhorrent at best not to mention the horrendous fees pirate private operators charge at least the first hour free offers some incentive to return to the CBD and not the malls so I think this confirms what we already know the press ran their own poll the while back with 95 percent of respondents saying that they supported the free parking initiative what we don 't know is what 's the and I can do a quick back of the envelope analysis but it 's far from scientific if you take the report which is or even question but those figures they 're 60 percent occupancy stated in the report assume a conservative park turnover rate of three per day say each shopper stays for an hour and a half paying for only 30 minutes so that assumed 30% choose Litchfield because of the first hour free hook well in excess of over 200,000 in lost revenue from people no longer supporting the Central City due to the promotion ending that we no longer geared so we do need that sort of detailed analysis and I 'm hopeful that throughout the consultation period that 's exactly what we 're going to get talking to those key stakeholders is in having a breakdown on the likes of the opportunity cost and the risks and that 's what our staff are good at and that 's what they can provide for us we 'll get that by the end of the financial year when the proposed consultation is complete so I 'm advocating it as is in the council car park buildings until then because the worst possible thing that we could do in my view is to chop and change what we 're doing we 've talked we 've talked to all the stakeholders by the end where they have all the facts all the figures all the analysis to allow us to make an informed decision by LTP but it will be absolutely nonsensical in my opinion to start at stop it being started again or a start at stop it then do something different once the consultation is complete so keeping it as it is in our buildings in my view is logical because it ensures that we don 't confuse the message we don 't confuse residents we don 't undermine both the central city nor our own leadership in the process so my message with us keep it simple don 't confuse the messaging and I think this has been a real one for us and I think it would be sad if we went backwards on there the secret city needs this we know what the tenancy 're still a long way off before the Central City is anywhere near there and intrinsically that the success of Christchurch 's rebuild hangs so largely on the success of the Central City so I think we need to do everything that we possibly can and it 's actually a really cost-effective one continue it for the few months until we have that robust analysis and that we 've completed the consultation so there 's a set of three pragmatic recommendations in my opinion and I hope that you support it thank you I 'll support it too I am aware encounters will be true that when the fit with the first report we saw that the incentives as being a temporary thing and clearly this is taking longer and this is all part of a transition period but I 'm just wondering in fact if the working party might also consider this and make sure you do please as part of looking at transport and air in a city as a whole and that 's not to break up the different parts like for example public transport in cycling how we here we do get it all working like an example would be if this actually works it might be that a subsidy for public transport could help our transport system too so those are those are features that I think we need to keep in mind that this this part of parking is really an important part of the whole this is a monopoly there 's no such thing as free parking but and so I think what we really need to also be doing is promoting the car parking that we we do have because there is actually a lot of car parking and our car parking buildings actually really cheap when you look outside of the city and look at other places if car parking buildings are charged a lot more and actually the price of odd streets also a lot more so while we 're obviously going to continue this into consultation which is good I think we really need to be promoting actually our car parks car parking buildings and the price they are because they 're actually not that expensive when you look per minute actually creates actually a really good offer for poor people so look I 'm looking forward to the consultation to hear what people say um but we keep calling it free parking and it 's not free parking there is a cost fear with the lack of revenue and it does fall back onto the right pair Yanni yeah I 'm really glad that we 've removed that on grade once you 'll recall when we previously discussed that that was a concern that was raised so I wish you 'd agreed with me then Jamie yeah rather than 26,000 years ago you know at least we can I think remedy it because I think if you look at the numbers there 's 12,000 people parking at those ones alone and so I think it 's financially prudent thing to do I think it is really a shame that the road works and the legibility to get to let you 'll have just been so so appalling for so long as well and I think you know that 's only gonna just really resolve itself and in the just heard that there 's going to be a whole bunch of construction happening around it as well I do just concur with my Davidson capsule Davidson around you know we need to promote our own buildings I can 't understand why we 're spending money promoting private car parking buildings in the Central City we 've got our own buildings that are struggling for occupancy so hopefully in the marketing and the campaign going forward we can actually think of encouraging people to park at our buildings so we get the revenue rather than go to private buildings but you know I think it is early days it would be really good to um you know just go through the consultation extend it to the middle of the year the other thing that I think we should still be doing if we can is looking at having people being able to make donations if they 're parking for an hour free so that going to some of the good causes and we 're still haven 't quite mastered that but I think if you look at some of the city for example you know I think there is still room for us taxi if people want to give something to some of the good projects that are happening in the city then maybe we could have a way in which we could capture a little bit of of that especially if we 're providing a free service but you know I think this is a smart way forward good thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "right showed us crash ditch Michael Bailey to come forward and talk about the fantastic showbiz crash excellent thank you very much for the invitation for allowing the time to come and talk to you this is on many levels just an opportunity to say thank you that has been given to us over the years and to let you know what the results on that investment are at the moment obviously like the rest of the city we have had an extremely induced hiatus but we are back and roaring now that the eyes of Theatre Royal has reopened so just over the last three years our shows have encouraged tens of thousands of people to come back into the Central City we part of revitalizing their central city economy I know that the hospitality industry is delighted every time we get a show into the theatre because those 20,000 or so patrons who come to the show very happy to go to the local bars cafes staying in hotels we have a lot of out-of-town guests coming in so the airport and I taxi companies are getting a staged as I 'm sure that you 're all aware we are a totally local company so the performers that you 're seeing on stage back stage and in the orchestra are all Christchurch residents in over the last three years we 've had over a thousand people participate directly in our shows and that is laying the foundations of a number of things for some of those volunteer participants they 're going to go on to careers as performers as educators running arts companies or in many cases just a lifetime love of theatre which is good for us good for our city we have from the moment it 's been open we 've been the number one hire of the eyes of Theatre Royal in 2016 we were over 50% of their total attendance and we 're well on track for 2018 to be doing the same again but if you look up on the screen you 'll actually see I 'm just here to say um happy birthday to us 80th anniversary and we 're taking an opportunity to celebrate this with the shows that we 're oral history we are collecting the memories of some of our long-term members at our launch this year we were delighted to have one of the cast from our first show in 1938 attending our launch this year we have members from the 40s to the 50s and onwards who are still very active participants participants in our society last night was our AGM obviously I like me a missile there that is when you get a significant slice of history we 're aware that a hundredth is burning Twitty is around the corner so we want to make sure that those memories don 't about right so we have commissioned a series of oral histories now so that we can get them all down with the potential of collating a book for the hundredth year anniversary so just to take us back this building the front wall still exists so the containers on term Street that is the old st. James theater which was renamed as the Odeon and that happens to be the first in 1980 years ago massive leap forward because one of the things I want restaurant as industry it is all jazz handsome fun but it 's actually a massive serious business that on a global scale is one of the Giants of the entertainment industry because people enjoy musical theater sometimes they forget to realize just what an incredible enterprise it is so this was a turning point for musical theater right across New Zealand it was a turning point service why because New Zealand was the first country in the world that was off the rights as community theater companies to station a miserable we all win yay and then suddenly went oh no because none of us could afford to stage it none of us had the resources to stage it we were all trading as individual cities run by volunteers volunteer committees volunteer boards etc and somebody came up with a smart idea of saying hey why don 't we collaborate why don 't we put all of our resources to and work for the greater good and with a lot of soul-searching and sleepless nights that 's exactly what happened because these collective societies not only had to relinquish their one person build and for everyone to be set with the same production that we would each collectively use one after another over a four or five year period we all also had to put a hundred and fifty thousand dollars into a pot that we may not see your return on for five years time so for a community society that 's that 's a very big leap of faith I 'm delighted to say it was an enormous success in 1994 Lamers Arbor staged in Christchurch it sold out before opening night to 34,000 patrons coming to see the show making it the largest musical didn 't ever been staged obviously the Iceland Theatre Royal is a natural home for us the stage of shows that we produce are on an extremely grand scale we are very happy to say that we are stage and shows and I choose this word carefully that are bigger than Broadway I 'm not gonna use the other be with the better if that 's up for you guys to say that but they are bigger than Broadway in the sense that casts larger lighting rigs larger orchestras cetera so you are seeing a fully internationally scaled show that would be bigger than you may have spent thousands of dollars to travel to New York to see but that requires a very specific sort of theater and when the isothermal roll was reopened in 2014 we were delighted because we need that mess of backstage area with proscenium arch fly Tower and orchestra pit so the only venue that we are able to stage the shows that we do is the likes of the eyes of Theatre Royal it is now the finest heritage theatre in Australasia phantom the Opera this was the first major musical in the eyes of Theatre Royal so just to give you a sense of scale until two years ago this was the highest-grossing entertainment piece of all time that 's big and Rolling Stones will do it bigger than the Titanic movie series and it has been overtaken recently the biggest grossing entertainment on the planet is now Lion King the musical so musicals are extraordinarily but extraordinary businesses to open a new musical on Broadway takes four and a half years of full House 's to return the original investment obviously shows of this nature are never going to come to New Zealand and a fully provisional capacity we simply don 't have the population we don 't have the tourism throughput large-scale musicals tend to exist in very large international cities that have huge tourism numbers so our community better structure is brilliant shows to New Zealand that would never otherwise be staged here on the scale and we 're getting extremely good effort and the rights holders are now very happy with us because they charge us a high percentage per ticket and giving us the rights to some of the latest and greatest shows in the world which leads me to some of my next slides this happened during the Pride Festival last year and we 're associated given with the Pride Festival this year this show was built in Christchurch we built a new bus we are pretty much the primary employer and make notes no pretty much we are the primary employer of scenic solution over the largest design firm least 10 months of the year with our show builds I 'm so they built the bus and sets that cost a quarter of a million dollars for Priscilla so this show is now available for other societies to hire it opens in Dunedin in three weeks time and it heads off to New Plymouth if these shows aren 't built by show biz Christchurch no other Society New Zealand will get to stage them it 's as simple as there and all of those builds are happening here in Christchurch we are driving a an industry which now sees Christchurch recognized as the center of excellence so you can proudly leave the room today and say our City Council is supporting a center of excellence of musical theater in New Zealand because that is the absolute truth which brings us to opening night in 15 days time look at wicked this is the New Zealand theatre company premiere once again this is a new-build production that we 're creating specifically for our season we have ten other community theatre companies around New Zealand that have signed our agreements for the country so the good news is year after year after year on our forward calendar which goes through till 2025 at the moment we have New Zealand theatre company premieres of some of the biggest shows in the world that is going to drive business into Christchurch that is going to be bring people to the city to visit I can tell you every other theatre company in New Zealand has come into Christchurch on either the 6th or 7th of April this year because they 're all desperate to see this show this is the second highest-grossing musical of all time on Broadway it was the fastest musical to reach a billion dollars in ticket sales on Broadway these are major major shows for us to stage a show of this nature as a community company the budget is still upwards of a million dollars so these are a very high-risk venture and we are delighted that we were able to successfully manage that so in a nutshell over 80 years more than 2 million people have come to our shows it 's actually significantly more than 2 there we think we 've not passed 2.5 million but it 's a hard number to pin down volunteers directly participate in our shows who have gone on to lifetime careers if you go through the court theatre at the moment a number of the established performance there like the Bond Martin again a number of the court trustees they all started their life doing what was Christ Church operating society shows now called showbiz but we are still doing that so many of our members leap off our show stage and go to international exposure International training we are creating a whole new generation of theatre practitioners since the eyes of Theatre Royal opened in 2014 a hundred and twenty five thousand people have been to see showbiz shows we are by a garden while the number one hire of that venue we are underpinning the success of the Isaac did oil as a long-term asset to the city in 2016 that year alone we had about twenty under-18s performing in our show aged between 16 and 18 so all year 12 and 13 students at high school etc bumper crop six of our performance from that year attained places and some of the top theatre schools in the world there 's one in the London Academy of song of stage and dance won over a whopper the best musical theatre school in Australasia one over and VCA to bring street under full scholarship in wonder Performing Arts down a note a go so they 're now all 18 or 19 we think they 're going to be some of our future New Zealand stars and as I 've said before creating a center of musical theater excellence I can this is a little anecdotal but I can tell you that we 've just had auditions for Labour 's arrive last weekend and we had three people who were news of the city and we said ah what brings you to Christchurch because they were all here to study various courses they said oh we came here to do shows they have chosen to relocate to Christchurch because they 're so thrilled with the opportunities that are available to perform thank you so much any questions no Michael I council agenda but this is a wonderful opportunity for the council to acknowledge the wonderful work of showbiz Canterbury and to wish you a very happy birthday which I hadn 't realized was the 80th Thank You Barry for a fantastic presentation really looking forward to wicked and the other shows on your on your program so thank you right so now we move on to deputations by appointment and we have five deputations on item nine local alcohol policy so I 'd like to call dr. Alistair Humphrey Thank You Canterbury medical officer of health policy is an important tool for us to use to curb alcohol harm some of you may remember the Law Commission report the front page of which the cover we sadly the the poster town for that report alcohol in our lives curving curbing the harm which was 2010 and on the front cover there was picture of the terrace with with the problems that arise from acute alcohol intoxication but from the district health boards perspective it is not just acute harm acute harm causes enormous burden in our for our general practice actually the day after and for our emergency department an acute harm leads to some is not just minor injuries we regularly have examples of damage to people from alcohol intoxication that costs all of us millions of dollars nevermind the tragedy to the people and the families who are dealing with people who often have long-term disability as a consequence of accident but the other important part of the damaged selca holders which was raised in that original commission report and we have followed up with our own data is that there are long-term consequences to increase in consumption of alcohol to the tune in this in and can 't_''_937.699 be District Health Board of close to a hundred million dollars a year that 's what we are all paying to deal with that not just the short-term but also the long-term consequences things like breast cancer for which alcohol is a significant risk factor stroke hypertension so these are all things that our community has to face because of an insidious increase in alcohol consumption there are not many tools provided to us by the 2012 act and some of the more potent recommendations were not picked up by the government of the day in particular those that relate to what fiscal tools if you like taxation and the like which was disappointing but make no mistake the tools that we were given do have an effect and the local alcohol policy was one of those Christchurch in my view as in so many things he says in a slightly one-eyed way but as in so many things we were ahead of the game with our local alcohol policy we had a progressive alcohol policy that was going to permit and indeed possibly improve vibrancy in our central city while at the same time making sure that we didn 't suffer there well we minimize the consequences of harm from alcohol it is a policy that deals not just with on license sales but very importantly with off license sales and the fact that we have had such a strong resistance from organizations that want to sell alcohol such as supermarkets suggests that the policy was effective there are other issues around the sale and supply of alcohol to fight with supermarkets in particular in the courts and I 'm happy to say most of the time not all at a time most the time we fight and we win make no mistake they squeal because the increase in sales over the last 20 or 30 years particularly supermarkets has been enormous I will make one kind because I did for the local alcohol policy last time about unlicensed sales with our tri-agency approach to alcohol over the last 20 or so years our host responsibilities in this city is second to none our managers of bars a long way from where they were 20 or 30 years ago and I have said that the safest place to have a drink is in a bar the the reason for that is because we have well-trained managers who are well supervised overall by the police who will look after you when you have a drink they will give you water or food if you need it and they will give you a taxi to get home but that home licensed environment has to be supervised we have to be that we supported the police in having a relatively well circumscribed area where we could all enjoy ourselves late into the night and what we are now seeing with the rejuvenation of Christchurch is the market is bringing people back into the city so the objections we have heard from from those on licences who have wanted to maintain what I call chasing the drunken dollar at three o 'clock in the morning in in the suburbs of Christchurch not popular with the residents there and very difficult to manage what they are seeing is in fact people are moving back into the city to a vibrant city centre and where we can all enjoy ourselves safely so there those are just a few examples but there were a huge range of very positive tools in that local alcohol policy that will ensure that we have both a vibrant city but also a safe city in which we can enjoy ourselves and I would ask the council that they revisit the issue of the local alcohol policy it is a tool that is valuable for for all of us those one to sell alcohol and those of us that are responsible for ensuring that people are safe while they do say I 'm questions yes so we 've got time for questions Jimmy question three do you think the existing provisional local local policy no can play is a function because I remember back to several years ago no please you and the wider community individual more than four thousand summations in that I was very impressed with all those summation if a new one in the exist one hazard offense can can you know the achieve these new scope the new one is a watered-down version of the original one a local alcohol policy is better than no alcohol policy at all so does that answer your question I think we should have one I think the rigor that was applied and the mandate let 's not forget the very strong mandate for that initial policy remains I believe but it was watered down and it was watered down because of in my view some very clever legal David one of the strong points that you made was the the steps and pediments or processes that you could go to actually install a charge on those people that have obviously just overstepped the mark and cost the city on the health industry a lot of money ken can we or while there are impediments that would be in place for the hospital board to actually levy a charge on people who obviously have just made that donkey of themselves and ended up in hospital due to two aspects to that first of all as a doctor I treat people we all all health professionals sign up to some form of Hippocratic oath they treat people who have made fools of themselves they treat people and up all circumstances punishing people financially for the problems they get themselves into but the other point I made and it 's very important to understand this a very high proportion of our health costs are for they for the invisible costs that you don 't realize and I 'll give you an example of that take for example hypertension and Stroke it is well known alcohol has a significant contribution to that not risk now when a supermarket sells Sauvignon Blanc for six or seven dollars model the shopper and I 'll say innocently pushing their thali down their aisle who happens to see it might think Oh Natalia that 's not very expensive maybe a couple and that insidious increase in alcohol consumption can end up many years later with that shopper suffering from hypertension or a stroke paralyzed in a wheelchair or with a breast cancer problem that needs an expensive treatment and that 's a very insidious issue we have to deal with it on a population health level we have to understand that the harm from alcohol is not just intoxication it 's the going home at night and having one glass of wine that 's kind of just to relax and is okay and then it becomes two and maybe three and that 's driven by low costs and availability and that is one of the things that the local alcohol policy sought to deal with the other issue obviously is the difficulty between on and off licences cheap off license sales are undercutting and damaging our local was particularly starkly in Dunedin where bars had closed because cheap off license sales have meant they can 't run their businesses a classic quote from the manager if the Captain Cook was he the students turning up to his bar turned up more intoxicated than when they live when they left he was looking after them giving them food and water and then sending them home but not selling anything so we have to also if we want a city where we can enjoy ourselves in the evening and we need to deal with the pre-loading and sideloading and that means shortening the time in which off license sales are made and remember that most off license sales are consumed within an hour of purchase so people do buy cheap alcohol from supermarkets are not putting it in their cellar they 're drinking it thank you we 've got a time restriction on you but thank you very much for your reputation thank you the canopy branch of the hospitality associate to New Zealand Amy McLaren Monti and Peter Morrison thank you this deputation is made on behalf of item 0.9 relating the decision on whether or not to proceed with the preparation of a fast-track local alcohol policy I indeed was asked to provide two views on the three options considered on this agenda item and we expressed a firm position that the formulation of a new like I have policy should be put on hold until October of 2019 for a new council to agree on a process to be completed by August 2022 with the default provisions of the remaining in place until then we do not downplay the seriousness of alcohol related harm in our communities and they concede advocates for workable solutions listen since we are firm and our view that advancing a local health policy is not the solution to achieve this outcome it is very disappointing for all parties I am sure to be back in this position after debating the need for la P and after always almost reaching negotiation last year on the provisional LA P they could assess like all the interested parties at no further costs to the rate payer and involved applicants rather precariously this is not in previous councils have been mislead by staff who have failed to accurately inform you listened partly for the high court proceedings that were bought on the council in 2017 back in 2013 the draft la P received the largest number of submissions on a council policy with 76.4% opposing the content which again has been misreported to you by your staff if you take anything away from the stupa tation be please leave it be these following points one you were told in 2013 that it was too early to prepare la P with a city still in recovery mode there would have become at a significant cost and that the process would lead you have failed legally all these points were correct you were also told that you cannot use it la piers a planning tool to inflict zoning decisions on the Central City and the High Court agreed with us the costs and failure risk to you as a council and making a decision to advance a la P again is high and there are many and the community who are ready to take you to task council has not even bothered to contact the other two appellants who fought about the appeal proceedings to think long and hard about a wallet what are la Paix achieves whether there is a issue at a local level there you can realistically address you 'll be shown sides from the police and public health to depicting alcohol related harm horrible energies accompanied by national and international statistics what you won 't be told is that this town is securing at the home and ant controlled drinking environments something in LA P can not address and not I 'd say not occurring in crushers highly regarded monitored and enforced bars we think the tools to reducing alcohol related harm me to be implemented a central government level addressing meta such as pricing age and availability as well as for a vision of education for the end users of alcohol LAPD does not actually restrict the person access to alcohol and does not prevent all harm from occurring it just shovels the problem around while it is in marble to try and fix this issue the LA Pig is not the is that the Act has provisions to address bad licenses what you 're not told in your staff report it said that there 's provisions to address bad licensees prevent new premises establish in areas with high identities of existing premises and to avoid the proliferation of off premises the district plan places controls on the location of licensed premises from residential areas and imposes annoyed noise limits on businesses you should find a very suspicious that a thorough evaluation of how they act works and practice and the relationship of the district plan to alcohol work in our community and is not being provided to you the issue is that this council faces faces appears to be associated with the proliferation of off licences and not on premises you have been misinformed that the only way to address this is by an el ap we know of only four off-license applications since 2015 they 'd have generated interest within the respective communities and each each have gone through the statutory process under the default provisions of the Act being mandatory public notification and a hearing and refused all the process and it allows those in the affected community to be involved in decision making meaning that those not affected do not have to be put through the cost as a rate payer to deal with via an el ap for applications over four years can hardly be seen as an administration of burden for the agencies significantly you have been a forum misinformed on both costs and the time frame to establish an el ap your staff predict the cost of 150k including excluding legal costs for Appeals we just make the cost to be closer to 1.5 million including Appeals the high likelihood of Appeals means that there are still a risk that you will not end up with an LLP Peter can I just interrupt the last sentence I just don 't think I mean you can refer to accounts of the impact on counselors but not their impact on staff if that 's okay just just the very last sentence of that power of thank you yeah I implore that you for you to keep this in mind when spending more rate payer money on top you as counselors who you will be held accountable yep finally 18z dynasty that had visors I have offered to sit down with council staff help them address the floors and the protest to date this has been rejected we are here before you as the decision makers the one issue the decision makers the ones we voted for dealing with a report that only gives you half of the picture and could will be the foundation of further legal proceedings we are more than willing to work with the council and agencies to reduce alcohol related issues in our communities but stand firm that el ap is not the way to do this and that the decision needs we made to Park this process until for the next council to properly reevaluate thank you very much thank you do you want to speak as well no no that 's good so we 'll open it up for questions and I 'll just pick up one thing you know you didn 't identify the position that the public health would adopt but in fact what we heard from Public Health premises and that the real cause of a lot of the harm that we see as the very cheap alcohol that sold through off licenses which leads to pre-loading and I hadn 't heard sideloading before but that 's obviously when you go to a bar and then zap out for for a cheap drunk that 's been bought from an off license and then zip back to the bar so that must be hugely challenging for the industry we agree with that as well what dr. Humphrey didn 't tell you that actually our home consumption and New Zealand is falling it says it 's increasing it is falling we 've always said that the pricing and supermarkets especially has been a big problem yeah and we as an on premise we have off-premise licensees off-premise licensees they wanted a bilakoro minute there 's no more licenses in Christchurch but it 's it 's a matter of getting it done yeah Dion and then Phil so you 're not saying that hospitality in New Zealand against an IP it 's something it 's what we 've always said at have another 16 on licensed premises going to open down the terrace I don 't really know what we 're dealing with we just say we prefer to wait until we know what sort of demographic and environment we 're dealing with yeah that 's the solution we had which we I 'm very disappointed we couldn 't have been retraced before we had solutions and to an L IP and that was grandfather was MIA Tommy it 's really grandparent they had justing premises outside the central city that it 's 00 or 00 a.m. licences and to enable Victoria Street for 3 a.m. trading for the entire length of the AP period so we it was quite easy we could have fixed us tonight sorry I just wanted to say before we run out of time chasing the Drunken dollar at 3 a.m. we don 't we 've got two premises and all of Christchurch that track pass 380 sir and we 're also not saying that those that have an 00 p.m. and the residential areas currently should be extended to that that doesn 't make sense the morning when they 've got residents right next door yeah tasting the drunken dollar at 00 a.m. to bars trade past 00 in Christchurch yeah so can I just ask you any report I think the understanding the understanding is that your view is that license the license appeals process is that that sufficient to actually for community groups to be able to make their case as part of the implications can I just ask you what he 'll how do you believe that small community groups and ordinary people can actually have all the information and quite an address quite a complex process to achieve what you 're saying my real picture my real question is why should community groups have to go to all that trouble with very few resources when clearly hospitality newsy on they 've got large resources okay then why are you prepared to capture the unlicensed market how is that possibly feared where it 's dr. Humphreys four-thirds to it is the safest place to be drinking as an unlicensed premise so why are you trying to capture the unlicensed market when you thank you very much look thank you for your time that 's much appreciated could we invite the New Zealand Police Inspector Richard Bruce area prevention manager Christchurch meet ray good morning welcome good morning thank you very much I 'm on the area provincial manager for Christchurch Metro which means that I cover the alcohol harm area for the city and but also down representing serpentine at Lane taught us the painting area commander and his role for the city as well so thank you for the chance to speak from the alcohol policy and we also believe that it 's an important tool to address alcohol can so we support their view our preference from the places that alcohol policy be enforced at the earliest opportunity and therefore we support the recommendation in the paper to prepare a draft policy as soon as possible Christchurch has still experienced alcohol related harm and alcohol policy will help address that harm the sick cinema paper on page 57 were still the police 's view particularly around that any delay to a local alcohol policy will result in additional unnecessary victimization is a brief presentation from us at a high level to say that we support the recommendation in the paper and that our preference is for an alcohol policy to be enforced at the earliest opportunity please thank you thank you questions Tim did you have a question same to you f we started the process of the net which is the important thing oh I feel it as if it were to exclude the Central City so we concentrate on communities first as we work through the process of the lit because that is quite clear enough that we we have to have a clear process would you be in support of that because the last lip that we had did seem to come unstuck and if you look throughout New Zealand lips have failed so if we concentrate on our communities first which is the off-licence and then as we work through that process with all the partners which would be the hospitality of New Zealand yourselves are the district health and interested parties and go from there so we concentrate on the communities first and the off through with their formation our preference will be to start with the whole city in doing the city centre as well I think with the bastard of you and the bars that are coming I 'm in the problems that we used to hear when it was destroyed we actually deal with city and deal with some suburbs and the issues that are there around hours and locations etc deal with the city as well clean Jonnie Sarah thank you could you give us a quick some of the outstanding the issues that stand out rather that you see in your staff and the central city and also in theirs suburbs from the harm of a handfuls Biocon sure I think it 's supposed at a at a high level we see a lot of jobs that related to alcohol and being involved and it causes work for our staff and causes harm for the community around violence etc and domestic violence and so we see that any steps that help reduce alcohol harm for the community at all the LMP there 's a tool that helps address alcohol harm are you able to delineate you know the major you know any major differences though between the unlicensed issues that you see and then the issues that you see in suburbia only only to the point that obviously pre-loading licenses somewhere else is an issue enforce and we know that 's always been an issue and then with the bars we have an opportunity to control them I suppose because there 's relations with them I can 't delineate to the point that you 're saying but I can say that there 's both things require attention from us I 'm Yanni Ben Sira thank you and thank you for the deputation oh I was just looking I was just wondering really what the New Zealand plates are doing at a national level if you 've you know like for a council for example we 've got mirrors that we 'll be talking about the various issues associated with the lapse through the courts and through implementation what 's worked what hasn 't are you doing anything nationally looking at the effectiveness because I guess I was just interested in the quote in the media was places failure present evidence for one of the reasons that the court rolled a certain way and we 're hearing both sides of the argument today from people that you know think we need one thing you know we should defer yeah anything that you guys are looking at nationally as an easel in place in terms of how these la P processors can be bid get better outcomes for everyone concerned sure I haven 't got a national view for you but I 've come here with a view for Chrysler to Metro is that we have viewers that we support it being preceded with and I think the process that goes through what will take care of some of the issues that you 're raising as we go through there 'll be the chance to address those matters and then speak to them and provided views on them it 's just if we keep ending up and cause and having you know successful appeals it doesn 't give much certainty and it can take a lot longer I think I think yeah recently you know throughout the Dunedin let which focused specifically on off licenses and they were up against the supermarket giants in terms of the response yeah I mean I 'm just concerned that there 's a community expectation that 'll that can deal with some of these issues when it when it goes through the process what we 're seeing around New Zealanders is it 's it 's actually not and it 's been chucked out on appeal in many cases so I wasn 't sure the place for looking at any sort of collective response to that yeah well they are just quote from the from the mayor of Dunedin the irony as local alcohol policy is ultimately being decided on in Wellington and that 's a contradiction to what it 's there for so and it 's certainly my intention to have a conversation with with the mayor of Dunedin about the circumstances they found themselves on I 'm Sarah and then David David you mentioned that the police have the ability to enter a bar and regulate things there what 's your response to an a enforcing some of it we seem to have a problem with with freeloaders and we 're acknowledging that the bars a problem it 's idiots of drinking the stuff that at a cheap off license and then comes down tanked up so we 've removed removed that statute for being you know taking missing someone for being drunk in a public place if that was brought back what 's your impression on the effect that may have improving some of their problems and thanks for the question I don 't think it 's appropriate for me to go down there I 'm down because that 's not a issue for the police that the laws are set by others and we enforce what we have before us and what I can say though as some steps that you have taken already around alcohol barriers as a positive move for us it 's a great preventative tall ways I 'm sure that you you know really and we 're that gives us a chance for people drinking in a public place for us instead of waiting for other are feigning to a preventative tool that we can actually baked quite positively with in a very various ways to actually stop people getting drunk and causing harm in a public place so that 's like that 's are told that we support and it 's a different issue that 's yeah but now the sorts of things that we were and then on top of that rather than go down a discussion around a whole different legislative option we have options were really than the crime take some of the offenses act exceed or to do what 's a disorder on public schools so so once it tips over the line so I think that you know that there 's a harking back to the to the olden days with you know sort of the law provided that that it was an offense to be drunk but there is still an offense if you do something that 's offensive or disorderly the police can act so you don 't need a crime that 's of drunkenness because if you do have one then you have to arrest them you have to proceed cell and if they were under 17 you 'd have to deal with under the legislation that deals with children and young person so I went out on a night visit with the police and I suspect that you know with you know I think it would be worthwhile for counselors to do that to go out I mean this mind was there quite a long time ago but I watched the police defuse circumstances such a shion 's just by the taking of a measured approach the alcohol beans certainly assisted and the CBD in terms of taking open bottles and just pouring them down the drain so you know there it was a good way but the 15 year old who was completely well almost comatose on the side of the road the fact that they were put in a taxi that the parents were prepared to pay for the taxi at the other end they 'd been contact made that to me is the way you solve that situation not arresting somebody and processing them so I think that 's reasonable and going back to the home actually fueled by no I haven 't_''_2940.839 I haven 't gone yeah we thought their view to care would come in with a high-level view about the local policy I think I mean I really recommend that councilors read the Royal Commission report because you will understand that there are a variety of tools that are required it 's not not just for like welcome whole thing though thank you very much for your time this morning much appreciated very much could I invite Wayne Walker to come for all please good morning my name 's Wayne Hawker and I 'd like to thank you for the opportunity to be here today to address you as a council who will be discussing and hopefully making an affirmative decision in regards the regulatory performance Committee 's recommendation to develop a new local alcohol policy for the city as a community member who has just been here the 18 airs over just two days this week involved in a district license hearing on an application for yet another liquor store in the community of Philips town I felt compelled to be here 's viewpoint a local alcohol policy is not only extremely important as another tool that would be available to support communities and their challenges of closing the proliferation of light of licensed operators just turning up especially in low socio-economic suburbs I feel that is essential we as communities should not have to go to the lengths we have had to go to with regards this application it has been challenging tiring and for many simply two months knowing that it really was a David versus Goliath situation given the applicants availability of funding and resources we as a community could only imagine and wish for so we look to our elected representatives and say please help us as we continue to struggle under the weight of the number of liquor outlets just popping up and thinking oh no not again we need your help and support and a local alcohol policy is a step in the right direction like all community objections against up let 's applications and which like as was in regard to location of a site and very close proximity to other the Catlett 's sharing being all we 're selling a high premium product directed at communities living teen kilometers away so we looked at the sale and supply of alcoholic 2012 and make particular reference to the object within section 105 and that we in the minimization of harm and that really is a key factor and why a local alcohol policy needs to be implemented as a council you will be aware of the decisions you have made around cycleways in and around crisis and the reasons behind spending millions of dollars to develop them albeit against the opinions of many and the communities my understanding is a need to better protect cyclists as a safety measure which since a you have identified there was an element of risk of harm if nothing is done given the increase and use of cycles to travel around the city and the situation of proliferation of off-licence liquor store their element of risk of harm caused by alcohol has more than arrests it is a fact and it is happening in and around communities all over New Zealand on a daily basis physical harm abuse of and yes it is real and even as we speak it is happening somewhere in society so before anybody argue against the cost of putting together a new alcohol policy which we all know is more likely going to be a price for the hospitality industry again just think about the cost of harm caused by alcohol some councillors seem to be broken at the reintroduction of a local alcohol policy because of the more than 1 million dollars for the previous policy which was withdrawn following a lengthy battle with the hospitality objections yet by having to include to spend two hundred and six million dollars on the thirteen proposed cycleways under the long-term plan where are our priorities alcohol harm is predominant more predominant society more so than the level of harm caused to cyclists and the report released by their alcohol watch group in regards to cost of home caused by alcohol on New Zealand as a society in 2016 you may be standing on that figure was five billion dollars and regard to costs on individuals through insurance medical bills loss of employment etcetera then when through cost related to the health sector road accidents police justice system welfare system that may seem somewhat scary that we as a society do not appear to him as much concern given the way alcohol is really concerned yet the contribution to the government bank accounts was only nine hundred and sixty million dollars through the excise tax on the sale of alcohol alcohol is something in society that has has far-reaching actions involved with her more so than any product or activity that we care to mention so this local alcohol policy is not just something that you should sit around and discuss should we or sort of we can we afford it the question is can you afford not to do it given the amount of how associated with alcohol and so I have pointed out and please give a special thought to the thousands of victims of alcohol I try and understand what is life like for them but for me I do not have to try and understand what life is like when hambo alcohol as I have lived through it and to this day inflicted on me by alcohol and it was also important to note that at the hearing I attended the applicants made mention of the fact there was no local alcohol policy which I believe there is none existed there is no real barrier for application other than the community put in an objections which by all account had to be pretty damning evidence for the district licensing committee to have to consider before making their decisions reality is at the present time in regards of licensed liquor stores and work waters in place everything is county waited in their favor of in the favor of the liquor industry and it 's time to address that imbalance and give us the communities that only do to best represent us the chance to even up the playing field and while not completely fix the problem it is definitely a step in the right direction for us as communities I will also know that we know I questioned the applicant in regards to local alcohol policy he agreed it was a great idea and yes he would support it so was it so buy into it as well we elected you to represent us and run the city in the best way to meet our needs we did not elect the hospitality sector who seemed to have a belief they have more rights than we do reality time they do not after all being bottom line is how much they can fill their bank accounts and at what cost to them they do not really see the true cost of alcohol and posts on society please don 't just discuss this stand up make a stand say yes we have listened to communities yes we will do what is right for this communities they have asked for help and they deserve their help thinking when can I just ask a question what specific provision and a local alcohol plan would provide you with what you 're asking for the locality of anyone you know regional area because you know the one that we 're doing at the moment is within 50 metres of one that 's already existing right so you know that 's probably the key thing but also the hours that of operation and proximity to other directions so local schools and actors yeah yeah we can do this but what your real concern is is that it 's the agglomeration of a number of outlets that are available and a local community a live person and a member of a community and part of the community saying wanting to say no or having a say and the number and weirdoes etcetera and the application how do you feel the hearing process was for your community community I found a very challenging we were you know we were guided by the chair of the licensing committee and you know some of the things we were you know struggling to understand when Atun you know we were trying to know you can talk you can 't bring that up because that 's new evidence you know anything to go away and prepare new evidence I 'm thinking more with the liberal playing field here providing challenges and from this I hope to be working with other communities and licensing committee and the alcohol team here at the council to maybe draw up for the communities to read and understand how they can best prepare themselves when they face challenges like this what helped it just seems that to get advice and to sit down with someone with regards to the process did you hear that because we heard before that you know with our licensing staff give advice but you 're saying that in this particular process there was you felt that it wasn 't a level playing field because perhaps you didn 't understand sorry sorry sorry I didn 't realize that this is a hearing that 's still current and I think I actually think that we shouldn 't be discussing it so lovely but but you 've made a very powerful point why I 'm so thank you very much for your submission much appreciated and could I now invite magic fuller owner of Trevino 's the crate and Irish bar in city Platte motel my name is Matt fuller I 've been in the hotel industry for over 40 years thirty-eight of those in Christchurch as the mayor can attest to in her previous life in this industry over thirty years was president for thirteen years and on the national board for 20 years I 'm a local and national life member of hospitality New Zealand I 've been on the local hospitality New Zealand branch subcommittee overseeing the LA P since its inception I made submissions on behalf of both of my businesses in 2013 and spoke to both submissions as well as representing the rigaton Edington licensees collector while my focus is on suburban bars for the record I completely oppose the introduction of any la P and endorsed hospitality to Zealand 's preferred position I 'm reverting to the national default house especially while Christchurch is still going through significant growth stages and demographic changes it is completely illogical to spend 30 to 40 billion dollars building a new International City and the hope of attracting comments conferences tourists events and students only for them to be met by draconian liquor laws let 's deal with any issues based on facts not a motion or feel-good in terms of suburban bars I again completely opposed the introduction of an el ap especially one that contained the last wondered and here 's why the term suburban bars was used very sweepingly or generically throughout the last el AP process but the reality is that there are many different types of suburban licensed premises and that in itself should preclude any type of overriding blanket regime for example a large proportion of suburban licensed premises like Trevino 's a join residential and our accordingly and living zones in order for any of these premises to trade beyond 00 p.m. they must go through an exhaustive and costly resource consent process and then only get one a.m. as a maximum closing time with owners noise management conditions I know this because I 've done it at Trevino 's I 've been through it my point here is that we 're a licensed premise our joins residential homes and the suburbs there are already significant tools available to the authorities to ensure that those neighbors are not adversely affected the craic Irish bar on the other hand like the remainder of suburban licensed premises is situated in a shopping complex and accordingly zone business one it has held a it did have to go through a resource consent initially to trade to 3 a.m. as there are residential houses a short distance from the rear of the premises there have been no issues with neighbors and the bars license has just been renewed for a further 3 years to 3 a.m. with no objection from any of the authorities or the community in other words there is no evidence of alcohol related harm emanating from these premises or any other for that matter these suburban licensed premises certain commercial precepts these precincts must be built on mixed-use activity later night training is an integral component of a mixed use environment all licensed premises unlike private homes must by law operate in a responsible and caring way we employ security personnel provide free water and complimentary food at times organize transport options and generally run a good ship providing an essential local community facility why should we be punished in any way for that when there is no evidence of alcohol related harm furthermore any reduction in hours would have a significant fiscal economic and social impact on these businesses repeated for some when there is no evidence that it would lead to a decrease in alcohol related harm this would be viewed as unreasonable by Allah in any court hearing and this is where the introduction of in our any el ap is fundamentally flawed because it is based on a premise that if you shut down licensed premises for potential patrons of those premises will simply go home and watch reruns of courage strength and that will lead to a reduction in alcohol related harm or crime there is simply no evidence to support that and that will be viewed as unreasonable by Allah as it was in the Auckland decision to the contrary you will simply be throwing people out of responsible controlled licensed premises and do uncontrolled environments where any trouble is most likely to occur when was the last time you saw a media headline involving an alcohol-related incident occurring in a licensed premises as opposed to one of us and I 'm sorry but at the back of your a presentation but you will get it I 'm closed to media headlines bottles Hill bottle herman student party and that is i play there are many many more but again i posed the question to you when was the last time you saw a headline that involved trouble of that nature from a licensed premises there aren 't any we all see concerns around any incidents of alcohol related harm but an L AP is not going to remedy there I believe most of your concerns revolve around the off premise market and subsequent activities like pre-loading and sideloading but there are already ample tools available to the authorities under the Act to control or limit this what an el ap would or could do is invisibly picture or impact on licensed premises who are doing an excellent job and are not always easy circumstances to provide an essential service to Christchurch in aid of its recovery this is not fair or reasonable and 2013 and my submission at that time I said and I quote fundamentally I believe it is at best premature and factly plain wrong back Christchurch is even preparing an L AP at this stage the council cannot possibly hope the demographics of this city over the next five years a consideration that is encased as a requirement in the act thus in itself is a strong reason for not developing an L AP at all which is the council 's right and simply allow the default house under the Act to apply as is the case now these are still these are still a reduction in what we previously had unquote you reward them not just by me about the folly of such a move and nearly 2 million dollars later you are warned again let me conclude with a number of questions for you are you aware of how many licensed premises they actually are outside the CBD that currently have a am Australian license are you aware of how many of these actually use it on a regular basis albeit that they view it as an important asset to their business to be used as and when they need it before you embark on a potentially very expensive gamble with rate payers money have you actually seen what tangible evidence the DHB the police or any other rated harm in the community to licensed premises are you fully aware of the contents of the Auckland ARLA decision and the evidence or lack of it that they based their decision on why is it do you think that a number of comparable large cities or competing tourist hubs like Auckland Rotorua Wellington Nelson in Queenstown now suddenly relying on the national default house and finally are you convinced that the introduction of an el ap and any subsequent reduction in hours of training of licensed premises will result in a reduction in alcohol-related part if you can 't answer any of these questions with conviction then please do not on bar embark on this hazardous let alone expensive heavy-handed piece bureaucracy immediately on industries experience and committed professionals who are providing safe enjoyable and indeed necessary entertainment venues why should they be punished for doing a good job when any adverse effects of alcohol consumption are not or they 're doing personally I believe councils have been throwing a hospital pass from central government with these L ApS they have every opportunity to include meaningful clauses in the an actual drinking age not the age of purchase as we have now and making it an offense to be drunk in a public place they put them in the too hard basket and turned it over to councils restricting on-premise sales will achieve nothing ignore it like the government did vote on fact not feel good and leave well enough alone thank you I 'm happy to take any questions thank you we 've got 35 seconds remaining Glen thank you simple question Marty yeah when will a city be rebuilt huh I 'd suggest that there 's about 15 people here in a better position to answer that than me right now you 've got another 16 to 17 licensed premises opening on the tiers foolishly in my opinion that will be ongoing for some reason people seem to think opening a bar please a joyful in an instant and guaranteed money winner let me tell you what I 'd like to show mr. Hawke of my current bank account because I can assure you it 's not when those places open they will have an impact somewhere more money so the hundreds possibly thousands of people that attend those busts are going to come from somewhere else they 're going to come out of other licensed premises there is a hope hitch that it might entice people out onto licensed premises who can 't currently don 't go out that would be great but overriding Lee they would come from an existing license perimeter those premises will be impacted on in property shut there have been three licensed premises to the best of my knowledge at least that have closed the doors in the last two weeks three weeks in the city there will be more I can guarantee you so that is an evolving demographic and in you know I 'm sure I don 't even tell you about what happened after the earthquakes everybody moved to the suburbs because the city was shut down and for a couple of years or so we had a real battle it wasn 't easy we were probably equipped to deal with it we did our best we got through and since then there has been a gradual drifter example is one-third of what it was in those first couple of years after the earthquakes so that is in an evolution that 's going to keep going and that is a changing demographic of the city and as I said to you that is a component in the terms of reference of the act that you must consider the changing demographics of the city I don 't believe you can do that because I believe the city is going to keep changing and you people probably know that better than me thank you very much Marty that 's um all extremely helpful and thank you very much so if I could just refer your councilors to item 9 _"

    "text": "on Central City one-hour free parking because we have a deputation on there and if I couldn 't fight the Central City Business Association to come to the table Brendon chase welcome Brendon middles out counselors thank you for the opportunity to come and speak to you about this yes I am speak I have to make a speech I am speaking without the benefit of hearing your counsel opposite speak so this Central City Business Association in secretive meet on Tuesday and we discussed the one-hour free parking I sent if that 's been operating particularly in the Litchfield Street parking building since it opened we 'd like to express our thanks to Council for that incentive we think it 's probably being helpful although we are conscious that there 's no benchmark to read what difference that incentive has made because it was offered from the data building was opened the council report says that refers to sixty percent occupancy in the building in December which we think is a little misleading my office is actually right next door the car park building and I casually casually observed at any given point in time during the day and during the last month police that members generally set between five and six hundred available unoccupied so the 60 percent occupancy in December business leaving its occupancy as liver was really between 30 and 40 percent [Music] reading the figures that are quoted and for the cost of this incentive twenty two and a half thousand hours and three months trial which has cost 90,000 when across your other off street car parking mister ducted and maybe if two dollars an hour was applied to that that would reduce the Sun by twenty five thousand dollars to the net sixty five thousand dollar incentive cost in the Litchfield street parking building by my calculation that 's under five hundred and fifty dollars a day the occupancy levels suggest that there hasn 't been a massive update car parking although I suspect that the occupancy rate is likely to be better during the winter when it 's Witter but the council and providing us incentive I 'm sure that the intention was to attract people back into the Central City especially environment the courts which have a lot of visitors in the open River precinct considering the three options that your officer has suggested our clear preferences for option two that the incentive remain in place for the next three months while you conduct your community consultation we think that stopping the incentive very short notice to the public would be disruptive and confusing and by our analysis of the figures it hasn 't cost an enormous amount anyway what is an enormous amount is the vacancy that 's sitting there the unused occupancy so and I think that you know when you read that the the true cost seems obvious if it was minimal for example if this 500 car park sitting vacant and they 're building at any given time not earning 2 a day in air and say four hours was reasonable to expect that it might be occupied not eight but for that would be lost revenue of six thousand one hundred sixty dollars a day times that 120 over the period of incentive and there 's seven hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars that you haven _''_336.55 it and that is enormous and we think wasted capacity so we would encourage you to continue the incentive whilst you carry a community consultation we don 't think that free car parking that 's necessarily something that should be offered indefinitely but at this time with your AC AC block it 's been a little hard to get to with roadworks on Durham of Montreal Street Valentine 's are building a new building immediately to us right the path is barricaded you have to cross the road to get around it construction is about to start on the farmers market to its left west into its north the Guthrie center as a construction site so almost two thirds or at least half of that block was under construction for the needs to twelve fifteen months at least and I think the council owes it to itself to throw the doors open and encourage people to use it because the patronage ship I believe needs to be built it 's not just going to suddenly appear on a slightly separate matter I just like to think council for making a Association worked in conjunction with Christchurch New Zealand to advocate council offices to allow this and promote it and it 's his betters now the case in its it furnitures significant so people hiring campervans aren 't just driving straight out of the city it 's actually being promoted to them in that 's worthwhile custom now come again thank you thank you very much we 've got time for questions does anyone have any questions no yes I mean there is a sea of grey parking and I think that 's a real issue that whilst will lies there to expect people to drive in to parking it 's probably wishful thinking I think it 's a natural human instinct to park out in the open at options available the west of my office I said watch during the day the old restart our Park where people drive in and pay 5 an hour and from the get go to Park pointed out to people who 's parking my car facts that there 's actually free care packing they don 't seem to be aware of it some don sites are a bit more peripheral across the river I 'm not sure it 's quite so important that the incentive continues to be offered a nice but I think in the retail you 've just raised a point that I just wonder you know pay five dollars rather than go to the free one and yes whether people realize that it does and and maybe this needs to be better signage in that regard but but I wonder whether there 's an element of you know the earthquake experience still sitting there in the background and maybe we need to be reinforcing the message about you know the safety measures that have been built into the new car park builder important message I think incentive it does really does need to be marketed yeah more strongly so there 's more taker even just to raise awareness whether people use it all the time or not because otherwise it could just continue is that the a bacon which won 't provide you know I used to use it all the time back in the day you know before the earthquakes do some thinking about that but we 're going to move straight on to this item now so right we 'll be able to see whether there 's a far superior design what was the that 's very easy to get in and out people probably need to experience them yeah all right Brendan thank you very much for your time and it 's much appreciated so we 'll move straight _"

right either way he is right he lacks the limitations he lacks the risk she is a risk rise should you shout can you fight will you a pretty face does not dismiss a quick wit a sly grin a love of life and knowledge of purpose given our strength not flesh but a mind and a resilience from here to the red-hot end you can thank you so much and you 'll hear more from the case thank you all very much indeed that was say thank you the next deputation we have is from Barbara price it 's the deputation by appointment welcome fabric on the Christchurch school of gymnastics welcome make yourself at home because the benefits that can bring to children with disabilities disabilities were aware that gymnastics isn 't just about a sport for a few people that what we 're asking for at CH g is support for rebuild with facility that helps far more than just the people who are going to go on to become competitive journalists so speaking for my son 's point of view and speaking as a parent my son has sensory processing disorder which means he has way more connections to a sensory system what is normal which means that walking through life on a day-to-day basis is painful activity for her and a score ground suit on if you touch her coming out of class he 's trying to get through the cloakroom these are the sort of children who lash out because they feel as if they 've been wet or punched by somebody but in effect I 've just had a as well as said he is dyspraxia and dyspraxia affects so many people in our population and for those that don 't know that 's a neurological thing we are the connection in the brain between what your thought and then your physical action is a delay so like giving a speech stuff up you 've got a movement stutter so to these children and primary school when they try to do Paley and so much of the PE is now tech games or playing candles or any of those type of things it 's the absolute torture for these cuts because they have to try to adjust to another person 's movement and it 's hard enough for the image actually give their own movement out without adjusting to what somebody else is doing so sports that the council quite rightly support like soccer rugby meet or one of the mainstream sports that people wouldn 't question that is ratepayers we support those facilities those supports those sports are just not sports the districts that can play that aspects that would even have trouble trying to manage a bike be called the clumsy child but my son is six it was recommended to us that he go into gymnastics as part of an intensive therapy program that he had been on since he had been a baby he wasn 't the difficult feeders clinic hurt Christchurch Hospital from two but the time he was sexy still couldn 't each side food because the sensory process in the dyspraxia affected him to that extent this is a boy who 's gone on to through gymnastics and through the repetitive nature of the of the training has strengthened up in sequence and part of his brain so that rather being the total disorganized child that 's always getting into trouble which happens to so many of these cuts he has been hit boy it brings them to me yet he 's been prefect defense at high school two years and near 12 year 13 and he 's narrow University you don 't finance finance degree all of this because he has six days a week trained in gymnastics such as enabled home to calm his brain and Karthus body and be so my plea to you when you consider this is to consider the children who can 't play normal the sport but that gymnastics is actually a way for them to be able to hear the phone and develop themselves to their full potential so the new building ish CSG says she already provides school training programs the PE program for sixty-four schools and in 2016 that was nearly 5,000 children so with what we call the differs CEO dyspraxia to calculate dysgraphia it 's really important for early intervention so at the moment the energy of the parents like myself in who volunteer our time has just completely set up with trying to get through this process of funding and pushing you know for the rebuild of building but if we have that building then we have the space we haven 't got the constant reminders of earthquakes we have about the cracked walls of the kids are not and yet we haven 't got the function room which you see through the windows of the Fallen roofs and the remnants of the earthquake we take those anxieties where now start getting our energies back to working with we have an excellent Odeon Christchurch that has been waiting now for seven years to start working where we can run programs with schools specifically some what tips was services and and use the skills and qualifications of like cs3 professional coaches to our communities our team programs which are just way too expensive for parents to do it individually we can 't afford to pay a hundred and twenty hours 120 dollars an hour for just one but if we get smart and say to a school because cats in come by taxi to school and the o teen has a specialized program and community these are real advantages that can go out to a wider community and people like my son I know that you don 't grow out of us because he had an injury last year and he couldn 't train in the gym he immediately reverted back to being anxious uptight the explosiveness of the team players here he has been a a pass grades the studio and second half the years slipped to secret because the smells and people eating all those things now he 's back in the gym three days a week immediately his results at university first two critiques no issues with work that he has to change he 's happy so I was just employing you to think outside of just how many people do the sport but think in terms of those lives that can be changed because they can participate in the sport so on top of people like Daniel we 've got adults who come from casual places we 've got teams we 've got dance parkour what cheerleading CrossFit the facilities when you consider whether you would grant this funding it 's not just the gymnastics club we share these facilities we allow them to be used by other groups so groups apparently who 've used it have been appreciate us and I 've put on a little support from the Crusaders that accept what I 'm saying about the development we 've had Paul daughter 's training because using the fire pits reduces your injuries snowboarders are saying we 've hit crepitus the big fun special Autistic Society CSG facility is not just for so thank you thank you very much and deeper and you 've got time for one question Aaron yeah thank you for your presentation because it certainly educated me on a huge part of what the CSG do that I didn 't know about didn 't understand my question is more around the Crusaders leader grateful right greatly to heed their and though supporting and you really had a whole lot of others that are supporting your funding applications with just endorsements obviously have you received one from the council after today yeah okay okay thank you very much indeed it was a very good presentation and what we 'll do Barbara it was actually go on to that item so you don 't have to sit and wait through all of the audit stuff yeah so all of you have got a memo that came to you on the hop and 7th of March David John do you want to say anything else or do you just want questions there 's other many questions of definite John Jana well thank you that you 've got the center parade not blacked out but then the other ones are blacked out and I just can just help me understand why or what the process is around a decision on that building I think in the memory reference waiting for the master plan to be can play yeah if some of us were keen to look at a funding reduction to the Center for a because we 're funding them for rent at the moment as a result of this deal that frees up that space what 's the best way to get there today so from from a process point of view it 's the the leaseholder of CSG crisis school of domestics responsibility to explore whether they 're able to sell that building to another user and then they would come back to Council by the community board to sue say Council happy for this building to be part of those new tenants council Pepita then issue the new lease to that part would come through from recommendations community board straight back to council for consideration at the moment we need to asked them about the center road being pertinent so we haven 't believed live CSG alone the situation as we wouldn 't do in any situation that whole public council ends and we 've been working actively with them about prospective tenants as some of the councillors have been involved in discussions as well as a prospective tenants that could potentially be interested in taking on that building recognizing what it will be fit for into there 's a list of four or five that have been investigated who were actively in discussions now so if CSG continuing the momentum they 're going to move on to a new site and building a new site they won 't be lifting the level of energy and support to help them find someone that may be their decision making process I was sorry I probably not being very clear um it 's a lot of money that we 're being asked to put into the project and I 'm trying to look at a way in which we can reduce so we 're currently paying a grant of X amount to the if we agree to put extra money into the school of gymnastics we actually get an asset that we could offset some costs that we have which would make the transaction over the ten years pretty much cost neutral and I was just trying to see how we actually get that decided today as part of this deal rather than leave it for a later process which would as it seems in the memo we 're exploring other other uses that probably wouldn 't save us much money and we end up having an additional cost that someone going as well total package we haven 't_''_2212.77 achieved that yes so he doesn 't require a bunch of work to be completed by the sempre to be happy that they would take on that building because they would be taken on a liability as opposed to an S it 's no buildings releases they would need to be comfortable and there so they 'll be provided with information from CHD so they come do their due diligence about whether they 're happy to take that building on and own it and and so we aren 't in a position you that they need to make that decision themselves before the council in position to make the decision on the lease so I haven 't been in contact with them recently it 's been estimated process okay see um some emotes we hear that the community boards are supportive which is great and the other ones who know their community beast about expectations around the master plan and funding but it 's also clear here that they 'd quite keen to recoup any money and to get their back again should there be a disposal of the building but I 'm quite keen for us to be able to have that offset other costs like yes the interpreting things so how are we able to incorporate that into what we 're doing today so today what was discussed with the community board on Friday was obviously with the aspirations of get up and maintaining as much as possible for the master plan approach yes and we talked to them with Lynn and David support to say well that would be something that yeah could I just add probably in response to your question Sarah and jaws eonni that the Christchurch school of gymnastics hold a ground lease from the council on that portion of QE should the council wish to propose any changes to that the there may be some legal or consultative processes that we have to go through that adds complexity and sort of justifies our answer to you that we 're not able to preempt or or include these arrangements at this point in time it 's just checking that the community board haven 't_''_2375.58 been given any expectations that money from the disposal or otherwise or leasing would come back to them rather than offsetting costs no totally another question based on John 's art so can I just get clarified the school of gymnastics will stall so we 've done a new lease with the new site and we 'll give them the funding as part of that there 's no relinquishing the lease that they 've currently got on their existing building so effectively they can choose to do what they want with that existing building required under the terms the new lease within I think either six months or 18 months of moving into the new building all going well that they need to demolish that building or have council approval to lease it to a new boat sell it to a new party I gotta move the recommendation Dave clean second Inc okay new debate zero just quickly um I mean the Christian loves gymnastics do an amazing amount of really good work and provide a fantastic space for a huge range of different community groups throughout the city and I really want to see that continue so I 'm really happy that we 're able to be able to do this today I 'm a little bit concerned about the timing and that the community haven 't had a chance to say on the aspirations the master plan for qe2 prior to us making a decision on some of the funding but the community border in favor of us and the other ones know the community beast and so completely willing to take the community boards steer on this and the local councillors expectations of the community through that master planning process it 's already happy to do this great thanks mover in sitting down Glenn you think you I think when you look at this facility it 's good for both the east and the city so you may remember that had produced a or out of the many people that have come out and done well Courtney McGregor went to the Olympics and if you look at the environment in which she and others have had to Train it 's not flesh so I think if we can do this so to be good for not only the East but for the city we 've heard already today too that there 's a wider community and city good in you know it can assist people of all ages and abilities there if this would be in keeping with what the sea is G intends to do and the aspirations of the board probably not ideal to do it this way but then if we don 't do it like this we 've got to look elsewhere in the LTP and you so there 's a sense in which it 's an internal an actual SWAT if you like within that fund so it would be good if you can support it proposal to relocate the school of gymnastics has been going on there for three years and to some degree the location the final location that the school of gymnastics had landed upon as a consequence of which may have offered some economies of scale in terms of ground Remedios we 've heard today into the City Hall and I think the presentation here earlier really does reinforce the the wide range of activities that this group does offer our community the Crusaders giving the letter of support probably didn 't actually say that at one stage they went there and had a bit of a pre-season training session themselves so it was wide and varied and I would ask my fellow councillors that they support this remit and as Glen has said it isn 't the most ideal way that we would have liked to have funded this application but the reality is that was going to be this way I put the motion okay I 'll put it those in favor please down those opposed carried thank you very much indeed and I Adam the forest presentation of petitions and I don 't have any 28 the resolution to include supplementary papers but that term moves in sequence of what that doesn 't favor please say aye as opposed to carried and then the committee minute reports I have items 5 8 10 11 12 which are just minutes from committees deal moves Pauline seconds put there those who say aye those opposed to carried that brings us to item do you want to do 6 and 7 or 28 okay we 'll do 6 7 got my finance report item number 6 happy to move Jamie seconds my discussion put there those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and item 7 the financial report for the six months to December RIF moves yeah yeah I 'll just get a second Jamie sequence Jonnie question of you know died no might be of callejero Carol you might be it okay we just see I might want to had an MMO around about it so are we allowed to ask questions on that memo or it 's not clear the one that came from Joe daily response questions from the committee 31st of January it might be helpful if you did have questions on it it 's just what the capital endowment fund like I see there 's a number of money being returned to it but I still don 't know what the process is for us to distribute that so in the past like for example in the bow of Pegasus Ward when they had money returned as part of this process they were able to reallocate it to community projects within the award but what 's happened here some of the money that 's being returned hasn 't gone back to the Hagley ferry meat board and I know the names have changed and it 's been some time ago but that hasn 't gone back into being out of the restoration into community projects in that area it 's just gone back to the principle I just wonder in relation to the capital measurement it from a number of counselors would it be sensible anyone finance some performance journey will be sensible if you have one roof on the kept going down that fund out the next meeting yeah right yeah so we can deal with the whole issue of it the inherits dealt worth the interest how you apply to it all those sorts of things that I thought we had a process underway to get that report back but I don 't know I just don 't know least to deal with its financing performance so you could I think that would be really really hope so just leave it in your hands so there 'll be a report then it 's fun in some performance it 's probably in Carroll teens okay anything else Dion just had a quick question on the operation sorry the personnel costs on page 21 at the moment the variation is positive but the year-end variation is 1.6 million in the red I mean what 's the do you know what is happening between now and you 're into sort of get such a big difference at the moment we can with the teens to make sure that all those forecasts are firmed up and I can 't comment specifically on on that one yeah does the chief executive yep yeah I mean cuz it 's quite a large variance there thank you Thank You Carol just three point six over the rates growth is that solely due to you say an increased number of rating units or is there a bit more to it based on what we know at that point in time so the population does change and I 've got Steve but yes if X loses a combination of both so as you know since the earthquakes and only until the end of this financial year were able to adjust people 's rates during the year as they either demolish or they build so the the reason that we have variances in our rates income is that we have any of the year we 've got to try and project how much natural growth net growth there 's going to be during the year the balance between demolitions and new subdivision and different the mixture some of it will be subdivisions so genuine new land a lot of it will be new building so therefore new value give us a nick residential rates unit growth off the top unit even around food not off the top of my head I 'm okay no I can 't and I 'm not even sure if I could do it residential versus any very granular in so that really split okay but yeah we can certainly give you an idea of numbers yeah in fact is reported in the episode growth rate to would be good yeah he 's also predicted to fall away over the next two or three years but we 're having as you probably know better than I do from other sources we 've we 've had our hump of earthquake recovery and things are beginning to settle back down okay thanks Vicki just going back are we making a note just for the record that the report would go to the committee for the fight for the cat wonderment fun just for the record she gets just for the record kind of updating the policy just make a little bit clearer you want to comment on this view No councilman G said it 's more or less a refresh of the current 15 disclosures policy into the style that we 've been using for the internal policies although this is fairly much an internal policy it as a statutorily required policy which is why it 's in the council has reserved for itself the power to approve the policy I said what is why it 's come to you and the other change that you can see in the resolution is changing who protected disclosures are made to within the council it formerly was the head of legal services and we 've assessed whether that 's actually appropriate given that the the legal services unit may need to be advising the council on the wrongdoing that 's reported to it under the policy it 's better to have a separate officer and all the cee who are the people that are that 's reported to I 'll put it those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you next one is item 14 the metropolitan discretionary response fans page 81 I 'm happy to move them though recommendations yep I think it Erin yeah you can ask a question of someone hi guys [Music] carrying it to budget services and whether this should really be a central government funded service around and this is a an MST funded service in the bulk of the income does come from in this state has been funded by council over time has commonly been forty thousand dollars a year the last gross organization we need to debate or he 's in question a moment or debated later and but just question of this moment are there any other questions Jimmy and the Vianney distinguish that between our t1 and priority to ACH of regardless of when the funding because I review the word Apache looks like they participate for 18,000 people who a good image he Tula Tula City they 'd apply for 25,000 per week when the 20,000 so what 's the duration ly perturbation a week another full fully amount with Wayne Effendi I have it as a priority at the moment men Amanda 25 form amount yes 18,000 people come to kaijus yes I 'm in the war 25 following on from what Jimmy see bad I am interested in why am the reduction and the money given to Kingdom it seems to to provide an amazing service it doesn 't just support people in deep but it also trains people so it 's not just and I know that they 've very well established and I 'm just wondering what the you know general rationale was and reducing that funding to Kingdom today didn 't actually do this he spent the person 's leave and did his leave from what I understood when he did the assessment he wanted to reap the funding towards the wages for the organisation rather than the rent so it was why he made the 20,000 recommendation yeah I was just um you 've thank you for getting the answers of the question about the service that was being reduced or team that service is still going and a bit like the question that ref raised but thing a central government has 'm just sort of still trying to understand why we would be funding this given that it 's a central government the thing that 's called funded government funding so this is an additional the extra people that have come into the service over this time not just for budget advice but around mental health issues and things like that which they are trying to get into other services but some of this work they still have to manage themselves do we have like a map of like where budget advisory services are in Christchurch and in which communities they 're working with I just wonder whether there 's a bigger strategic question about budgeting advice and who 's delivering it and how we wither if we 're going to fund it like on what grounds we would fund it rather than our central government it 's came up at the me as well fee fund yesterday didn 't that mean and that all of the agencies were reporting a hugely busy January and February or including the mez Welfare Fund which has spent a huge amount of money and Salvation Army Methodists budget advice and there was one other the city mission your all offer budgetary services some of the part-time some of them are occasional basis but all of them getting huge demand and quite often when they were food there there are some there are a lot of issues so what they were also finding is a lot of people not on benefits coming through just I think one of the issues that we find with the mayor 's wealthy founders that by the time people get to us they 've got two and a half thousand three thousand dollars worth of debt and a usual donation or payment of not donation about payment of some bail it 's around three to five hundred so there 's still issues I don 't think Christchurch is dealing with a whole pile of the issues in fact what we 've asked is that with us Paul dowsley ought to come and talk to us about the whole economic shift that 's happening here because you saw it in that housing report that so far fewer people now own their of equity and any sort of secured boat makes huge issues for all sorts of families not just the families that you may think that you would get and so I don 't think there is a surplus of budgeted bus service and the city at the moment in fact we know there 's not yep so so I 'm happy to speak to support this strongly clearly you know the whole purpose of King business before you do well I was here okay I 'll put them separately then so we can have Jimmy 's amendment sorry so furniture okay if he did originate we do I 'm since I moved and had agree with Jimmy 's amendment yep yeah and what we might also do is invite you to invite all counselors to the position that we were looking at on the sort of structural changes that that might be useful from these guys to start with and then we 'll get you some information apologies fell so you 're happy to accept Jimmy 's Amendment to do yeah so as I indicated I I strongly support both for just an especially in relation to Kingdom resources just want to say that a budget advice it 's more than a budget advisory service per se and it 's clear actually and the and the metrics here they liate them they partner very strongly with other support services and it 's it 's clear that the people now who are going for budget advice people who 've never been in this position before and are in some serious financial difficulties and the whole purpose of the budget advice is to stop these people falling into poverty it 's very easy to say that central government should pay for all of it but I think we as a city have in a tradition of actually supporting budget advice and other other social agencies like this and we at a time like this we need to continue that there 's there 's a lot of streets with us particularly for people who it 's quite clear in the report also are coping with mental health issues we have special funds around that I know but this agency is playing a key by training others and by partnering strongly with out with other agencies so that the Kingdom resources are as a long tradition of providing of providing the service in and yes they of course they get some mes T funding but this is an outreach which actually covers the whole city it 's much wider than Eddington which is their base and they do need new present premises they need to be able to afford increasing rents and I 'm struck I 'm strongly this application and also the application for word thank you of these today and I 'd like to point out to counselors that once this is done we 're going to have only 21,000 left in our metropolitan discretionary fund with still months to go and to remind everyone that we had a unanimous decision around the table last year to put extra grant funding in our draft annual plan and then at the last minute we decided not to that would have given us an extra seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars across the city way list in any many other things that were giving we get these applications we recognize how how many organizations in our city do amazing work with our communities and have valuable letters and how many volunteer hours that that 's extra is able to be got from that funding the fact that we have decided as a council not to do that after a full unanimous decision is incredibly disappointing and I really hope that our communities are able to submit in a long-term plan and say actually that 's not good enough and that we need to be able to support our communities better I guess my plea would be its assist our communities by funding what is hugely proactive so if we look at the top five issues for those coming to me as welfare electricity rent arrears bond rates and medicals so these are the fundamentals and people are being served to are being put in situations where they have to choose what is it going to be this week you know food power whatever these are the things that we you and I around the table wouldn 't think we need to worry about I whose responsibility it is we could argue technically actually it is the government 's but in the meantime some people still need the skills and a bit of guidance over decision making and I think this is actually a good investment please Lee it 's not a tuna again into a custody battle between as a central or local government is just get on to it and it 's just people in the meantime even because you can see we review their lumbers you know paid to four years four years ago 2014 they 're only a thousand people but two years ago the increased 12,000 people and this year there were another 18,000 people that 's amazing we always emphasize this city nor city of opportunity will welcome the people to come to our city you know their idea their contribution it 's good opportunity for us to create a good kind of good image the profile of Chi Chi so I don 't think so you know to increase 5,000 is a lot and also the 18,000 people in here consumption social work being this huge benefit to you Jimmy can I put them motor I 'd like to increase the amount the time we give to Kingdom back to 2004 in moving the amendment I would I would accept sale increase of five any cuz I 'm feel like I 'm being bullied by Phil it 's gonna punch me if I say no I did want to say something fuser because I actually think that this is more than just giving a hand out to people this is actually training them and giving them skills and I think that we want that to happen so that people can be empowered not to fall into the tricks that we 've been talking about so I I think they offer a hugely important thing to our community and yeah I think we should give them as much as we can um yeah I 'm not comfortable with raising the funding towards the scope we 've got other budget advice services in the sea that we 've heard are struggling who possibly could use our support and if they come back next week for 20,000 or 25,000 then what would be really important to just get an understanding of the services that currently exist how they 're being funded and what their needs are and I was happy to accept reluctantly a one-off grant for the amount that was suggested but I 'm certainly not in favor of increasing it there were so many groups that do work in our community supporting people in need that we rejected through our strengthening communities fund because we said that they were they were getting funding from central government and now today we 're turning around and making decision for just one of those groups without any understanding of what those other ones may be and that makes me very uncomfortable so I don 't want to criticize the work that this group do but there 's a lot of good work that happens in our city with people who need help and support and I just think you know having a bit more of a strategic think around how we do that before increasing the funding is there 's a better way to go we 've just heard that one of down so actually this groups demands should be reducing not increasing so I don 't know why we would increase the funding based on this from the staff recommendation I think we also just need to be mindful that and again that 's not a criticism of the group but there 's a lot of religious budgetary advice service services to inner city but there 's I think only one that does it that 's not non-religious so you know I think we do need to think about about that and end our policies so ruin to buy it so you know I think we just do to be a but we need to make sure strategically that we 're reaching the people that need the help and that for some people they may not choose to go to a religious provider so you know it 's just for me we need to get a strategic piece of work done and I won 't support an increase okay is there any more debate because what I 'm intending to do just so you 're aware has put these two I the grant of 25,000 to kingdom resources is lost I 'll put it back at 20 okay just so you know what you 're voting on yeah yes a full shadow 20 and so that there so that we don 't run the risk of losing it all together because they desperately need it yeah could I just make a brief point of reply please because there 's no motion no there might be other people who want to speak so he would be closing their babies a bit and so I 've got Dion Jamie and Tim I 'll make sure you just had another quick look through the through the staff reports and they 're actually pretty good [Laughter] I 'm more comfortable staying with the two recommendations from the staff the 20,000 we do here quite a few more months to go so that 's we 're on signaling and I just want to say that I do know the pattern I have heard of the kingdom resources limited stuff and this is not anything to do with religion this is to do with people so after 's a confusing response fund amendments all I 'll say listen I 'll keep it really brief I 'm gonna be voting against both amendments not because I don 't disagree with sentiment I do I think they do great work but the one thing I 've learned on my time and Council is that the unexpected will appear you don 't know what you don 't know and the other thing that I know is that our staff do a really good job of getting to understand these organizations we all mean very you know have best intentions around this table but we don 't get up close and personal with a grassroots level with these organizations like the staff do I think there needs to be an element of trust and governance and I think they play you know a very difficult game trying to allocate the far the finite resources that we have to some very good organizations so it 's it 's an art not a science and I think we need to back our staff and based on betting our staff and they also based coming up we 're the unexpected will almost certainly arise I 'm gonna stay with the staff recommendation on this okay now I 'm only gonna let you speak once in no I 'm gonna gonna need anybody speak once Tim thank you think there 's a connection between these two are really an article recently of some of the most successful people the world and these active people sit one thing that sets him apart made them successful was reading reading reading what they all do is for about 80% of the day they read whether it 's in the chosen field or of expertise some of them felt that too relevant what they read they just read so I do think there was a connection between these two and I was okay Thank You Erin have you spoken it just felt like you 're here sorry Erin go for it sorry I asked a question thank you so I listening to the debate I 'm no longer happier to be the Sikandar happy to be the Signet now that it 's changed because like a mere point out 's merely formats actually include this month listen halfway through so I will I prefer the original staff recommendation I generally always trust the staff and these reports they work closely with these groups and they give us a figure for a reason because they 've done a whole lot of research on how much money they don 't have to spend and also how well they know the organizations and we there are the fundings coming from so I 've never had much force to ever doubt the recommendations and on this case I 'll go back to the original solid remove my name from being a second because it 's change thanks Erin so have we got a second afford a 25 to both Glen okay so can we put the amendments there 's no more to the original ones okay by way of foreshadowed further amendments okay so the first one so it 's now yeah can 't_''_4636.38 so Clearwater cancel Livingston and so we 'll put them both together any problem with that the 25 for both of them are you happy that they both go that okay they 're 25 towards the word I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed can we just have a show of hands guys um if you 're a favor put your hand up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and is that what 's it going to be I depend I know there 's a couple away and so if you 're opposed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 well okay carried by 8 to 7 is that where you got joke right okay and the second one 25 to kingdom resources trust can we put the 25k first those in favor please say aye those opposed I think it 's lost but can we have a show of hands those in favor please put up your hand what you get is it seven those opposed one two three right that one 's lost can I put now the 20k which is moved by Sara and seconded by Erin to kingdom resources can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried right okay thank you I think to Clause 29 the LTP consultation document which is a supplementary agenda the LTP teen water [Laughter] right clearing and interesting I need the coffee yes to just make a Restatement about crash it James II yeah okay thank you so as you know of course the long-term plan consultation document is the umbrella document that provides the key issues and proposals for the draft LTP so it 's the the document that our community connect with but with the detailed information and the additional document sets that prepared we had a discussion on this earlier in terms of Christ Richie and Zed and the direction you gave us in terms of including a question around that and the consultation document which we discussed and you approved earlier in the week it 's gone through an extensive process with our auditors our legal people and today is really a technical sign off of the auditors opinion on that and the feedback on that but closures in theatre have some concerns about the content the way it 's written it doesn 't really fully reflect what the additional funding is for additional to major events that an International Education the film scene to conferences in a range of things that they do I 'm satisfied that the wording is that as reflects what we discussed in the direction that you gave us and it describes it in a way that 's reasonable to understand but the concern really is that the you know public wouldn 't understand that through a wider variety of things not just for major events what we could do is continue to eat with Christchurch in Zeeland clarify the information on the website in the other long-term plan documents and also make sure that we include sort of small specifics around the particular areas that they 're funding additional funding would include it would be difficult to change the actual consultation document as it is because it 's been approved by the auditors and approved by the legal external legal opinion as well I don 't know Carole you want to talk about the actual process but hippies taking Christians right did you want to talk before we take questions very close advisers and also with audit that is the amended consultation document that you see before you today the auditors have issued a we have issued an updated leader Brett presentation and they 've given us an updated audit report so this very late stage with consultation occurring tomorrow and all of the documents already been printed it 's virtually impossible to make a change I 'll start with the additional one that just came from their last sentence why are we why are we approving something if the documents have already been printed has been driven by the advice from the office of the Auditor General they 'd said that including the question for Christ 's Church indeed was a change it was significant enough that required us to reprove the documents know that you 're saying that from what I gathered that we couldn 't correct the wording that Christ returns he would be more comfortable with because number things the consultation consultation document is already a style to be printed so my question is why are we passing any resolutions they 're already printing it so perhaps I can respond to that so the wording around that that was agreed because consultation starts tomorrow we agreed to print the documents the main issue in terms of the auditor-general is that because they issue a new letter I can 't really call leader of approval opinion then the date had to change as well and so that 's what actually you 're confirming and approving as well I don 't think any of us were aware that Christchurch on Z&Z had felt that it probably didn 't reflect the opposition and I think the slight changes that they want to make what is concerning is that we we might be going out or something it probably isn 't reflecting the situation as quickly as what it could be but their notice they 're the same they 're detail is not like the detail isn 't the same sort of it is misleading how we the details on that can be in the background documents all of the consultation document is at quite a high level yeah it 's very high level sounds like slightly dubious process in that for number three though that if theory should pass today but they 're already being printed what does the oldest genome say about their so Jamie I can speak to that I am queried to richly with and I ask the question quite directly are you okay for us to start having the print button and their responses we sit around here and saying it 's totally correct there 's no one of those just means that we can 't do a mean for the Christ Church indeed well we haven 't gone into that level of detail on any other question either no to be fair and so I 've got questions from David Dion in the cars just wondering really with description if we go through and even in the background documents or whatever and make that clearer does that in any way potentially compromise their position with you or do we come up with a descriptor there are we and you will recall that earlier in the week as counselors you did actually sign off on the wording of this question for the option page sorry for the consultation okay do you ottoman little bit of clarity because I was under the impression that we weren 't going to go to print until we signed off today because that was what I thought was the last thing that was said at their meeting if it needed to come to council you will hold off on print until we signed this today but everything else could go online you know that was what I was strictly under the impression was going to happen and she gave us permission we needed to paper to today and the timing of the printing yeah but what I 'm saying is that my impression was that from from that last meeting I think it was Katie that might have said it was that if we needed to bring this paper to the council today because we needed to change something from the auditors or whatever there everything else can happen but the print would be delayed until we 'd made the decision you better be but you said everything else could go ahead like all the online stuff and all the other bits could still happen but it a day or two or three in which is why we ask the question is today the only change so maybe that I think that must be thick to us that was my understanding of what was you so in just a Christchurch in the information about them and the consultation document can be addressed and other ways because it sounds like the way it 's been described it 's not quite what they 're doing can that be addressed in other ways and are they comfortable with this um I don 't think so I think they 'd like a change I know they 'd like to changed right I have got Erin next thing Annie so just around that change because Christchurch in zeal is so new so fresh they need every thing lined up for them as best as possible and it 's like if you go to sell a property if you miss out a few good bits like it doesn 't leak and things like that you you might miss out on some sales so in this as a sales document how much would it what it 's probably one page you wouldn 't be redoing the entire document I would 've thought that would be about 4,000 but would we still have the booklets for tomorrow and then the booklets would be okay so that 's decisions really around 4,000 and timing 4,000 is the cost of that the time involved in that one and rego of the audit and liquor would be considerably higher I think of mr. memo I just what are the Crushers ended changes that they want so adding in the woods around not just if you take the questions is what do you think of the council providing additional funding to Christchurch in seed so that I can bid for major events on behalf of a city to support new events through sponsorship in to test the feasibility of new concepts within they 're willing to add an International Education Film Center conferences in the other words they 've been relates time right and so the reason that because it focuses on descending order 750k for major events seed fund 300,000 for major business event seed fund so if thousand in film office 150k costs one hundred and forty K International Education at 60 K so in the scheme of things it would be quite detail table and we haven 't done it for anything else so we haven 't addressed three hundred and sixty thousand of the 1.4 million so so if we don 't make the change for what Christ 's reasons that have asked for the outcome of that as they crush systems that are upset well I guess it 's about whether in fetch that residents have a good understanding of what it as we 're asking them about that 's probably the question so we can we can put some of the information in the background but the the risk is that what submitters say is this but hear anything it 's entirely major events and can I just ask in terms of the number of copies that we 're getting that we 've got printed so just having a wee sticker or something that went over it is that right is that something that was considered so if we just I 'm just people could get we could print out a copy for people that wanted hard copies of the new modified one and then we 've only got we could stick of the rest a sermon order to proofs and legal approves and what 's the delay with it and can I just come back to the point that this has been signed off by legal and our externally sorry signed off by all that external legal on that wording and based on the go-ahead from counselors earlier this week staff and good faith went ahead with that expecting that that would be the case I my viewers that you should adopt the consultation document as it is invariably through a consultation process there are matters that require clarification and this could be one of them we could look at amending the underlying information but I think the critical thing is to adopt it now from what I hear the event the matters other than major events as a small apartment the major events and I just think you should adopt it now and we if there are any clarifications required during are there any more questions the thread would do is might be a legal question to ask actually are we able if we just approve this and say look the documents that have been printed are printed but could we go through a process that all your online stuff because what I get and all the processes I do but I do accept around the day changes and that we did have a briefing and good faith except the only thing I think the issue that we find with counselors is that we 've had new information has come to us within that time frame which would be absolutely fine if they hadn 't been informal assurance that everything would be good however I think them all of the story is joint okay because like I said in the last debate the unexpected always arrived you know and it 's cropped up in this instance which is problematic but I think that we still need to find a solution is somehow you 've got essentially the International Education in the film office in Christchurch which are the two things that that probably need to be put in this one two options really one we can buy resolution error for that that goes in there but from everything that we 're hearing it 's just not realistic because it 's already being printed okay so it 's so failing that what we can do because we 're on the same page we all want the same thing but we also want don 't want to ask you try and pass resolutions that don 't mean anything or aren 't possible so the only option really is you we can put the preferred wording on the website so that can be done and essentially what a supplementary paper or an insert or something into into the CD the reason why I say that is that I would imagine well maybe I 'm the only one here but I 'd certainly wouldn 't think so that you 've got Christ really and that of Wutai I guess in good faith with us we want to give them all the tools possible and chance for success and I feel that it 's probably poor reasons pull the rug out from underneath them when and then go to print with something which they 're not completely comfortable with so that 's how I feel about other people don 't that 's fine but I would prefer given that we can 't change the consultation document to ever insert into inside the consultation document and update the website with the preferred wording is there any downside to that it was more information on it but you wouldn 't be able to change the question I just point out in the scheme of things we 've got that 1.7 billion of capital spend about 500 million of our peaks we 're talking about 60,000 extra for international education and a film office of 150 okay they 're not we haven 't consulted to that level of in degree on any other thing I mean I know it must be annoying that that the wording is not as you would want us but I don 't think it makes a huge amount of difference in terms of people 's a willingness to put extra money into things and see the consultation document they 're going to get the general impression of what we 're trying to do which is basically to to do major capital repairs when we 're four billion dollars down the hall so this is a very small issue in the scheme of things I would like to get the consultation document out there and get people 's input it won 't all be about but usually there 's a essentially a start up those so and we want to I think right from the out we did they see the within we did they see the wording that we 've gotten here so I think yesterday last night and this is raised with us about midday today well so what was the point of them saying that had already gone to print it 's a really good way for us to have a great relationship with them well okay I can 't answer that one so let 's just focus on what we 've got have we got any more questions in relation to this because it 's either get this out to day dollars we save and not having to alter their CD document could go to fletchling and we want it to be strong and we want it to grow and so I don 't know maybe think of it creatively about this I think we 're very happy to think creatively about Christchurch in seed but the consultation document process is not one that allows for creative thinking as we 've noticed with audit and legal advice so it 's either I mean you had briefing on this on Tuesday it 's either adopters now or do something different do I have anybody who 's willing to move the recommendation that 's in front of us we put a note that it 's amended on the website or something that we can be to reflect I think till Jesus Christ which is that you want to add additional information we can 't do the consultation document get that but I wonder if at the very least we could provide some supplementary original and there is a additional information on the website for Christchurch Cinzia to Peter talks about film office and don 't think this is though I sweated blood over there baby I don 't think you just stick it so are we okay with that additional note that additional will be added to the website is there any legal problem with their tour audit problem no I don 't have a problem we 're going to put some additional clarification on the website additional clarifying information or something related to funding Precision 's it 'd be available in practice I wonder if it 's worth just not necessary not limiting it to the website so obviously we can 't_''_6191.88 Amin to printed document but associated documents good okay recked you want with this okay um I 'm sorry I just want to seek in debt before we get into the bite you 're seconding okay Mike is there any debate is it Mike seconded Aaron yeah I I 'm not overly happy with this to be honest and just the way we 're going about it because we 've got a situation where we have a partner organization who were building a good relationship with we 've entrusted them obviously been shown the document in advance because they 're a partner they 're not happy in like Jamie race where I even show them we would have been better discard and ambush them but it 's a case of with I think we have an opportunity to put this right that would cost us a few thousand dollars and and we could put it right but it may seem that the count itself we all vote against it then would have to change it and put it right and then vote for it and that 's where I would sit so I would like your run to consider do we put this right today and yes it will delay a little bit and we might get a rap over the knuckles from in but that might be the last time that will happen to me while I 'm here and so yeah please consider that if you no one else is debating whether we can put it right and if we do spend that little bit of money because I don 't want them to be on a back think it 's a sensible way moving forward but I I just wanted to put out that I I think it 's a little bit disappointing it 's gone to print already because I was as I said before under the impression it wasn 't going to go to print if we had to make a boat today because what happened if we didn 't vocalist and con have gone blade the chicken before the egg was born or something like that because you know if we didn 't vote if we didn 't vote for this then the whole consultation document would have to be changed again anyway so I think it was a bit silly that we 've gone out and printed actually it was [Music] thank you no sewer I 'm just going to take full advantage since Becky held up the book clip and see there 's lots we could comment on to say I 'm community funding since we 're making alterations clearly can 't make it now after that you know community funding just want to say cycleways much that kind of thing and also asks about job what we can do about water popping class also asks about what people prefer and a few ticks so that they could have a list of rising rates given what they 're looking forward to and I think also just said stuff I know this has been an amazing labor it actually looks lovely a puff-puff from the content in the rates increase it 's a really lovely living vote and for Tim who wants us all to raise thousands at 80 percent of our time this feels like you 'd want to read it so thank you for all the hard work on it can I put the recommendation okay those in favor say aye those opposed you want it recorded out yep parent Mindy damn okay Jeremy down the post at 114 okay okay take Harry [Laughter] okay so I 'm going to move that we go into px and ask that Darren burden remain and then Joe tells us that she 's got a cup of tea really outside at 00 so are you okay keep going three it 's not that long 30 for a race relations day if we 're not finished it 's Jimmy 's idea yep three through the camera man 's here so okay so you have a chance to go and put your makeup on Aaron right so winner and pee miscarriage whoo chica peeps No you _"

are they comfortable with this um I don 't think so I think they 'd like a change I know they 'd like to changed right I have got Aaron X the nanny so just around that change because crush it genes

the bird misses that film and international education which is 60 grand in terms of it relates to descending order a 750 K for major events seed fund three hundred thousand for major business event seed fund so if you put those two together it 's 1 million and fifty thousand in film office 150 K costs one hundred forty k International Education at 60 K so in the scheme of things it would be

before we get into the bite you Mike second in Aaron yeah I I 'm not overly happy with this to be honest and just the way we 're going about it because we 've got a situation where we have a partner organization who were building a good relationship with we 've entrusted them to do some really special stuff for the city and obviously been shown the document in advance because they 're our partner they 're not happy in like Jamie race where I even show them we would have embedded as guard and ambush them but it 's a case of with I think we have an opportunity to put this right that would cost us a few thousand dollars and and we could put it right but it may seem that the count itself we all vote against it then would have to change it and put it right and then vote for it and that 's where I would sit so I would like you 're under consider do we put this right today and yes it will delay a little bit and we might get a rap over the knuckles that will happen to me while I 'm here and so yeah please consider that if you no one else is debating whether we can put it right and if we do spend that little bit of money because I don 't want them to be on a back foot so early on in their in their life I think it 's a sensible way moving forward but I hey I just wanted to put out that I I think it 's a little bit disappointed in it 's gone to print already because I was as I said before under the impression it wasn 't going to go to print if we had to make a boat today because what happened if we didn 't vote for us and we 've kind of gone laid the chicken before the egg was born or something like that because you know if we did inviting if we didn 't vote for this then the whole consultation document would have to be changed again anyway so I think it was a bit silly that we 've gone out and printed it before 'm just going to take full advantage since like he held up the book clip and see there 's lots we could comment on to say I 'm community funding since we 're making alterations clearly can 't make it now after that you know community funding just want to say cycleways a bit kind of thing and not leave it at that okay it 's a it also asks about job what we can do about water popping class also asks about what people prefer and a few ticks so that they could have a list of rising rates given what they 're looking forward to and I think also just said stuff I know this has been an amazing labor it actually looks lovely apart from the content in the rates increase it 's a really lovely living vote and for Tim who wants us all to read thousands eighty percent of our time this feels like you 'd want to read it so thank you for all the hard work on it can I put the recommendation okay those in favor say aye those opposed do want down the post 114 okay okay take Harry _"

    "text": "discretionary response found at page 81 I 'm happy to move them though recommendations yeah seems it Aaron yeah you can ask a question of someone right hi guys the grant would Kingdom and I think I can 't_''_42.16 I saw a memo about comparing it to budget services and whether this should really be a central government funded service around people 's specific budgets or is this something that council always does fund and this is a a NEMA stay funded service in the bulk of the income does come from in this day he 's been funded by counsel over time has commonly been 40,000 a year the last grant that we to this organization we need to debate or he 's in questions later nominal world so you can debate it later but just questions this moment other any other questions Jame Oliviana bacteria distinguish between our t1 and priority to a central regardless of when the funding because I reveal the word a Tai Chi looks like they participate for 18,000 people who a good image it Tula Tula CT they 'd apply for 25,000 per perturbation a week another full fully amount when the funding I don 't know I 'm sorry we cannot sit at the moment Menem under 25 forum amount yes 18,000 people come to kaijus yes I 'm in the war 25 following on from what Jimmy see bad I am interested in why am the reduction and the money given to Kingdom it seems to to provide an amazing service it doesn 't just support people in deep but it also trains people so it 's not just and I know that they 've very well established and I 'm just wondering what the you know general rationale was and reducing it funding to Kingdom today didn 't actually do this he spent the person 's leave and did his leave from what I understood when he did the assessment he wanted to reap the funding towards the wages for the organization rather than the rent so that was why he made the 20,000 recommendation yeah I was just um you 've thank you for getting the answers of the question about the service that was being reduced or team question that ref raised but thing a central government has actually made funding provision for budget advice services so I 'm just sort of still trying to understand why we would be funding this given that it 's a central government the thing that 's called funded funding so this is an additional the extra people that have come into the service over this time not just for budget advice but around mental health issues and things like that which they are trying to get into other services but some of this work they still have to manage themselves do we have like a map of like where budget advisory services are in Christchurch and in which communities they 're working with I just wonder whether there 's a bigger strategic question about budgeting advice and who 's delivering it and how we wither if we 're going to fund it like on what grounds we would fund it rather than our central government it 's came up at the maysville fee fund yesterday didn 't that mean and that all of the agencies were reporting a hugely busy January a huge amount of money and is having to cut back there are Kingdom resources trusts Salvation Army Methodist budget advice and there was one other the city mission your all will offer budgetary services some of the part-time some of them are occasional basis but all of them getting huge demand and quite open when there were food there there are some there are a lot of issues so what they were also finding is a lot of people not on benefits coming through just I think one of the issues that we find with the mayor 's wealthy funders that by the time people get to us they 've got two and a half thousand three thousand dollars worth of debt and a usual donation or payment of not donation about payment of some bail it 's around three to five hundred so there 's still issues I don 't think Christchurch is dealing with a whole pile of the issues in fact what we 've asked is that with us Paul dowsley ought to come and talk to us about the whole economic shift that 's happening so far fewer people now own their own house so the volatility of renting and the lack of equity and any sort of secured boat makes huge issues for all sorts of families not just the families that you may think that you would get and so I don 't think there is a surplus of budgeted bus service and the city at the moment of that we know there 's not yep so so I 'm happy to speak to support this strongly clearly you know the whole purpose of King business before you do well I was here okay I 'll put them separately then so we can have Jimmy 's amendment sorry for entrance okay happy did you do my since I moved and happy to agree with Jimmy 's I mean yep yeah and what we might also do is invite you to invite all counselors to their position that we were looking at on the sort of structural changes that that might be useful from these guys to start with and then we 'll get you some information apologies Phil so you 're happy to indicated I I strongly support both of these applications and the amendment that Jimmy has asked for just an especially in relation to Kingdom resources just want to say that a budget advice it 's more than a budget advisory service per se and that 's clear actually and they and the metrics here they liate them they partner very strongly with other support services and it 's it 's clear that the people now who are going for budget advice people who 've never been in this position before and are in some serious financial difficulties and the whole purpose of the budget advice is to stop these people falling into poverty it 's very easy to say that central government should pay for all of it but I think we as a city have in a tradition of actually supporting budget advice and other other social agencies like this and we at a time like this we need to continue that there 's there 's a lot of streets with us particularly for people who it 's quite clear in the report also are coping with mental health this agency is playing a key part in this whole area particularly as indicated by training others and by partnering strongly with that with other agencies so that the Kingdom resources a little as a long tradition of providing of providing the service in and yes they of course they get some mes D funding but this is an outreach which actually covers the whole city it 's much wider than Eddington which is their base and they do need new present premises they need to be able to afford increasing rents and I 'm struck I 'm strongly this application and also the application for word thank you of these today and I 'd like to point out to counselors that once this is done we 're going to have only 21,000 left in our metropolitan distribution refund with still months to go and to remind everyone that we had a unanimous decision around the table last year to put extra grant funding in our draft annual plan and then at the last minute we decided not to that would have given us an extra seven hundred and fifty other things that were giving private grants for for private individuals and developers every time we get these applications we recognize how how many organizations in our city do amazing work with our communities and have valuable letters and how many volunteer hours that that 's extra is able to be got from that funding the fact that we have decided as a council not to do that after a full unanimous decision is incredibly disappointing and I really hope that our communities are able to submit the long-term plan and say actually that 's not good enough and that we need to be able to support our communities better I guess my plea would be its assist our communities by funding what is hugely proactive so if we look at the top five issues for those coming to me as welfare electricity rent arrears bond rates and medicals so these are the fundamentals and people are being served are being put in situations where they have to choose what is it going to be this week you know food power whatever these are the things that we you and worry about I suspect so we can have a debate all day over whose responsibility it is we could argue technically actually it is the government 's but in the meantime some people still need the skills and a bit of guidance over decision making and I think this is actually a good investment please Lee it 's not a tuna again into a custody battle between as a central or local government is just get on to it and it 's just people in the meantime event because you can see we review their numbers you know paid to four years four years ago 2014 they 're only a thousand people but two years ago the increased 12,000 people and this year there were another 18,000 people that 's amazing we always emphasize this city nor city of opportunity we welcome the people to come to our city you know their idea their contribution it 's good opportunity for us to create a good kind of good image up the profile of cultures so I don 't think so you know to increase 5,000 is a lot and also huge benefit to the city so that 's why amendment is what thank you Jimmy can I put them motor I 'd like to increase the amount that time we give to Kingdom back to 2004 in moving the amendment I would I would accept say increase of five any cuz I 'm feel like I 'm being bullied by Phil it 's gonna punch me if I say no I did want to say something future because I actually think that this is more than just giving a hand out to people this is actually training them and giving them skills and I think that we want that to happen so that people can be empowered not to fall into the tricks that we 've been talking about so I think they offer a hugely important thing to our community and yeah I think we should give them as much as we can I think um yeah I 'm not comfortable with raising the funding towards the scope we 've got other budget advice services in the city that we 've heard are struggling who possibly could use our or 25,000 then what are we going to do so you know I think it would be really important to just get an understanding of the services that currently exist how they 're being funded and what their needs are and I was happy to accept reluctantly a one-off grant for the melt that was suggested but I 'm certainly not in favor of increasing it there were so many groups that do work in our community supporting people in need that we were ejected through our strengthening communities fund because we said that they were they were getting funding from central government and now today we 're turning around and making decision for just one of those groups without any understanding of what those other ones may be and that makes me very uncomfortable well so I don 't want to criticize the work that this group do but there 's a lot of good work that happens in our city with people who need help and support and I just think you know having a bit more of a strategic think around how we do that before increasing we 've just heard that one of the groups that was closing down is no longer closing down so actually this groups demands should be reducing not increasing so I don 't know why we would increase the funding based on this from the staff recommendation I think we also just need to be mindful that and again that 's not a criticism of the group but there 's a lot of religious budgetary advice service services to inner city but there 's I think only one that does it that 's not non-religious so you know I think we do need to think about about that and end our policies so we 're going to buy so you know I think we just did to be but we need to make sure strategically that we 're reaching the people that need the help and that for some people they may not choose to go to a religious provider so you know it 's just for me we need to get their strategic piece of work done and I won 't support an increase okay is there any more debate 're aware has put these two I 'll put them separately so people can vote separately if the grant of 25,000 to kingdom resources is lost I 'll put it back at twenty okay just so you know what you 're voting on yeah yes a full shadow twenty and so that there so that we don 't run the risk of losing it all together because they desperately need it yeah garage make a brief point of reply please because there 's no there might be other people who want to speak so it would be closing their baby today and so I 've got Dion Jamie and Tim I 'm actually just handed another quick look through the through the staff reports and they 're actually pretty good [Laughter] I 'm more comfortable staying with the two recommendations from the staff the 20,000 we do here but quite a few more months to go so that 's where I 'm signaling and I just want to say that I do know that I have heard of the kingdom resources limited stuff and this is not anything to do Deon was genuine j-jimmy was that no just Jamie so it 's a confusing response fund amendments all out soundless and I 'll keep it really brief I 'm gonna be voting it 's both amendments not because I don 't disagree with the sentiment I do I think they do great work but the one thing I 've learned on my time and Council is that the unexpected will occur you don 't know what you don 't know and the other thing that I know is that our staff do a really good job of getting to understand these organizations we all mean very you know have best intentions around this table but we don 't get up close and personal at a grassroots level with these organizations like the staff do I think there needs to be an element of trust and governance and I think they play you know a very difficult game trying to allocate the far the finite resources that we have to some very good organizations so it 's it 's an art not a science and I think we need to back also based with the Fed we 've got a number of months coming up we 're the unexpected will almost certainly arise I 'm gonna stay with the staff recommendation on this okay now I 'm only good that you speak once in know I 'm gonna need anybody speak once Tim thank you there 's a connection between these two are really an article recently of some of the most successful people the world and these active people said one thing that sets him apart made them successful was reading reading reading what they all do is about 80% of the day they read whether it 's in the chosen field of expertise some of them felt that too relevant what they read they just read so I do think that there was a connection between these two and I was okay Thank You Erin have you spoken [Music] it just felt like your hair did sorry Erin go through sorry our question so I listening to the debate I 'm no longer happier to be the Sikandar happy to be the Signet now that it 's changed because 'd prefer the original staff recommendation I generally always trust the staff and these reports they work closely with these groups and they give us a figure for a reason because they 've done a whole lot of research on how much money they don 't have to spend and also how well they know the organizations and we there are the fundings coming from so I 've never had much force to ever doubt the recommendations and on this case I 'll go back to the original salt remove my name from being a signal because it 's change thanks Erin so have we got a seconder for 225 to both Glen okay so can we put the amendments this and then we 'll come to the original ones okay by way of foreshadowed further amendments okay so the first one and so it 's now yeah can 't_''_1378.38 so clearwater council livingston and so we 'll put them both together any problem with it 25 for both of them are you happy that they both go to give put them separate okay put them separate okay that okay in favor please say aye those opposed we just did a show of hands guys and if you 're a favor put your hand up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and is that what 's it going to be I depend I know there 's a couple of way and so if you 're opposed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 well okay carried by 8 to 7 is that where you got Joe right okay and the second one 25 to kingdom resources trust can we put the 25k first those in favor please say aye those opposed I think it 's lost but can we have a show of hands those in favor please put up your hand what you get is it seven those opposed to right that one 's lost can I put now the 20k which is moved by Sarah and seconded by Erin to kingdom resources can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried right okay thank you I think we 've dealt with it please _"

    "text": "want questions questions having any questions of davidann Yanni well thank you and thank you for the additional memo I just know that you 've got the center parade not blacked out but then the other ones are blacked out and I just can just help me understand why or what the process is around a decision on that building I think in the memory you referenced waiting for the master plan to be can play yeah if some of us were keen to look at a funding reduction to the Center for a because we 're funding them for rent at the moment as a result of this deal that frees up that space what 's the best way to get that today so from from a process point of view it 's the the leaseholder of CSG crisis school of gymnastics responsibility to explore whether they 're able to sell that building to another user and then they would come back to council by the community board to sue say council happy for this building to be part of this new tenant at the moment we need to asked them about the sense of raid being pertinent so we haven 't believed lift CSG alone in the situation as we wouldn 't do in any situation that whole public council aims and we 've been working actively with him about prospective tenants as some of the counselors have been involved in discussions as well as prospective tenants that could potentially be interested and taken on that building recognizing what it would be or there 's a list of four or five that had been investigated who were actively in discussions now so if CSG continuing the momentum they 're going to move on to a new site and building a new site they won 't be lifting the level of energy and support to help them find someone that may be eligible to go through their decision-making process I was sorry I 'm probably not being very clear um it 's a lot of money that we 're being asked to put into the project and I 'm trying to look at a way in which we can reduce so we 're currently paying a grant of XML me if we agree to put extra money into the school of gymnastics we actually get an asset that we could offset some costs that we have which would make the transaction over the ten years pretty much cost neutral and I was just trying to see how we actually get that decided today as part of this deal rather than leave it for a later process which would as it seems in the memo we 're exploring other other uses that probably wouldn 't save us much money and we end up having an additional cost that some going as well happy that they would take on so they 'll be provided with information from CSG so they can do their due diligence about whether they have take building on and iron it and maintain it and be be responsible for the light one and so we aren 't in a position you they need to make the decision themselves before that Council in position to make the decision on the lease so I haven 't been in contact with them recently so it 's an amount that it hear that the community boards are supportive which is great and the other ones who know their community beast about expectations around the master plan and funding but it 's also clear here that they 'd quite keen to recoup any money and to get their back again should there be a disposal of the building but I 'm quite keen for us to be able to have that offset other costs like yes the interpreting things so how are we able to incorporate that into what we 're doing today so today what was discussed with the community board on Friday was obviously with the aspirations of get up and maintaining as much as possible for the master plan approach yes and we them with Lynn and David support to say well that would be something that would come through the lease process in the future okay yeah could I just add probably in response to your question Sara and jaws eonni that the Christchurch school of gymnastics hold a ground lease from the council on that portion of QE should the council wish to propose any changes to that we have to go through that adds complexity and sort of justifies our answer to you that we 're not able to preempt or or include these arrangements at this point in time it 's just checking that the community board haven 't_''_347.58 been given any expectations that money from the disposal or otherwise or leasing would come back to them rather than offsetting costs no totally another question based on John 's aren 't so can I just get clarified the school of gymnastics will stall so we 've done a new lease with the new site and we 'll give them the funding as part of that there 's no relinquishing the lease that they 've currently got on their existing building so effectively they can choose to do what they want with that existing building as long as they get approval through us so the new within I think the six months or 18 months of moving into the new building all going well that they need to demolish that building or have council approval to lease it to a new sell it to a new second Inc okay need abate zerah just quickly um I mean the crisis school of gymnastics do an amazing amount of really good work and provide a fantastic space for a huge range of different community groups throughout the city and I really want to see that continue so I 'm really happy that we 're able to be able to do this today I 'm a little bit concerned about the timing and that the community haven 't had a chance to say on the aspirations the master plan for qe2 prior to us making a decision on some of the funding being used but the community border in favor of this and the other ones know the community beast and so completely willing to take the community boards steer on this and the local councilors and it will be up to them to manage the expectations of the community through that master planning process it 's already happy to do this great thanks mover and seconder and Glen you think you I think when you look at this facility it 's good for both the east and the out of the many people that have come out and done well Courtney McGregor went to the Olympics and if you look at the environment in which she and others have had to Train it 's not flesh so I think if we can do this it 'll be good for not only the East but for the city we 've heard already today too that there 's a wider community and city good in you know it can assist people of all ages and abilities there if this would be in keeping with what the sea is G intends to do and the aspirations of the board probably not ideal to do it this way but then if we don 't do it like this we 've got to look elsewhere in the LTP and you know as well as I do how tight things are so there 's a sense in which it 's an internal an actual SWAT if you like within that fund so it would be good if you can support it proposal to relocate the school of gymnastics has been going on there for location the final location that the school of gymnastics has landed upon as a consequence of some of their around how things ended up on qe2 and that final location has actually ended up probably costing them a considerable amount more and the ground remediation initially we the new recreation facility which would have may have offered some economies of scale in terms of ground remediation we 've heard today the wide and very community of course to the eastern suburbs into the city as a whole and I think the presentation we heard earlier really does reinforce the the wide range of activities that this group does offer our community the Crusaders and giving the litter of support probably didn 't actually say that at one stage they went there and had a bit of a pre-season training session themselves so it is wide and varied and I would ask my fellow councillors that they support this remit and as Glen has said it isn 't the most ideal way that we would have liked to have funded this application but the reality is that was going to be your consideration okay I 'll put it those in favor please down those opposed carried thank you very much indeed _"

counted unless you let them stop you you can be strong unless you as you wish so long as your voice can carry and teach you can have a say in your world so long as you prepare to overcome silence you can be who you wish to be so long as you ignore those who would take back your freedom you can be free and you don 't expect it to be handed to you you can be independent if you don 't hold on to the expectations of the past you can be a new woman if you vote you can wait that change what became of it what a difference would have strength the battle did not even that nearly began with that paper I thought in you I thought you knew bodies piled high degrade and disrespected on the grounds of biology look she had children soon how can she be right over way he is right he lacks the limitations he lacks the ruse she is a risk rise should you shout can you fight will you a pretty face does not dismiss a quick wit a sly grin a love of life and knowledge of purpose feminine 's from here to the red-hot end you can thank you so much and you 'll hear more from the cat thank you all very much indeed that was just lovely way to start the meeting today thank you welcome welcome home were aware that Jim Mystics isn 't just about people that what we 're asking for at CSG is support for rebuilders facility that helps far more than just the people who are going to go on to become computer journalists so speaking for my son 's point of view and speaking as a parent my son has sensory processing disorder which means that he has way more connections sensory system what is normal which means that walking through life on a day-to-day basis is painful activity for her and a Scott Brown scooter if you come to class he 's trying to get through the cloakroom these are the sort of children who lash out because they feel as if stuffing wet or punched by somebody but in effect I 've just had a light touch so getting through schooling is a difficult situation as well as people in our population and for those that don 't know that 's a neurological thing where the connection in the brain between what your thought and then your physical action is a delay so I 'm giving a speech stuff up you 've got a movement stutter so to these children and primary school when they try to do PE and so much of the PE is now tag games or playing candles or any of those type of things it 's the absolute torture for these kids because they have to try to adjust to another person 's movement and it 's hard enough for the image actually give their own movement out without adjusting to what somebody else is doing so sports that the council quite rightly support like soccer rugby meet or one of the mainstream sports that people wouldn 't question that is ratepayers Wiest those facilities those supports those sports are just not sports that aspects that can play the distracts that would even have trouble trying to manage a bike so it affects their self-esteem that you know used to be called the to us that he go into gymnastics as part of an intensive occupational therapy program that he had been on since he had been a baby he was under the difficult Finas plan over to Christchurch Hospital from but the child he was sexy still couldn 't each side food because the sensory processing the dyspraxia affected him to that extent this is a boy who 's gone on to through gymnastics and through the repetitive nature of the of the training has strengthened up his sequence and part of his brain so that rather being the total disorganized child that 's always getting into trouble which happens to so many of these cuts he has been hit boy it brings intermediate he 's been prefect defense at high school two years and near 12 year 13 and he 's narrow University you don 't finance finance degree all of this because he has six days a week trained in gymnastics such as enabled home to calm his brain and conscious body and be able to live a full life as other people do so my plea to you when 't play normal sport but that gymnastics actually a way for them to be able to hear the phone and develop themselves to their full potential so the new building it says she says she already provides school training programs the PE program for 64 schools and in 2016 that was nearly 5,000 children so with what we call the disses dyslexia dyspraxia dyscalculia dysgraphia that 's really important for early intervention so at the moment the energy of parents like myself who who volunteer our time has just completely set up with trying to get through this process of funding and pushing you know for the rebuild of builder but if we have that building then we have the space we haven 't got the constant reminders and earthquakes vm about the cracked walls that the kids are not in yet we haven 't got the function room which you see through the windows of the following roofs and the remnants of the earthquake we take those anxieties where from the cuts we get that facility where we can now start getting our energies back to working with we for seven years to start working where we can run programs with schools specifically or pets worse purchases and and use the skills and qualifications of Lexi 's to professional coaches to amenities ot programs which are just way too expensive for parents to do it individually we can 't afford to pay a hundred and twenty hours 120 dollars an hour for just one but if we get smart and say to a school because kids can come by taxi to the school and the OT has a specialized program and the German can implement it these are real advantages that can go out to a wider community and people like my son I know that you don 't go out much because he had an injury last year and he couldn 't train in the gym he immediately reverted back to being anxious uptight the explosiveness of the team players here he has been a a plus grades his studio and second half years slipped to secret because he couldn 't cope with being around that noise and the smells and people eating all those things now he his results at university first two critiques no issues with work that has to change he 's happy so I would just employ you to think outside of just how many people do the sport but think in terms of those lives that can be changed because they can participate in the sport so on top of people like Daniel we 've got adults who come from casual places we 've got teams we 've got dance about parkour what cheerleading CrossFit the facilities when you consider whether you would grant this funding it 's not just the gymnastics club we share these facilities we allow them to be used by other groups so groups currently who 've used it have been appreciators and I 've put on a little support from the Crusaders that what I 'm saying about the development we 've had Paul daughter 's training because using the fighting pits reduces injuries snowboarders are saying we 've hit crepitus the big fun special needs group cats fear strongly Children 's Home Cancer Society Autistic Society CSG facility is not just for a club of just german to come to me to do states of training introduce those expertise i 've been involved in doing the Lottery 's grant application so far we 've got letters of support from the Crusaders surely boys hi know the Montessori Mount Pleasant Queen 's Park and such girls really and we 've Stuber other letters that are coming in so the country to wash you know you might see on social media that only being about you know something it isn 't it that reaches out and that the benefits of developing motor coordination ability there 's just nothing generations thank you thank you very much indeed Burke and you 've got time for one question Erin yeah thank you for your presentation because it certainly educated me on a huge part of what the CSG do that I didn 't know about and didn 't understand my question is more around the Crusaders leader grateful right great leader here there and though supporting and you really had a whole lot of others that are supporting your funding applications with just endorsements obviously have you received one from the council very good presentation and what we 'll do Barbara is actually go on to that item so you don 't have to sit and wait through all of the audit stuff yeah so all of you have got a memo that came to you on the hub and 7th of March David John do you want to say anything else _"

    "text": "it and now we move on to the last remaining item on this agenda this part of the agenda and that 's the heath cup River dredging Stage one report and can I hand over to you Pauline as the chair of muddy nation to approve stage one of the preaching there 's three stages the first stage one to be first commit to begin and financially 2018 and funding source as West our reprioritizing produce an existing budgets hence though as we know that reaching program was actually designed to deliver the food risk reduction to participate in nationally the committee as they start to go and have a look at moving there today to run forward and also looking at the possibility of moving stage two and three forward and this is partly in response to a petition that we received at the end of November from people from the community and Heathkit and we ought to think that we respond to people when we are very aware of the material situation that people are under me so apart from reducing and the flood defeats down there the of the new storage ponds and the upper Heathkit and there 's a lot of money being spent up there so it seems just a logical to actually do both projects more in alignment affordability that takes so that we get the maximum benefit for the people so that 's why we wanted to look at accelerating it there 's not only reduces of flood risk but also improves the landscape of the river corridor will enhance the in under spawning sites and bring a pro three in the program there 's some bit of time for the white bird season as well and don 't only report that we 've been very careful to manage the environmental impacts and start working very closely with specialist aquatic ecologists intimately mitigating the adverse effects so if running stage two and three forward as well the staff have looked at this and found that they can we can mean this to be done but funds with him to be filmed and through substitutions from the LTP and I guess the information will come forth so the committee sorry you 're having to see conductor I 'm sorry so it 's ticking it by so okay right I 'm sorry Dave Peter stone a little bit of work and he 's got a little presentation here if you 'd like to see it around the dredging it just will remind you of all the aspects of it which we 'll go through quickly we are wondering or we are recommending if you approve number three they approve the acceleration of the dredging stages two and three we are wondering whether then we can approve the delegation to let stage two as well because if you do bring it forward we will be trying to get that possibly into the market and let by July and so that would be an acceleration depending on the substitution and it would just mean that we wouldn 't have to then write another series of reports bring it up through it again through Council if that was approved by council here today previous got some proposed wording some stones but again we 'll just put that up there is it coming up there now only stage one eight or nine months away so we 've got letting the time do the reports for that but it was only stage one and two so I 'll just leave that for you to think about and maybe we 've just we go through go through yes please okay look it 's just very quickly I know we 've been through this a number of times just reminding gain of the earthquake fix increasing vulnerability and frequency and we 've seen that again recently so the dredging is part of the whole package of works and we have never been talking about them in isolation so currently reaching thanks stabilization which is currently in construction and the low stop things which will be and consulted on later this year and the approach was to break down into manageable chunks and storage is certainly a key component and all of these are needed to really and just a reminder on the benefits and there was a with the storage alone we dropped that significantly but it 's really with all of those other things such as reaching the flood intervention policy dredging the rest other benefits as well nibbles i reduced underfloor flooding and it reduces the impact of sea level rise over time to approximately quarter of a meter of sea level rise which might be in the order of 30 to 40 years I 'll bet so just on the proposed reduced agents had seen a spring but it 's clear so first pages from Wolf 's been cut to read these three so the dredging Wilson cut is a separate project part of the whole whole package but that is underway currently so we 're looking to begin stage one as soon as possible followed or possibly slightly concurrently with stage two from ready Street so let 's stretch through Clarendon Richardson terraces they 're in the third stage and we 're looking at is from a power Road up to Kingston Park and possibly a little bit further there 's approximately 20,000 cubic meters of material to be removed on each stage so overall about sixty thousand cubic meters and very good thank you alright are there any questions Jonnie and then deal yeah thank you um and regards to stage two in the report there 's comment of talking with MKT and with tonight to a Harriet to a hit right ovary so just they obviously seem to be quite concerned and I know that the first section doesn 't have as much cultural impact as the stage 2 so how are you gonna work that through if we agree to the extended delegation yeah so we 've had those existing especially once we 've got a better idea of sort of accept hiring and staging of that the things we 've got those more details this agent will there be required as part of the consenting process no and we 're actually using existing consents I think that 's the concern that they 're priced as it 's no it just great consent it 's a it 's a global consent um just a second question I had was um it came up this morning but it just wondered and it maybe we can 't get an answer today but is there a hit cut catchment stormwater plan that 's been developed because I guess work and from the all the work that 's gonna happen in this rubber corridor how are we ensuring that we 're improving and dealing with the stormwater issues at the same time yeah so they can 't get storm water management planners development that 's mainly dealing with so this is more I guess dealing with all the stuff that heads come into the river so certainly there 's a lot of work being done to improve judges and I can point to things such as the basins there 's a number of very large projects going on where and to treat a large proportion of their catchment in the areas the retrofit on the in the mid lower reaches will take time but there 's certainly a lot of funding in the LTP okay and stuff final question I had was um the petition also made reference to the maintenance and I know it 's been gone this year that I 'm sure you 're aware of that a number of residents have raised concerns around the way in which the current system is working just can you plan to fix the valves that seem to be allowing watered coming up and also the stone baskets and there 's also a new project go through my understanding them on the maintenance program to beat ceiling I think we sent out an email just prior to the last of him we didn 't think that we would actually have it 's more complicated than what they thought so we wouldn 't have got it done for this last event that was a week ago but it certainly on this you Joe and they have got a work plan to to address it okay Dion my question was around the silt disposal have I got a memo saying that you guys were still looking at investigating some cheaper options about the silt disposal have you got anywhere with that so currently our budgets based on the either hearings tailored to wood friction to connect fairly just considered to be conservative we were we are looking at options for disposal sites and some of them around the existing the wastewater treatment ponds some areas which has become hammock II since the safe for recreational content so it could be used with you know obviously be kept and so on so it could be used in some of those areas that 's a preference because currently we 're still investigating the consent and if that money is or if those savings are actualized what would happen would go into a program or is it come back oh speaking to the program because this money is taken there we 're reprioritizing the land drainage program which is a one point two billion dollar program and so it would enable us the you know by doing this we are going to delay other projects and so will enable a few of those project or fewer of those projects to be delayed and what projects have been delayed we haven 't worked that out yet and so we 're looking at what will give us the best or the least negative benefits but we believe that this should be getting on top of the listing so all right so I 've got a mover and a seconder for the resolution so I 'll put that no it 's Kerry _"

    "text": "and thanks very much for your understanding about this morning thank you okay so I 'll move that the that we received the minutes from the strategic capability committee to have a seconder for that and report the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and _"

  {
    "text": "great so now let 's move to the reports from the three zone committees and again on very aware that people have been waiting for some time thank you very much indeed for your patience as soon as we 've got through these reports we will then break for lunch and we 'll come back at two o 'clock Sarah we did it yep we did it at 26 minutes past 00 obviously just slipped into the format of the meeting so seamlessly yeah okay I mean we wouldn 't normally plan to do that but it 's just a couple of items have taken longer than we expected this morning I 'm very aware that we 've got people who 've been waiting for some time so we have this is okay so what we 've got is item 17 page 167 the zone committee quarterly reports so who have we got here and how do you want to run this so you 're speaking Pamela 's Deputy Chair of the and Banks Peninsula zone committing yep great thank you yeah I mean I think the background to this and this provides you with you know 10 minutes essentially to highlight any things that you particularly want to bring to the attention of counselors and to leave time for questions if you wish that what the whoo what the work of the zone committees does across to the counselors we need to have opportunities where we can actually sit down and relate the things what is going on I feel as though that we need to be a bit more closer and talking to what 's going on I 'm a weird I 'm a community board member and a zone committee member and it has been very beneficial to be part of both of those so that there 's a good flow of information between both so if we we think about how banks financial order zone we also have got another catchment plan and we also have a catchment plan there with a huge amount of science behind it so the things that are brought up in our Beck spinach losses on reporter are this morning we 've already posted this morning with paruppu of which we sure that that works with us and focus of our banks financial community so committees that we do work with our communities the one that there that 's a bit more that it says it 's at least visible issue is currently interested talk of septic tanks and issues around septic tanks if we had good functioning septic tanks across the peninsula perhaps we might need two big sewage systems that we have we 're going to need to be working towards in some of the areas so it 's an area where I would where we would ask for some further work be done on and that we did have a question to the council around some proposed action big actions for banks financial or so that is previously table and it did come to that and now when we put our our weekends and city council submissions to the long term plan so I hope that 'll be picked up so I really haven 't got much more than that we 've got three new members to our zoning committee so we 're really just starting to get of the committee and we 're now moving on to the next phase of briefing them and getting into gear and prioritizing what we can do as you know from fuck-around PO little rubbers also going to catch the plan as well but we have huge amount of work to do with our communities and we need to find ways of where we 're working with the community where we can actually move across the a plan or model might be that doesn 't really pen or whatever it might be to make sure that that community feels comfortable and about changing their attitudes things and getting on with life so I won 't say any more than that Andrew it is very difficult to put everything into this very tight time slot and if you at all understand they don 't come to our zone meetings and catch up with us and what 's going on so we welcome any of you to come and join us in a zone meeting indeed Thank You Pam are there any questions for Pam on the Banks Peninsula zone committee report Dion you just I 'm just a weed it more about that is it like is does it need to be more monitoring of them or in can you celebrate on me well we we last year asked in the zone committee vos that we undertake the pilot program with the local community group to identify actual risks from it the existing systems to look like whether there are any impacts on the environment that are being caused on the environment to look at gauging in a research prophit project to identify the effects of on-site systems on the land and this I mean this has nationwide benefit so it 's just something that 's starting off with perhaps it may be that we need to look for partnership funding to look at this moving forward so I 've just sent it to a scientist a wastewater scientists that we 've got about just starting a process too we might get help it 's um it 's also find out how our local systems are working a lot of them well was responsible for the old septic tank Environment Canterbury is they 're all a lot of them are old systems so they won 't be consented systems they 've just been existing they 've been there for years and they just continue some of them are functioning and some of the mote we 're looking at an education project with local schools to get into back home to families start with the kids and the kids will take it home and then we 're looking for some information about what sort of systems are appropriate for being financially the City Council will be aware of systems thank you okay so let 's now move to oh and sorry something we need to work that through how we might improve that relationship I know the board with relationship with our boards but there is a lot of there 's a lot of sharing of information there 's a lot of things that City Council Environment can 't_''_425.1 be doing that we all I mean the last time we just discussed this the result was having the zone committees briefed the council but as Pamela 's pointed out you know a 10-minute yeah um so palling to you and do you want to and yeah I 'll make a note of it and we 'll just make sure that it gets on to what used a briefing that 's fine yep that 's it thank you Sarah it 's clear from a whole part of the really good work that 's gone on that there 's own committees and the immediate steps funding which enables a whole pile of really good work and extra on tier hours and those kind of things from over in a range of areas it 's really really useful but that you could do a whole pile more with more immediate steps funding yes yeah did the zone committee specifically submit to a can asking for more funding so that they can do more of that kind of work as part of a long-term plan we have we do also use the City Council biodiversity funding as that 's right so we do work I mean these are combined groups CCC anything so we do work very closely together yeah shear that funding and make it go a lot of funding in the scheme of the ATN council budgets if you like and I would it be useful if it 's something that we might be able to look at as part of our submission to you he 's made it steps funding my copperheads aid that came for counselors has signaled that they want to increase how much do four thousand to buy diversity and Thanks all right thank you so let 's sum thanks very much indeed for that update on the thank you now let 's move on so we 've got yes that was the entire year 's budget and it wasn 't partnership with the landowners across to the council in community groups British committee we 're just all so again like to support you with your decision not to cut really big vegetation but there are so many many benefits and as openly sees that the current methods being used can still be adapted so that it can at the same time metal that ecological would have been a bit nicer the committee has three new community members they Helen Haley pass this on so I said I would she 's requested she would like in a number of community groups around the city had been saying for a while they would like to have one person with an equation city council who could be a single point of contact staff member who might have an overview of all the potential and thane work on rivers of the city that Suzanne can keep in touch with us that they can she and community groups can to be knowing what possibilities are coming up and what opportunities might come up so that they can feed in some ideas at a stage before while it can still be taken into account that 's right I 'm just lastly and the zone committee members are joining the Christchurch City Council in over Nautica to network in Environment Canterbury to the stormwater superheroes on Sunday the squeaking at the Children 's Day which has a theme of hero so it was perfect for the zone community based on what our superheroes again and there will be a large stupid errant well a lot of storm few recently printed that a an update on yes certainly we can make sure that they 're passed around counselors we can just have our staff pass them around counselors there 's no problem thank you all right great thanks very much indeed for the update from Christchurch West Melton are there any questions on there Christchurch West Melton Zone committee report Yanni thank you appreciate all the work that you 're doing I just I just wonder we 've got you know the vision values and vision document for their power oh and the heathcote but I guess what I 'm still not saying is what 's being done to address the worst science is there a kind of action program that you have to address the sites that have really poor water quality and if so what does what is that yes as Kashmir and for example within heightens there are particular sites that have been being off the most risk to the health of this is currently the worst so how do we add like the Wolves to industrial state which has equal worse there 's nothing was going to overall index that we will give them that shows it 's the poorest possible maybe just to get some information back about so some of those things like it cuz there 's a lot of really good stuff in here but we don 't we don 't have a sort of as I 'm set we don 't have a hit get catchment plan at the moment it might be good if you guessed oh yeah if you 've got questions referring to that specific document it might be good for you to put those through you know in in the right level of detail to the resume committee facilitator and understand you know here 's the water you 're right I 'm Dion and then Pauline and then we 'll move on to sell my horror very quickly about the mowing and the river not blowing thing is one of the big benefits of the Yerba so why don 't we still have our white baiting in the rivers that may not be a question for the zone committee the zone committee wouldn 't police or is the dog isn 't wagging the tail some are free members and police looking all right final question from Pauline 's day very good um so I 'm just looking at point number three and talking about why she just groundwater system and one in the northwest around Belfast has showed nitrate contamination so yes so last week zone committee meeting the zone committee was briefed on the same science at the way my career his own committee was briefed a couple of weeks ago earlier all Christmas as well and what will be happening is the way Mercury 's own committee will be working closely with the Christchurch was mountain zone committee in terms of finding solutions through the one Malcolm Arizona companies process for coming up with addendum to the zone and permutation program it 's a regional plan sorry the one micro zone committee is taking it very seriously and they are they are welcoming the levels of nitrates very low volumes but bearing in mind that there 's a 30-year wave coming through it 's a huge concern and the other thing that the policy solutions providing they don 't have an economic impact alright great look thanks very much indeed for those comments Pauline we do need to move on cuz I 'm again very conscious of time let 's come to the so thanks very much indeed for the update from Christchurch which Melton for the answers to those questions now let 's move to I 'm selling like horror and some comments on your report if we can please so I mean one apology was here but unfortunately did have to go to an appointment he must appear as yeah and again we apologize for the length of time that kept you away so today can be very brief and the first iron and silver horror I guess alerts you to the relatively impromptu visit by the Minister for the environment you tuned it I understand I wasn 't there but he turned up in shorts and a cap and proceeded during the day to swimmin sailin river I just want to continue the conversation a little bit about immediate steps funding at the February meeting the zone committee allocated the meter they have now allocated all of the 100,000 for 2017-2018 one of those projects is to support the portal 's fire recovery however in seven war zone to protect up to X your wetland project and other Hoonah Road which is and who was all 13 revocation questions thank you any questions I 'll sell my hallways report I 've no idea I was not dear I and what I personally can talk to other people 's choices maybe that 's a question for the minister rather than zone come isn 't very good all right so we 've got thanks very much indeed program for that update as well and once again to all of you and apologies that we 've been running late this morning and thanks for your patience in in waiting to speak to us at this time so we 've got a resolution in front of us to receive the information in the zone committees reports which aren 't happy to move Sierra Templeton 's having a second so I just wanted clarity is there a hit get storm water catchment management plan being developed it on track because in 2016 it was announced it was being done but I can 't see anything that reference was that okay are you able to get something so we 'll need to take that offline and come back with an answer so the questions been captured and will come back to you with an answer and again that can be circulated among everybody it 'll be useful information for all of us to have all right so this has now been moved and seconded I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "item 13 the coastal Burt wood Community Board report to Council and Kent thank you for waiting apologies for having kept you waiting for some time okay so over to you to present the delegations with it you 've got 18 extras but only the first one as you can see was the development over a portion of the Brighton Beach for a period of 18 months for the Christchurch hot pools so that 's as you know part of the New Brighton for short development and ventilation so that 's really exciting to think that that 's been commencing this year the second thing we have staff to period safety review as you can see I 'll be there is the entrance to Thompson Park we 've asked for the safety review also to include assessing the need for security cameras lighting and a range for the neighborhood watch to include the park on the visiting schedules Thompson Park has been on our radar for a while now as a community board and we need to address the carpark the entrance and the street visibility and there was a this year a user of the park was assaulted and as it so happened at this particular community board meeting we were having an update from the police this was extremely handy because we were able to ask them about the approach to the situation so they were also in the favor of having visual access from the road as you drive past as well as the lights in the chemist and so a safety review on this part will be able to give us some direction the art central New Brighton school site the community board asked for a further extension until the next until the end of July sorry which it doesn 't reflect hang and hang on with that one so we asked for the 16th showing from the Ministry of Education to enable time for any community group John Pearson proposal to take management but all part of the central New Brighton school site such as the boys Stokes hall so thank you for supporting that extension and the Ministry has granted it and start working with the community we 've got freedom campus as you issue for all of us we have just asked the compliance staff to consider updating the monitoring along the foreshore the especially around Thompson Park in the coastal beach area we have really about 10 to 20 just in that very small stretch and we actually want to encourage these visitors however it does need to be appropriate years areas provided to accommodate them so something for all of us to be working on the next thing here you might remember in my last report I mentioned the coastal hazard workshop that we had last year the main questions that were asked were around the ability to build within the hazard zones however there were no resource consenting staff prisoners workshop so the updaters we now have two workshops planned in the next few weeks of the resource and consent staff so we 're very pleased about there just to mention the houghton in this significant council projects out for sure in South New Brighton regeneration so the how team are putting together a engagement plan for regenerated christchurch others and this be available by April so now we come curative recreational and Sports Center which has been exciting and this is going to be completed by Queen 's Birthday hopefully so the council staff and Apollo team have just pulled out all the stops they 're doing an amazing job we had a site visit and it was just looking absolutely amazing so this is a real city asset we also had the privilege of just hanging out with the guys that were doing a inside deals in boys high school build and this is also tracking very well significant community issues events and projects in that area so again the South Brighton issue each of you look at this picture you can just see the destruction of the environment which could have been avoided to refresh your memories this area and along a 300 meter strip was protected pre-earthquake by RINO mattresses which are those two sloping stone baskets some parts slumped down and earthquakes and live sections vulnerable to erosion which then has exposed these areas to flooding so consequently we have requested or we 're losing as a result we 're losing and the concede trees others behind there that are also looking very vulnerable so as a consequence the board has asked an urgent safety order on this tree in the devastation of this area and the vulnerable state that is and cannot wait for a long-term regeneration strategy plan we would like these earthquake appears to be effects now the good news is we 've had a bit of progress we are we are having

so it 's been a fantastic thing the only downside to the yes and I did notice that actually yeah that 's great now I noticed Mary made a note of that as well so I don 't know what does anything can be done about it but yeah that was one thing that I spotted all right so we 've got the motion to receive the community board report Dave happy to move Glen have it second all those in favor against as carried Kim thank you very much indeed for a really thorough presentation on what 's happening in the east of the city that 's great thank you _"

    "text": "a lead thank you can I just dump highlight a couple of things from my report so last week was an incredibly busy week which you know we had a state of emergency and the preparation for the extra people cycling dita then on that Wednesday you approve the draft long term plan to go up the consultation as mirrors didn 't and I agree with that this is a particularly difficult long-term plan balancing rates increases which is quite recovering regeneration business as usual and the aspirations of our community and there will be really difficult decisions to make that you know as we go into their consultation period and here are the things that people need to balance against those things in intercourse we have the theory 22nd anniversary as well and so I 'd like to thank both staff and elected members for all their support and actually getting those things true last week the other thing I 'd like to highlight to you is the work around my council this is really a very large transformation business transformation and cultural change project and the organization enabled interactions with our community and our inability to use technology to improve it so what that starts with it it 's from the first of February a new cache disc that allows cache receipting at service centers so it 's much more streamlined and digital will also use it for the long term plan submissions and making it quicker and easier to process submissions in for people to engage with us about some of the significant work that will happen be and will be around the 200,000 service requests that we get each year and looking to modernize and digitalized those standardize their processes and be able to close the loop with our citizens and then also to throw things around you know requests were really buns graffiti property management transport parks the whole range of there and move to online self-service in payments as well later in the year so it 's a big piece of work but will actually improve the ability for our residents to actually interact with the council great thank you very much indeed Carlene for the report and also for your comments on it on her report so poorly Dionne fell when it says only needs to there is no need to maintain residuals and then the second question is that it 's been unclear therefore of all Wells at a pump station can be signed off is secured by an expert and well heat security assessments and our agreed to be secured by the Assessor there may be no need to install a team through chlorination equipment on those pump stations so does that read that as each pump station is signed off that pump station no needs no longer needs chlorine in it so I 'll start with that first so that 's correct it 's about the security of the bore heads and we had conversations across a number of bore head so and it 's a network of those and some areas of course the networks are connected in which case it will be many more boy he 'd have to be secured and approved so there 's a chance there depending on how they 're repaired and made secure that you we have to progressively reduce the amount of mean that from other networks there may be a combination there in terms of the first one I 'll give you my lay standing of the issue so because we 're not treating a transgression or an infection of our water our water is still good in our reticulation system is fine we 're treating at the point where there 's potential contamination and so it 's a preventative treatment as opposed to treating a contamination that 's actually there and so what that means as I understand it is that it 's a lower risk and lower level that needs to be managed rather than through the whole reticulation system at that point maybe just at the beginning it 's an issue for people so when you say residual this when when a lot of chlorines put in and it stays at a certain level within the system because it 's treating rather than just as we 're trying to prevent any contamination thank you dear I just wanted to get a clarity on the building consenting and resource consenting do you have any idea in the building consent projections our projections I think from memory there 's a 17% decrease from what was budgeted if it 's an unseen team but in the building consenting doesn 't actually say all right if I don 't have that off the top of my head sorry about that I can get that you that still continues to decline and there 's some suggestion that with new legislation that comes in around installation particular in walls it may again produce a spike and consenting but at the moment it 's um it 's certainly continuing to decline over time is there any risk to us in our LTP because of this decline is there any risk that our growth projections are out not in a growth predict predictions no so in the long-term plan the forecasts around building consent is the forecast is much better in terms of understanding what 's actually happening in the work around things like the settlement review and it 's been done across Greater Christchurch will also help us with that as well thank you Phillip thanks Colleen on air page 160 under the strategic policy I 'm just really flagging just about how in fact that work might come to the government 's part of Council to learn and how we might develop a process for this yes so there 's a reasonably big project within the organization to align the work that 's going on across the organization to a strategic part and the priorities that councillors have identified and reconsidering updates you were said so you know through a briefing to understand we really think that thank you Vicki and then Jamie just going back to the chlorination because it was a really interesting paragraph and so how much lease would we need to put into the water then say Auckland Wellington will do that once we 've got the system I think you 've got to recognize these very very low organics in it so the American we will be putting in this very low but because it 's very low organics it will travel a long way through the network so basically you 'll get that now probably we will need a few months of operations for the things to settle for rum just that residual for a period down so that it is sitting there for a contact time okay and the second part of it in relation to the secured well heeds is their own network of wellheads that would be signed off now such that they or by the end of the month such that they wouldn 't need to be chlorinated in those words no because the issues are spread across the questioners we though we can take some of the smaller networks yep in focus on those yes I don 't think that 's part of the planning in terms of carry me forward with us I just wonder because there will be huge interest in this when John with reports needs to their IT committee we certainly pending by that time we 're still having discussions with the drinking water sisters about the final details and so basically I 'm I 'm not sure when the next City Committee is but whenever the next City Committee years we will certainly have a far more detailed of what we 'll do obviously within the other to that once the things up and running yeah clearly this whole thing 's an area of interest that 's fine we 'll also be putting information out to our residents around timing what it means no sort of things but also you know that if you put a zine stone water in a jug and a fridge and let it sit there being this nice taste shoes and something we will cover that but that obviously has got some really risks involved and some real issues probably more risky than taking water but we can cover that and we 've looked at that they 'll be fair to say that we you know periodically have transmissions and the amount that we need to dose into the system is very very very light and so you do find well we haven 't found a myriad of complaints from any of those occasional transgression all right thank you very much moving on Jamie with the my council one are we going to give reporting via the OIT project rolled out probably like via finance and performance or something you want briefing in no the briefings nice ear that just maybe some governments either side just to ensure you know that as far as a health chicks are the guys that everything 's looking good because these things you know I think do need governance input not domination but to some degree that is coming too much yeah so if it 's on the wrists register then even more importantly for to get some government oversight so it 's a comes in to fill the committee 's yeah we can social community so are you are requesting it 's reported out I think it 's more of a financial thank personally that look everything has financial implications I mean we I 'd say an IT project rolled out fits perfectly in a finance committee well if it 's on the risk register audit and risk is one place where we certainly could have some oversight it strikes me that the the the customer benefit side of it certainly belongs with Phil 's committee because there 's an effect on how customers interact with counsel but agree Jamie the the financial oversight part of large project and the the risks that are inherent in these type of projects audit and risk is probably the right place for that tool and if it 's on the risk register it allows us to pick it up there yeah yeah just I guess the question he has going back to is there a place in a governance level committee level for reporting on the on the IT project rollout well if not can we lives it 's coming to my committee Jerry and in those minutes or discussion will go to Council all right so the answer is there 's going to fill its committee but there 's the opportunity for oversight at auditing records the delegations for grants communications okay can we look into this and make sure that is so apparently the innovations think the Development Committee has the the delegated at the term of reference for council communications well you just thought communicating with the community would be with them can we check that out and just make sure that it is coming to the right place it 's like a major IT project are two aspects to it one of which is the financial and risk considerations as any projects but the benefit to council in terms of its interaction with its community and the benefit to the community I do believe would fit that 's the outcome all right can we ask Carlene to to pick that up and just make sure that we 've got it in the right place and maybe just to circulate something around all councillors that lines up the work that 's been done with the term of reference of the relevant committee be taken let 's get an answer to this we can 't resolve it here today because if it does belong it fills committee then that 's where it should go we 're not going to have a review of the terms of reference and so on at this meeting now but we 'll certainly get the information back from Carlene as to where it should be reported to and if it isn 't able to be picked up as I 'm suggesting in terms of the interaction with the community at one committee management point of view at either audit and risk or financing performance then that 's something we might choose to do something about I think we can pick up the spirit of your question but let 's find out what the as Chloe 's first and what the opportunities within that out hippie all right great okay so Yanni and then back to Vicki yep Yanni thank you um I think the financing performance we 're sewing to get better performance quarterly monitoring reports on certain topics and I think IT might be one that we could easily yeah look at so thank you restroom they 're just two questions one is is it possibly a copy of the Christchurch Northern Corridor plans for current bid straight based on what went to the Environment Court versus what we 're actually doing and I know this was a question raised last year when there was quite a lot of media interest and quite a lot of concern in the community um so this is on the report page 157 where it talks that we 've already started construction but I still I just like to understand what the difference are and differences and also ever reports going back to us to approve those designs or whether that 's already happened I can 't respond today I don 't know Dave you 've got any comments on me classic Northern Corridor are there differences in two planes and who has oversight of that we have got people sitting on the board of that so it 's actually controlled by the board of the Alliance and Osborne hit a transport sits on that board representing us so he 's got full oversight of it he 's working with the communications and the the in VTA it 's an entity a contract yes but it 's an alliance because it incorporates 10% of our work downstream and it 's lies between NZTA ourselves and the contractor so so we the media and the media there was a suggestion that we may be taken to court if we don 't follow the Environment Court design Fletcher 's were getting involved and so Fletcher building have asked around the on street parking so we 've had question that I put on last year around can we just see what the two designs are and then can we get some information back on who 's actually approving the designs because normally Cranford straight would come through counsel but we 've just had causal judgment okay can we can we get an answer from Dave the consortium is in consultation with those groups just doing their because basically they if you look at the plans that went to Environment Court they just generally had a note on the side of parking parking now we are going through the detailed design with those neighbors there 's places out there there 's some so there 's quite an extensive consultation system going there at the end of the day I will have to talk to Richard around the actual final process of signing off that design and yeah so if you can circulate that memo when you come back around all councilors so that we 've got an awareness of the answers to questions that yarn is asking that 'll be great and the second question as in regards to council laws are gonna be able to sign off on a strategy and planning work program for the year and you know I I think we of service we were supposed to do that every year and I don 't think we 've we 've seen one for quite quite a few years and I 'm just I guess interested in how we 're working through what what is going to happen versus what 's not and how we are the government 's level actually so not on that so I think last strategic priorities today LT you 're not talking about the strategic priorities referenced in my report you 're talking about something else well I would have thought that the strategy and planning work program should be aligning to our strategic priorities and previously I think we 've been told but that 's possibly the reason why it hasn 't happened today but I just want to understand you know I find it hard for us at a government level not to know what there 's what the strategy and planning work program is for a year and how does report and you need to start looking at this trial look through the service plan for their area it 's part of it LT pain so the LTP would be so if we were wanting to dig deeper into exactly what was proposed to be delivered then the LTP would be the place to currently web service that we 're supposed to sign off on a strategy in planning work program every year right so given that that 's not a part of this report I mean not saying that the question isn 't one that we would want an answer to but given that it 's not a part of this report that 's maybe something we should take offline a day thank you thank you all right and then Vicky finally back to you and I 'm keen to move on because we 're run taking quite a bit of time on a number of these items yeah certainly happy to do that promoted a bit more and signe through the community board so it 'll be great so something on news like yep great we model and they were gonna go out and engage with the community but I would tend to concur that I just think it 's almost like a bit premature because it 's still a work in gauging on that new model that we haven 't even got through yet yeah if we could do that they 'll be great okay fantastic thank you so resolution in frontof was to receive the chief executive report which I 'm happy to move holding costs have at a second all those in favor against that 's carried _"

    "text": "moving on then to our item 11 the holes well Hornby Rickett and community board report to council like more are welcome to the table thank you for joining us so if we deal with the report first and then we 'll deal with the part a as a separate item if you 've got any commentary on that so anything on the report first of all yep so where we 're at at the moment we 've got a number of community board chairs still to present and on obviously aware the people have been waiting for some time we 've got the zone committees also waiting we 've got Carlene who is only with us until midday and then he 's going to be out for a while and we want Carlene in the room when we debate the chief executives report so what I 'm trying to do is to get through the community boards within the next sort of 20 minutes or so let 's do carlene 's report before she goes and then the zone committees which should take half an hour that would see come back this afternoon to complete the rest of the agenda and public excluded but I 'm just aware that we 've got people waiting who were expecting to be on at certain times and the limitation around um Carlene stepping out for a while as well so Mike over to you opportunity of be as brief as I possibly can and in doing so we 're not going to have a video today to show us all the good things we 're doing and we 've got no hyper helpful random facts to offer you today either because their staff have been so busy on other projects significant projects in their board area we do have one part I which will come due that we 've got strengthening community fund projects unfortunately Erin our means trusted and mean to cook program has lost at ship so we 're looking for ship to replace that and we are also in the process because of the work that 's going to be going is going on down and we 'll continue for quite some time on this the horizontal infrastructure we association the unwritten road to so that we can communicate and on a timely manner with the with the contractors and the project team and the businesses and also residents associations etc in that area and the myself and in the the Pennington here would why Mary Community Board at a meeting with the Vice Chancellor discussed Parkton issues around the university which was really really helpful it 's not much you staff looking at at introducing car parking restrictions or alterations in the in the area of the the university unless we actually talk to and engage with the university as well so that was very very welcome pick them as reserve and that 's all underway them as we speak in the Harrington Park toilets and also the context just a bit read to be let their results very closely there 's other good things happening in halls well and the City Harvest as far as heritage there 's a lot of heritage and awful and the community just want the opportunity or a location to actually display that so that the public can actually come to speed that 's where half of Christ each came from cause will quarry nearly date then we 've got the city harvest is the big food rescue and operation has actually moved to to Rick it into the demonic enterprises building and up-and-coming events that we 've got is connect 2018 which is an activity that involves the students in the local residents and welcome them welcoming them to the to the academic world and and vice-versa welcoming the young people to be able to live and work and share in the in the community in a positive way and culture galore has already been mentioned by our neighboring board and that 's something that 's been going on for over how many years now Garrett 16 yeah and we 've got we 've got hollow Hornby as well another event coming up in the Hornby area on the 23rd 24th yeah and black hole park and we 've also got the community pride garden Awards as well coming up with the word community pub that 's and the other matters of interest we 've got the reclassification of depth of issues that I could add to that list but we are very very busy in there Ward and I will let you talk about the part I meant how the air community board accepted the job me to talk on that now let 's receive your report first of all so we 've got a motion in front of us to receive the holes were jambe Rick at the community board report which Jimmy 's gonna move and and it 's gone a second yep great were there any questions on the report for Mike before we pass the resolution I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried now let 's move to the pass did you have any commentary on this part a Mike or we got to go I mean it 's it 's it 's really good to see progress on that and we we had no problem at all with the staff recommendation but we just we we just did save a couple of firms and trees because the project involved some tree removal but there were some trees on Waterloo to retain and the services the whole project can proceed to those trees so and the last the last resolution 28 is is for air board to say well and we agree with everything on the staff recommendation and we had to save those those trees in that location so that 's it we can 't_''_397.7 wait until it 's done all right thank you are there any questions on passing yawning we there 's stuff gonna come up to the table on this or if we 've got questions for staff will bring staff to the table yep is there a question yeah right so can we bring staff to the table for a question please no I think that 's fine you 've provided your introduction to the depart a that 's fine so if you want to take your seat back in public gallery Mike that 's great and thanks for your contribution now let 's hear from staff in answer to any questions and then we 'll then we 'll deal with this okay so Yanni your question thank you we 've we 've been given budget and option one isn 't as there is there an option one Bay that remains within budget so yeah actually no we just have option within budget that 's currently the link the existing link and the new link and do nothing was another option to minimum just tidy up it 's a very struggling to understand how we can go out for a scheme and consult on something that we don 't have money on budget for so what happens if we say no through the draft LTP because we get community submissions around you know right too expensive and we can 't afford the whole project we 've gone far and there 's no legal requirements against us doing that there 's no legal agreements or committed agreements that we have with anyone okay and just fine I mean does that I guess my concern is this kind of pretense at LTP so um I can 't quite understand why we would I 'm just to understand the timing why we wouldn 't wait for Delta V to confirm the funding and then go engage with the 's a really strong drive from the community for the project guy he 'd progressive project in England Croatoan it doesn 't come at us to doing words I 've got what I mean it 's like some of us have lots of things we want done in our areas like that we that we don 't go for consultation until we 've got the money on budget okay let 's let 's keep questions to the budget so have we got legal have we got any legal advice on this it is a project that what 's been we 've been talking with the developers in that area around the links within GTA and railways for probably four or five years over this project it might be longer might might be able to sorry i 've only been around a short period of time compared to some of them so it 's been on our books and in our books for a long time but we have not been able to scope it and fully do it it 's only just recently we 've got the full requirements from of this project so basically there was not enough money when we did it it was in the 1525 plan however the whole thing hadn 't been scoped at that time once we had scoped it we couldn 't actually put it back into the annual plan because we didn 't actually know the philistine so as soon as we knew that we put it into the next planning document we are trying to hit a deadline it 's a project like I say that 's developments happening out there industrial development that 's happening out there at the moment so it 's an important link in that in the network and so the only way we could do it is actually put that additional funding yes if you turn down that additional funding we would not be able to let those contracts but we have because basically there has been a long discussion on it and the importance of the network continued work we would just stop that and it would just go on hold until some of the full ramifications of that I 'm sorry I would have of the documentation around that to advise you on the full ramifications but we could bring that to you to the LTP for generations that 's exactly what I was going to say that 's a matter for the LTP rather than for today this is about the current that we 're working in for the LTP we 've got an explicit funding decision to make in the LTP and we may or may not choose to get some further advice around that as we consider whether to do this or not that 's fine Viki I think it 's fantastic that you 've gone and done all of the work around this this is a huge Road Business Park is really major and this actually helps keep industry in the Christchurch City is this a question or have we strayed into debate already the question is no there is no question when when actually it had to happen this is a huge development these guys have put in an amazing amount of time effort into building a major industrial park in this area and it needs to connect and approved in the LTP we can get on and do it so that people are safe on the road is really really important ok so now let 's move back to questions Glen do just a second power 6.28 given the public interest in this project it is proposed to continue with design and team there so my questions over the sequencing so today does this actually give a tick to the design and tender because it thence is subject to the approval of the additional funds so again I don 't want to get into a kind of a current player completely but we actually can 't go back because today we get the tick keep the LTP or sorry no choice it 's already know we have heard that we can make an explicit decision in the LTP either to fund this or not and the decision we 're making today just forms part of the environment that we were making that decision in so Dave made that very clear in his answer to the previous question Sarah and 2.5 metres shared by direction all paths here going to hear be vehicles that might not necessarily look in both directions for cyclists on the path and there 's not much with first cyclists to dodge why can 't we make those wider through the in terms of the overall functions of the nature of the road yes it is typically we have both sides rather than just web sites that the design had been amended before shin cycle paths on both sides of the road the original intent was on one side saying it is spreading their life will save the flexibility of spaces on the road for cyclists cyclists to you so there 'll be some they are quite came to use and similar to what does happen on all the existing agency to enforce or Junction Road at the moment so a lot of it a lot of the design elements had been looking at taken into account basically the overall needs really recognizing some of the challenges such as in an industrial area there 's no doubt about that so consideration had been given to the interactions between both cyclists and heavy vehicle users yeah through ite because it seems like it 's the sort of project that would like it 's quite a substantial project and that involves Road extension cycle ways those kind of things that would seem to me that it would come through ite the for sort of the the for council see the plane the first time maybe it should have gone up through the communities delegated to the community board to make a recommendation from here I suppose I 've had to keep the delegations and the community board inspector counsel if the community boards got the ability to make those decisions yeah this is a community board recommendation to council that 's the process that this has gone through I mean the question is why did it not come to the committee and the answer seems to be because it 's a local road yeah okay more of a scrutiny over the actual layout and design of things because I you 're quite used to doing the it and so I 've got concerns over the cycle ways for example but yeah we don 't have information sorry design process as we do undertake safety audits at each of the stages so through their changes had been made some of the elements of the original design to accommodate those needs an extra wide across the safety spectrum it 's pasted into transport users because it 's new bus stops gone and you 've got your scientists your new pedestrian activity so there 's a range of things that through that does one process as we do have safety genius in did you while at winter general submissions did you send it specifically to the stakeholder groups like spokes great thank you okay so do it Jimmy you 're happy to move I was just about to ask for a mover so there 's perfect do we have a second up and is there any debate on this so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against miscarry thank you very much now _"

    "text": "all right and now let 's move on to the per se which is item 7 so Carolyn your commentary on this some first of all yeah okay for round Samira stood for a very long time the earthquake recovery meant that it was a wreck run from Brahm through to the city for people and the area around Samir 's Church has been treated rather badly by that rate run including the bollards and the businesses that we have asked the council to help repair because it 's the offense as well and so we proposed two three years ago for a 30k speed limit for the whole of Eddington we would like because Eddington is classic Railway House buildings very close to the road was not a lot of leeway between the road and the roads are narrow as well it 's very much suited up for a susyq a speed limit then we were told that you don 't have a 30 K speed limit introduced until the traffic is going at Suzy K which was very hard to take but there you go then they introduced for the boutique a speed limit but we have been told by our fantastic traffic engineer John Doerr who 's practically a God in our eyes and our Lord because he is so efficient and hardworking and we had the slightest of disagreements with him and he put this proposal forward for 40 K speed limit there because this is what NZTA would say because the cars are going closed all really going close to 40 K we thought that we could still try for the 30 but we 're persuaded by John 's persuasion but he 's very good at so you will notice in the resolution that we are looking for a review in a year 's time with to look at whether we should stay at 40 K or 30 K if you pass the resolution so it has a proviso that we 've added so on advise the board was comfortable with 40 K well you 're still motivated to look at reducing that to 30 K and that 's what resolution 5 is about at lease great thank you so questions Sara Jaime Vicki the quite a small tight area yes sorry I was gonna say some streets people we 're going while the cycle way through here is a separated one there are other other cycle ways where we 've got a neighborhood greenways for example through nice wide streets we would put a few build outs and they 're going to 30 not 40 yeah we 've been through the discussion yeah and we understand it we understand their it 's a difficult one yes we understand so you obviously have had some by the sounds of it detailed discussion with staff and you 've received staff advice on 40 K or 30 K has rules that favor yes I know I know because the inner city maybe maybe we 'll deal with questions for Carolyn and and Melanie now and then we 'll bring staff to the table and we can we would like to extend it to the whole of Edington but this is only amounts of mirrors to it we don 't believe the traffic goes greater than 30 because they 've got the and the cycleway has stopped the so far and appreciating there are more questions to come what I 'm hearing is that the board really wants 30 K isn 't Mary 's square but because of their advice that you received that you wouldn 't get that if you asked for it you 've kind of agreed to 40 but reluctantly agreed to forge this all right this is all useful information let 's proceed with questions but if there if people have got questions that would be better put to staff then hold those for staff so let 's deal with question yeah let 's deal with questions for Carolyn now and then we 'll bring some staff to the table and we 'll put questions to staff and then we 'll decide what to do from there so I 've got Jamie local knowledge on the flip side though I think just around the visual pollution side of things sometimes when these signs go up do you think that we run any risk of that and just to follow on from it we 've got a number of streets you and the female from apeman 's Road mcdougal Eve Browns or it goes on forever leave 50 caves but no one can do anywhere near 50 you 're lucky if you can do five at times do you think that the visual pollution sort of side of it with signage everywhere for something that 's just not going to happen anyway is going to be a rest when I was actually saying I 'm probably being deal was advocate more because like I see that I do nothing I 'm saying doesn 't really make any difference anyway because looking at the speeds people are going pretty slow and it looks like it 's just difficult just do the problem streets and address the problem and not the one no the problem streets into the inter so that we if they 're coming down the problem streets Ward for instance at 60 that 's what they get to speak they 're going when they 're into they have to slow down the straightaway but that 's what their speed that go and that 's one of our problems from a community perspective there 's of know the answer to this but it 's um the season sounds like that you 're favoring 30 do you think that there is perhaps a risk of confusion for motorists not the beer such simple beasts but I mean you know you 've got 30 case you 've got 50 case theater case in the city 50 cows on normal streets you know it 's a bit of a random number to then come up with 40 when people feel quite used to there 's a 30 speed limit and slower areas that we see there 's a 50 on normal sort of arterioles or my brother pacing out and I think there 's a problem with inertia that it costs quite a bit of money to change science so we the review in the years time it 's a bit of a shock really because this is only my opinion I 'm only expressing my opinion because the cost of the science is so large he wants the city to have to incur it so do it properly please thanks great thank you next question Viki most see why I can 't go to 30 I like the idea of 30 so just in terms of the consultation that you did we put out 1300 leaflets was there actually asking them about 40 or 30 saying there 's a proposal for 40k speed limit it was that it was the people who have talked about 34 years right so what you asked in your community views and preference staff was lowering it to 40 mm right so you haven 't consulted on 30 yeah no we would need to do that if we lowered it to 30 okay and the staff will be able to advise on that further when we bring details desktop all right so again just sort of taking care to ask the questions for the board to Carol in and keeping questions for staff I 'm just for a few minutes Jonnie and they know I 've got Glen thanks I 'm just looking at the map at the back that shows the measured speeds and I was just trying to understand it 's got its got the recorded mean Spain yeah and just I guess what I really wanted to understand from the community board and I know that they 'll be time to ask questions of staff there 's the current speeds through the area too fast and are there problems with the current way in which people are speeding through this area yes we 've just see it so through Ward and Paulson we think they 're going too quickly in the entering church square too quickly they 're going slower and some of the other ones like em yeah so we know look at the information that we 've got it would look like Ward 's trips 43 and I think Paulson was that the other one you said that 's 31 that 's parallel to them as well so they 're Collins we 're talking about yeah basically there are Collins is under 40 now Ward streets slightly over and pulse on to come down they yani not that 85% oh right yeah because what would you talk we 're talking about getting all the people speeding to slow down to below it 's all very well if this we don 't mean to think we 're going about that speech yeah so so I mean the reason for asking the question is our councils child this before in Charleston which is there I know which is a few similarities with Eddington old workers cottages etc and what we found was 40k didn 't that she reduced the speed at all so I have a lot of sympathy for the 30k and I guess we can our staff and I just wanted to check with your board about whether you 'd had any feedback about what had been done elsewhere and how that had worked no I mean we were still told that the inner city was about an example on its own and endings et a had rules about the speed limits and the justification for lowering the speed and the indeed TTA 's was the kind of premise that we were fine but so start gave you know advice on the 40 K zone in Charleston which would be very quite similar the home was totally and didn 't work but what they say is that trying to go their speed anyway yeah exactly what we found the child okay but seaweed like sushi came for the whole event and so Samir is too square really is just the start of what will I think be a campaign by the local residents but it does encourage people to think we have a mindset in that direction all right now I think there 's a picture that 's building quite clearly here of you know where the where the board 's a store certainly you 're telling us very clearly what the local view might be so final question through for Carolyn from Glen air and your things a question for staff is that right so Glen and then we 'll get some staff to the table and I 'm sure other questions for staff as well okay thank you just trying to figure out hey you could actually go much faster than 30 Ward Street is very wide and it leads him to Selwyn Street and I 'll tell you what they did because we were really worried about Ward Street it seemed quite dangerous and lot of submissions on it and just as an in to intervening thing the traffic engineers put a white line down the middle and we 've got reports from the residence that it slow down it 's just the visual interference Ward Street is a real problem and and the entrance coming into it people are still going at speeds that are excessive for our tiny Street it feels a bit counterintuitive it 's probably today worth being frustrated with the traffic on sale all right thank you very much that 's been useful feedback from the board and from the community so if I could now maybe if the board members and take their seats back in public gallery and if we can bring relevant staff to the table and I mean clearly there 's a view which has been expressed by the community board from the community that a 30 K speed limit may be more desirable than 40 certainly there 's a Central City example Yanni 's comments I think around the Charleston example and I 'm very familiar with those streets and their similarity to some about here the experience there if there was a desire I mean what I 'm hearing from the community board is a desire to look at 30 than 14 and to take a wider view of what we might do other streets in Addington as well and Ward Street Pilsen Street Collins Street were all streets that were mentioned in the question and answer discussion what would the process be to do there having got to where we 've gotten clearly one process is for us to have to approve this today maybe make some further comments around the need for additional speed treatments in those neighbouring streets and look at the review that 's noted in item 5 of this set of recommendations and go 40 and let things run for the moment the other alternative would be to look at whether we should be taking this back to the board for a further consideration of whether 30 would be more appropriate so if we can get some advice on that to start with and then let 's see what questions are still remaining after you 've provided that has come through a quite a robust process speed limits are a regular tree they have there 's a set piece of legislation there 's even a speed limits rule which local authorities must follow in cities pigments and I can certainly confirm that this current proposal was gone through that if you were to look at doing something in your decision today that differs from that you would essentially be obligated to rican sult to comply with the legislation so but but thinking more generally about what we 're trying to achieve with speed management count the NCTA has recently changed to be management not only the legislation but the guidelines and it is significantly more support or fobs some 50 kilometer per hour speed limits and I definitely think it 's timely to have a chat with council generally about the how we go about that in effect of sorting it of sorta to do a for briefing with elected members to suggest what areas of the city which should be our priorities because it 's something that really does need to be looked at and it 's 't make sense to do individual streets to some looks to some extent it 's actually this in a number of other locations there will be our focus what the NCD I would refer to or what what is feed management practitioners we were for it was self explaining roads so those are roads we are generally traffic travels lower than 50 kilometers an hour and what we want to do is set the speed limit at the speed at which the traffic is generally going so that 's what we 're trying to do generally that we 're it becomes a little bit tricky is and this is would be a good example of that as some streets in that area especially around two-square they do have a really low very early traffic combed and people can 't trim very fast at all but then other streets like Ward Street you can travel a lot faster and it gets to the point if you would if you were to try to set the speed limit of every individual Road it 's and all those sorts of principles you quickly a lot of cohesion and the area to have speed limits all over the show and it would be very hard for you as the motorist to sort of get to grips with what exactly what speed limit is because you could turn the corner go bigger do a one speed light you turn the east corner you 've got different speed you tend to cut another corner it 's for you could be going from forty two thirty to fifty and a very short space of time and essentially what this what I think is really strong about this proposal is it 's it 's a quite a large area and it is quite well defined and it will be very cohesive and very user friendly as motorists to understand what the expectation of is or view and so that so that 's we 're so I guess I that 's we 're on at with this proposal in terms of 30 h I do think as an organization we do need to be careful about that so there are provisions within the new regime for speed limits to necessarily intended for small suburban type areas it 's the intent is more really high density CBD the types of Main Street work areas where there 's really strong high densities of pedestrians maybe maybe things like rodriram Street and Rickon will maybe bits and pieces and around Sumner with us really they can be really quite numbers of pedestrians so we do need to be careful about looking at that type of approach in the suburban environment and just the other comment I 'd like to make about that as well is there 's a really strong focus on how we do speedometer now of taking the community with us and so this proposal does have a really strong level of support in the community although some elements acid '_``_1105.629 doesn 't go far enough but it would be really easy to forget just how contentious the 30 kilometre per hour for the sign for the speed limit and the CBD was and if they hadn 't gone through the process they did through the zero notice there would have been there would have been a lot an opportunity I think that 's something we need to keep in mind as well all right thank you so Aaron and then Sarah Aaron yeah it was later last year that dr. Glen curry eluded us to some of the changes that were made and he said we did have delegated authority to do this and to go to 30 is that true or not soon or do you make that up industry the council obviously has council obviously has the authority to make decisions on speed limits but with that or I guess with their ability to do that there 's an expectation on making good decisions and making reasonable decisions and there is legislation that 's behind these decisions that you need to be aware of and making those decisions yeah in this one because it is a week I 'd call it pop it it seems to make sense to change that and going to the 40 I think 30 works so my question would be if we 've gone out and consulted and an a considerable number of come back and the feedbacks been would like 30 then that consultation is done but otherwise why consult because the fever um comes back and sees no paint at black so we go well only 90 percent see painted black so it 's still paint it white why would we do it why does that not so my question is does that suffice it as a consultation so it 's a really good question and my advice would be that my advice I I would I would feel I would feel uncomfortable with the consultation so in what this is what I 'm taking it I think if say for example it was challenged to say for example judicial review and the consultation response and the con and the leaders of requirements were look to him in terms of counsels obligation to consult with the NZTA of the police their AAA and other specific stakeholders and if we changed if we change the decision at this late notice I 'm not convinced that we would be on strong ground and they since so then the whole question goes back to why even consult if you get an answer that change anyway a bit because we 're scared of judicial review no no I think that I don 't think this particularly fear like you could have we could have headed consultation that was overwhelmingly in favor for something other than what counsel had originally proposed and say for example the police or in Zito or others that have got some of the statutory obligations to to I guess check and make sure that the right checks and balances in place about the right and type of appropriate speed limit if those who are firmly opposed to our proposal then I think we would have an obligation to respond to them in consultation but that 's simply not the case and the the consultation response in this case is really seemingly and very much in agreement with what has been proposed so your advice really is if we were getting Kline to make a decision to go to a 30 K speed limit here rather than 40 there would be a requirement to recon sult on a 30 K speed limit proposal yes thank you coming back to council about report back it would give the council an opportunity to see what wanted to do in the bigger picture so that we have some consistency across the city so this does enable us to go ahead with what we have consulted on and it also doesn 't pose it or to future changes which could appear in well I think you sorry Andrew my my point was do we have to consult again and you use the word that would create a requirement to and I don 't think it legally does create a requirement to consult again because we 've done the consultation and we have we didn 't get overwhelming response saying all jeepers only go to 40 but we wouldn 't expect anything lower than that hold back I 'm tempted I say we want legal advice on a consultation we should ask a lawyer and we 've got all the room I think you have to take regard to the advice you 're getting at the end of the table which is around not just community consultation but other involving other agency as well like NZTA decision-making for you to make a decision to change it to 30 rather than 40 now without giving staff the opportunity to flesh that out and come back to you and say whether or not one any further consultations required or that yes that 's okay but we need to do this all that or whatever I don 't think you should make the decision now I think you need further advice before you do that and good decision-making practices would indicate that that 's what you should do so if we were inclined to make it so repeating my question if we were inclined to make a decision for 30 caves rather than 40 Kay 's today we would need to investigate whether they were further processes we need to go through before we did that we wouldn 't simply make that decision at these meetings maybe you can I start to come back to you with a report on whether or not the 40 should be changed right okay great all right moving on further questions Sara thank you so following on and I guess there 's some great to get shortly but the the similar area in Charleston it 's about to have a cycle way through it with a neighborhood greenways it 's a 40 k zone currently and it 's going to have a thew GK strip running through the middle so you can have 50 40 30 through there and so yeah and then 60 on one of the nearby roads so if we get a if you are saying that we need a consistent approach to nets what 's in the report as well can we get a report on a strategic approach to so speed neighborhoods to say ite committee in the next yeah with the workshop and things a in the next three to four months so that in the meantime while you know before the 12th month review we can have that strategic approach done so now we 've just consulted on Richmond Hill well that 's open at the moment for a 40 K zone it would be really good rather than an ad-hoc to have that strategic approach so pets what I can share with you is the meet if that 's the way that you would like to do it so as staff we 're really approaches bid management from two angles and boost anglers there 's some really high gain improvements that we can make so these high-speed roads generally rural roads that have high speed limits and they have a disproportionately high number of high severity crashes on this we 're looking at those types of roads as a specific high priority speed management project those types of roads don 't tend to be high on the community agenda for change but they are certainly high on the staff attended due to the safety issues there 's another element that is high on the community agenda and there is local neighborhood areas and staff have at the moment identified on a map a number of areas within the city that we think would be really good candidates for lower a sloth speed limit than 50 kilometres an hour my view is it would be a mistake to try to affect all those speed limits and one large and one large go and just in terms number the sheer number of signage to be able to implement that across the city is quite staggering and what would having identified those areas what we would like to do is hear the areas that were identified with council with a view to getting at council view on what of those areas would be a highest priority to to change first were medicine freeze first yeah so no I wasn 't asking whether we should do them all at once just whether we should get some sort of strategic approach together where we say actually as a council we believe that when we do a slow-speed neighborhood it should be a consistent 30 across the city or we believe it should be a consistent 40 across the city rather than having this ad hoc approach with some might theory because that way it makes it much clearer for the community you know they 're going into a slow-speed neighborhood it 's always duty or it 's always 40 that 's they not just which ones I mean so clearly there 's some work underway within staff at what point 's suggestions easy committee is a good one and at what point are you looking for some elected member guidance on that so that we can actually progress some of this in a prioritized way so request staff provides a report on a strategic approach to slow-speed neighborhoods to the ite committee timeline yes so if we said within means if you want a report or a briefing okay well the briefing would be faster wouldn 't it so why don 't we why don 't we say rather than request staff to report request staff to provide a briefing yeah I mean that briefing may then end up in a report but at least with the briefing it gives elected members some influence over what the report contains so that the report will come with what 's likely to be agreeable request staff to provide a briefing the infrastructure transport and variant committing a strategic approach to slow speed neighbourhoods to slow speed neighborhoods and if we said within a month two months next meeting find out a briefing so I probably need I wouldn 't like to say with the chair and let 's not eat in as soon as we possibly can yeah okay great Sarah that was everything yep great thank you so where are we Aaron Sarah Vicki Glenn Phil and Vicky actually I 'm keen to move this on because I 'm getting a sense that you know I mean there are questions people are asking which are removing in something of a similar direction Vicki I was going to ask has been asked but I just wanted at some stage to hear back from the community board on whether they would like to go what 's the 14 hour or wait while we do the 30 but that 's the community board not right yeah all right so let 's just perk that and that actually leads to a question if we were to say if we were to say we don 't have a desire to go 40 now we want you to go back and consider what needs to be done to come back with a proposal at 30 or to consider a proposal of 13 how long would that take at 15 if it was going to take you six months to do that then might that might color our decision to go with one year review realistically I would realistically I think I don 't think that we would be able to get back to you within three months so within three or six months would be a three to six months all right thank you it just I 'm sort of submitting this somewhere in mind in terms of the consultation the the legislation says you must consult a few propose a speed limit if you were to the this is my view we have not proposed the 30 kill made it perhaps being the match if if counsel was to insert a 30 kilometer per hour we might it has to have consulted on a 30 h speed limit it just simply hasn 't done that yeah that 's our that 's understood from the previous and questioning my question was how long would that take and you 're saying three to six months thank you yep if you can 't_''_1950.31 and then I 'll come back right if I 'm wrong and so my fellow counselor but the reason why we agreed to the 40 was to get it in place now and then look at the 12 months what came from the the consultation was that the community wanted 30 and the we couldn 't and for the reasons given we couldn 't do 30 but we thought that it was at least a safety in their area straight away or as soon as possible but let 's get a final comment from the chair before we debate this so I 'll come back to you Carolyn want to invest questions for staff that 's useful Tim but I 'd probably prefer that comment to come from the chair of the board that 's fine or a comment on that to come from the chair of the board all right that 's great so so Vicki you 're happy now or you 've asked all your questions anyway and Glenn this report in terms of if we look at but when we used to look at plane changes for instance from commissioners it was more much with them they can really overturn them this kind of feels like that as if it 's a fait accompli this is very different in the plan change now quite a parallel in terms of the fire can play what we 've heard is that because we 've chosen to consult on 14 yet the option we have today is to adopt unity or not we were we were wanting to go 30 rather than 40 we would need to go out and reconcile and there 's a time scale of three to six months to do that it would be good in future to do that and go out with different speeds rather than spend a whole lot of time and money just to yeah I 'm sure that comment gloomy caption that 's fine thank you Phil my first point was achievement is a given the number of questions and interest in those in concern in a big problem that in fact besides the Attic committee that in fact we have a briefing for all counselors and I think Ryan indicated that we have that my second speeds on some of the streets like for example and especially goes above the 85th percentile where the speeds on this map are very worrying and just how like some nearly 70 K and that 15 that that for a percentage of the drivers and in another 158 K so how how workable might it be at the stage to actually have those speeds now and so that they 're all consistent with with safe 30 K and I guess or is is in fact the concept that the board decided eventually to actually have a forty K and as an interim way of so in traffic so what what what you in your view is the best way is the best way forward to actually have these actually achievable so these speeds are lowered so that 's a really good question actually and I think anyone would be easily gobsmacked by the speeds there some people willing to drive on residential streets if you looked at any of the speeds on residential streets that we 've been odd venerable I on our radar for neighborhood improvement schemes it 's 100 kilometres per hour on residential streets just leading into achieving slow speeds if you are actually determined to achieve 30 kilometres per hour you it is absolutely essential that you have traffic coming to be able to make that workable absolutely essential and it 's probably quite timely to remind you that there is absolutely no funding for traffic coming the neighborhood improvement scheme in any council budget so realistically if you do want to go down the direction of 30 kilometres per hour you really are going to have to look at how you fund additional roading measures to make the digitally visible I think we need to be you know given that we 're requesting a briefing I think we need to be careful that we don 't end up encouraging that briefing to take place today when we 're making a decision in a council meeting because all of this information will be considered at that time the question in front of us today is are we going to approve a 40 kilometer speed limit reduct a 40 kilometer speed limit for some Mary 's Square doing that so this is taking some time and I 'm keen to keep the questions specific to the matter that we 're considering today realizing that if we don 't adopt what 's in front of us there will be implications okay if I got an a Mike and then I 'm really keen to move on so we 're all obviously really concerned for our communities could we have a briefing come to all of us to save time and to get things moving along all right so let 's make it a briefing to councillors rather than a briefing to the infrastructure transport the Environment Committee let 's do that or it could be a briefing of the infrastructure transport Environment Committee to which all councillors were invited the difficulty with that is it often then gets put in the diary at times when other councillors aren 't available maybe we could put it on the list for a Tuesday briefing at some point so it was a briefing to all councillors that seems to be the the sense but it needs to happen reasonably quickly yeah then it that leaves the option of a briefing to issue with all councillors invited or just whichever is able to happen first I think there 's an urgency around this well if we 're laid on the table then we don 't have the opportunity to make a decision today about reducing the speed to 14 and it may be that we 're gonna decide that 's what we want to do do you want in the meantime the speed limit look you want to take a morning tea break in sort of like the border no I want to finish this now that we started with women we 're making a big job of what is really a simple question today because there 's a whole contextual piece behind it which is what the briefing is going to be about we need to we need to answer this today because if we don 't the speed limit remains at 15 as Samaras Square and that certainly isn 't what the Community Board wants okay so we 've got one more question for Mike and then we 're going of a comment because obviously we 've seem to have moved away from the actual item and going across the whole city so on for you know to meet one of the boost problem is actually the fact that around school zones we have speed limits of forty case and if we 're looking at reducing speeds down to thirty I think we need to actually look at this go zones as well which is really added to higher limits so can we make sure that briefing includes yeah I don 't know that we need to note that in the resolution but can we be assured the school zones will be taken into account in that briefing as well we haven 't_''_2395.6 done as much work in that area and so it is actually a bigger briefing but we 'll do as far as possible it needs to be joined up again that 'll be a matter that will traverse in the briefing that 's fine okay so if we can now just have the question answered by Carolyn relating to so the question we 've heard from staff after all is a recommendation from the community board today to adopt a 40k speed limit if we don 't do that the speed limit remains at fifteen until such time as further work done to consider bringing it down to 13 there is work which is underway which is looking at an area-wide approach to lower speed zones and it sounds as though the streets that we 've talked about in this discussion today could well be a contender for that would the board 's wish be for us to take the recommendation that you 've put in front of us today lower the speeds of 40 and then consider the whole area through this piece of work and this briefing that we 're talking about also leaving in the one-year review but realizing that there 's work that might be able to be got underway sooner than that extended beyond the samiri square which is almost symbolic of what should be happening for the rest of Eddington it should all be 30k yeah there 's no question of that but we took what we could get John said and we reacted as I think you 're probably going to we took what we could get and we will continue to take what we can get but it was wanted so what you want from us today given what 's in front of us is reduced to 40k now because at least we get some reduction but progress the 30k soon progress the conversation about 30k or an area-wide speed reduction as soon as possible yeah so I am therefore happening to move the recommendations that are in front of us do I have a second to fill clear water is there any debate Phil Allen we need to do that otherwise this will take another this week Asian find some improvements in the series of steps we have to take the street Mysterio or yep great Thank You Aaron well yeah after the discussion and the clear intentions of the community board I would have preferred we 'd gone to 30 K an hour today and if we were a ballsy council that 's what would do but as Carolyn put it we took what we could get slogan because that seems to be the theme of the rebuild and we were going it 's that we took what we could get and how often do we get these decisions come up in front of us we 've really consulted once well go and we already got the answer that in now we 'll go out and consult again eventually and then we 'll pay thousands of dollars to change all the signs what a great use of rate payers money that 's why they voted us here to do was to just resend Andry spend their money when we took what we could get there 's a good lesson here thanks for those special words yeah but I would gone for 30 okay so Mike and then Vicki and then Glenn and then we will at that point move to make a decision I wasn 't gonna smoke I 'm gonna support this in this is not about being a boozy council it 's actually listening to the advice that we 're receiving listening to the community board actually if you look at the submissions I think lower so this list around twenty five percent so you would have to go in and consult I 've actually taken advice listened to the community board I think this is actually the best it I 'm sure around Christchurch we 'd love to see the speed limit slower to actually it 's these they 're safe but we have to do it right and actually just come in right now making a speed limit of 30 case is not the right decision to make great Thank You Vicki I like the fact that Ryan mentioned that there were two things under review and one of them was the rural roads which have very high speed limits and a lot of which we have in our community board area which desperately need lowering and some of them are still seventy and they 've still and they 've got there now major residential roads and we 've been working on getting a lot of those lowered I 'm delighted that NCTA has actually taken their foot off the pedal as it were in terms of ensuring that every Road is it and that we can now look seriously at communities deciding for themselves what they want to do by way of the use of the road within that community to keep the kids safe the dogs safe the everybody safe in that area I love the idea that the whole of Eddington could be 30 case and I love if that 's what the people of Ellington want I love the fact that we could possibly do that quite soon I would also take the 40k now and work towards that if that 's if that gets you an answer this week and I would take the 30k in six months time when we can do that but I I like there are 30 K areas all over the city and I like the idea that people can actually decide for their neighborhood what they want and we can make that happen without NZTA telling us all the time that that 's not okay and the fact that the rules chapter has changed too is it 's just excellent and we need to get on and do something quite different about and Glen I 'm very aware of the fact that we 've got the zone committees waiting outside and we 've got community board chairs who have been waiting for some time to give their presentations as well so I 'm keen to keep this moving now thank you I 'm gonna support this as the foot of K now and I hope that my fellow council as well as well it 's better to get this and now and make this these streets safer and then have the reviewers read agreed and twelve months but prior to that to have a briefing to councillors to and for councillors to make it clear to staff what we 're thinking as well which I don 't think has been there I do think that the 30 Kay 's should be the next step down rather than 40 so it 's very clear central cities 30 I do believe also that around our schools that should be 30 Kay 's and I mean really that so I think we 've got to get clear advice when we talk to our staff in the clear advice that we 've had today thank you Thank You Glen thank you is with most reports that cease at the beginning you know that their council it feels to me as if before it is a fait accompli I question the kind of efficacy of the council but it you actually can 't_''_2859.97 overturn the decision I also consider that a bit of common sense actually when you drive around these streets they are narrow caused by which which is accessible by the cars park via a lot of speed humps and I contrast this actually you know not meaning to take a shot with parts of Park Terrace and I think under the AAC program where it feels very counterintuitive to actually drive 30 K 's it 's probably a block too far just in my personal view so I 'm actually cannot vote against this and finally yawning I appreciate the cinnamon of this is you know apparently better than nothing but having been through the Charleston one where we spent a huge amount of time and energy putting in a forty K neighborhood speed you know I concur with a comment that 's been made that you know if we 're gonna put something can that creates a false perception and actually the ideal outcome would be 30 K and that 's presumably what we 've heard is the community boards first preference and possibly the community 's first preference then I really can 't see the sense in putting the Sun I don 't think it 's actually going to achieve what we want it to achieve based on experience I also am concerned that there 's no money to do the neighborhood improvements and our local streets anymore but you know our mine cancers that just the other week we we passed continuation of accessible city where we 're spending huge amounts of money like just outside almost a Boulevard to make that safer so you know I think one of the things we need to think about is if we want to slow the speed traffic in these areas we do have to put some Street calming measures in place otherwise it won 't work and you know ideas like shutting you know looking at some of the entrances into this area for the rat runs doesn 't seem to have come through either so you know I want to make this a safer environment but I do not believe that 40k will will be effective and therefore I won 't support it today I 'd much rather get the 30 K information back and look at that as a solution along with rating improvements I 'm taking my guidance from the community board chair in the community board and I think it was good that we had the ability to ask that question and have it answered clearly there 's a an area-wide approach that we need to take in Addington and possibly other areas of the city and proper consideration of that can be done at that briefing which were signalling in item four of our resolution today so whilst my instinct would be to go 230 case because that 's what I 'm hearing the community wants my strong instinct is also to rely on the legal advice that we 've been provided and I think to reduce limit at 50 for what could be another six months let 's get an improvement in now but let 's have our eye on what the community really wants or what we 're hearing the community really wants which is a speed reduction over quite probably a wider area and to a greater extent than the 40k so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you and Carolyn thank you very much for your input that was a long discussion but I think a useful one now moving on to do you want to record the notes for that yeah so if we can just have the know show their hands please so Erin Glen yawning thank you all right and _"

    "text": "thank you for joining us this morning welcome to the table speak before very passionate as you are too pure at a tone we have a part a to begin with which is which I just want to comment on you won 't be putting it now Andrew you put it yep so maybe if you want to do the report first yeah and then we 'll deal with the pace yeah so let 's let 's do it with your overall report guest you will do this and then we 'll come and look at the part I and maybe make the comments on part I get that now nigh as usual are going to share so she 's going to start with the reopening of the old stone hence Oh the order on here okay so I think it was anyway it was Tuesday which is before liens and all that kind of stuff and they have this awesome celebrations if you ever go to any of the so the most amazingly fun and exciting thing so they hit the pancake race in the picture before was the it 's just an amazing sort of community event that they always get to be their own everyone has a fantastic time and and we 've support this this was a very emotional event for us almost not long after the earthquake when Major whom you will all know is the person who bought the beach came to see the board with a DVD of the opening of the West Braden community pool which occurred on the 20th of February 2011 and it had been the culmination of a mess of fundraising effort to rebuild the pool that have been built in the 1930s at a time when everybody else was pulling their pools out with spraying schools one of the has one of the poorest least resourced communities in Christchurch and they built this pool and was opened on the 20th of February 2011 and was naturally pancaked all in all enormous sums of money all the fundraising just went and he showed us the DVD of the opening which was like something from the 50s with kids jumping into a pool on a hot sunny day and he pool from the United States so if there is another earthquake then falls apart or something it does something that means it can be rebuilt together again and they did the surrounds he even suggested to local tradies that they were going home with a load of concrete on Friday night they could just drop it we sprayed in school and they do something with it they built they surround and they 're built the change sheds and Lamar came in for just for example this was the kind of thing that happened Lamar came in with a 12,000 to put in disabled excess so they 've got a chair to lower people into the major pool as well and it was opened with that 's right it was it was reopened on the 22nd of February after I think it 's just it 's very close to 800,000 worth of fundraising it 's a remarkable thing for a school in our area to do and we have assistant we we contribute to 20,000 and we also contributed two tickets for families from neighboring areas to have a family entrance we 've supported that in in five local schools that surround West Braden school so that families from our area who may not ordinarily be able to access the pool can take their children and their family in there far know into that we sprayed in swimming pool and the numbers that can go in and this is typical of Dwayne major the numbers that can go in on a family ticket are up to ten which is terrific and family of course is a very liberal father interpretation so it was a it was a divine night Dwayne lead to jump into the pool the kids followed him and though a couple of kids beat him to it while the speeches just don 't be and it was a just a great thing to have a heaven our local neighborhood with me as in one things they did was they sent kids around Christchurch to other polls to do bombing because one of the things that just Turley and he ran in a pull as kids have to have fun so rather than say well knowing you can 't test all the polls to work out how deep they should be for bombing okay hold some hands you hear the opening of the old stone house which was fantastic only in speech was really good because I learned to hold lotion it was all in the article if you saw that and stuff that this building was built in 1870 by Sir John Ruth Wilson and he 'd come over and he bought a huge like over 100 heap these other getters of land and he built this stone building for the farm workers so it 's a two and a half story building which I thought was also interesting so it was it was originally built for a named about a wooden house for the into 11 so um yeah there 's a there 's a big history too and the picture before the woman standing these tool Iain and the white as Carol and Marian she 's one of his descendants and she gave a very inspiring speaks of talking about when she had been there as a child and what the landscape was like and how back then so it was amazing and she 's an amazing woman because I saw a better parent facebooking people of commented she but she 's in here excuse I think yes here yeah and she 's been on the zipline at the beach park I think was pretty good thing yeah so um yeah it was it was really great and if you haven 't been in that because it 's really great looking on the mezzanine floor and they 're so um yeah we 're very grateful to have that opened again in our area and we 're going to have our one of our awards ceremonies soon for the edible gardens and they 're which will be picking it out just probably slightly over but we 're really keen to use it yeah yeah no but it is remarkable that it was for the workers and not and but because of course their house burned down just like so many wooden houses here does it burn down the got-damn has been staged as well the coronation Hall this is a point of contention the board coronation halls drove into the side of it and leave the engine running in it it 's got fire damage it looks much better than this if you see it on from the side of the park we 're at where it resides coronation Hall is heritage and last May our board asked for advice following a submission on the use of the hall from the rigaton players who have been homeless for six years they and other groups just for instance the toy library a local to a library and the Carew club that had used the hall before and other groups have expressed interest in the coronation hall but as a result of the written players coming to see us after their travails we asked staff for comment about the use of the fall because the board was very keen to see it being reused for the people for the benefit of the community particularly given the number of groups that we know in our area who are homeless they are joined by Eddington net at the moment as well and when we we had we didn 't even respond the three heritage buildings and our Ward including and coronation wall into the use of it with five weeks for community groups and other groups to come up with submissions on it and we look forward to some pod bye dears from the community but we wish that we had had some advice on how to what we could do with this haul to make it a positive contribution to the community before the next one this is Manuka cottages proposed site foreman Manuka cottage manuka cottage has been waiting for seven years for their new building they used to be in Dickens Street they 've had several shifts since then they are now in st. Mary 's Church where the pancake celebration was being held and they look forward very much to having their own building and its proposed to put their building in and eddington on the park on I 've forgotten the stream yes yeah yeah no they Cornelius O 'Connor reserved him in Harmon Street which is right next door to a large number of community housing so we look forward to seeing them there at out pretender and the price of the money that we had left after all this time was not a lot and we 've got two tenders that come in in the funding so we 're thrilled we are at soo thrilled and we look forward to being on site in a year 's time so that we manuka cottage who have been a substantial influence in the Eddington community can get going properly again in their own home I heard that work that 's right but his connection with the council housing behind Oh absolutely this is thank you I 'm the emergency preparedness plan this is the most boring subject in the world sometimes and the sprayed neighborhood Network just did it they pinched it off Brighton they pinched it off the Brighton community and they attributed to the Brighton community but they refined it more and I showed it to other organisations who are thinking of pinching atop the sprayed community and it 's a preparedness plan for the household that you would actually read and I just wanted to show it to you because if it 's brief and it 's affordable with what you can take out and I really wanted people to see that because how many of us read civil defense plans that we think may can be workable and this one is and the spray-tanned neighborhood Network also as well as this in receipt of the Red Cross money they 've also bought a large barbecue and a gazebo already and they 've got plans for the future on the same house that they will use which is for you or a house a little about Barrington they are steaming ahead where and being extremely clever and smart with the money that they got from the way across and I 'm I just I just think they 're an exemplar of what a neighborhood can do they 're also behind the the nagging of us for the right-hand tune of the Barrington mall which we hope will come about in this coming year it 's only been about five years waiting or longer than there but no this is a great example of people he wants a copy we 're glad to give the spreadin Hood neighborhood Network and Brighton okay well you do want to talk about sorry ah the road the drainage team came to us with an imaginative proposal which is going to go in Nick 's daughter Linden Grove along Phillips Road and its landscape in proposed retention basin it 's designed to purify the water to provide a floodplain again for down river on the hiss cut and it 's got and we discussed with great trust between the two parties the plantings that they 've proposed to put in to around the small lakes that they 're developing including no noble and native noble trees which we are really thrilled about the edingtons spend speed limits around to screen I really want to talk about this we proposed a 30 this is the part a isn 't it so much they would that way again thank you so it 'll gardens lots of people who we 've asked who were far too humble basically they think Nick gardens aren 't good enough to go into it and they 're gonna wait till next year so I 'm later of people 's projects and things like that but yeah like I said it 'll be in the old stone house great well thank you very much indeed for that roundup of all that 's going on in your part of the city was obviously a lot that 's right so that leaves time for a couple of questions if there are questions for not a question but a quick coming I think the board the board 's report is a good example of the board being fully engaged with this community and the community responding and I think the sprayed and Paul is as an extending example in like less than a million dollars you know there 's a challenge for other other awards and boards really to see how in fact we might be to reduce the cost of it some important Italy yeah very good all right and Duke and do pass on our congratulations to the Wizards of Ward Street for their success in the pancake okay so we 've got a resolution in front of us to receive the reports Phil you 're happy favor against that carried and _"

question for the benefit of staff placing yet document particular purposely point of consultation y-squared supported by the community particularly in thanks Peninsula leaders and Harper say so but you 're putting a mention here have a minor amendment all right for a final worship we 're about what 's the difference between those two versions right basically the changes will the text I understand it will be the same will be changed like obviously it won 't say draft at the front and it 's currently receiving what you call a graphic makeover by night after night ah whose graphic designers which will change the symbolism and the appearance of the document the text approved and then we just make it look thank you any further questions all right so we have a recommendation in front of us from the bank spoon sealer community board do I have a mover for that is there any debate on the matter Jonnie I just want to acknowledge the huge amount of work that 's gone into this and I really love the fact that this has been a real a community-led process with support of the council staff and others so um it 's a really amazing document and I 'm very supportive of it I just I 'm a little bit worried about the extra funding that it 's gonna be requested and particularly in the report where references the fact that this short-term and priority actions that aren 't currently funded and I think it 's incumbent on us as a city that if we 're going to of these documents we ensure that the priority actions and the short term actions can actually be achieved because we 've got lots of nice glossy documents that sit on our bookshelves but sometimes the actions don 't don 't always get delivered and I think that 's a real shame because so much good work has gone into the producing this document and this our catchment plan so I just really wanted to that water quality is a major issue for us as a city and a region and as a country actually and we should we should really learn from these excellent ways of working with people and bringing people together and focus on improving our water quality as much as possible which I think this document is a great start towards doing so thank you to everyone involved I 'm very happy to support this I hope that there 's no priority actions or short-term actions that don 't get delivered because of lack of resources thanks Andrew I just really want to congratulate all those have been involved on what a great collaborative approach this has been and they 're going going back a long time just soon after you earthquakes we did that little turn port recovery plan and this is not just a bench waiting and I think it 's particularly impressive that you know with all the partners that you reached this stage clearly as Yanni 's indicated there 's a lot of work to do and there is funding in the long term plan and that that the concepts of improving the water quality the whole seed and sedimentation issues and the erosion around the coasts all of that you 've really put forward about a fundamental document as a way to cleaning up air harvest and we certainly appreciate that thank you this plan and the steps that led to it a really example a excellent example of a partnership project we 've worked very closely together through both the working group and the partners governance group with colleagues at Environment Canterbury we 've worked closely with nitr who we 've worked very closely with net effect and also with LPC Littleton port in fact I 'd like to take the opportunity to thank you for the leadership that you have shown in this space the result is is an excellent plan and you 've done an excellent job of bringing people together for some really quality conversations and I think that 's evident in the quality that we see in the resulting plan so thank you I know this is an area and it 's clear from the presentation this morning it 's an time and it 's great that this plan has been able to be a vehicle for those passions to land in something that I really hope will be a document that 'll have currency for many years so the result is an excellent document a plan that we hope will guide many improvements to both the ecological and the cultural health of Fakher upper lyttelton harbour for many years to come I certainly acknowledge my colleague councilor yo Hansen 's comments regarding funding and of course one thing we 're always nervous of is a plan that may be excellent a plan that may well be proved well presented but something that isn 't deliverable or delivered and that just gathers dust on a shelf for years and is largely forgotten about I 'm absolutely determined that this will not be one of those plans I know there 's energy in the partners and in the community to deliver some of the priority projects there are people in the community that are ready to start work on some of these projects pretty much immediately so whilst I acknowledge the concerns 't present any concern to me at all I know there 's energy in the community for that in terms of funding the tables with the action points at the back of the document with the actions at the back of the documents contain a large number of projects where there 's already a significant council contribution to projects which are well aligned with those actions 48 million dollars for the lyttelton harbour sewerage scheme wastewater scheme the biodiversity fund that was confirmed in the recent annual plan and also work that 's already going on on our banks peninsula roading Network which will lead to a reduction in sedimentation flowing in to factor out though so we have some significant work streams that are very well aligned with the actions in this document so I 'm pleased to referred positive comments from council colleagues this morning I know there 's energy in the community I look forward to the formal launch of the document on the seventh which I 'll be attending and I would invite any colleagues to attend along with me will be great to see some seeing the delivery of the actions that are signaled in this document to see improvements in the ecological and cultural health of lyttelton harbour so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried but did you want to just formally record our thanks just acknowledged maybe that would be appropriate actually if we can just add a note there formally recording our thanks to Yvette couch as the chair and the members of the Joint Working Group and the partners governance group and to staff evolved yet just staff of each of the organization 's concerned good point temp yeah if we just put that as a note _"

cleared and now we move to the public participation section of the meeting this is where members of the public have five minutes where they may address the council and I 'd like to start the public participation this morning by inviting Glenn Harris Jill Stevens and Akira l 'affaire of Christchurch pride to speak to us regarding the upcoming Pride Festival so if you 'd like to come up to the table place so welcome thank you for joining us this morning you have five minutes to make your presentation to council thank you very much Stevens I am the current chairperson of the Christchurch pride committee I just wanted to come along in speech you about the events we 'll be having in March from the 15 to the 25th to make our community feel inclusive I wanted to speak a little bit about cry-cry such pride it 's been around to rebuild the fragmented community since the Crushers earthquakes there 's H people within our community we are all volunteers we all work full-time some of us have children and we all have other commitments that and for that time as well as part of Christchurch pride we like to bring diversity within the city so we aim to inspire we like to educate and celebrate and revitalize the diversity that sometime is making with in Christchurch so over the 50s to the 25th of March we will be celebrating 11 days worth of pride within Christchurch we have 32 events over that time and Christchurch pride run a few of them and we put a few of the other events out to different community groups so we act as an umbrella to bring people and so that a person can look upon Christchurch pride and see that there is events that cover all different aspects of life we have church groups we have dog walking groups yoga and we do also have parties but I want to specifically speak to you about three different events today that will be is the Art Show this year we 'll be holding it in a gallery in Christchurch and it 's a time for well-known New Zealand artists along with amateur artists to showcase their work and have the opportunity to sell some work to benefit the community and we also have our opening speeches at this time and we would like to invite any of the council meters that would like to attend there feel free to pop along a second event is a bingo event where we will be specifically fundraising for a local Christchurch group called kindred they are a very small group which supports the trans trans youth community within Christchurch so this is children younger than 14 years of age and their families people struggling with sexuality we 're just not quite sure where they fit within the world often these children like slip through the loopholes because there isn 't a lot of support out there and to our knowledge there 's not anything offered from like medical experience we 're going to be holding a fundraising event who specifically fundraise for those people so the well the third event I wanted to speak about was a movie viewing by an artist called Welby and he is a New Zealand filmmaker and he has made a short film called espero it 's a beautiful story about a boy who likes to build strength and stand up to the bullies within a school I work super excited to be having this this year at the Philip Carter family auditorium at the Christchurch art gallery so what we tried to do is bring sponsors together and bring the community together so we can offer events like this for families to come along to for a small price so it 's just a gold coin donation we this year have even got an event North Canterbury I think it 's important there crushers try and bring a lot of people from the outskirts into the area we know a lot of people travel from the west coast and from now Center events they do have a small price group and Dunedin based the week after hours but I know Christchurch has a strong following and we like to bring the council looking for support we not understand the councillor is a very diverse place to work and we would like to show that the crucial city councillors behind us as a community group we have approached some of some places with encroach used to light up for Christchurch pride and we 're having the Issac Theatre oil and rainbows we 're also having the Christchurch casino and just recently on board as the International Airport so they later nice big rainbow right along the International Airport for us so that we can through support and one of the main reasons we 'll come to council us today is we would like you to raise a rainbow flag and support for Christchurch bright and also to show that it 's important to you to you into the community that everyone feels inclusive especially in Christchurch with it being so fragmented and spread out so the request is specifically whether we would be happy to fly the rainbow flag from this building as part of your Pride Festival what are the dates the festival runs from he 's something so flying so it 's something I should ask the chief executive about so Carlene we can make those arrangements thank you so you 're writing the things that the this organization is a very has a great deal of diversity and council support that would be supportive of flying effect we need a very large flag though so if you can work with our team here around the the suitable size and flag and supplying a flag then it would be great to see that happen as part of that Pride Festival so thank you very much indeed for coming along with the presentation this morning and great to to hear what 's going on and it 'll be great to see the flag flying from the building thank you so I 'd now like to call Robert Huffman to the table and Robert if you 'd like to come forward please now the public participation part of the meeting provides for the opportunity to speak for up to five minutes on any subject I have the public participation segments of the meeting allows for a member of the public to minutes on any subject I have a transcript of what 's intended to be said and I 'd like to mr. Luffman draw your attention to our standing order 11.2 the chairperson has the discretion to decline to hear a speaker or to terminate a presentation at any time where and there are a number of sections to that but a couple of bullet points that having read the transcript may be relevant to what you are perhaps intending saying to us the speaker is criticizing elected members or staff the speaker has been repetitious disrespectful or offensive and if we get to a point where that 's happening within this presentation I will have no hesitation in stopping the presentation so I just wanted to give you that guidance to avoid any embarrassment as we proceed and you have five minutes now to address the limit this could be just five minutes is the limit but if we can reset the clock now at five minutes more slots between the solvent mr. la mayor 's office myself relayed the earthquake issues and which I copied to councils projects counselors I felt the need to provide these support copies is that when I originally sent the emails I immediately receive failure notice yeah yeah for each of the professor 's City Council councillors I 'm not quite sure what is going on I find it extremely frustrating that I have unable to communicate with the elected representatives of Christchurch I do not know who or what is behind this obstruction of communication but I strongly feel that it is unfair I guess I need to tell you why I 'm making this effort to communicate when there are powerful forces doing their damnedest to block my efforts I was up in Golden Bay at the taco library when I read a copy in the press with an article mentioning that well no barrister had made a comment that those responsible for the collapse the CTV tested in a court of law against him to date there has been no testing of criminal charges against those perceived to be responsible for the collapse of CTV I immediately knew who they were talking about after the first week of the Royal Commission session of the Royal Commission I was able to watch each and every witness you have testimony except for those who had their testify read out at the hearing by a lawyer and who did not show up for the Royal Commission in person Alan Ray was put on the way to stand four times if you wish you could check it out as there are video types of the testimony of all the witnesses Tereza I attended the Royal Commission sessions is that I wanted to find out what had happened and why in relation to the collapse of the CTV and all the circumstances leading to the tragedy that occurred I wanted to understand what had happened I took the opportunity to speak with many of the witnesses during the breaks I referred to my conversations with dr. Priestley a former lecturer in structural engineering at the University of Canterbury and William Holmes from San Francisco who was the peer reviewer on the Royal Commission in one of my three emails on 24th January this year Tamara del Zhu I also had a number of god conversations with structural engineering professor there and a former lecturer in structural engineering at the University of Canterbury he knows John hare from Holmes consulting very well his table manners bomb lives in Christchurch certainly certainly did at a time of the rock emission each of these people mentioned the fact that they were astounded at the so called inspections of the CTV or not connected conducted by structural engineers and most took less than 20 30 minutes to complete John Mathers testimony was particularly in a student check it out the videotapes should be still be available or it may even be somewhere online I noticed that some of the lawyers at Royal Commission did not appreciate Professor manners candor at all I did anyway to cut to the chase I need to tell you my motivation for wanting to communicate with you counsel it is my view that is patently unfair to have Alan ray and a party sure there were serious deficiencies in the wire mesh connection on the North Course sheer wall to the main envelope of the building there is no question about that but both of genuine apologies how could they not be contrite about that when those place the platters which provided for quote no restriction on use or occupancy of the CTV building have not received so much as a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket it is not fair it is that simple no good copay was first witness to testify at the Royal Commission she worked as a counselor and registered services on top floor of CTV and was there as class reactively she survived the collapse with only minor bruising lacerations her testimony was quite grippy hearings in that testimony she detailed the efforts that she her colleagues made to find out if the CTV bone had been inspected after the 2010 quakes she her colleagues were assured much on truth building manager of the CTV that it had no good and her colleagues were not aware of the Sham procedure that was effectively in place at that time paragraph 4 below details failure of the Russians officers to even fall council policy in relation to the rapid level two inspections I strongly believe no good company would the point at which I need to stop the presentation that 's the wording I was hoping you weren 't going to be using this morning I will invoke Clause 11 point 2 of our Standing Orders and ask that the presentations cease at this point so thank you very much indeed for joining us you 're aware of substantial correspondence between yourself from the mayor 's office on this matter the mayor is dealing with the quake families and will continue to do so the mayor is advised that your statement today may not assist in that process but the her conversations with the quake families will continue so thank you for sharing what you 've shared this morning but we we cannot allow and those sort of comments around staff in this chamber thank you _"

table and you have ten minutes this morning two addresses about some of the facts and management plan cohort um at airport owatta Milkha call a dog port Des Moines up caught Iraqi put up timber I corryvic couch Lewis a home now quit andrew tuna ten our koto councillors I 'd like to introduce to you from my right I have Andrew Scott from up or nodding fakira to my left Pam Richardson representing the Banks Peninsula zone committee and the community board and behind me over to the right is Calvin Macmillan Christchurch City Council staff kyouda and thank you for the opportunity to address you today on the dope or lyttelton harbour catchment plan is the chairperson for the partners governess we are asking Christchurch City Council approving the catchment plan for publication could I next slide please just some background the Luton catchment plan came about through the Luton port Council and Environment Canterbury te Runanga or NATO and long-term pork company and rocky to work together to create a catchment plan that is based on the philosophy of kita kita and to restore the ecological and cultural health of dope or at the time also when those partners did come together an MoU was in signed with those partners for a commitment to a three-year period ending in 2018 plus additional resourcing we 're required to develop the catchment plan and for its initial implementation slide 3 please these notes briefed counselors on the proposed publication for that dope or catchment management plan or it 's now known name as order healthy harbour QT keto a delegate I 'm a delegate for each of the partners once you have agreed to sign off the sketch my plan for publication will sign the catchment management plan at a launch event on the 7th of March 2018 at rocky and we hope that the councillors are able to attend that event partners have been approved for the plan for publication have been Environment Canterbury rocky tier in anger or night aho who happened who have adopted and approved this plan to go forward to Council next slide please the outline of the catchment plan because the commissioners at the time of the port recovery plan had given a clear direction in terms of Maha chi and kita kita as this slide is showing you that the one thing that rocky was really concerned about at the time was a long with the community within dope or was the health of the harbor and looking at restoring the mo hangar Kai and may I just say that when we talk my hangar hide the community values along with the values from tapa when a leaf icky are similar we are all the same when we talk making a kite and that is the main message that is coming through in this plan so the kaupapa for the plan coming true looking at the goals we wanted abundant healthy and connected making a kite we want to be connected to that Kai everybody wants to go down into that Harbor and to be able to fish and to be able to feed their information as you can see over to my right is that we 've got science advice being engaged with the community and we sought advice from rocky without Toyota yaki from there then looking at key taquito we then looked at aspirational future state of the Harbor what we wanted the harbor to look like this document is actually an aspirational plan it is not a regulatory plan it is an aspirational plan that works on the positive in terms of what this community wants to be able to achieve in the future and ongoing generations it looked at key focus areas immediate which came from the science group and from tonetti acting in the community that were preventing now signal that 's a negative but they were preventing us from being able to achieve our goals and that was sedimentation emotion and pollution looking at the biodiversity of for the terrestrial and the marine and then from that 's looking again from kita kita from the crater rim down to the middle of the harbor we then did the bands that came on down and we looked in there look like with our forested areas right into the middle of the harbor from there within to the actions and terms of the programs that we were looking at that would actually enable us to deliver more importantly in the urban areas where people live in Middleton will be able to see where they sit in those bends and will start to plant native trees and will start to encourage that Buddha life second next slide please so one of them so then the benefits of this plan the plan will will be implemented by the partners so yourselves as a partner and other organizations in the community to develop programs of work and in programs for 2018 and beyond to work towards achieving the cope up or the purpose of the plan it 's it 's a way forward for the entire Harbor community to ensure that ecological and cultural health of akkad opal are restored for future generations the key thing here is that normally that the agencies would have pilot programs or they would have a main program that they would support this is about giving it a lot of really good community work that is happening within doe pool we recognized that we acknowledged it and we encourage it to move forward that also encourages to bring on new projects to enable that Harper to be able to get the mo deed back into it so that we as a full community are able to enjoy that that enjoyed the harbor next slide please the implementation of the plan so we have so the plan is developed I have shown you quickly and briefly how we develop that aspirational plan we are now at that stage of implementation once you have signed off when we have done the launch on the 7th of March we then need to be able to implement it we need to hand it back to the community and you as a partner need to be able to oversee there and encourage and support there so with their approval the management plan for publication we will move into that strategic development stage into implementation the role of the partners in the long term leadership for the implementation of the catchment plan is are all working to look at what that model might look like this is a new model we are moving into something different we 're partners that actually giving back into the community the most significant risk though has been must-watch risk all the way through and we have had that right alongside us the governor 's looking at those risks is that looking at the project is around the implementation of the plan and particulars securing additional funding to commence more projects in the third stage the partners MOU also supported looking at the funding of projects going on out to 2021 and this is where the importance of Christchurch City Council as a partner comes in you have got the waste water project I 've millions of dollars that are going into there that now removing that out of a 'dope or you have the stormwater project that has come in in the small communities that is critical that is your contribution as a partner that you are contributing to this plan that is the beginning that is what we need we need you as a partner within is already committed in your long term plan next slide please the significance of engagement the partners working group undertook significant consultation the result from this consultation been feedback received on the draft version of the plan was extremely supportive and with the only minor changes sought the local community and stakeholders are eager to move on from the development stage until its implementation we have the support and we are wanting you to be able to sign off this document for publication so that it may I also add that once it does go out to public confirm out for publication the one thing that has been noted about the spleen is that it will more likely be seen nationally because of the change that is there of the cope up amaldi thing that is right across this plan it 's one of the firsts that has actually been written in such an aspirational plan that is driven by the community next slide please so I 'd like to be able to thank you for your ongoing support and commitment as a partner and we hope that you will off any questions please survey thank you very much indeed for the presentation a very concise presentation around obviously what 's a large and detailed document we have in front so we 'll move to questions in just a moment we have in front of us a recommendation from the bank 's peninsular community board Pam did you want to make any comment alongside and what Yvette has already told us about this item this morning environment came to be saying it was a new way of doing things so I think we need to be looking at yes this is going to be a change maker and to make a change making work we all have to get them behind it so I mean the board is totally supportive of aspirational plan we must actually recognize that things cannot be all done tomorrow but yes it is over a time frame and that we as members of that community have to change how we look at things how we deal with things and we right thank you very much now I will allow a couple of questions for Evert about the difference between those two versions before consultation in the after consultation where about we consider from the attachment all right so that 's in our own council paper that Jimmy might be a question better put to our staff than to a vet who 's come here with the deputation this morning so if you want to hold that as a question for staff that will be appropriate are there any further questions for a vet all right Yvette and the team thank you very much indeed for for joining us this morning and for the presentation what I 'd now like to do is to invite staff to the table so if you 'd like to take a seat in the public gallery that would be great and I 'd now like to invite staff to the table _"

apologies but appears that everyone is here decorations of interests I haven 't_''_151.659 received any no public participation has been advised presentation of petitions no presentation or petitions so I 'd like to move the resolution to include the supplementary report on the public excluded agenda number 19 just evened up that Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and I will ask that somebody move that the council and all our moves at the council minutes I confirmed and received SP the resolution I have a seconder for that Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye first place they know that 's carried so we move on to item number nine amendments to delegations for new vitals and councillor Kadir could I ask you as the chair of the infrastructure transport Environment Committee to introduce the item and to the council these delegations were signed off at the end of last year and the they come into a people first of March if you choose for briefed on this at the end of January they have information so that we 've put the additional resolution which we should have done at the meeting in the in long discussion about this and all agreed that there was the won 't best way for you to clarify this that because we 're also running a parallel program of reviewing the commutable delegations there is an opportunity via should they want delegation back for these bylaws that there 's an opportunity here however the staff have explained to us also that these delegations that we 've better sitting within a staff level and the transport one is a temporary one and their nature of there is that there wouldn 't be time for their decision to go through community meeting so the committee was one opposed but at least the committee and we thought this was the right thing to do okay so you 'd like to and moved it Sikandar you I was the one that 's leading voice it ite on this one and I don 't believe that the process has been good enough we 're looking at having a partnership with community boards and empowering our community boards I can understand the rationale behind this but we haven 't gone through a process where we 've discussed this with our community boards these vitals have passed in November last year giving us ample time to talk to the community aborts about these changes and have their agreement and I 'll be voting against them okay Jonnie can we just find out when the community board I 'm sorry did you have questions yeah yeah oh I just moved a debate so I know there 's no way sorry I well I wanted to move that we put a resolution and around the community board delegations and a time frame for when that will be done because I think for me I 'm going to struggle to support this without a really clear indication that there 's a process underway to review those community wood delegations and it on everything on Tuesday so I think we can establish timeframes Dean well except we 've been asked their progress today so what 's wrong with putting a date and getting the commute with delegations back in front of Council well I 'm not sure what the time frame is well let 's let 's just put this on hold for a minute can you find out what the time frame is for bringing a vector Council move on well I don 't either but this is changing delegations to community boards and taking some away without anything coming in front of the community boards it 's totally relevant to three and giving three new ones but it 's actually to change that should it be the fact that you 've got number one in there now it makes Yanni 's point directly relevant it just asks for a time frame about to happen another three years to do it then I 'm not going to support this today if it 's going to be you but I could ask them there that notes the current work work program on the before the 30th of June so it 's before the LTP takes effect and it if necessary the relegations relation to the bylaws and this report can be revisited as part of this work so that 's the it is expected that the delegations will be fully completed by the time the new LTP takes a few all right so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and that 's certificate of thinking thank you the next item is inaccessible city current state and again I 'll hand over to you Pauline thank you so this is about it 's not actually about detail of any of the projects it 's just about the timing so that we can bring these works particularly around High Street forward so that they will align with any development that 's happening there and the streets will not need to be dug up again there is a mention of the tree and prochik there there 's no detail about their teamwork at the moment but whatever happens through the atrium goes this part of the AAC budget the trim is a different budget and the money is in the budget the AAC just relates to the renewal works in High Street these the issue of the two weighing of core and Salisbury to defer that and just do the piece along Gilmour to read for the opening of the town hall if we were to proceed with the two weighing that would be much much later than these a whole it 's a whole complication to the works around Victoria Street and all the intersections so there would be quite a long delay than that and the other thing to note the Metheny case speed limit to go out for an engagement on Essex Street extending its consultation and the engagement on Victoria Street to recommence the tour strip has already been consulted on and I think there was a really good process through the 30 committee of Henkels 2016 and there was really good engagement on there I think people are pretty happy with where we 've got to the thing is with Victoria Street it 's failing the surface needs we are the took it up and replace it as it is we 'll proceed and engage with the people in perhaps bring some improvements in there and one of the additions to the recommendation was that we look at options to connect to the Rapanui share rock cycle way to the cdk central city sewing because this had been overlooked so I 'm happy to make these recommendations as well thank you type a seconder for it Mike Davidson is there any discussion questions questions I 'm just trying to understand why we 're doing this now I hit all the consultation on the LTP and it does seem a bit odd that we would change timing until we 've had that community feedback I think the idea through the draft or the resolutions before yours to go out and get some feedback from the community so potentially you can amend the LTP for instance to bring forward high street redevelopment by another year so that 's the idea of going out before the LTP is approved by council sorry we 've just approached the draft LTP yesterday mm-hmm changes consistent with what 's in this report said that the report itself so last year at council drone annual plan Council agreed to bring forward the redevelopment of the tram at high street and as councillor Cottard noted that 's not an AAC project there is a separate line item within the LTP so what this sought to do was align the adjacent streetscape works with the brought forward tram redevelopment now there is potential to bring that forward both of those 40 years another year but we before doing that we need to engage with the property owners along there and the operator of the trend to find out particularly in relation to when the hoardings are going to be removed if it 's possible to do that redevelopment and the next phone interview that is the reason for the reason two other questions one is that part of Victoria Street comes under into the local community board and I don 't think this reports been to the local community board is there a reason what 's the process around that so that resolution in front of you that so it 's not seeking to reinitiate it the money is currently in the 15 to 25 LTP but that would be carried forward into the 18 to 28 LTP because we 're not going to deliver the works this financial year so as part of that process and and developing that report Vittoria Street we would engage with the community board so do you think it would be useful under 0.3 to have to actually make reference to a report go into the community board would be inherent in whatever we do but and just the final question is we 've got some of the costs associated with the AAC just seem horrific like Herefords straight to a million dollars for two blocks what what ability do we have to a look at the entire accessible city program and actually save the benefits and what we thought would happen have happened and until look at reducing the scope and in terms of saving some money given our financial pressures because we still seem to be spending a huge amount of money for very short distances in a city that since it was launched so that there 's a couple of things the AAC as a chapter of the Christchurch central plan and that store has statutory wait under the Greater Christchurch regeneration act I think that the plan itself still his legal status so reviewing that as something which is a a wider question in terms of the program of works themselves the first 72 million dollars of that was heavily funded by the crown so that both came from Sierra and New Zealand Transport Agency and I think the first suite of projects where circa 60 65 percent funded by the crown so and I think that was very positive for this organization to receive their degree of funding for those initial projects I think that the costs associated with the projects are simply dependent on the quality of the work that has done and certainly some of that the builds that are out there at the moment are of a reasonably high quality and that 's got a direct bearing on what costs there are thee there 's also underground structure and other things associated with of water what we need to do to make the street look and in accordance with what some visitors within the the regeneration plan and what stood out within the energy store city chapter like to speculate on my own debate any other questions um Dion been clean um what is what what is the TP 30 kilometre exactly so TP was a breviary before transport project so everything with TP in front of us simply stands for transport project and the 30k is simply the slow zone within the core of the central city so that 's the suite of projects that you 'll see where once you enter into that slow core it tells you as the driver of the vehicle that you 're entering into a 30 K zone and their costs three million dollars to do well that 's the budget and some of which has been done on some of its ongoing you would have seen some of those been rolled out throughout the city but there 's signage this treatment there 's build outs this various other things that are appearing within the TP to Richard mr. Peebles about his development at all yes so so you would already know when he 's looking to plan to take away there because you just sit before they use you you this is effectively giving you resolution to go out and speak to them something what what is this actually there 's other people ready dominated by the sounds of it so what does this actually asking us to do so he 's one of the developers which there are long high street there 's other developers that we 'd need to speak to as well and we 'd need to speak to the operator of the tram it was easily been a misunderstanding about the two projects because one and this paper relates to the AAC project which is the street treatments on the area where the tram tracks would go the tram tracks are not part of AAC so that it 's a separate project but I felt when I read about this elsewhere that it was it seemed to misunderstand the two projects and that we 're actually trying to help align the don 't want to dig up the street twice so if you lay that tram tracks if we don 't want to come along and do the streetscape works at a later date that 's what the sort to do was bring forward the AAC component of the works for my street to align with what was proposed for the tram but there is a possibility of bringing there both of those projects forward even further but that will be on some of that engagement which was just discussed and then the quit that was actually the next question I had was how are you going to do that because obviously the budgets are in financial year 19 at this stage how are we going to bring the budget forward is it going to be an LTP conversation or is it something else that we 're missing so that wouldn 't be as part of a staff submission to the LTP or through so that the money is programmed so there 's no new money as simply a matter of changing which year we can deliver it on so that lesser amount it 's simply a matter of a transaction that goes into the LTP disabled we can deliver in 1919 as opposed to 1920 that would be preferable but I think it 's incumbent upon us to make sure that we discuss that not just with one person but with other people who also have interests along there and find out what their development ambitions might be we also have a couple of heritage buildings which are currently propped along there have been nearly other heritage for science have been that way for obviously a long long period of time the issues are particularly with one of them at very fixed and complex and so before we get and to do our works some of those hoardings all the hoardings will need to come down yeah is that on the other part of the high street yes so it 's not the actual yes but you wouldn 't really want to think of high street and isolation is an train wreck nothing changes there as the the other question is I mean the other question I have here is intersection at choom Street while we 're actually doing this work or is it still going to be the 21 traffic lights industry I 'm not just thinking that no I 'm actually I 'm actually being deeply serious it 's one of the most ridiculous intersections in the city actually not the most ridiculous one I 've ever seen but it 's good getting unable to answer your question I think you browser a good point because there are travel the Train and where it goes and the intersection if we are to take the tram up through the air and up to the top end of the high street pass are the Duncans Bluemont absolution and how it operates there 's going to be pretty fundamental to what 's proposed as part of this program well Aaron I 'll take the traffic light please clean thank you my question just over there if you like their kind of display of the screen back display of the costs Richard so do we always show the breakdown between ground and Council in their tables I mean this one obviously looks over you use these words gold plating does does that include the gross cost of goods right so so with the first suite of projects this minute two million we got twenty sim was funded by the crown and then okay eighteen by NZ tae-young and we funded the remaining twenty seven million so suka 63% was funded by the crown sixty-three so for the second phase of projects we went through a business case process which is a real environment of New Zealand Transport Agency for any funding of the project so for a million dollars they have endorsed our business program business case for accessible City yeah but but that always comes with a caveat that you know any new projects they 'll be looking at and seeing what the Transport benefits cuz they 're a transport agency so you know some things they fund more than others yeah and as we were discussing earlier when it leads to transport efficiencies people get in from a to be quicker that 's something that that were keenly interested in and so that 's the type of thing that they it do we always consistently just show the council component or does it tend to be both in our reports just counsel okay the other question red thank you a couple of questions is so Victoria Street you 've got you 've still got in here at five and a half million I thought that had been deferred that 's that five and a half million is it is in the she 's budget under the in your plan this year we 're not spending it this year oh no no so would nature so it would be carried forward and that is going to go back so the idea is to prepare report before the organization to consider while we haven 't prepared that I think it but should have some options to it so it needs to be an options assessment so that would be you might look it up there 's councillor Cotter mentioned there 's certainly some issues on Victoria Street with the quality of the asset so you might look at just a straight renewal to have a like-for-like replacement of what 's here at costs of that being comparison with doing something which is what 's proposed through IFC and you know how long would that take as well to deliver because the might be similar time frames to what 's proposed as part of this project so that 's that 's the idea as to bring something back to all that with a range of options good okay that 's good and on the I mean the general cost me is there 's Yanni and deal changer this kind of gold plate this kind of coffee and croissant there 's bread and butter and maybe a kind of and crackers this is ya rasol expenditure now in next week 's finance committee were having a report back on one of the AAC projects which was that he referred matched it to the dress piece which was budgeted at 2.4 million came in at 900 thousand and we can examine why that happened something you know some of these costs do need to be there is a sense that stuff 's being over engineered more than it needs to be and I think we I hope that is happening through this committee just see what happens next week but I think you know we 've had it with some of our pedestrian crossings and whatever some of the quotes we get and then some of the final prices coming way low so it worries me if we 're over budgeting for a lot of this stuff then renewals do full street renewals are expensive but in terms of the here for the street redevelopment the reason why they 're one of the reasons why came and lower than the originally anticipated costs later some of the work was actually done by attacker so we don 't have to do a full suite of works associates did they not charge us for the budget when we originally budgeted for numerous years ago we assumed that we 'd have to do that work we didn 't so it 's the budget cuts but in actual fact the only bit that they were that we were legally liable for any way was the 122 meters well year was the it was from east of the East frame lead masks we 're right yeah and we were to tidy up that corner as well yeah and we got them to do it but I thought we paid for it there were some other benefits as well contractors and continuation groups but that that 's all networking I shall be very interested to read that report particularly in town we also upgrade the infrastructure and they have done a huge amount of upgrade particularly in the storm water networks as part of Manchester Street and so we were able to tag on the end of that as well and that 's one of the issues that we 've got with the lights of he referred streets at Victoria Street I think there 's another one that the infrastructure what you see is broken but also what 's under the ground I think people were a bit sad to see Orion digging straight back into the brand new pavement straight after that work had been completed which was exactly what we 're trying to avoid by getting them to do it all at the same time just paint certainly be 's not I understand it 's not just as simple is you know people think but anyway I 'm you know yeah the the yeah but anyway that there are treatments that have been applied to the roads as well as build outs and things like that that actually say to people you know I remember when we first had because remember I mean it wasn 't us to put the 30k zone on this on the central city it was it was central government that I mean I 'll send you round the order and council if you like so I 'm by Gerry Brownlee and yeah it 's at this week but the point is is that you know at the time I said why don 't we have just large signs just saying you 're entering a 30 K area and then so there 's no question that every intersection and at the point that you 're going on that you 're entering it well it 's starting to look like that now and it wasn 't for a long time anyway yeah Dion get a question _''_1731.94 in the original report but it 's it 's up here for a recommendation here how was that mess you mentioned it was that the committee had put there done it so no but from the original committee it wasn 't there yes and you mentioned that it had been missed off I mean I just want to know how it was overlooked or whatever the word you use but I just want to know how that got overlooked well I don 't think that that it 's the staff that over looked at it was the committee considered us and felt that it was absent yes so the command is how the committee voice I mean if you 're sitting around a committee table you 're working it through with staff okay and somebody raises the the options for connecting the cycleway to the 30 k central city 's own well it seems a perfectly valid addition I don 't_''_1783.75 I don 't think it is suggested in anyone 's not paying all of the roads and we were doing all the other cycle ways and this seemed to asked us to investigate options for it so there was an AAC just doesn 't cover every single Road within the for revenues no it doesn 't it 's generally in really here is our D we 're making a paper like this today around where AAC is ed I just don 't want to hear that we 've got to do any more anomalies so we actually the question is hey I ask the question I ask are we gonna hear of any more anomalies so that we end up having to pay for more work this is requesting staff investigating options for connecting a cycleway it 's been picked up by the committee is an issue that wasn 't identified and they say that so it 's all I think I will forget that AAC is a chapter of the Central City recovery plan young we asked specifically the time if there were any other side boys any word thank you that 's the answer I was looking for thank you so what 's that yeah this is the only one that was most great that was all 't just clarified um get clarity is this the Wooster Street connection is that the piece of road that we 're talking about the one that comes in is that the one that comes in Worcester straight yeah so I think it may be quite useful to actually identify the street that 's that 's looking clean looked at okay so it just needs to grab an amazing stuff or a weird it 's where you connect unto the foodie Kay so they 're not know if you need to do you speak but it 's a second seriously bringing the options back to the kamati a right I don 't think it matters right now that we specifically identify which streets might be involved so I 'll Jamie questions just just on one day and it 's I 'm cool they actually might be able to help me out with that one what what 's the point of of having one and they 're really because obviously the issues that are covered pretty a pretty basic the 30 K 's on the street make sense with a school and that you can 't go to 31 okay is there any way probably in the other ones Agena belts and braces like the high street and it 's essentially just doing work to coincide with developments to really back it 's a silly program when there are so many question marks over particularly what 's you know all the balls are up in the air with Victoria Street and also a number of the ones on the amended program that you 've got here which are reasonably comprehensive like Manchester to Cambridge of here if it 's Street and the Wooster Street one with Montreal tallest and there 's a couple of others there it 's hard to from where I 'm sitting anyway to say yep sign off there I mean does accessible sitting when we don 't know what that stuff looks like we know what the Victoria Street ones look like and it ended up being quite controversial of shelved earth but then just say yes everything else looks good without seeing what they look like feels counterintuitive or is that not what that 's saying at that 's what it 's seeking as it doesn 't get into the detail of what the works look like it 's simply adjusting the program and I think to speak to counselors works query earlier on what we 'll need to do and what we 've done worried this is probably the third timers continue to look at and adjust the accessible city program because the way when the blueprint was originally put out we expected anger projects and other things to have been developed in the first tranche of projects was designed to align with me that 's not what 's played out in the ground and development has occurred across different parts of the city that probably wasn 't thought about originally so what we have done is brought this pair to to say hey firstly it was the bus interchanges opening earlier and we adjusted the program to make sure that the buses could get into the interchange now as part of this paper we 've got other development occurring and for instance places like high street and we think as do you it 's a works yep so there might be other changes that need to occur to the program in the future to align with development because you 're thinking changes five years that 's helpful with but but what you 've seen actually probably lines to be my thing is it but that almost sounds like one should really be we at reading council acknowledges that the accessible city programmers are moving feast for me that the program itself is been moving what this is saying is the key things in six point one other what we see ourselves become more and to bring forward a Colombo a soft Warren of Colombo with the circle connects with Pepin or parallel cycle way and the high street development mmm-hmm now there might be further amendments to those and a few years time when it might be a good idea to bring something else forward and push something else there so it 's not fundamentally did this will give me comfort and it 's not necessary locking us into a number of the other upcoming projects that 's great and and what unstated and to I mean is taking on what everyone is seeing shouldn 't one 32 for dessert open to the proposed action projects with modified timing and and note that the budget allocation is in this financial year and won 't be spent in this financial year and then say that it will be subject to a further report to the committee or a decision by Council isn 't that right we 're not approving the current continue with project is identified in the current program because they 're going to come back to us because they 're going to come back so wouldn 't it be better to shift that up into the top block page on the table on page 32 where it says deliver the AAC program in accordance with table 2 below o table 2 below attachment 1 yeah 6.1 yeah yeah yeah stand to be loved as this financial year ever that was agreed to put the accessible city projects on hold for a while yeah and rather than us trying as part of this which is seeking your approval to reactivate the program with some amendments it 's important that we go out and speak with the owners and developers down there give us some options bring that back to Council so well maybe if you 've got approves the continuation of the accessible city paladar and then put and brackets at the end a bit one so after report go brackets noting project 1 832 for AAC Victoria Street is continues to be on hold because it 's not we 're not authorizing you to continue that the project is identified in the current project program no but and the rest of the stuff like that the lower portion of that table there from the 30-kilometer one all of those are going to be coming back to council anyway though are they not yeah the only issue with putting that and putting that statement of 0and is that we do want to engage on for tourist street and we want you to tell you until until until we okay continues to be subject to engagement no engagement engagement subject subjects of further engagement can I just I mean it 's been a lot of talk things and engaging on the delivery but actually the owners of Victoria Street other citizens of the city and there are many other stakeholder groups and who are really interested I know that Jim zero for example had a petition of over 800 signatures on Victoria Street when it first came to council listen I 've got so much on the trace five million dollars and I 'm just maybe no staging with stakeholder making a decision around different presentation no I 'm not asking I 'm just all I 'm saying is that we may talk to the business owners they should also be able to talk to the LR detective them they can talk to the residents and they talk to the time around and have been all about the business that 's all the businesses yeah anyway don 't worry let 's let it lie so can I just make a point in relation to one the winning one it implies it 's on hold in effect work is still being done in planning so yeah and it 's in it 's in a timeline so I on hold is it as an HD entirely true yeah Enterprise physical works are on hold well that 's clear yeah Davina may be delivering I 'm sorry the trouble was and again it 's because we don 't have the program in front of us per se it 's difficult to know what the project is identified in the current program I mean maybe if it had said as amended by resolution of council on each state then it would have been clear that you don 't have all authority to proceed with the project but it doesn 't say that and it looks like it 's the same as everyone I mean did you know the council may infect decide that actually just restoring what 's wrong with the road will be good enough and it won 't be gold plating or betterment in an environment we 're at probably you know when I think of all the streets and areas of the town that I drive through what they need to have done to them I know where I 'd rather be spending the money myself so a question about some of the work that we have to do rather than the work then we might like to do that 's so lien can I just ask them that for clarity didn 't think but some of the work on Victorious Street is proceeding we 're not going to get the detailed design until all the design until it comes to the committee so it 's just after Victoria Street it 's just subject to through their engagement its note in construction so no sir nice delivery don 't you instructors asking that we know delivery our project is on hold subject to fear their engagement and report bet 30 committee I 'm really saying it doesn 't need to be on hold per se the actual delivery deliveries on hold right it 'll be an interesting debate when that report comes to the council for sure do you have a question or you want to speak to the debate okay well I 'll open it up to debate and I 'll call yani because he asked first Gerry Brownlee once famously said who was who is know an identity crisis and very comfortable throw I am but I 'm just just to say that like I look at the costs in this program and I 'm just baffled at how we can continue to put such huge amounts of money into what I think is a very dynamic environment we 've just seen ECAM proposed to reduce a number of bus services and local communities based on what I believe is a failed hubs and spokes model which a number of us raise concerns at the time it was introduced as a councillor we were told that the accessible city was based on the hubs and spokes model and that 's why we had to spend the money that we 're being told we have to spend on the central city so that the buses work the buses are not working we 've got a broken public transport system at the moment and we 're still going on this path or spinning huge amounts of money in gold plating the central city I 'll just give you two examples what 's too straight right outside here fixing the road between Oxford Street Oxford Terrace and Ralston Avenue is that really a priority for us what 's wrong with that just the other day I drove down Park Terrace on my way to Council that 's on budget not on this next three years but and you know five to six years out we 've got money on budget to spend millions upgrading Park Terrace when it 's just had its resurfacing I cannot understand given our financial pressures why these streets are continuously getting a huge amount of money being spent in terms of capital when actually there doesn 't seem to be a lot wrong with them in some cases there 's others that do need fixing and I support fixing them but not gold plating the other cost is that 's hidden here from these expensive and what I believe are luxury items is the ongoing optics cost of maintaining them which we don 't have any information that which I consider will be significant so therefore until we review the accessible city plan then I do not believe we should continue to contribute government and forced plan on us as a city that I think is clearly failing so let 's review the plan before we spend more money on it let 's try and get some examples of realistic costings to do the things that we need to do without the luxury items I conclude with the example I gave to you yesterday go to Littleton farmers market on the weekend look at a very simple priceless and probably cost-effective solution they simply closed the road to allow out the farmers market and the community and the public to go in and feel safe what a great solution that has almost no cost to it compared to the money that we 're spending in this program that 's been proposed today let 's start thinking creatively about how we can save money given our financial pressures rather than continue to blindly fund the accessible Central City program without any review though well I think it 's good have had this discussion today some of the members might councils might like to come along to the committee at that time rather than sort have been useful but it just seems to me an altogether like for example the the point about the hub and spokes model it 's it 's rich that 's actually irrelevant the the point is that we are we are designing with an accessible City some clear bus corridors no matter what model we use that that 's what has to happen there all of the stuff is really tidying up stuff the point about actually including and finishing off the the Rapanui shan-rock one Ruth would we not do there and the same with senescence Street the 30 K they 're like that it 's very clear that in terms of safety for pedestrians coming across the road and soon SF and for children coming across the road it 's it 's when the school goes in that in fact it that that 's essential who on earth really wants to delay the works around the town hall so that we open the town hall and they 're not done okay so overall I think I do invite councilors who to come along to that to the committee that the that the recommendations up there are something that as a council we must support I 'll blame ya what really concerns me with what I hear is the the one dig principle that skirt ain 't aimed for and which they were never really truly able to attain so once they dig up a streak that 's it it 's all done at once and you know it 's it 's been talked about as something which is to be aimed for but never actually reach so that I mean it 's that kind of methodology or lack of it which I think it 's tremendous cost to some of these projects arguably so if we are going to proceed with the site understanding is we 're making changes within something that 's already agreed so let 's get it right that would be my plea in this I do have to agree over the Town Hall you cannot have the Town Hall looking good and then the street outside looks like a construction site we needed it needed all done together I hear you on his point time and time again over gold plating I could make the same argument over you know water shoes yeah maybe there all along there was a structural disconnect when the council to terms ago was told that the priority was the 4s or as the city is the whole city some things you can 't_''_2893.92 challenge and change some things you have to live with but let 's try and do this as well as we can and keep the costs down by by having their one big principle somebody else it was it you Dion Dion and then Aaron I agree with some of the points that would just sit before you know we need to be doing the Town Hall you know working you know we 've heard in this they 're bringing up some of these projects together actually has operational efficiencies but I just look at there are some things in here that I agree with and some things that I don 't necessarily think needed or it they leave all that I think we 're funding them and and I think he referred Street would 's quite a lot of money on the budget in there for that and do we need to be doing that exactly at that level at this time is that what the people of the city are wanting at this stage I just I struggle with that and I also struggle with that nearly three million dollars to do the traffic enhancements for the 30 kilometer zone in the Central City I just is that necessary at this time when we 've got that so many other pressures I just I just don 't feel that that is the right thing we should be doing I mean paint some paint 30-kilometer on the road and how much can that cost if that 's what we wanted to do I don 't think we need to be doing all these build outs and everything like that at this stage I think the trend bringing that forward is a good idea I think that was but again that was that was resolved in the annual plan and it 's I thought it would have been better to come well before the long-term was going to be happening so it 's a bit of a shame the timeline on there but I really roadworks are so tricky for people in the city at the moment I think they 've they 've had their at that level they 're at that tolerance and they don 't think people are really ready for the amount of disruption and I think we 've got said you know that the examples that we 've gotten Durham Street and Manchester 's do you mean Chester Street have just ruined the perception of what we need to do in roadworks they are such gold plated they are they 're really nice but there are so many other needs in the city at the moment Aaron yeah I do agree if a couple of points have been raised and there 's any reason I went to speak is to follow up on Yanni 's point around like Wooster Street here and end around the park and the upgrades and when they 're scheduled for and I 'll just go back to all the way to yesterday to item 11 and fantastic resolution based around community feedback with NDC and upgrade so if it does we get the feedback from the community boards and from the community that they want to see the way we do our prioritization differently Jonnie what you have a saying at is community board and say no don 't spend the money on the street we want it spent on that street so we 're just so that 's out there again and I think what intersection was named in there okay Pauline thank you I mean busy day that we 're not really talking about budgets and design we 're talking about timing of the program and in response to council johansson he can have not decided to cut six routes they 're consulting on that and I really encourage people to three options have got the six routes I 'm sorry yes I know and we will but we won 't be submitting as a council I can tell you that here and there so we 've got to be careful when we just we think we 're absolutely ready for good transport system did question the the costings today but you know is we know a lot more costs that appear when we 're doing these boots a lot of things that we don 't see under the ground which is a lot of cost and we might as well fix those things up users who say they have a long life while we 're digging the road up so and we also comply with obligations in the ASC that we don 't always have any choice over so um we must look around too and see what has been done we all have to work around the T recently a one it 's a big gold-plated we don 't want butts to the city that don 't match we may decide to do that and we will be running reports back but I think like put ourselves into the future as they were doing this now should we do a good job at the Christchurch it 's starting to look really good people are commenting a de Leon have force with me so be there tonight but today we 're just looking the budgets for that time will come later when the digital grid becomes big so today let 's support this committee recommendation to modify the timing and let 's get Christchurch cracking thank you very funny see what he did see what is it yep I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no no Johansson [Music] so you want and get well we hang on look I 'll put I 'll put two separately that but but you want to vote for only two of them so two separately so if I put item two notes that before that that 's a noting provision anyway yeah okay so I 'll put two separately all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so that 's it I mean but do you oppose three and four as well I mean do you want to support those you want to just record your opposition to one yeah okay so Dion and Yanni offers opposition to item one of the recommendation thank you thanks very much everyone right well I 'll exclude the are we but yeah we passed the resolution to exclude the public set out on page 83 to 84 at the agenda and pages 5 to 6 of the supplementary agenda and that Linda for wasa and Gemma Clark from crash each in seed remain after the public have been excluded for item 13 New Zealand Track and Field Championships of the public exclude agenda as they have knowledge that is relevant to that item analysis the council I 'll put that motion oh I 'll move it I 'll move it and secant is secant of my turn yes 19 separately can i entice speak to it so 18 19 19 and a supplementary that 's up to me true sorry yeah I don 't believe that we should be going to peak item 19 it 's too important and too much in the public interest we 've discussed the previous paper and public even with figures involved and including any estimate of costs and I think that this particular topic is too important in the contents of the report too important not to be done in 19 you 're going to be no that 's fine thank you it 's fine okay so so I will put item number 19 separately so those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no so how many are opposed one two three four five six so okay you 're handsome Livingston queuing swags Davidson no no oh yeah I wasn 't aware that this was the case no one spoke to me about it so anyway this all right Sarah Tim Burton was the sixth one so so that 's carried and so I 'll put the rest of the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you right let 's just take a 10-minute break you _"

    "text": "is inaccessible city current state and again now I 'll hand over to you Pauline thank you so it 's not actually about detail of any of the proteins it 's just about the timing so that we can bring these works particularly around High Street forward so that they will align with any development that 's happening there and the streets will not need to be dug up again there is a mention of the row cheaply there 's no detail about their tram work at the moment but whatever happens clearly that trend goes this money will need to be spent the tram is not part of the AAC budget the tremors a different budget of the money is the budget the AAC just relates to the renewal works in High Street these the issue of the two weighing of cure and Salisbury to defer that and just do the piece along Gilmore really for the opening of the town hall if we were to proceed with the two weighing that would be much much later than these a whole it 's a whole complication to the works be quite a long delay in red and the other thing to note is the unique a speed limit to go out for an engagement on Essex Street makes you think it 's a consultation and the engagement on Victoria Street to recommence the toy strip has already been consulted on and I think there was a really good process through the 30 committee of huncles 2016 and there was really good engagement on there I think people are pretty happy with where we 've got to the thing is with Victoria Street that 's failing the surface needs to be redone on the road and the footpath so we are the took it up and replace it as a business will proceed and engage with the people and perhaps bring some improvements in there and one of the additions to the recommendation was that we look at options to commit to the Rapanui shake rock cycle way to the cdk Central City sewing because this had been overlooked so I 'm happy to make these recommendations as well thank you type a seconder for Mike Davidson is there any we 're doing this now a hit off the consultation on the LTP and it does seem a bit odd that we would change timing until we 've had that community feedback I think the idea through the draft or the resolutions before yours to go out and get some feedback from the community so potentially you can amend the LTP for instance to bring forward high street redevelopment by another year so that 's the idea of going out before the LTP is approved by council sorry we 've just approached the draft LTP yesterday mm-hmm which has already agreed to already agreed to these timing changes consistent with what 's in this report so the report itself so last year at council donating plan council agreed to bring forward redevelopment of the tram up High Street and as councillor cotton noted that 's not an AAC project there is a separate line item within the LTP what the sort to do was align the adjacent streetscape works what 's the brought forward tram redevelopment now there is potential to bring that forward both those forward here 's another with the property owners along there and the operator of the trend to find out particularly in relation to when the hoardings are going to be removed if it 's possible to do that redevelopment and the next phone interview two other questions one is that part of Victoria Street comes under into the local community board and I don 't think this reports been to the local community board is there a reason what 's the process around that so the resolution in front of you for Tory Street is to do a report on that so it 's not seeking to reinitiate it the money is currently in the 15 to 25 LTP but that would be carried forward into the 18 to 28 no TP because we 're not going to deliver the works this financial year so as part of that process and and developing that rapport vitória Street we would engage with the community board so do you think it would be useful under 0.3 to have to actually make reference to a report going to the community board would be inherent in whatever we got some of the costs associated with the AAC just seem horrific like Herefords straight four million dollars for two blocks what what ability do we have to a look at the entire accessible city program and actually save the benefits and what we thought would happen have happened and until look at reducing the scope in terms of saving some money given our financial pressures because we still seem to be spending a huge amount of money for very short distances in a city center that 's evolving and we 've never reviewed it since it was launched so that there 's a couple of things there AAC has a chapter of the Christchurch central a little recovery plan and that store has statutory weight under the Greater Christchurch regeneration act I think that the plan itself I 'm still his legal status so reviewing that as something which is a a wider question in terms of the program of works themselves the first 72 million dollars of that was heavily funded by the crown so that both came from Sierra and New Zealand Transport Agency and I think funded by the crown so and I think that was very positive for this organization to receive their degree of funding for those initial projects I think that the costs associated with the projects are simply dependent on the quality of the work that is done and certainly some of that the builds that are out there at the moment are of a reasonably high quality and that 's got a direct bearing on what costs there are thee there 's also underground structure and other things associated with that but you know the costs are simply the costs of water what we need to do to make the street look and in accordance with what some visitors within the the regeneration plan and what stood out within the energy store city chapter like to speculate on my own debate any other questions um Dion been clean um what is what what is the TP 30 kilometre exactly so TP was a breviary before transport project so everything with TP in front of us simply stands for transport project and the 30 k is simply the slow zone within the of projects that you 'll see where once you enter into the slow core it tells you is the driver of a vehicle that you 're entering into a 30 K zone and that costs three million dollars to do well that 's the budget and some of that work has been done and some of its ongoing you would have seen some of those been rolled out throughout the city but there 's signage this treatment there 's build outs this various other things that are occurring within the TP 30 project yeah just yeah I 'll speak to I 'm the other one have you spoken to Richard mr. Peebles about his development at all yes so so you would already know when he is looking to plan to take away that because you just said before they is you you this is effectively giving you resolution to go out and speak to them something what what is this actually there 's other you 've already done that up by the sounds of it so what does this actually asking us to do so he 's one of other developers that we 'd need to speak to as well and we 'd need to speak to the operator of the train it was busy been a misunderstanding about the two projects because one and this paper relates to the AAC project which is the street treatments on the area where the tram tracks would go the tram tracks are not part of AAC so that that 's a separate project but I felt when I read about this elsewhere that it was it seemed to misunderstand the two projects and that we 're actually trying to help align the two projects the purpose though is councillor cotton mentioned we don 't want to dig up the street twice so if you lay the tram tracks if we don 't want to come along and do the streetscape works at a later date that 's what was sought to do was bring forward the AAC component of the works for high speed to align with what was proposed for the tram but there is a possibility of bringing there both of those projects forward even further but that will discussed and then the quit that was actually the next question I had was how are you going to do that because obviously the budgets are in financial year 19 at this stage how are we going to bring the budget forward is it going to be an LTP conversation or is it something else that we 're missing so that wouldn 't be as part of a staff submission to the LTP or through so that the money is programmed so there 's no new money it 's simply a matter of changing which year we can deliver it on so that 's not new money or different money or greater or lesser amount it 's simply a matter of the transaction that goes into the LTP to say well we can deliver in 1819 as opposed to 1920 that would be preferable but I think it 's incumbent upon us to make sure that we discuss that not just with one person but with other people who also have interests along the yeah and find out what their development ambitions might be we also have a couple of nearly other heritage for sites have been that way for obviously a long long period of time the issues are particularly with one of them are very fixed and complex and so before we get and to do our works some of those hoardings all the coordinates will need to come down yeah is that on the other part of the high street yes so it 's not actually yes but you wouldn 't really want to think of high street and isolation is an trem trick nothing dreamshade is there as the the other question is I mean the other question I have here is there going to be any look at the that ridiculous intersection at Jones Street while we 're actually doing this work or is it still gonna be the 21 traffic lights indices I 'd like to second that no I 'm actually I 'm actually being deeply serious it 's one of the most ridiculous intersections in the city it 's actually not the most ridiculous one are we the same but it 's good getting em to answer your question I think a where it goes and the intersection and if we are to take the tram up through the air and up to the top end of the high street pass are the Duncans boomers and their decision and how it operates there 's going to be pretty fundamental to what 's proposed as part of this program so well Erin I 'll take the traffic lights please clean thanks give my question just over there if you like they 're kind of the display of the screen back display of the costs Richard so do we always show the breakdown between crown and Council in their tables I mean this one obviously looks like council but you know say Yanni has a comment over I mean you use these words gold plating because does that include the gross cost of goods right so so with the first suite of projects that 's 72 million we got 27 was funded by the crown and then okay 18 by NZ tae-young and we funded the remaining 27 million so circa 63% was funded by the crown 63 so for the second phase of a requirement of the Zealand Transport Agency for any funding of the projects over a million dollars they have endorsed our business program business case for accessible City yeah but but that always comes with a caveat that you know any new projects they 'll be looking at and seeing what the transport benefits because they 're a transport agency so you know some things they fund more than others yeah and as we were discussing earlier when it leads to transport efficiencies you know people get him from A to B quicker that 's something that that keenly interested in and so that 's the type of thing that they look at the fun and the way we report it do we always consistently just show the council component or does it tend to be both in our reports just counsel okay any other questions all right thank you a couple of questions is so Victoria Street you 've got you 've still got in here at five and a half million I thought that had been deferred that 's that five and a half million is in the we 're not spending it this year oh no no so would nature so it would be carried forward and that is going to go back so the idea is to prepare report before the organization to consider while we haven 't prepared that I think it but should have some options to it 's only spend options assessment so that would be you might look at her there 's councillor kata mentioned there 's certainly some issues on Victoria Street with the quality of the asset so you might look at just a straight renewal to have a like-for-like replacement of what 's here at the moment so we need to look at what the costs of that being comparison with doing something which is what 's proposed through ASC and you know how long would that take as well to deliver because there might be similar time frames to what 's proposed as part of this project so that 's that 's the idea is to bring something back to you on that with a range of optional good okay that 's good and on the I mean change on this kind of gold plate this kind of coffee and castle there 's bread and butter and maybe a kind and crackers this is yeah result on expenditure now in next week 's Finance Committee we 're having a report back on one of the AAC projects which was that he referred matched it 's an address piece which was budgeted at 2.4 million came in at 900 thousand and we 're going to examine why that happens I think you know some of these costs do need to be there is a sense that stuff 's being over engineered more than it needs to be and I think we really need to have a good so I hope that is happening through this committee I just can 't_''_992.389 say what happens next week but I think you know we 've had it with some of our pedestrian crossings and whatever some of the but the quotes we get and then some of the final prices coming way low so it worries me if we 're over budgeting for long this stuff then renewals do full street renewals street redevelopment the reason why they 're one of the reasons why came and lower than the originally anticipated costs right and some of the work was actually done by attacker so we don 't have to do before suite of works associates did they not charge us for this budget when we originally budgeted for numerous years ago we assumed that we 'd have to do this work we didn 't so it 's the budget cuts but in actual fact the only but that they were that we were legally liable for any way was the 122 meters well yeah was the it was from east of the East frame well from the park or through to through to mentor Lima square right yeah and and we were to tidy up that corner as well yeah yeah and we got them to do it but I thought we paid for it there were some other benefits as well contractors and continuation groups but that that 's all inevitable I shall be very interested to read that report particularly in town we also upgrade the infrastructure and they have water networks as part of Manchester Street and so we were able to tag on the end of that as well and that 's one of the issues that we 've got with the lights of he referred streets at Victoria Street I think there 's another one that the infrastructure what you see is broken but also what 's under the ground is I think people were but sad to see Orion digging straight back into the brand new pavement straight after that work had been completed which was exactly what we 're trying to avoid by getting them to do it all at the same time any car going just paint certainly be looking just paint some things on no no it 's not understand it 's not just as simple as you know people think but anyway I 'm you know yeah the yeah but anyway that there are treatments that have been applied to the roads as well as build-outs and things like that actually say to people you know I remember when we first had because remember I mean it wasn 't us to put it was it was central government that I mean I 'll send you round the order and council if you like so I 'm by Gerry Brownlee and yeah it 's at this week but the point is is that you know at the time I said why don 't we have just large signs just saying you 're entering a 30 K area and then so there 's no question that every intersection and at the point that you 're going on that you 're entering out well it 's starting to look like that now and it wasn 't for a long time anyway yeah Dion get a question leave it the resolution number four on here wasn 't_''_1219.95 in the original report but it 's it 's up here for a recommendation here how was that miss you mentioned it was that the committee had put that on it so no but from the original committee it wasn 't there yes and you mentioned that it had been messed off I mean I just want to know how it was all over looked or whatever the word got overlooked well I don 't think that that it 's the staff that over looked at it was the committee considered us and felt that it was absent yes so the command is how the committee boosts I mean if you 're sitting around a committee table you 're working it through the staff okay and somebody raises the the options for connecting the cycleway to the theory Kay central cities I 'm all it seems a perfectly valid addition I don 't_''_1271.74 I don 't think it is suggested in any one 's not all of the roads and we were doing all the other cycle ways and this seemed to be the anomaly so the committee picked that up and asked us to investigate options for it so there was an AAC just doesn 't cover every single road within the for revenues no it doesn 't it 's generally in really here is are these we 're making a paper like this today around where AAC is ed I just don 't want to hear that we 've got to do any more anomalies so we I asked are we gonna hear of any more anomalies so that we end up having to pay for more work this is requesting staff investigating options for connecting a cycleway it 's been picked up by the committee as an issue that wasn 't identified and they see that so it 's all I think I will forget that AAC is a chapter of the Central City recovery plan young we asked specifically at the time if there were any other side boys any wound thank you that 's the answer I was looking for thank you so what 's that yeah this was the only one who was most great that was all I was asking for Christ 's sake we just can 't just clarify the UM get clarity as this the Wooster Street connection is that the piece of road that we 're talking about the one that comes in is it the one that comes in Worcester straight yeah so I think it may be quite useful to actually identify the street that 's that 's looking clean looked at okay so it just needs where you connect unto the foodie case so they don 't need to do it but it 's a second seriously bringing the options back to the kamati a right I don 't think it matters right now that we specifically identify which streets might be involved so I 'll Jamie questions you 're just just on one there and it 's I 'm cool they need you might be able to help me out with that one what what 's the point of of having one and they 're really because obviously the issues that are covered pretty pretty basic the thirty case on the street makes things for the school and everything like that and everything else there and the fact that you can 't go it 's 31 okay is there any way probably and the other ones again belts and braces like the high street and it 's essentially just doing work to coincide with developments to really back the accessible city program when you 're in so many question marks over particularly what you know all the balls that are up in the year with the amended program that you 've got here which are reasonably comprehensive like Manchester to Cambridge of he referred straight and the Wooster Street one with Montreal tallest and there 's a couple of others there it 's hard to from where I 'm sitting anyway to say yep sign off there I mean does accessible sitting when we don 't know what that stuff looks like we know what the Victoria Street one look like and it ended up being quite controversial of shelter but then just say yes everything else looks good without seeing what they looked like feels counterintuitive or is that not what they 're saying at all one of one I can go speak to that on that 's what it 's seeking as it doesn 't get into the detail of what the works look like it 's simply adjusting the program and I think to speak to counselors works query earlier on what we 'll need to do and what we 've done worried that 's probably the third timers continue to look at and adjust the accessible city program because the way projects and other things to have been developed in the first tranche of projects was designed to align with them that 's not what 's played out in the ground and development has occurred across different parts of the city that probably wasn 't thought about originally so what we have done is brought this pair to to say hey firstly it was the bus interchanges opening earlier and we adjusted the program to make sure that the buses could get into the interchange now as part of this paper we 've got other development occurring and for instance places like high street and we think as do you it 's a good idea to align the streetscape works with the tram works yep so there might be other changes that need to occur to the program in the future to align with development because you know thinking changes five years that 's helpful with but but what you 've seen actually probably lines to be my thing is it but that almost sounds like one should really be we at reading council acknowledges that the accessible city programmers are moving what this is saying is the key things in six point one other what we see ourselves become more and to bring forward a Colombo a soft Warren of Colombo with the connects with Pepin or parallel cycle way and the high street development mmm-hmm now there might be further amendments to those and a few years time when might be a good idea to bring something else forward and push something else there so it 's not fundamentally did this will give me comfort and it 's not necessary locking us into a number of the other upcoming projects that 's great and and what unstated and to ABC yeah and this is not but is that right I mean is taking on what everyone is seeing shouldn 't one 32 for dessert open to the proposed action projects with modified timing and and note that the budget allocation is in this financial year and won 't be spent in this financial year and then say that it will be subject to a further report to the committee or a decision by Council isn 't that right we in the current program because they 're going to come back to us because they 're going to come back so wouldn 't it be better to shift that up into the top block page on the table on page 32 where it says deliver the AAC program in accordance with table 2 below o table 2 below attachment 1 yeah 6.1 yeah yeah yeah stand to be loved as this financial year ever that was agreed to put the accessible city projects on hold for a while yeah and rather than us trying as part of this which is seeking your approval to reactivate the program with some amendments kicking straight back in and delivering Victoria Street we think it 's important that we go out and speak with the owners and developers down there give us some options bring that back to Council so well maybe if you 've got approves the continuation of the accessible city paladar and then put and brackets at the end a bit one so after report go brackets noting project 1 832 for AAC Victoria Street is continues to be on hold continue that the project is identified in the current project program no but and the rest of the stuff like that the lower portion of that table there from the 30-kilometer one all of those are going to be coming back to council anyway though are they not yeah the only issue with putting that and putting that statement of 0and is that we do want to engage on for tourist street and we want you to tell you until until until we okay continues to be subject to engagement no engagement engagement subject subjects of further engagement can I just I mean it 's been a lot of talk about the owners and the businesses and those kind of things and engaging on the delivery but actually the owners of Victoria Street other citizens of the city and there are many other stakeholder groups and who are really interested I know that Jim zero for example had a petition of over 800 signatures on Victoria Street when it first came to council listen I 've got so much on the trace five million dollars and I 'm just maybe no I 'm not asking I 'm just all I 'm saying is that we may talk to the business owners they should also be able to talk to the LR detective them they can talk to the residents and they talk to the time around and have been all about the business that 's all the businesses yeah anyway don 't worry let 's let it lie so can I just make a point in relation to one the winning one it implies it 's on hold in effect work is still being done in planning so yeah and it 's in it 's in a timeline so I just think to actually go out and say look those on hold is it as an HD entirely true yeah Enterprise physical works are on hold well that 's clear yeah Davina may be delivering I 'm sorry the trouble was and again it 's because we don 't have the program in front of us per se it 's difficult to know what the project is identified in the current program I mean maybe if it had said as would have been clear that you don 't have all authority to proceed with the project but it doesn 't say that and it looks like it 's the same as everyone I mean did you know the council may infect decide that actually just restoring what 's wrong with the road will be good enough and it won 't be gold plating or betterment in an environment we 're at probably you know when I think of all the streets and areas of the town that I drive through what they need to have done to them I know where I 'd rather be spending the money myself so you know it 's just it is going to be a question about some of the work that we have to do rather than the work then we might like to do that 's so lien can I just ask them that for clarity didn 't think but some of the work on Victorious Street is proceeding we 're not going to get the detailed design until all the design until it comes to the committee so it 's just engagement its note in construction so no sir nice delivery don 't you instructors asking that we know delivery our project is on hold subject to fear their engagement and report bet 30 committee I 'm really saying it doesn 't need to be on hold per se the actual delivery deliveries on hold right it 'll be an interesting debate when that report comes to the council for sure do you have a question or you want to speak to the debate okay well I 'll open it up to debate and I 'll call yani because he asked first Gerry Brownlee once famously said who was who is he you knows who read me anyways I don 't know an identity crisis and very comfortable throw I am but I 'm just just to say that like I look at the costs in this program and I 'm just baffled at how we can continue to put such huge amounts of money into what I think is a very dynamic environment we 've just seen ECAM proposed to reduce a number of bus services and local communities based model which a number of us raise concerns at the time it was introduced as a councillor we were told that the accessible city was based on the hubs and spokes model and that 's why we had to spend the money that we 're being told we have to spend on the central city so that the buses work the buses are not working we 've got a broken public transport system at the moment and we 're still going on this path or spinning huge amounts of money in gold plating the central city I 'll just give you two examples what 's too straight right outside here we 're going to spend another nearly two million dollars fixing the road between Oxford Street Oxford Terrace and Ralston Avenue is that really a priority for us what 's wrong with that just the other day I drove down Park Terrace on my way to Council that 's on budget not on this next three years but and you know five to six years out we 've got money on budget to spend millions upgrading Park Terrace when it financial pressures why these streets are continuously getting a huge amount of money being spent in terms of capital when actually there doesn 't seem to be a lot wrong with them in some cases there 's others that do need fixing and I support fixing them but not gold plating the other cost is that 's hidden here from these expensive and what I believe are luxury items is the ongoing optics cost of maintaining them which we don 't have any information that which I consider will be significant so therefore until we review the accessible city plan then I do not believe we should continue to contribute cubes huge sums of money to what was effectively a government and forced plan on us as a city that I think is clearly failing so let 's review the plan before we spend more money on it let 's try and get some examples of realistic costings to do the things that we need to do without the luxury items I conclude with the example I gave to you yesterday go to Littleton farmers market on the weekend look simply closed the road to allow out the farmers market and the community and the public to go in and feel safe what a great solution that has almost no cost to it compared to the money that we 're spending in this program that 's been proposed today let 's start thinking creatively about how we can save money given our financial pressures rather than continue to blindly fund the accessible Central City program without any review though well I think it 's good have had this discussion today some of the members might councils might like to come along to the committee at that time rather than sort of re-litigate I think clearly a lot of the points have been useful but it just seems to me an altogether like for example the the point about the hub and spokes model it 's it 's rich that 's actually irrelevant the the point is that we are we are designing with an accessible City some clear bus corridors no matter what model we use that that 's what has to happen there all of the stuff is really off the the Rapanui shan-rock one Ruth would we not do there and the same with senescence Street the 30 K they 're like that it 's very clear that in terms of safety for pedestrians coming across the road and soon SF and for children coming across the road it 's it 's when the school goes in that in fact it that that 's essential who on earth really wants to delay the works around the town hall so that we open the town hall and they 're not done okay so overall I think I do invite councilors who to come along to that to the committee stage to ask these questions but all together I think that the that the recommendations up there are something that as a council we must support I 'll blame ya what really concerns me with what I hear is the the one dig principle that skirt ain 't aimed for and which they were never really truly able to attain so once they dig up a streak that 's it it 's all done at once and you know it to be aimed for but never actually reach so that I mean it 's that kind of methodology or lack of it which I think it 's tremendous cost to some of these projects arguably so if we are going to proceed with the site understanding is we 're making changes within something that 's already agreed so let 's get it right that would be my plea in this I do have to agree over the Town Hall you cannot have the Town Hall looking good and then the street outside looks like a construction site we needed it needed all done together I hear you on his point he 's kind of on message we hear him at time and time again over gold plating I could make the same argument over you know water shoes yeah maybe there all along there was a structural disconnect when the council to terms ago was told that the priority was the 4s or as the city is the whole city some things you can 't_''_2381.92 challenge and change some things you have to live with but let 's try and costs down by by having their one big principle somebody else it was it you Dion Dion and then Aaron I agree with some of the points that would just sit before you know we need to be doing the town hall you know working you know we 've heard in this they 're bringing up some of these projects together actually has operational efficiencies but I just look at there are some things in here that I agree with and some things that I don 't necessarily think needed or it there leave all that I think we 're funding them and and I think he referred Street would be an example of this at moment we know there 's quite a lot of money on the budget in there for that and do we need to be doing that exactly at that level at this time is that what the people of the city are wanting at this stage I just I struggle with that and I also struggle with that nearly three million dollars to do the traffic enhancements for the 30 kilometer zone in the Central we 've got that so many other pressures I just I just don 't feel that that is the right thing we should be doing I mean paint some paint 30-kilometer on the road and how much can that cost if that 's what we wanted to do I don 't think we need to be doing all these build outs and everything like that at this stage I think the trend bringing that forward is a good idea I think that was but again that was that was resolved in the annual plan and it 's I thought it would have been better to come well before the long-term plan was being discussed and which is what I thought was going to be happening so it 's a bit of a shame the timeline on there but I really roadworks are so tricky for people in the city at the moment I think they 've they 've had their at that level they 're at that tolerance and they don 't think people are really ready for the amount of disruption and I think we 've got said you and Manchester 's do you mean Chester Street have just ruined the perception of what we need to do in roadworks they are such gold plated they are they 're really nice but there are so many other needs in the city at the moment Aaron yeah I do agree if a couple of points have been raised and there 's any reason I went to speak is to follow up on Yanni 's point around like Wooster Street here and end around the park and the upgrades and when they 're scheduled for and I 'll just go back to all the way to yesterday to item 11 and what was signed off when the may have made a fantastic resolution based around community feedback with NDC and upgrade so if it does we get the feedback from the community boards and from the community that they want to see the way we do our prioritization differently Jonnie what you have a saying at is community board and say no don 't spend the money on the street we want it spent on that street so we 're just intersection was named in there okay Pauline thank you I mean busy day that we 're not really talking about budgets and design we 're talking about timing of the program and in response to council johansson he can have not decided to cut six routes they 're consulting on that and I really encourage people to three options have got the six routes I 'm sorry yes I know and we will but we won 't be submitting as a council I can tell you that here and there so we 've got to be careful when we just we think we 're absolutely ready for good transport system which will come watch you perform it takes in we did question the the costings today but you know is we know a lot more costs that appear when we 're doing these boots a lot of things that we don 't see under the ground which is a lot of cost and we might as well fix those things up users who say they have a long life while we 're digging the road up so and we also always have any choice over so um we must look around too and see what has been done we all have to work around the T recently a one it 's a big gold-plated we don 't want butts to the city that don 't match we may decide to do that and we will be running reports back but I think what like put ourselves into the future as they were doing this now should we do a good job at the Christchurch it 's starting to look really good people are commenting a daily on how it 's looking so be there tonight but today we 're just looking at timing of all this group not the designing of the budgets for that time will come later when the digital grid becomes big so to daily support this committee recommendation to modify the timing and let 's get Christchurch cracking thank you very funny see what he did see what is it yep I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no no Johansson so you want and get well we separately that but but you want to vote for only two of them so two separately so if I put item two notes that before that that 's a noting provision anyway yeah okay so I 'll put two separately all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so that 's it I mean but do you oppose three and four as well I mean do you want to support those you want to just record your opposition to one yeah okay so Dion and Yanni offers opposition to item one of the recommendation thank you thanks very much everyone right well I 'll move that we that we _"

    "text": "good morning everyone we 'll start with apologies don 't have any apologies declarations of untrust none and now on to the long-term plan 2018 28 report and you 'll see in front of you that there are a significant number of recommendations that we need to go through and there are a number of number of resolutions that we have to deal with first the first will relate to receiving the information that 's contained in referred to and the staff report including all of the documents that are attached to it we will be noting the recommendations of the council 's audit and risk management committee and I 'll be asking the Deputy Chair of the audit and Risk Management Committee to speak to that and then we need confirmation of the authority of myself and the chief executive to sign that lease or of representation to audit New Zealand and I 'll be inviting representatives of ordered New Zealand to speak to that speak to the report so so rather than rather than speak generally to the to the report I 'll save that for when we with formally moving the recommendations 1 2 and 3 that we received the information that we note the recommendations of the audit and Risk Management Committee and confirmed the authority to sign the letter of representation seconded by Andrew and I 'd like to again I just want to check with staff whether there is anything that you wanted to to provide us by way of information just in relation to these three matters if not all to ref manji and ask him to speak to the audit and risk management committee report thanks Ian I 'm expected me informing a number of minor changes to the consultation document and those changes are flagged and highlighted and the document that 's in the big tin can so I just wanted to make sure that you 're aware of it thank you very much right over to you brief yeah thank you so the risk committee is charged with approving the process for the development of the long-term plan the draft which includes the draft consultation document the financial strategy and the infrastructure strategy so we have reviewed that in process we 're just there to make sure that staff have followed the appropriate process and that all the plans do what they say they 're going to do so we have done that work we 've reviewed the financial the draft financial strategy we 've reviewed the draft infrastructure strategy and the draft consultation document and we 're happy that the appropriate process has been followed there and that they will link together and do what they say they 're supposed to do so we 're happy to advise the council that they can adopt that underlying information obviously subject to the orders of general support which we have received and we 're happy with that we note that the preparation of the information has been supported by the appropriate management sign-offs and has followed the required process under the Local Government Act and therefore recommend that the council adopts the draft financial strategy infrastructure strategy and the draft consultation document with minor amendments allowed to the GM of Finance and commercial so a relatively straightforward process this year in terms of that process and so the order committees happy draft LTP subject to amendments on the date and subject to the Auditor General 's report which will be presented a little bit later thank you um does anyone have any questions arising from the report from the audit and Risk Management Committee no move on and thank you ref and so the next one is the confirmation of the authority of the mayor and chief it seeks to sign the letter of representation and could I invite oh sorry I 'm just concentrating on three things at once you sorry I 'm having difficulty yes yes so I 'm auntie booths and entertainment thank you sorry suffering from quake brain sorry morning everybody no more for me to say there are conversation with the audit risk management committee last week just to confirm the oddities no complete and we are happy to issue an unmodified opinion only a consultation document that basically means that we 've looked at the underlying support information that supports the document and I comfortable that it 's as consistent overwatch reported the key issues in the CD are what we would expect to see document complies with various statutory requirements so when you adopt the consultation document today you would opt it with a clean audit opinion and that 's probably a sign I think first one would pay for a walk so thank you very much has anyone got any questions really not a question just a comment really just to thank audit New Zealand for their work around this and also I should have before to thank the order or risk committee know an especially independent chairs who shall be the work they 've done around this is quite a lot of work for them to do so thank you he is now reiterate that thank you very much at some it 's a very tricky job it 's a tough job to go through such an extensive process as this and we really appreciate the way that your team has worked so well with farm council staff them yeah thank you alright so so I 'll put those first three resolutions this is all this they haven 't been I should have included them okay so that those are the three confirming the authority to sign the letter of representation so I put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you the second well the next recommendation that we will deal with although as I 've advised you it requires 75% approval for this to carry but it 's a temporary suspension of Standing Orders to enable members to speak more than once it removes the limits on the number of speakers and the general procedure for speaking and moving emotions foreshadowed amendments and lost amendments so to set those aside moved by glen livingston seconded by tim Skindred i shall put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no I was expecting at least one day that 's thank you so the next one is adopts the information that provides the basis for the council 's draft and relied on by the content of that to be adopted by council so I 'm just working out where the amendments so they fear there are more we do we I just dumb yep it says food if you before the council can adopt the consultation document must first adopt the information that provides the basis or the information in the consultation document and then you invite any people any members who might want to make amendments mean ones okay so that 's the that 's the all right well ian has just explained what I should have explained which was that before we can adopt the consultation document we must first adopt the information that provides the basis for the council 's draft 2018 28 long-term plan and relied on by the content of the consultation document and so at this point we open up the metaphor discussion any relevant amendments that may be moved I do actually have an amendment and I 'm still working on the detail of it and there are a couple of others who are in the same position so I 'm just going to adjourn the meeting just for the next 15 minutes and so we 'll reconvene at 48 5 past 15 at 5 plus 10 so it 's time for people to go and get a coffee if they want adjourn the meeting so that we can get the wording of the amendments agreed my 1 involves an amendment to the to one of the questions to be asked in the consultation document so I just want to get the wording of that crystal clear I do want to kind of signal it to the audit office because they won 't know about it but I don 't think that there will be a problem with it and and just to tidy up I know that Yanni 's got an amendment in relation to level of service and Sarah 's got an amendment in relation to some advice that that is required before the LTP signed off so we 'll just get the wording bino so if people could be back here at five past ten thank you you I apologize for the delay because there was some wording changes to the consultation document I 'm just looking for comfort at the end of the room that people were nodding and smiling so I 'm assuming that the wording is okay he 's siddhis okay the end it was just a prioritization yep okay so so we 're just going to change the word establish to agree to a prioritization framework so I 'll just just quickly run through it that and and I 'm not going to specifically speak to it as such but there has been a lot of feedback expressing community concerns about the dangers presented a range of intersections and the example I 've used as as here word brains and gardeners rose and I know that Aaron Cohen will speak to that but also the state of many of our streets and footpaths as a council we wish to agree to a prioritization framework for intersection improvements and street and footpath renewals which ensures that we 're meeting the needs of our residents and that 's making it crystal clear that it 's the needs of our residents that we wish to prioritize and asking our residents what do they think we should take into account when prioritizing the work that needs to be done and do you think the priority should be informed by the local community board I guess that that 's a local community boards know more about their local areas and the priorities and their local areas than we do collectively as their council so but we want people to turn their attention to the fact that community boards play this important role in terms of of of priorities so let 's hear what the public have to say in relation to that so I 'm not moving that as an amendment of written that into the resolution which I will now move and seconder by Andrew notice but only please and I think this is better down we we 'd start dealing with the consultation document rather than the underlying information that you 're going to adopt first no okay [Applause] its next blog page yeah but if it if we 're adopting the consultation for console you don 't do that to be patient it 's the background information yes oh no include any amendments you want to make the first step is to adopt the information that forms the basis of the proposed LTP and is relied on by the consultation document well one of the one of is in one of the levels of service sorry I 'm just a little unclear so do you want to do you want to highlight that on and copy it and we 'll put it somewhere else but um can you put it between nine and ten okay so we 're with that the we with the council Johansson amendments that 's here do they rate relate to the information yes has does they should be dealt with you you move adoption of the information and noting where it can be found and then amendments can be slaughtered in there so counsel Johansson moved by way of amendment there so put that in between five and six or is it after six no actually we have to is we 've don 't mean dat first so put it above five what are you all you 're doing is moving the adoption at this stage and if you 're opening it up for discussion and amendments and then oh okay yeah well we have moved sorry yeah I know I 'm just a confused as to why one goes there and that we can 't debate my amendment well what I feel you will would we get information we then move to adopting the consultation document and that 's when you could think the meeting can discuss your document okay all right all right so it 's been moved and seconded and there 's a First Amendment counselor Sarah Templeton and that seconded by and Galloway so I 'll put that amendment do you want to speak to the amendment it 's not quite the word I know it 's just there 's a couple of extra words that got sent around to all the counselors just before just um in a realistic time frame with enough information to inform the final decision because it might be that there 's some sort of cost benefit staff or disadvantages advantages information not just the timeframe and the cost that counselors will need to inform the decision it was a male ground yeah that 's a yeah I mean this section of coastal pathway is the last section that 's the most difficult it 's also the most most dangerous and it 's there 's probably enough to do some design work that we are unsure about that the the section is dangerous at the moment because they used to be a footpath around this corner connecting these two communities and really really highly used one on the weekends and that footpath was taken away as part of the the Littleton Road corridor the mess movement in the rock fall risk works and it was on the other side of the road it 's not able to be put back there it needs to be keen to leave it out in the annual plan last year we bought forward some coastal pathway funding and some other funding to enable the Croesus Yacht Club to build the first section around this corner that they already had the design work done on and getting this information and I 'm aware that there will be submissions on this during the long term plan will allow us to make a decision in June whether or not to include funding for the really dangerous section of footpath around the corner good Jonnie gloom I guess we 're in doing the amendment but just um I think the other thing for this one is like this is a cycle way and so you know we 're spending a fortune on cycle ways and this is one of the most obvious places with people cycle whether it 's recreation or commute and it does seem to me that when this information comes back we should actually be talking to NZTA again about getting it as part of an MC are it just seems ludicrous that it 's not being included and that it 's taking so long because this is an area that has had lots of I think risk and it definitely needs to be addressed and so I 'm very supportive of what 's been put back clean thank you just hearing the words can 't you leave it out on to these three okay so I think we 'd need to include environmental costs in this I 'm sure yeah absolutely so it 's not just financial that the you know eat I trust and others will ever be watching closely how Phil look I 'm happy happen the costs are going to be they 'll be useful to him because clearly they 're going be quite significant you know and I 'm sure that will there 'll be further debate though to in terms of the affordability of this project which is recreational as against the commuter cyclists that council you 're hence and referred to within their major cycleways program so whether central government come up with some more funding for that we perhaps can find out but in the meantime I 'm certainly happy to support this amendment all right I 'll put that motion just just a correction that this isn 't a this particular section isn 't a recreational route this is a core council business section of footpath that we 've taken away on one side of the road due to life risk and we 're obliged as a council to put a safe pedestrian footpath back whether or not it 's coastal pathway woody Bay as a council we need to provide a footpath for our residents around this dangerous corner right so I will put that motion all those that 's carried and council you 're Henson has an amendment which I 'll second over to Yanni very just very briefly I just think um there 's been a lot of public concern at the state of our parks and I understand the intent behind removing the words which is that it 's quite hard to measure but I actually think in terms of the public perception of us aiming to be you know a beautiful garden city again it 's really important that we reinstate these words so I 've just suggested that we actually just leave these words and rather than delete them as is currently proposed and I don 't think it makes any material difference to the way in which staff will run the the contracts but I think it does send a signal to the community that we do want our posts we clean and tidy down so um I 'll just speak to it briefly because and I 'll come to it perhaps more when we get to the consultation document but but I made quite a thing about the fact that we Garden City and we can 't afford to lose that and and we need to think about what that means and in the 21st century and I know that the Nommo trial has had its challenges and that 's partly why we 're reviewing that now so that we can gain the the benefits that it was intended to achieve while at the same time ensuring that we retain that status so that 's why I 'm making the clean and tidy amendment okay I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now I 'll put the amended motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now we move on to the receiving Simpson Grayson 's advice on the consultation document and its compliance with the requirements of the Local Government Act we receive that Auditor General 's report and that the consultation document includes the following questions which relate to intersection safety in the state of roads and footpaths and that we adopt the consultation document for consultation including the Auditor General Andrew so I 'd like to open the debate by by referring to the introduction that I wrote to the long-term plan to the consultation document and that is that and the phrasing that I 've used as we run this together and the reason that I 've used that phrase we run this together indicates that there is nothing that we can do alone that we can 't do better when we actually collaborate with others and that means collaborating with central government but it also means collaboration with our communities our communities are our frontline when it comes to noticing when things are wrong we are completely and utterly dependent on people letting us know when there are potholes letting us know when there are rubbish burn overflows although I do tend to blame those that leave the rubbish as the culprits in that regard but you know it is important that we are hearing from our community all the time but that they see themselves as partners with us in order to ensure that one we maintain our garden city status but also that we 're able and community involvement in their own facilities we have established a set of strategic priorities which form the platform for the way that we 're thinking as a council enabling active citizenship and connected communities and that means you know communities being able to do things for themselves with our support not council abandoning communities but actually engaging communities and the whole process and I love for example the governor 's Bay GT story and I love the story of the community facility that 's being developed at the church and South Brighton you know that when communities take ownership and actually put their own resources and time and energy into the particular project it means so much more it 's way more meaningful and and we are enriched by what communities are able to contribute maximizing opportunities to develop a vibrant prosperous and sustainable 21st Century City we have to think about sustainability and that 's what I often say and I 've said in the and the introduction that what a Garden City is in the 21st century is quite different from what it was when when I was more about the the parks and the gardens and the flowers but now it 's about sustainability it 's about environmental protection it 's about ecological values it 's about clean rivers clean air and food resilience that that 's what a Garden City is a sustainable 21st century as Century City as today but the vibrancy and the prosperity we must have those as well and I know that you know that we look at some of the central city projects that we would have liked to have seen further advanced but the idea of having a central city that people love to come into people love to live in you know again just love to see more people living in the central city that that is an important part of that vibrancy and of course prosperity is for all that this is we frame ourselves as a city of opportunity for all its this is no one left behind this is everyone having the opportunity climate change leadership and you know it 's really important that we take a leadership role we can 't sit back and have to we have to lead cities around the world are acknowledging that even when the United States pulled out of the Paris Accord the cities they all put their hands up and said we will take on that challenge ourselves and as was said by our own Prime Minister actually quite recently these these can 't just be seen as challenges because with every challenge comes an opportunity an opportunity to develop new technologies to be leading the way and I think that it 's a it is an opportunity for our city to be doing that and we know that from disaster comes opportunity as well informed and proactive approaches to natural hazards risks well you know the fact that we 're actually technically still in the state of emergency while we debate this you know as a just a constant reminder of the state that we 're on increasing active public and shared transport opportunities and use I think I 've expressed myself many times about how concerning it is that that public transport hasn 't really been able to take off on Christchurch the way it supply and improved waterways these are all priorities for us we have a lot of challenges though and as I 've said in the plan we 're investigating a whole range of options rates and come is not going to be a sustainable way of funding this counts or other councils into the future and we need to be working with central government about different ways of funding but the reality of this long-term plan the most important message is that we have still got a long way to go in terms of our recovery from in terms of the work that still needs to be done and it is going to take some time and it does take a lot of a lot of resources to recover from a circumstance such as that we 've experienced so it does mean that we look to central government and in a way the government has made commitments to Christchurch with a stated desire to negotiated global settlement and capital acceleration facility as being developed with this comes the promise of a partnership approach to our relationship with central government which I and so I come back to the phrase where we 're in this together and I think we can achieve a lot more and we invite our communities to have a say in relation to their long term plan and and I hope that out of this process we develop a very clear vision for the future of our our city so I will open it up for debate Andrew thank you and there 's been some commentary about the 5.5% rate rise that we 're proposing as part of this draft long-term plan and 5.5% rates rises certainly more than some of us would ideally like to sing although the level of rates rise of course is directly related to what we 're able to deliver operationally in terms of levels of service and in terms of the capital program reserve relating to both horizontal and vertical infrastructure in particular so our clear intention as set out in this plan is to keep rate rises to a minimum whilst meeting community expectations around what we do and continuing to see an increase in the standard of the roads and still got a huge amount of work to do to get this back to pre-earthquake levels funding finding the balance between these considerations what we spend the money on and what a reasonable level of rates rise would be certainly hasn 't been easy it is something that we 've been working on for at least the last six months quite possibly longer so today we will approve the draft long term plan to go out for consultation and it 's important that we hear from the community about what the community thinks the right balance is and what they think about the balance that we 've found whether we 've got it right whether we should be doing more whether we should be doing less and of course realizing that to do more costs more and to do less costs less we think we 've got the balance right with that 55.5% rates rise and the the amount of work that we 're doing in each area really reflects this but we 're certainly very keen to hear from the community whether the community thinks that we 've got investment proposed into the a Corot Wharf development the navel point development plan finally and continued commitment to significant interest infrastructure projects such as the akaroa wastewater scheme these are all projects that are proposed to be done and completed within the life of this plan and some of them sooner rather than later and whilst I know that Rachel Isis will be felt on Banks Peninsula as they will in other parts of the city I also know that the peninsula is seeing significant investments in two key infrastructure I know there 'll be submissions relating to new projects many of which are actually partnership opportunities with communities and and just reflecting on the mayor 's words that 's something that we welcome and things that we we would really welcome the opportunity to consider as part of our deliberations on the draft as we move into the final long term plan really keen to hear from as many community members as we can around what they think we should be doing and how we should be doing it so that we can respond effectively to those submissions and and the final long term plan as we approve it at the end of June so I 'll be interested to hear the community feedback and it 's important that we do hear that we 've done a lot of work since the earthquakes as a council and we 've already invested heavily in the recovery and regeneration of our city we 've still got a lot to do this is the opportunity for us to hear from the community about what our priority should be as we plan what really is the next 10 years of activity improvement investment and expenditure and my key message is that we welcome that feedback from the community I really want people to be engaging with this important and documents through the consultation document in the draft LTP so that we can absolutely get this right in terms of what the community wants us to be doing over the next ten years Sarah I 'm going to vote in favor clearly of the the draft day in spite of having some some really serious concerns because we need to hear from our communities only one opinion and if people share it then they need to speak out so much and speak at the hearings there 's a real disconnect between what we say are our priorities climate change leadership waterways enabling active citizenship increasing active public and shared transport opportunities and what we 're currently proposing to fund enabling active communities in citizenship I don 't know if you remember that that in the metro funding round last year the we had a unanimous decision of councillors to increase in the draft LTP the amount of community funding available to enable our citizens to in fact contribute more to their communities we decided that we would like to put in 10% more this year and then make it inflation adjusted after that there will be seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars approximately less than 10% of what we 're putting into the cathedral many community events such as Carols by Candlelight are at risk because council has increased costs of compliance and made it more difficult for these groups to run valued events even with the number of volunteer hours that they were means that we will face the same situation again next year having to say no to many of those active citizen groups who want to contribute to the city but struggle with final funding in the sustainability of the sheer number of volunteer hours involved a major cycle routes failing in our commitment to combat climate change in a low-lying city is a dereliction of duty for our citizens especially when climate change leadership is a priority transport emissions make up 40% of our emissions as a City January was our hottest on record and yet we had to flooding events the cycle ways are an easy target but they are the biggest thing that we can do as a city to mitigate the impacts of increased extreme weather being events on our city in setting aside climate change as if we could I am simply not sure that there 's some simple economic realities of our transport to the transportation system have around the table we 're expecting 10,000 more people to be working in the central city in the next three years 83% of them will be in more cars in the central city and as well as the increased congestion we simply cannot afford to build another 10 which filled street car parking buildings at 32 million dollars each to store them all on our Central City was dying before the earthquakes and simply putting back the same 20th century infrastructure back we 'll get the same result do we want our CBD to thrive or are we happy to let it die cycleways are hard that controversial and they 're difficult everywhere they take real leadership to implement and that 's not what this LTP is offering our communities we have heard at the highest levels that climate change is the nuclear-free moment of our generation and we as a council have signed the global covenant of Mears for climate change committing us to get Christchurch to net neutrality by 2050 we committed to action not just nice words on paper that is difficult but it is essential yeah the long temper in 2018 228 the ten years is very important for our city at eager for the future of our city if we review how we are open to new ideas new people new ways of doing things a place where anything is possible but we are aware last year we already launched the multicultural strategy also there kind of the vision the purpose we went as Perry respect all the treaty of waitangi what but the others expect is all committeeman you know if every person feels a sense of belonging and also is commitment by the council to give every person an equal opportunity to access all services information as well as participate in a decision-making process if today we review all those 6 the strategic direction to fulfill to implement of this la vision you can see for instance I won the particular mayor she mentioned earlier enabling active citizenship in a conducted community but we need to be aware you know we need to kind of a new way before we follow our publication to let your graphic area then we need to reform not only geographically so timo demographic because in this city as the 25 percentage of people respond overseas we need to to face this effect how to gather this information then they can the feedback to the council so if they choose we are not only focus on our tradition I know this very very best no infrastructure because there 's in related to outer the hills all the well-being we still follow but we still put a big amount of money on that like a water supply no like a road like a stone water like a pearl river that 's absolutely very important part regarding to the if this the city is the city of opportunity how do we to keep those two people are since strong since they are part of the inner city so my view we need to strengthen the Civic international relations this group I 'm not sure whether they are big a sufficient resources committed the nice needs are inácio also regarding a community service the department if the part it is not sufficient then we open to the public we welcome then they can feedback to make that happen and also these cities innovational cities of particular the mayor also mentioned or we are enlisted together if we saw can make that happen we need to welcome the regional national in the even over system working together participate investor in this the city for how do we to make the happen we need to be thinking about how to way to work in the together and also this innovation we saw there 's a new course new technology how do we get this one whether we create a good environment to can be the vector this happened not only council need to think about it but a community also need to think about the other one is an fatigue you lied to de-emphasize the regarding to other a train medium for casitas square because why because i still color some several email from no social economical or people people their predictions and this is the kind of regressive detector but i still like to talk to name you know actually this a small amount per year only seven point of one night per week only 30 in the same easy to be the collector and also even we extension for the 10 years but actually sooner a fun racing the foundation probably only five five years we can stop so now pick a potent for those paper I study economics I fully understand the requires a pro questioner text I just wanted a no no Bastille welcome them can be a fee Peck last ones I would like to emphasize the community facility I 'm happy you know the Guardian assault waster the new a library and also service center in the laser Center still put on The Bachelor they said carry forward I 'm only sir I 'll review lost master prep actually the new home P Library Service Center will be open in July of last year same as the fish ' theaters service in túcume Center library in the same master Sam nieuwe but we are delay today but many reasons but right now the location right now the the concentration for the classification for reserve actor there 's the timing we need to go on to be a more faster we need to community also work in the with the council together but anyway this is the just--it rafter the non temple but it 's the people committed feedback to us thank you and first of all I 'd like to say a huge thank you to staff and actually even the legal team because this has been a huge and mammoth task getting this together and even the consultation document which has been rewritten I don 't know 120 times this is fantastic to see something that 's all ready to go out and I think the acknowledgement is particularly true because looking at the numbers it is particularly hard if we look on page 17 of our documents in page 7 of the actual report it says about the cost the the council was left with seven point seven billion to fund by way of rates debts and other sources from the earthquake costs so the concept that the government was going to come in here and help us and everything would be hunky-dory and everything would look at like it used to was completely illusory and the costs that remain according to Deloitte a reasonably independent source of information they they 've cost the council the earthquakes have so far cost the be paid over the next thirty years as 5.7 billion that 's the scope of the problem there this 10-year plan attempts to sort out in a way that leaves at least marginally affordable rates and and that 's for a council that previously had very low debt levels and and also owned major assets so thank goodness in this case for Orion and the airport which have enabled us to do a capital release without selling them but to use their assets while all the assets but most of it comes from around and the airport in terms of raising capital bonds I think if we look at the future of this over the next 30 years the fact that we have to find this sort of money means that we do have to look at new ways of doing things and be open to new ideas and look at other possibilities and that 's why in the consultation document we ask people do they want to look at other funding mechanisms so Auckland for example which apparently faces the problems of high growth is allowed to have a needing to spend 5.7 billion over the next 30 years on a major disaster recovery just to get things back to where they were in terms of stormwater drainage water all those sorts of things if we had had for example a four cents a litre fuel tax rate raised this year would have been around 1.9 percent because the additional income that would come in operationally from that would be the equivalent to about three point something percent on rates and I think we need to look at and I 'm glad that we 've asked people about what are the other ways that we can actually raise raise monies because rates have never been and I did my poli-sci thesis my master 's thesis on local government finance and looked at rating as a mechanism even then which was a long time ago it wasn 't a good mechanism for equity or anything it 's still not and actually if you look at the impact of this it 's it 's it 's actually doesn 't it doesn 't work as the largest form of income generation for of looking at was this some way in which we could actually recoup some benefit to the community from water bottling plants because the community does not love them in any way shape or form we 've struggled with the concept of a targeted rate we 've struggled with all sorts of ways of doing it and I have to say the legal legal team have been very thorough on looking at what we can do so we 've asked the question just in case in terms of the wisdom of the crowds there are ways that other people have thought of that we haven 't yet because if people extract billions of litres of water they need to actually be able to recruit the community needs to recoup something from that or at least get something back from from their major major extraction and so I 'm hoping that in terms of the submissions that we get that we will get people looking at effect that looking forward rates are as you say Lian not a sustainable way of funding such massive repairs and I don 't actually ever _''_6279.46 I just never get there it makes no sense to me whatsoever that they can have a fuel tax and we couldn 't even if 99% of our population wanted it so I 'm keen that we keep asking those questions if that 's what the people of Christchurch actually want because I think looking at this it 's very difficult and I think people have done amazingly well to get to put this together but it 's this is a very different budget then if you looked at the Christchurch budget 20 years ago and looking forward it it doesn 't get a whole lot better just in terms of debt and and other things that need doing right well my heart rates down a little now I 'm a bit more relaxed I was gonna come in here today I 'd lost a bit of sleep the last few days leading into this because I had a fight to pick with my fellow counselors and miR and that fights now over thanks to the mere and I do sincerely thank you for coming up with a solution to issue of my community and that was a lady who couldn 't walk her children to school I had a problem and brought it up and hopefully we will now have a solution and in res and in part 9 up there we can see it and that is the public having the opportunity to feedback on the in sections they feel are dangerous and also it gives the public the opportunity and community boards the opportunity to tell us where they want to see road improvements when it comes to the surfaces or footpaths a couple of my fellow councillors have raised that they have foot parts in the areas where there 's only one on one side of the street well we have one up and here with which has got no footpath on either side of the street and everyone at the table will now get ready to put your cringe faces on when you look at me because my child my children are driven to school and that driven to school because where we live in all our neighbours and this nine school-age children in our in town and there 's a few there 'd be a couple of hundred children in their area so that 's a section of gardeners rope we 're there it 's a TKO now there are no footpaths on either side of the road or cycleway and there isn 't also no veg there 's some long grass to walk through on a wet day and that 's for the parents that will let their children go down there now some of the kids do bike down there to go to school but my wife is on your categorize her as a worrywart there 's one you could use she sees my 10 year old son has no road sense and there 's a lot of women out there would say that about all me but there is my son and so he can 't bike to school I 'm a little more relaxed on the rules and would probably let himself bike down that road myself ADK now a lot of tracks it 's probably not the best idea so thank you very much Leanne for including that and of feedback and if we don 't if we don 't get feedback and support from the community on the particular named intersection then that will be the last year of it from me if it doesn 't come back but I assume we will so we 'll leave that there now there 's a couple other issues I want to raise one is and I 've been contacted by a number of people around the 5.5% rates rise that 's the one part of this whole consultation process I don 't like and don 't support I 'm not in 25.5% wind our inflation rates 1.9 I don 't believe we 've done enough to reduce our spending I think our community facilities that were putting in way over spec and far too flesh for the type of city we really are and we need to be more realistic about that once upon a time when I was a kid growing up I 'm not that old you know I I know I look 28 but I 'm actually considerably older than that the when I was growing up they were converted school buildings and so on and so forth but it was a box that has the community that you met and they had crafts groups they had scout groups they had all sorts of people using them karate groups and you had a working kitchen normally went with stainless steel and some toilets that were pretty basic but they worked and at some point this city flipped the switch and now our community facilities when architectural awards and and on funny angles and I 've got imported glass and it 's just the miracles of of of the building industry but is that really what we need I know it 's what a lot of us would like and we want but I don 't believe we can afford it and there is something we 've never addressed we 've never asked the community and these the facilities you actually really want because this is the cost and it 's 5.5% when inflation is 1.9 and I think that massive population in our city who on fixed income because they 're retired and they may be asset live in good neighborhoods that cost them a great deal of money to be there and now they can 't afford to stay there and as a council we say just sell your property of taken reverse mortgage it 's unacceptable we should be facilitating the way people want to live their lives not telling them how they should live their lives so I invite more people in this LTP to submit on how they don 't want us to spend money I don 't want to hear from that normal 500 to a thousand people that tell us how much more they want I don 't like to hear from those that want to tell us how much less they want us to spend it 's easier to add on it 's a little harder to take off and then I 'll go down to I want to follow on from what Vicki said around funding mechanisms because the rating model was a bit of a flawed model and we are lucky to have the assets we do but let 's hear from those other people out there we council and create revenue for the city from things we 've never thought of what are all of those ideas and concepts in a way forward that create employment and create income for the city this social enterprises that could be social enterprises that are a partnership with the city that don 't cost us money they actually make us money and create employment why do they look like and what are those ideas and models let 's see those and that can help reduce our rates increases and finally the cycle works because I know it 's going to come up this time and I 've been a supporter a few years back I was the one that added in the 20 levy for active transport and it included the coastal pathway which I will say will become the hottest ride in the country it is going to be so popular I will consider myself to put in a bike hire slash rollerskating and I just gave the idea away business at the eastery end but that will be a booming business that place is going to be amazing then there 's the head-to-head walkway in the cycle ways but the budgets gone crazy on the cycle ways and no doubt we will hear back about that and I can handle that a little because there is a decent government subsidy involved but what I am struggling with is the up taking people cycling I don 't think it 's good enough for a city that 's flat that the weather as majority really we 've got to face it we 're quite lazy as people crush ditch we 're lazy it 's an easy City to bike and but we 're doing no promotion to make cycling the new black that is where you fall down Westfield would never spend a couple hundred million dollars building a complex and then spend a few thousand promoting it it would fall over cycle ways we have to do the same so whether that money comes from government I 've brought it up at Health Board because they get a big one out of it or it comes from Council wherever we have to promote the cycle ways they are going to get everyone on board and wanting them more and embracing them more thanks Lee and I 'd like to start by thanking the staff to this has been an enormous amount of work and you know I think the staff in Council counselors have worked really well together to come up with the consultation document and like clearly this is a time to wean as a council we take stock of looking at the future challenges and what we can what we need to budget for and to severe are key projects and so that that challenges I think that clearly that 's in the document that that it 's that balance between what people expect around delivery of our services and ability as a council to fund those costs through rates and debt unless we are able to come up with some other methods of funding as Vickie suggests there suggested and I think one of the difficulties for us as a council was that earlier on several terms back there were some early public announcements after the 2011 earthquakes that really have led to some quite unrealistic I think having all of our city streets fixed straight away is probably an example and clearly from the the the document and especially around the horizontal infrastructure part the challenge actually is really enormous so we but we 're making a great start I think the the document is about how we can work to become more resilient in the face are and to be also to be prepared for future events and I guess having the be event like we had yesterday and last night reminds us that in fact this is a series and like last year we also had the port it was fire and this is us has been a series of flood events which when it comes to climate change we need to be prepared for so I think the consultation clearly is a better balance between those key challenges earthquake recovery and maintenance of air services and then we need to plan from at least medium population growth as against affordability through mainly rates so I think given those challenges in the costs since 2011 compete with other cities that haven 't had a major earthquake on air infrastructure Christchurch has been doing remarkably well and I 'm sure we 'll continue to but those flooding events of last night and clearly we dodged dodge more than bullet it was like dodging a shot a shotgun cartridge that reminds us though how much we have to prepare for climate change and climate change in leadership is clearly a key community outcome for us and as this key strategic direction that we need to make sure happens and I guess that 's something actually the weather is often discussed in the media but not the importance of climate change and how in fact the other key strategic direction for us to be informed and proactive and taking those approaches around our natural hazard risk or risks so and I think our infrastructure strategy is really clear about the projects for resilience and the natural hazards in the long term sea level rise and climate change and clearly some of our assets in the longer term are going to need to be moved to higher ground so and I 'm encouraged and we 've done term plan there 's a lot of mitigation measures including for example stop banks in the detention ponds and clearly we are going to prioritize work and ask residents to comment on this about how we reduce flood in some areas and particularly for people who are vulnerable so overall I 'm really pleased that the long-term plan makes provision particularly for the natural hazards area and maintain that we maintain a proven prudent level of Headroom in in the event of a further large-scale natural disaster there 's reference right at the end of the consultation document in relation to heritage and the Central City landmark grant fund and exactly recent examples we all visit it was the Midland club or Knox for Terrace and to keep that fun going I think as essential and I hope that residents comment on their in the old post office in in the square as an example of what we 're I think as a council we will need to retain the central city landmark grant fund so clearly in the end the consultation document we 've prioritized projects as a council approach and I along with others councillors I hope that the the consultation document that it generates a good number of submissions about residents priorities and so that we 're also well informed when we do our final decision-making thank you and I wanted to take this chance just to affirm you 're really cool on that state of emergency I was going to say that anyway on dinner saw the email come through met but I thought there was a very good call and I also wanted to acknowledge the staff including the financial staff who were part of the civil defense team yesterday and have had to backup today being here for the draft long term plan my views on our where we 're at with our plan our that it seems to me with still living and what I would call a tension between the council 's delivery of what it delivers the the more basic needs around the city and the Esper ational which we 're planning as well seven years after the quakes and we 're reminded of this tension occasionally through commentary mass media our rates you know we see these as the priorities have you got it right so this long-term plan process will be an opportunity for the public and I really hope people who may not have thought of coming into council before really take this opportunity to come in and tell us so it 's one thing to say it in social media most media come in and let 's have that conversation face to face we have many opportunities ahead of US personnel Fila but court is a city councilor party to the leader expectations with region over areas such as the residential red zone which I 'm also the ward councillor for much of that I 'm starting to get a bit antsy over progress I do understand the process and where it 's at but I really want some movement in the residential red zone it 's an opportunity for us visa V climate change you know without it doesn 't have to involve necessarily millions in the beginning for us to get started and demonstrably show we are committed to mitigating some of the effects of zone as a climate sync there are other ways of maximizing our income if you look at the dividend payment from our companies they comprise 20% of our income so my question would be in this process are we maximizing the dividend return from all our companies especially the bigger ones I 'm not going to single any out at this stage but that 's just a question I 'd like to leave are we maximizing the return from all our companies and the counselors and others will know what I 'm talking about when that when they look at the figures there but let 's hear from the community it 's really important you have your say the council has always had I think a fairly vigorous relationship with the community here in Christchurch it 's kind of the dynamic of the city it 's a city village and people pre and post earthquake have always challenged the council 's so keep doing that and come and see us and let 's have this conversation let 's just get it out thank you ooh you I support the long-term may not necessarily agree with all of the aspects of the LTP as its proposed but I 'm very keen to see the citizens of Christchurch express their opinion on the various aspects of the LTP and give us some priorities as to what they think these opinions I believe will go a long way to giving us some direction for the final content of the LTP personally I 'm actually very supportive of giving greater attention to our traditional core values of council provision of services roading three waters for example in my mind there 's still a huge amount of recovery of our infrastructure post-earthquake really a high degree of prioritization will be needed to ensure that the worst is dealt with first I 'm quite encouraged with their LTP vision Christchurch is a city of opportunity for all open to new ideas new people and new ways of doing things a city where anything is possible and I 'm struggling to learn that off by heart because I think it 's something that we 're probably going to trot out fairly well all the time it 's on the City Council giving core functions of its operation greater emphasis however I 'm a great supporter of this vision and particularly the two last phrases new ways of doing things in a city where anything is possible that 's quite obvious and previous speakers have emphasized this that the rates model is becoming a burden for our ratepayers so I look forward to the citizens and citizens of Christchurch through this consultation process giving us some direction in support for new ideas to develop complementary models that will enable us to complete our earthquake repairs and then consequently the city to be able to return to a more business as usual model thank you Tim thank you I totally support the long-term plan the draft long-term plan I 'm very much looking forward to giving feedback from the air citizens and business its variant simpleness that you do needs and once you deliver what you need to and then you cut the wants to what you can do with this with our city it 's a lot different we have needs and we have have twos and then we 're going to really hear from our community as elected members we 've heard from community groups interest groups but as community board members we 've also heard from the general communities as a whole so I think that we as individuals are gonna get some um interesting feedback from our communities with regards to our 5.5 rates and what our communities and our citizens want as we 've heard that some communities are more resilient than others with the governor 's by GT as one example but communities are like very much like people some need more help than others but all are equal so we 've got to take that on as counselors and not look at our personal in our own communities but the city as a whole and that 's a responsibility that we all have over and above our community boards my young colleague Aaron here mentioned about the youngster waiting for the 21st party environment the community facilities becoming palaces or being designed so if we were really looking at commit these and I do think we got carried away following the earthquake design but but made bigger or smaller to commit to fit the community 's needs because the key to a community center as access for all whether they have a disability whether it 's physical or intellectual or whether they 're perfectly healthy it 's about putting community use into those buildings I think we could have done a lot better and hopefully we 're going to get some feedback from our communities with gas to that recently I crossed the floor and spoke to a hearing on behalf of the Summit Road Protection Authority with regards to closing the proposal to close the Summit Road from rail pecky to give his pass overnight we as a city have pushed for recreation and their people to get out and get healthy we 've been incredibly successful with it we now have over a million people a year using the tracks and paths between Godley head and give his pass which is absolutely outstanding but we don 't follow it up by protecting those environments our generation are the ones that have to clean up our rivers our generation are the the peninsula as a whole we 're the ones that have been handed this environment and this is not a want but a need and it 's going to be interesting to hear back from our communities about where they want this waiting it 's going to be an interesting journey because of those needs and have to s have to weigh up against the wants because the wants are what gives you a city it 's heart that pumps the blood that gives us at soul it 's a friendly smile and that twinkle in the eye to want people to be here but you actually need the three waters and the roads to live here so thank you okay and risk a hippie with their CD and have legislation so it gets a very very good start and I would like to mention the determining ratio paragraph in there because it 's important that this keeps us well under the two hundred fifty percent recommended by the New Zealand funding agency and it allows us a financial heed room with New Haven young unplanned call on air funds percent of any costs prior to the crown sixty percent contribution so I think that 's really important to note theater and another thing that we must also be prudent about and aware of is that the higher our capital investment and any facility in the higher the operating costs will be for the rate payer over the life of dead St which may be 15 years or even more so I want to hear from people about their views about the size and scale and scope of our proposed facilities just to ensure that the advice of appropriate and affordable and affordabl into the future and I especially welcome as the mirror alluded to in her opening statements so any proactive communities who want to build and operate their own facilities there 's a targeted rate mentioned in there too and this has come from the archive community looking at a way to Thunder a help tough and I think this was actually pursuing a bit further and doing some work around that I 'm not sure how that would actually be implemented in the metropolitan area but I our major cycleway programs are the remainder of the 13 routes the plan for delivery over ten years and part of the reason for the ten years from now is that as these extra child challenges that we 've faced and for instance we thought we perhaps could take some roots down kiwiRail corridors that have found that that 's not workable so extra money is required to to choose different routes which often longer and there 's also co-op health and safety legislation concerning the rail barriers of to cost as well and the mess of consultation programs that we embark on with the people around each route so it 's comforting to know that so far we 've completed the three full routes in one section of the Rapanui shaped Rock and also it 's really good to know that the usage numbers are very impressive and growing daily so we have a prudent program near which is affordable and deliverable over ten years and we 're still able to access the ebon cycle way fund and the NZTA funds to assist us to do that with our reduce the flooding and the prequel to pre quake levels but also while embracing environmental and waterway improvements we 're possible and very our capital works so we can see the 48 million dollars that we spent on flopped and was deployed again yesterday and has proved to be effective and diverting thousands of qmix of potential flood waters away from people 's homes but the Heathcott area now the next priority and we 're just being delivered now so I think this this draft out really strikes a good balance a balance to deliver levels of service to continue our repairs to embrace the opportunities for betterment and improving our biodiversity or environment yet now City we 're possible and responding to in being prepared to events and including climate change and a balance between our rates increase our timing and affordability of the capital program and deep service ability and Cal secure and I mentioned inflation previously but as far as I know we use an inflation rate of 3.3% which is actually the construction industry rate rather than the CPI oh I said it may make a it um and although we 'll see some deterioration in our wastewater SCS due to delays in some renewals and it is a little bit of concern it 's about prioritizing these routes across the whole broad program we just can 't_''_7906.719 can 't even and people make feedback on it and give us some guidance on what the what is that so we have here a preferred option and the document and I really do look forward to people telling us if they have any preferences for one project over another recognizing that we 're looking at substitutions at this stage in order to maintain a rates increase it under 5.5 along with our prudent level of debt and at the public fora where they can do this they can mix and match between the high and low you know negative one with the other the consultation document outlines very clearly what our financial challenges are what our climate change challenges are and there we still face considerable earthquake legacy repairs and restoration so no Papa no Yunus would probably our main project does the albeit controversial was an mitigation if it 's at seventeen and this is big money for cars I think councillor T Bhushan alluded to that previously but we also have a new community center for sand ovens of three million dollars and of course we hear the community leads project they need to be a pool project which is currently not included in any council budget but it is a leader in the way that we would like things to be delivered by it to the communities and I think we need to look at equity across the our city when we 're looking at these sorts of projects so I 'd like to reiterate others views and comments on in thinking of staff who labored long and hard over this document for months and months and months and with its contain strategies it 's been an incredibly huge amount of work so thank you thank you yeah needy on a Anna Mike come I 'll tow endorse the work that 's gone on and into this and you know LT Pazin are never easy and particularly excuse me um in a city where the last few years so you know it does take a lot of effort to put these documents together I think there 's there 's several important points to make in terms of context and it 's not just the impact of the earthquakes but it is things like the forced amalgamation with the peninsula the cost of taking on the peninsula has been absolutely massive to the city that happened long before the earthquake the cost of the earthquakes and obviously the relationship with central government has been a huge issue interesting to note that when the council did its own Central City plan the cost was about 800 million of capital the government came in with 1.2 billion so you know it was on top of the 800 moon so there 's been a huge cost put on the city not just from the government what it has or hasn 't done as part of the cost share but on other decisions that have also been made like for example designating our central library as a site for a convention center which has meant that we didn 't that was a choice that we made given our financial predicament so we 've had to build it new at it at a huge cost there 's also been the decision to close merge and relocate schools and we 're now as a council picking up the traffic safety improvements for those students because of the impact of those decisions decisions by the government the previous government to make it incredibly easy to demolish listed heritage buildings in our city which our community felt strongly should be retained has led to a huge demand on our heritage funding as a city so asking the question I think of can we afford to fix private fund private heritage buildings being fixed well our own publicly owned heritage buildings are put on hold there 's a really important question to ask there 's been another I think layer to the increased cost and burden of us as a city and that is the the duplication and emergence of entities being set up after the earthquake the cost of contractors consultants chief executives boards of directors has been I think astronomic when you on some of the projects whether it 's taxpayers or ratepayers we seem to have enabled this huge proliferation of entities often doing quite similar things using similar resources at a huge cost before we make decisions and I think we do need to look at that and look at how we can get a lot better synergy and efficiency and for me it comes down to actually council should be delivering some of these things rather than having separate new agencies doing it but you know there may be opportunities to look at that going forward we really do need to focus I think on operational will we 've heard a lot today about the capital but actually the operational the basic maintenance of our city is a really important thing that we need to get on top of and I welcome having that conversation with our community and looking at how we can improve that I totally endorse the idea that you know we should be proud to be considered a Garden City and we should try and make Christchurch beautiful again because the psychological impact on people untidy parks and Missi streets it is actually quite significant and I think it is important that we adjust that can I just make a few other points one is that in regards to the the budget I still think that this budget is in terms of the capital as it 's more of a coffee and croissants budget than a bread and butter budget and I think that 's the real key thing that we need to address there 's some things in our budget which to me certainly make no sense at all Park Terrace is scheduled to have a three million dollar upgrade after we 've just fixed it so I can 't understand why we 'd be spending money if you look at some of the intersection safety improvements in the accessible city program there 's a whole bunch of money being spent again and again on the same stretch of roads that are linked unto other projects which again it seems a huge duplication and waste it also seems to be unnecessarily gold-plating the central city he referred straight for two blocks we 're proposing far would that go to fixing some other broken roads in the suburbs a long way I would suggest Cathedral Square we 've doubled the funding for Cathedral Square we had four point six million in the cost year this budget is proposing to go to nearly ten million we 've got central city development contributions going to I think what are some of the wealthiest people in the city and we 're putting you know money in for private developers to have central city rebate contributions when we can 't afford to fix our own social housing what does that say about priorities people have touched on the northern arterial improvements you know the irony of spending you know close to 70 million dollars on those improvements for cards coming into the central city while spending a huge amount of money on cycle ways to try and encourage people to use alternative means of transport while slowing the central city down and trying to remove cars from the Central City it seems to be a real contradiction I didn 't put the right I thought people were playing ok you know there 's still a long way to go I think of fixing this capital program I think there 's a huge opportunity to still make some savings I just wanted to conclude with two points one is that I totally endorse the comment that rates are not an affordable way forward it simply is not reasonable to expect our community to continually face rates increases to fund the things that we need to do in a city and I welcome the opportunity to look at that and finally I 'll just leave with a quote from Edward de Bono and and just before I do that I just wanted to just give you the example of or I 'll read the quote first and finish with the example in the future he says instead of striving to be right at a high cost it will be more appropriate to be flexible and plural at a lower cost if you cannot accurately project the future then you must mix early be prepared to deal with the various possible futures and in conclusion I just want to say I had the weekend and going to London Street where the council just closed the street we didn 't spend 10 million dollars or 16 million dollars as we 've got in our accessible city on that street we simply by closing the street you got a much better safer pedestrian environment that gave a real sense of community so there 's ways that we can save money and I give you as that a real tangible example thank you I just ask that you also put the cathedral levy separate so that those of us who didn 't support it previously can have our votes record it against it 's it 's not the vote today it 's it will be put separately when we get to the end of the LTP Dion yeah I was gonna say the same thing actually about there but I 'm not too happy with this to be quite honest I I have some struggles and the first thing that I have struggles with is as part of this I 've got four key points I want to talk about actually there 's five the this is the way we are proposing this to our communities almost every core fundamental part of our what a council does in terms of its infrastructure is going backwards over the next ten years I don 't think that 's acceptable I really don 't our road network and I 'll just just give me a second and I 'll just go back to the right screen that I had here our carriage way is is decreasing in standard by ten percent over the next ten years that 's our roads the surfaces the stormwater is going backwards by about five percent compared to where it is now our wastewater is going backwards by about five percent I 'm pleased to see how will our fresh water supply is going up a little bit but we 're putting rates up there at double what they were before the earthquake and I know we have some major financial constraints around the earthquake and the recovery but I don 't think we are fighting hard enough for our city is my gut feeling we need to be going to the government guys really need to support the city we are a big player in the South Island and you guys need to support the city because I am really upset that our main core infrastructure is going backwards in this plan that we 're proposing now I want people to dig into this and look at it is lot of information in this actually there 's a heck of a lot of information and this is just on the capital stuff one of the things I 'm talking about with with optics I don 't think we as a council have had a real dig into the optics I know they have in the staff and there 's probably their mix about management verse staff but we need to because I 'm looking at this and I did some rough calculations last night then amongst all the other stuff that was going on around flooding if we spent another 50 25 million dollars on the roads over the next two years if you look at this spreadsheet so that all the graphs that we get it would it be the same we are going to be spending there anyway so if we spent 25 million dollars more on road improvements we would get two million dollars savings and optics which is actually the same rates impact that you would have versus the optics if we 're going to be charging rates or the capex if we 're going to be borrowing it to do the work so I think there 's some real deep dives that we need to look at in that respect I think there 's some savings that we can have long-term and actually make the city a better place in terms of the level of service the cycleways stuff I I have to say this if you look at the cycle ways initially it was fifty six million dollars sixty eight million dollars sorry after a Dutch person came here it was changed to one hundred and fifty six million dollars because they went from on street to off street if you look at this in this long term plan we 're asking for another two hundred and six million on top of what we 're spending consultation document we have to ask you you know we have to ask people you know it 's before the rebate yes there is rebate but we still have to put a lot of that money and we have to you know I want people to actually look at that and go what do you value what do you want right now because we don 't have the money to keep the basic infrastructure up in that that does concern me one of the comments was to do more costs more yes and in reality it does but with the example that I just said before doing more actually means where the save in the in terms of the operational costs that we have as a city doing less will cost more so that the equation doesn 't necessarily work as easy as it as it sounds and I know there 's probably more complications and they 're effective but I do really feel we need to do a bit more work on on getting that and especially around the corner infrastructures in the infrastructure strategy as public it 's enough I just think we need to be spending more money the money that we do get and prudently sensibly and strategically around the long term infrastructure stuff and I you know when we 're talking about revenue I mean a fuel tax is great in theory and stuff like that but I 'm going to repeat it here that I 've said a number of times before we already pay 15 to 20 cents per liter more than Auckland now so in effect were already subsidizing the North Island for their fuel on the South Island so we need to say to the government yes fuel tax might actually help local government but you need to regulate that industry first because otherwise we 're just doubly taxing our poor people and and Christchurch the residents are going to be paying the taxes anyway council companies yes I 've had a quick look at that and I do think we need we bought the city has more assets in terms of the companies that we own than we did previously bought pilot you know we 've we 've acquired some the way that we wanted them to perform are we actually getting what we wanted to get out of them I do not think so I think we need to have some you know some actually you know how are they going to deliver for the city not just in a financial way but actually how can they benefit the residents of the city not just us as a city council you know the other thing that I think about when I think about revenue as we paid everybody pays GST on rights there 's a tax on top of a tax you know that 's a free fifty to sixty million dollar tax for the government I think there should be just seen in it back to us and saying here you go here 's your GST on your rates and that 's actually in 50 or 60 million dollars or even you we could just have overnight and all councils should be looking at that actually because it 's not fearful ratepayers who are paying a tax and then having to pay a GST tax on that again be looking at as the depreciation on our assets we 're building a brand new city we 've got all his brand new assets and the government changed laws and it 's actually affecting how we can do our text tape and other things like that in terms of what we can borrow against but I just wanted to finish on the Central City when it comes to transporting to the central city I think we really need to not just think about circle ways we need to be thinking about public transport so we need to be going kept in hand with the SE ek and actually looking at this and the long term plan process that both our councils are going through and saying how can we make our public transport system work in the long term plan you 'll notice we 're spending 23 million dollars on buying the bus exchange if we don 't have people using buses we 're not going to be getting a good return on investment on that great asset that the government did build as part of the recovery plan so their levels of service another there 's also yes sorry I 'll start that again there 's also level of services and optics with where we have headed I example identified and that 's been moved but there are other things in there that that I think a lot of people would open their eyes at and balk at you know and we and I 'd really encourage people with they 're going to be looking at this long term plan to look into those details around what is actually in what 's out and actually understand their and we yeah I 'm going to stop there I think I 've seen enough but that 's just where I sit with this at the moment thank you hmm is a amore proverb that says my upon my Pharaoh or T to mahi if worker and chief pull together the job is done we 're in this together the main challenge for us all has been to balance the significant cost of work that needs to be done on our infrastructure the speed with which the work is done and rates rates increase as low as possible while we work to complete remaining earthquake repairs renew aging infrastructure and maintain a focus on regeneration thus draft LTP purposes proposes to keep rates at an acceptable level by deferring some aspects of the capital program in maintaining the current rate of borrow borrowing this proposal meets our obligations imposed on every local authority which include ensuring prudent stewardship and the efficient and effective use of the city 's resources including effectively planning for future management of our assets we would not be here without an incredibly hard-working team who have gathered information to bring us answered endless questions often the same ones over and over responded to requests for even more information graciously and patiently we are indeed fortunate to have such a team of people who themselves are residents who go over and above for the good of the city so thank you for the work that you 've done I 'd love this this proverb to widen to include a whole community so that we are all working together going forward we need to build active citizens by valuing and to partner with us and to care for each other and our place we can do so much more when we work together mapping all my pharoahe or t2 mahi we can do this together thank you um Grif down on one of those points I think sometimes we look too hard at to keep a little project in and forget actually about the operational side and not around the maintenance because that needs work but there 's a lot of other things that we spend money on and like the amount of money we give to to DCL regenerate regenerate christchurch it 's phenomenal and this is where the real rates increases come from I just like to correct day on around the cycle ways we 're not looking to add an additional two hundred million dollars it 's an additional 90 million dollars and up to sixty s in sixty six percent that 's actually refunded by NZTA and the government so I think that 's an important thing to factor and look we 're in a difficult point of time where you know we 've got the to what we had before but actually what 's right for both now and into the future also continue to provide the core services without creating a rights burden on the people calling Christchurch home today and I personally don 't think we 've got that balance right the way the mechanism that we click rates does not work we have so many people actually on fixed incomes many of whom are elderly there are are struggling and we need to look at ways how we can collect revenue from different streams and potentially if your text may be there I think they would need to really expand to be more sub regional fuel tax is we have so many people moving out to where my hurry and Selwyn that still work in Christchurch and commuting you put in so much wear and tear on on the roads that we fund to repair so we need to look at look at ways we 're losing rates by that but it was still paying for that infrastructure I do I do look forward to listening to the people and hearing what don 't agree we 've got the balance right I do not send 5.5% is acceptable we cannot continually have five person plus race increases it just does not work and there are a couple of points in the draft LTP that I just want to focus on today and one of them is the major cycle waste program which in this draft is actually proposed to be pushed right out until 2028 which is 14 years after it was started and well bizarrely there are some belief that these cycleways they 're everywhere this this program is only 100 kilometers of cycleways which represents under 5% of the total transport network in the city heading to the only 50 kilometers of off-road cycleways that the city had before the program began then we were told it costs too much when the majority of this program is not funded by rates if we want to look at a transport infrastructure project that a my opinion gives bugger or benefit to Christchurch and cost more than the entire cycleway program we just have to look at the 12 kilometer 240 million sheer was 31 million dollars there 's actually 63 million dollars from previous and future council budgets fullest project plus another 50 million dollars for downstream effects there is a huge amount of capital money spent are very very small Road in project and what does it do it adds thousands of noisy co2 emitting cars into a peaceful suburb and will add zero benefit to the people of st. Albans however the actual benefits of increase in active transport is huge on so many levels and completing the full knee with sock waste is integral to this I want to focus on one benefit or one of the completed cycle ways which is the papua new parallel it goes past st. albans primary st. Albans careful ik pepper our street school to preschools it is a stone 's to our way to another three schools include in papua new high school it goes past the ground khandaan center it links up to the cycleway whole morale corridor which goes past another two or three schools this cycle wave built with the majority of funding coming from NZTA in the children to get to school the question is why would we want to delay this opportunity for other trusts Christchurch kids New Zealand last year so the number of cyclists killed on our roads nearly quadruple and we know young children that cycle are vulnerable providing safe cycling is so important we 've lost a generation to cycling and we cannot afford to wait any longer and providing safe cycling infrastructure is key to this you know I could have moved an amendment today to try and pull the funding back into where as previously agreed but I 'm happy to listen to the people of Christchurch and get a mandate from them because this is important it must be said though if we do not get these cycleways completed and if we do not improve active transport and public transport what we 've been seen in the CBD over recent times so if the congestion will pale in comparison to what we 're going to see in the near future we need to act but I will listen to the people and then we 'll act at that point disappointing to see that the rebuild of the once very popular Shirley Community Center has been deferred so far out it doesn 't even make the proposed 10-year plan this is unbelievable that a previously well used community center which was destroyed by the earthquakes has IFFT a hole in the community or not that will not be rebuilt until 20 years after the earthquake how is this acceptable what other communities will have this length of delay at the same time there 's other projects that have been added since the last long to implement all had massive increases in funding for one example naval point has gone from 750,000 to ten million dollars yet this community still goes without a community center as a community board we 've advocated for this community and for some reason we make one step forward just to get booted back and other two steps I don 't think is acceptable once again I will wait and listen to the submissions and then at that point I 'll make an amendment once the people say that it 's also not acceptable I will consultation but I urge my fellow cancers it 's time to listen the city is about to speak thank you well I 'll just close bays and I think this I 'm really pleased with the quality of the debates and how people have contributors their their views their their passions their concerns and the support for elements of the of the draft long term plan and I reiterated as a draft it is going out for public consultation and we do invite the public to have their say but I kind of want to go back to the sort of essential question that we are asking our community and that is that there is a balance between the significant cost of the work that needs to be done on our infrastructure the speed at which that work has done and rates affordability and they are the three core critical elements that have to come together when we resolve the long term plan and we have strive to keep the proposed rates increase as low as possible as it as low as possible that is the question that we ask at that they told us that we would have real concerns over some of our core infrastructure if we reduced it further but it is behavin on us to actually drill under that I agree with the points that have been made are we able to do better than that and also we have to look at that the levels of service we have to look at the level of rates increases and we have to look at the level of debt and a number of you have commented on all of those so I think that this has been an incredibly good debate because what it shows is that this is a draft it is going out for public feedback we do invite that feedback and I think it 's going to mean that the the debates that we have when we finally have the final draft in front of us are for consideration will be a very powerful one indeed so think thank you to each and every one of you and thank you to the staff for all of the incredible work that you 've put on done and in these times of floods a lot more water to flow under the bridge so on that note I will put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carries and we move on to the authorization for the general manager of Finance and commercial etc to make any amendments that 's not amendments so that you can ask your own questions but just so just to tidy up to make sure alignment with the Auditor General 's report and and then approving the process for consultation so I 'll move that and Andrew will second that and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and what 's next Oh so I and did we move that we reapply Standing Orders or do they just okay I can just close the meeting right on that note I declare the meeting closed thank you very much good week you _"

    "text": "joy 's for the delay because there was some wording changes to the consultation document I 'm just looking for comfort at the end of the room that people were nodding and smiling so I 'm assuming that the wording is okay he 's earnest okay the end is just one minor little tweak that we thought rather than creating a prior yep okay so so we 're just going to change the word establish to agree to a prioritization framework so I 'll just just quickly run through it that and and I 'm not going to specifically speak to it as such but there has been a lot of feedback expressing community concerns about the dangers presented a range of intersections and the example I 've used as as here word brains and gardeners rose and I know that Aaron Cohen will speak to that but also the state of many of our streets and footpaths as a council we wish to agree to a prioritization framework for intersection improvements and street and footpath renewals which ensures that we 're meeting the needs of our residents and that of our residents that we wish to prioritize and asking our residents what do they think we should take into account when prioritizing the work that needs to be done and do you think the priority should be informed by the local community board and I guess that that 's a bit of a an open question it 's pretty plain that local community boards know more about their local areas and the priorities and their local areas than we do collectively as the council so but we want people to turn their attention to the fact that community boards play this important role in terms of of priorities so let 's hear what the public have to say in relation to that so I 'm not moving that as an amendment of written that into the resolution which I will now move and seconder by Andrew noticed button there please and I think this is better down we we 'd start dealing with the consultation document rather than the underlying information that you 're going to adopt first no ok [Applause] its next blog page yeah but if it 't do that to be invitation it 's the background information yes so know include any amendments you want to make the first step is to adopt the information that forms the basis of the proposed LTP and is relied on by the consultation document well one of the one of the amendments that we have got amines the background information is and one of the levels of service sorry I 'm just a little unclear so do you want to do you want to highlight that on and copy it and we 'll put it somewhere else but um can you put it between nine and ten okay so we 're with that the we with the council Johansson amendments that 's here do they rate relate to the information yes has does they should be dealt with you you move adoption of the information and noting where it can be found and then amendments can be slaughtered in there so council Johansson moved by way of amendment there so put that in between five and six or is it no actually we have to do is we have all you 're doing is moving the adoption at this stage and if you 're opening it up for discussion and amendments and then oh okay yeah well we have moved sorry yeah I know I 'm just a confused as to why one goes there and one gets no but that 's right but that means that we can 't debate my amendment well what are three you will would we get to the contribution to the on form eight information we then move to the to adopting the consultation document and that 's when you could think of the meeting can discuss your proposed amendment to the consultation document okay all right all right so it 's been moved and seconded and there 's a First Amendment counselor Sarah Templeton and that seconded by and Galloway so I 'll put that amendment do you want to speak to the amendment it 's not quite the word I know it 's just um there 's a couple of extra words that got sent around to all the counselors just before just um in a realistic time frame with enough that there 's some sort of cost benefit staff or disadvantages advantages information not just the timeframe and the cost that counselors will need to inform their decision it was email ground yeah that 's it yeah I mean this section of coastal pathway is the last section it 's the most difficult it 's also the most most dangerous and it 's not enough funding currently on budget to get it built there 's probably enough to do some design work but we are unsure about that the the section is dangerous at the moment because they used to be a footpath around this corner connecting these two communities and really really highly used one on the weekends and that footpath was taken away as part of the Littleton Road corridor the mess movement in the rock for Rusk works and it was on the other side of the road it 's not able to be put back there it needs to be keen to leave it out in the annual plan last year we brought forward some coastal pathway funding and some other funding to enable the Croesus that they already had the design work done on and getting this information and I 'm aware that there will be submissions on this during the long term plan will allow us to make a decision in June whether or not to include funding for this really dangerous section of footpath around the corner good Yani bloom I guess we 're in debate so probably not we 're just doing the amendment yeah but just um I think the other thing for this one is like this is a cycle way and so you know we 're spending a fortune on cycle ways and this is one of the most obvious places where people cycle whether it 's recreation or commute and it does seem to me that when this information comes back we should actually be talking to NZTA again about getting it as part of an MCR it just seems ludicrous that it 's not being included and that it 's taking so long because this is an area that has had lots of I think risk and definitely needs to be addressed and so I 'm very just hearing the words can 't get out on to these three okay so I think we 'd need to include environmental costs in this I 'm sure yeah absolutely so it 's not just financial that the you know eat I trust and others will ever be watching closely how Phil look I 'm happy to support this everyone would like to see this actually happen the costs are going to be they 'll be useful to him because clearly they 're going be quite significant you know and I 'm sure that will there 'll be further debate though too in terms of the affordability of this project which is recreational as against the commuter cyclists that council you 're hence and referred to within their major cycleways program so whether central government come up with some more funding for that we perhaps can find out but in the meantime I 'm certainly happy to support this amendment all right I 'll put that motion just just a correction that this isn 't this particular section isn 't a recreational route this is a core council business section of the road due to life risk and we 're obliged as a council to put a safe pedestrian footpath back whether or not it 's go coastal pathway woody Bay as a council we need to provide a footpath for our residents around this dangerous corner right so I will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and council your hints and has an amendment which I 'll second over to Yanni very just very briefly I just think there 's been a lot of public concern at the state of our parks and I understand the intent behind removing the words which is that it 's quite hard to measure but I actually think in terms of the public perception of us aiming to be you know a beautiful garden city again it 's really important that we reinstate these words so I 've just suggested that we actually just leave these words and rather than delete them as is currently proposed and I don 't think it makes any material difference to the way in which staff run signal to the community that we do want our posts to be clean and tidy Dion so um I 'll just speak to it briefly because and I 'll come to it perhaps more when we get to the consultation document but but I made quite a thing about the fact that we are really proud of our status as New Zealand 's Garden City and we can 't afford to lose that and and we need to think about what that means and in the 21st century and I know that the Nommo trial has had its challenges and that 's partly why we 're reviewing that now so that we can gain the the benefits that it was intended to achieve while at the same time ensuring that we retain that status so that 's why I 'm making the clean and tidy amendment okay I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now I 'll put the amended motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now we move on consultation document and its compliance with the requirements of the Local Government Act we receive that Auditor General 's report and that the consultation document includes the following questions which relate to intersection safety in the state of roads and footpaths and that we adopt the consultation document for consultation including the Auditor General 's report I 'd like to move this seconded by Andrew so I 'd like to open the debate by by referring to the introduction that I wrote to the long-term plan to the consultation document and that is that and the phrasing that I 've used as we run this together and the reason that I 've used that phrase we 're in this together indicates that there is nothing that we can do alone that we can 't do better when we actually collaborate with others and that means collaborating with central government but it also means collaboration with our communities our communities are our frontline when it comes to noticing when things are wrong we are completely and utterly dependent on people letting us know when there are potholes letting us know when blame those that leave the rubbish as the culprits in that regard but you know it is important that we are hearing from our community all the time but that they see themselves as partners with us in order to ensure that one we maintain our garden city status but also that we 're able to achieve a lot more by way of community engagement and community involvement in their own facilities we have established a set of strategic priorities which form the platform for the way that we 're thinking as a council enabling active citizenship and connected communities and that means you know communities being able to do things for themselves with our support not council abandoning communities but actually engaging communities and the whole process and I love for example the governor 's Bay GT story and I love the story of the community facility that 's being developed at the church and South Brighton you know that when communities take ownership and actually put their own resources and time and energy into the particular project it means so much more it 's way more meaningful and contribute maximizing opportunities to develop a vibrant prosperous and sustainable 21st century city we have to think about sustainability and that 's what I often say and I 've said in the and the introduction that what a Garden City is in the 21st century is quite different from what it was when when I was growing up you know back in the day it was more about the the parks and the gardens and the flowers but now it 's about sustainability it 's about environmental protection it 's about ecological values it 's about clean rivers clean air and food resilience that that 's what a Garden City is a sustainable 21st century as Century City is today but the vibrancy and the prosperity we must have those as well and I know that you know that we look at some of the central city projects that we would have liked to have seen further advance but the idea of having a central city that people love to come into people love to live in you know again just love to see more people living in the central and of course prosperity is for all that this is we frame ourselves as a city of opportunity for all its this is no one left behind this is everyone having the opportunity climate change leadership and you know it 's really important that we take a leadership role we can 't sit back and wait for somebody else to do it for us we have to we have to lead cities around the world are acknowledging that even when the United States pulled out of the Paris Accord the cities they all put their hands up and said we will take on that challenge ourselves and as was said by our own Prime Minister actually quite recently these these can 't just be seen as challenges because with every challenge comes an opportunity an opportunity to develop new technologies to be leading the way and I think that it 's a it is an opportunity for our city to be doing that and we know that from disaster comes opportunity as well informed and proactive approaches to natural hazards risks well you know the fact that we 're actually this you know as a just a constant reminder of the state that increasing active public and shared transport opportunities and use I think I 've expressed myself many times about how concerning it is that that public transport hasn 't really been able to take off on Christchurch the way it could have after the earthquakes and safe and sustainable water supply and improve waterways these are all priorities for us we have a lot of challenges though and as I 've said in the plan we 're investigating a whole range of options rates and come is not going to be a sustainable way of funding this counts or other councils into the future and we need to be working with central government about different ways of funding but the reality of this long-term plan the most important message is that we have still got a long way to go in terms of our recovery from in terms of the work that still needs to be done and it is going to take some time and it does take a lot of a lot of resources to recover it does mean that we look to central government and in a way the government has made commitments to Christchurch with a stated desire to negotiated global settlement and capital acceleration facility as being developed with this comes the promise of a partnership approach to our relationship with central government which I believe can expand well beyond our rebuild now regeneration opportunities and so I come back to the phrase we 're we 're in this together and I think we can achieve a lot more and we invite our communities to have a say in relation to their long-term plan and and I hope that out of this process we develop a very clear vision for the future of our our city so I will open it up for debate Andrew thank and there 's been some commentary about the 5.5% rate rise that we 're proposing as part of this draft long-term plan and 5.5% rates rises certainly more than some of us would ideally like to see although the level of rates rise of course is directly related to what we 're able to deliver operationally in capital program reserves were relating to both horizontal and vertical infrastructure in particular so our clear intention as set out in this plan is to keep rate rises to a minimum whilst meeting community expectations around what we do and continuing to see an increase in the standard of the roads and footpaths and pipes that key horizontal infrastructure realizing that we still got a huge amount of work to do to get this back to pre-earthquake levels funding finding the balance between these considerations what we spend the money on and what a reasonable level of rates rise would be certainly hasn 't been easy and is something that we 've been working on for at least the last six months quite possibly longer so today we will approve the draft long-term plan to go out for consultation and it 's important that we hear from the community about what the community thinks the right balance is and what they think about the balance that we 've found whether we 've got it right whether we should be doing more whether we should be doing less and of course less costs less we think we 've got the balance right with that 55.5% rates rise and the the amount of work that we 're doing in each area really reflects this but we 're certainly very keen to hear from the community whether the community thinks that we 've got that right for banks peninsula I 'm came to see investment proposed into the akaroa wharf development the navel point development plan finally and continued commitment to significant interest infrastructure projects such as the a Corot wastewater scheme these are all projects that are proposed to be done and completed within the life of this plan and some of them sooner rather than and whilst I know that Rachel Isis will be felt on Banks Peninsula as they will in other parts of the city I also know that the peninsula is seeing significant investments into key infrastructure I know there 'll be submissions relating to new projects many of which are actually partnership opportunities with communities and just reflecting on the mayor 's words that 's something that we welcome and things that we we would really welcome the draft as we move into the final long term plan really keen to hear from as many community members as we can around what they think we should be doing and how we should be doing it so that we can respond effectively to those submissions and make changes between this draft and it is a draft and the final long term plan as we approve it at the end of June so I 'll be interested to hear the community feedback and it 's important that we do hear that we 've done a lot of work since the earthquakes as a council and we 've already invested heavily in the recovery and regeneration of our city we 've still got a lot to do this is the opportunity for us to hear from the community about what our priority should be as we plan what really is the next 10 years of activity improvements investment and expenditure and my key message is that we welcome that feedback from the community I really want people to be engaging with this important and documents through the consultation document in right in terms of what the community wants us to be doing over the next 10 years Sarah I 'm going to vote in favor clearly of the the draft day in spite of having some some really serious concerns because we need to hear from our communities about what they think before we make the final decision only one opinion and if people share it then they need to speak out so much and speak at the hearings there 's a real disconnect between what we say are our priorities climate change leadership waterways enabling active citizenship increasing active public and shared transport opportunities and what we 're currently proposing to fund enabling active communities in citizenship I don 't know if you remember that that in the metro funding round last year the we had a unanimous decision of councillors to increase in the draft LTP the amount of community funding available to enable our citizens to in fact contribute more to their communities we decided that we would like to put on 10% more this year and they make an inflation-adjusted after that there will be seven what we 're putting into the cathedral many community events such as Carols by Candlelight are at risk because council has increased costs of compliance and made it more difficult for these groups to run valued events even with the number of volunteer hours that they were able to get not putting this funding and now simply means that we will face the same situation again next year having to say no to many of those active citizen groups who want to contribute to the city but struggle with finally funding in the sustainability of the sheer number of volunteer hours involved a major cycle routes failing in our commitment to combat climate change in a low-lying city is a dereliction of duty for our citizens especially when climate change leadership is a priority transport emissions make up 40% of air emissions as a city January was our hottest on record and yet we had to flooding events the cycle ways are an easy target but they are the biggest thing that we can do as a city to mitigate the impacts of increased extreme weather being events on our I am simply not sure that there 's some simple economic realities of our transport to the transportation system heads around the table we 're expecting 10,000 more people to be working in the central city in the next three years 83% of them will be in single occupancy cars of nothing changes that 's over 8,000 more cars in the central city and as well as the increased congestion we simply cannot afford to build another ten which filled street car parking buildings at thirty two million dollars each to store them all in our central city was dying before the earthquakes and simply putting back the same 20th century infrastructure back we 'll get the same result we want our CBD to thrive or are we happy to let it die cycle ways are hard that controversial and they 're difficult everywhere they take real leadership to implement and that 's not what this LTP is offering our communities we have heard at the highest levels that climate change is the nuclear-free moment of our generation and we as a council have signed the Global Covenant of Mears neutrality by 2050 we committed to action not just nice words on paper it is difficult but it is essential yeah the long temper in 2018 228 the 10 years is very important for our city at eager for the future of our city if we review all the vision if this city is a city of opportunity we are open to new ideas new people new ways of doing things a place where anything is possible but we are aware last year we already launched new multicultural strategy also the kind of the vision and the purpose we went espera respect all the treaty of waitangi the targeted way but the others expect is our committee manual if every person feels a sense of belonging and also is commitment by the council to give every person equal opportunity to access all services information as well as participate in a decision-making applauses if today we review all those six the strategic direction to fulfill to implement of this la vision you can see forest and leg of one the particular mayor she mentioned earlier enabling active citizenship in a conducted to kind of a new way before we follow our publication Tula geographic area now we need to reform not only geographically shot mo demographic because in this city is the 25 percentage of people respond overseas we need to to face this effect how to improve district consultation to give a person equal opportunity together list information then they can the feedback to the council so if they choose we are not only focused on our tradition I know this very very best no infrastructure because there 's in related to outer the hills all the well-being we still follow but we still put a big amount of money on that like a water supply like a road like a stone water like a pal river that 's absolutely very important parla regarding to the if this the city is the city of opportunity how do we to keep those two people are since strong since they are part of the inner city so my view we need to strengthen the Civic international relations this group I 'm not sure whether they are big a sufficient resources committed nice if the part it is not sufficient then we open Tula paprika we welcome then they can feedback to make that happen and also this city is innovation a city so particular the mayor also mentioned or we are in this together if we thought is to settle innovation see not only the in culture we can make the happen we need to welcome the regional national in the even over system working together participate investor in this the city for how do we to make the happen we need to be singing about how to way to work in the together and also this innovation we thought as a new course new technology how to we get this one whether we create a good environment to can be the make this happen not only council need to think about it but a community also need to think about the other one is our fatigue oh you lied to the emphasize the regarding to other 3 million for casitas square because what because i still gather some several email from the social economical or people our people their predictions and still like to talk to name you know actually it is a small amount per year only seven point of one night per week only 30 in the sense easy to be the collector and also even we extension for the 10 years but actually sooner a fun racing you know Sula sang a co-anchor in the church the foundation probably only five five years we can stop so now pick a potent for those paper I study economics I fully understand the requires a pro questionnaire text I just wanted a no no Bastille welcome them can be a fee Peck last ones I 'd like to emphasize the community facility I 'm happy you know the Guardian assault waster the new a library and also service center in the laser Center still put on The Bachelor they said cable forward I 'm only star review most master prep actually the new home P library service center will be open in July of last year same as the fish at the others service center Career Center library in the same as the Sumner one but we are delay today the the consultation for the classification for reserve actor there 's the timing we need to go on to be a more faster we need to community also working with the council together but anyway this is the just the drafter the non-temporal but it 's highly in relation to everyone so we encourage it all the people committed feedback to us thank you and first of all I 'd like to say a huge thank you to staff actually even the legal team because this has been a huge and mimma the task getting this together and even that consultation document which has been rewritten I don 't know 120 times this is fantastic to see something that 's already to go out and I think the acknowledgement is particularly due because looking at the numbers it is particularly hard if we look on page 17 of our documents in page 7 of the actual report it says about the cost the the council was left with seven point seven billion to fund by way of rates debts and other sources from the earthquake costs so the concept that us and everything would be hunky-dory and everything would look at like it used to I was completely illusory and the costs that remain according to Deloitte a reasonably independent source of information they they 've cost the council the earthquakes have so far cost the council about 3.6 billion and the remaining capital work to be paid over the next 30 years is 5.7 billion that 's the scope of the problem there this 10-year plan attempts to sort out in a way that leaves at least marginally affordable rates and and that 's for a council that previously had very low debt levels and and also owned major assets so thank goodness in this case for Orion and the airport which have enabled us to do a capital release without selling them but to use their assets or all the assets but most of it comes from Iran and the airport in terms of raising capital bonds I think if we look at the future of this over the next 30 years the fact that we have to find this sort of money means that we do have open to new ideas and look at other possibilities and that 's why in the consultation document we ask people do they want to look at other funding mechanisms so Auckland for example which apparently faces the problems of high growth is allowed to have a fuel tax Christchurch which faces the major ramifications of still needing to spend 5.7 billion over the next 30 years on a major disaster recovery just to get things back to where they were in terms of stormwater drainage water all those sorts of things if we had had for example a four cents a litre fuel tax rate raised this year would have been around 1.9 percent because the additional income that would come in operationally from that would be the equivalent to about three point something percent on rates and I think we need to look at and I 'm glad that we 've asked people about what are the other ways that we can actually raise raise monies because rates have never been and I did my pulse I thesis my master 's thesis on local government finance and looked at time ago it wasn 't a good mechanism for equity or anything it 's still not and actually if you look at the impact of this it 's it 's it 's actually doesn 't it doesn 't work it 's the largest form of income generation for us we 've also asked because we explored the possibility of looking at was there some way in which we could actually recoup some benefit to the community from water bottling plants because the community does not love them in any way shape or form we 've struggled with the concept of a targeted rate we 've struggled with all sorts of ways of doing it and I have to say the legal legal team have been very thorough on looking at what we can do so we 've asked the question just in case in terms of the wisdom of the crowds there are ways that other people have thought of that we haven 't yet because if people extract billions of litres of water they need to actually be able to recruit the community needs to recoup something from that major extraction so I 'm hoping that in terms of the submissions that we get that we will get people looking at effect that looking forward rates are as you say LeAnn not a sustainable way of funding such massive repairs and I don 't actually ever understand why Auckland can have something and we can 't_''_2357.45 I just never get there it makes no sense to me whatsoever that they can have a fuel tax and we couldn 't even if 99% of our population wanted it so I 'm keen that we keep asking those questions if that 's what the people of Christchurch actually want because I think looking at this it 's very difficult and I think people have done amazingly well to get to put this together but it 's this is a very different budget then if you looked at the Christchurch budget 20 years ago and looking forward it it doesn 't get a whole lot better just in terms of tip and and are the things that need doing right well my heart rates down a little now I 'm a bit today I 'd lost a bit of sleep the last few days leading into this because I had a fight to pick with my fellow councillors and miR and that fights now over thanks to the mere and I do sincerely thank you for coming up with a solution to an issue that it 's not mine it 's an issue of my community and it was a lady who couldn 't walk her children to school I had a problem and brought it up and hopefully we will now have a solution and in res and in part 9 up there we can see it and that is the public having the opportunity to feedback on the in sections they feel are dangerous and also it gives the public the opportunity in community boards the opportunity to tell us where they want to see road improvements when it comes to the surfaces or footpaths a couple of my fellow councillors have raised that they have foot parts in the areas where there 's only one on one side of the street but we have one up and here with street and everyone at the table will now get ready to put your cringe faces on when you look at me because my child my children are driven to school and that driven to school because where we live in all our neighbours and this nine school-aged children in our little cul-de-sac there is no footpaths between our properties and in town and there 's a few there 'd be a couple of hundred children in their area so that 's a section of gardeners row we 're there it 's a TKO now there are no footpaths on either side of the road or cycleway and there isn 't also no veg there 's some long grass to walk through on a wet day and that 's for the parents that will let their children go down there now some of the kids do bike down there to go to school but my wife is on your categorize her as a worrywart there 's one tomb you could use she sees my ten year old son has no road sense and there 's a lot of woman out there son and so he can 't bike to school I 'm a little more relaxed on the rules and would probably soft bike down that road myself but a decay now a lot of tracks it 's probably not the best idea so thank you very much Lian for including that and the consultation document I hope we do receive a lot of feedback and if we don 't if we don 't get feedback and support from the community on the particular named intersection then that 'll be the last year of it from me if it doesn 't come back but I assume we will so we 'll leave that there now there 's a couple other issues I want to raise one is and I 've been contacted by a number of people around the 5.5% rates rise that 's the one part of this whole consultation process I don 't like and don 't support I 'm not into 5.5 percent wind our inflation rates 1.9 I don 't believe we 've done enough to reduce our spending I think our community facilities that were putting type of city we really are and we need to be more realistic about that once upon a time when I was a kid growing up I 'm not that old you know I I know I look 28 but I 'm actually considerably older than that the when I was growing up a community hall was a box essentially it would sometimes they were converted school buildings and so on and so forth but it was a box that house the community that you met and they had crafts groups they had scout groups they had all sorts of people using them karate groups and you had a working kitchen normally went with stainless steel and some toilets that were pretty basic but they worked and at some point the city flipped the switch and now our community facilities when architectural awards and and they on funny angles and they 've got imported glass and it 's just the miracles of of of the building industry but is that really what we need I know it 's what a lot of us would like and we want but I something we 've never addressed we 've never asked the community are these the facilities you actually really want because this is the cost and it 's 5.5% when inflation is 1.9 and I think population in our city who on a fixed income because they 're retired and they may be asset rich because they worked hard throughout their lives to live in good neighborhoods that cost them a great deal of money to be there and now they can 't afford to stay there and as a council we say just sell your property or take a reverse mortgage it 's unacceptable we should be facilitating the way people want to live their lives not telling them how they should live their lives so I invite more people in this LTP to submit on how they don 't want us to spend money I don 't want to hear from that normal 500 to a thousand people that tell us how much more they want I 'd like to hear from those that want to tell us how much less they want us to spend it 's easier off and then I 'll go down to I want to follow on from what fricasseed around funding mechanisms because the rating model is a bit of a flawed model and we are lucky to have the assets we do but let 's hear from those other people out there we haven 't heard from you that can partner with the council and create revenue for the city from things we 've never thought of what are all of those ideas and concepts in a way forward that create employment and create income for the city this social enterprises that could be social enterprises that are partnership with the city that don 't cost us money they actually make us money and create employment what do they look like and what are those ideas and models let 's see those and that can help reduce our rates increases and finally the cycleways because I know it 's going to come up this time and I 've been a supporter a few years back I was the one that added in the 20 levy for active transport and it included the ride in the country it is going to be so popular I will consider myself to put in a bike hire slash rollerskating and I just gave to the idea away business at the eastery end but that will be a booming business that place is going to be amazing so let 's get on and get that finished and then there 's the head to head walkway in the cycle ways but the budgets gone crazy on the cycle ways and no doubt we will hear back about that and I can handle that a little because there is a decent government subsidy involved but what I am struggling with is the uptake and people cycling I don 't think it 's good enough for a city that 's flat that the weather as majority really we 've got to face it we 're quite lazy as people crush ditch we 're lazy it 's an easy City to baikin but we 're doing no promotion to make cycling the new black that is where you fall down Westfield would never spend a couple hundred million dollars building a would fall over cycle ways we have to do the same so whether that money comes from government I 've brought it up at Health Board because they get a big one out of it or it comes from Council wherever we have to promote the cycle ways they are going to be a gem of the city we just got to get everyone on board and wanting them more and embracing them more thanks the end I 'd like to start by thanking the staff too this has been an enormous amount of work and you know I think the staff in council counselors have worked really well together to come up with the consultation document and like clearly this is a time to win as a council we take stock of looking at the future challenges and what we can what we need to budget for in terms of air air key projects and so that that challenges I think that clearly it 's in the document that it 's that balance between what people expect around delivery of our services and ability as a council to fund to come up with some other methods of funding as Vickie suggests there suggested and I think one of the difficulties for us as a council was that earlier on several terms back there were some early public announcements after the 2011 earthquakes that really have led to some quite unrealistic public expectations about what in fact could be delivered and I think having all of our city streets fixed straight away is probably an example and clearly from the the the document and especially around the horizontal infrastructure part the challenge actually is really enormous so we but we 're making a great start I think the the document is about how we can work to become more resilient in the face our and to be also to be prepared for future events and I guess having the event like we had yesterday and last night reminds us that in fact this is a series and like last year we also had the port it was fire and this is us has been a series of flood events which when it comes to climate change we need to be a better balance between those key challenges earthquake recovery and maintenance of air services and then we need to plan from at least medium population growth as against affordability through mainly raids so I think given those challenges in the costs since 2011 compared with other cities that haven 't had to address such a mess of the massive impact of a major earthquake on our infrastructure Christchurch has been doing remarkably well and I 'm sure we 'll continue to but those flooding events of last night and clearly we dodged dodge more than a bullet was like dodging a shot a shotgun cartridge that reminds us though how much we have to prepare for climate change and climate change in leadership is clearly a key community outcome for us and as this key strategic direction that we need to make sure happens and I guess that 's something actually the weather is often discussed in the media but not the importance of climate change and how in fact the other key strategic direction for us to be informed and proactive and taking those approaches around our natural hazard is really clear about the projects for resilience in the natural hazards and the long-term sea level rise and climate change and clearly some of our assets in the longer term are going to need to be moved to higher ground so and I 'm encouraged and we 've done a lot of work on this that in the long term plan there 's a lot of mitigation measures including for example stop banks in the detention ponds and clearly we are going to prioritize work and ask residents to comment on this about how we reduce flood in some areas and particularly for people who are vulnerable so overall I 'm really pleased that the long-term plan makes provision particularly for the natural hazards area and maintain that we maintain a proven prudent level of Headroom in the event of a further large-scale natural disaster those reference right at the end of the consultation document in relation to heritage and the the central city landmark grant fund and exactly recent examples we all visit it was a Midland Club on Oxford Terrace and to keep that fun going I that and the old post office in the square as an example of what we 're I think as a council we will need to retain the central city landmark grant fund so clearly in the consultation document we 've prioritized projects as a council and I believe we 've been really responsible in our approach and I along with others councillors I hope that the the consultation document that it generates a good number of submissions about residents priorities and so that we 're also well informed when we do our final decision-making thank you and I wanted to take this chance just to affirm you 're really cool on that snow emergency I was going to say it anyway and then I saw the email come through me but I thought there was a very good call and I also wanted to acknowledge the staff including the financial staff who were part of the civil defense team yesterday and have had to backup today being here for the draft long term plan my views on our where we 're at with our planner that it seems to me between the council 's delivery of what it delivers the the more basic needs around the city and the aspirational which we 're planning as well seven years after the quakes and we 're reminded of this tension occasionally through commentary mest media social media etc you know what are you doing with our rates you know we see these as the priorities have you got it right so this long-term plan process will be an opportunity for the public and I really hope people who may not have thought of coming into council before really take this opportunity to come in and tell us so it 's one thing to say it in social media most media come in and let 's have that conversation face to face we have many opportunities ahead of US personnel feel a bit caught as a city councilor party to the leader expectations with region over areas such as the residential red zone which I 'm also the ward councillor for much of that I 'm starting to get a bit antsy over progress I do understand the process and where it 's red zone it 's an opportunity for us visa vie climate change you know without it doesn 't have to involve necessarily millions in the beginning for us to get started and demonstrably show we are committed to mitigating some of the effects of climate change through treating good parts of the residential red zone as a climate sync there are other ways of maximizing our income if you look at the dividend payment from our companies they comprise 20% of our income so my question would be in this process are we maximizing the dividend return from all our companies especially the bigger ones I 'm not going to single any out at this stage but that 's just a question I would like to leave are we maximizing the return from all our companies and the counselors and others will know what I 'm talking about when they look at the figures there but let 's hear from the community it 's really important you have your say the council has always had I think a fairly vigorous relationship with the community here in Christchurch it 's kind village and people pre and post earthquake have always challenged the council so keep doing that and come and see us and let 's have this conversation just get it out of you thank you you I support the long-term plan consultation document being adopted for consultation I look I may not necessarily agree with all of the aspects of the LTP as its proposed but I 'm very keen to see the citizens of Christchurch express their opinion on the various aspects of the LTP and give us some priorities as to what they think these opinions I believe will go a long way to giving us some direction for the final content of the LTP personally I 'm actually very supportive of giving greater attention to our traditional core values of council provision of services roading three waters for example in my mind there 's still a huge amount of recovery of our infrastructure post-earthquake really a high degree of prioritization will be needed to ensure that the worst is dealt with first I 'm quite encouraged with their LTP vision Christchurch is a city of opportunity for of doing things a city where anything is possible and I 'm struggling to learn that off by heart because I think it 's something that we 're probably going to trot out fairly well all the time it 's a great vision but I was still really am focused on the City Council giving core functions of its operation greater emphasis however I 'm a great supporter of this vision and particularly the two last phrases new ways of doing things in a city where anything is possible that 's quite obvious and previous speakers have emphasised this that the rates model is becoming a burden for our ratepayers so I look forward to the citizens and citizens of Christchurch through this consultation process giving us some direction in support for new ideas to develop complementary models that will enable us to complete our earthquake repairs and then consequently the city to be able to return to a more business as usual model thank you Tim thank you I totally support the long-term plan the draft long-term plan I 'm very much looking forward to giving feedback from the do needs and once you deliver what you need to and then you cut the wants to what you can do with this with our city it 's a lot different we have needs and we have have twos and then we have the wants and this is why I think we 're going to really hear from our community as elected members we 've heard from community groups interest groups but as community board members we 've also heard from the general communities as a whole so I think that we as individuals are gonna get some um interesting feedback from our communities with regards to our 5.5 rates and what our communities and our citizens want as we 've heard that some communities are more resilient than others with the governor 's by GT as one example but communities are like very much like people some need more help than others but all are equal so we 've got to take that on as counselors and not look at our personal in our own communities but the city as a whole and it 's a responsibility that we colleague Aaron here mentioned about the youngster waiting for the 21st party invite the community facilities becoming palaces or being designed so if we were really looking at communities and I do think we got carried away following the earthquake and rebuilding some of these if we had a 1 design but but made bigger or smaller to commit to fit the community 's needs because the key to a community center as access for all whether they have a disability whether it 's physical or intellectual or whether that perfectly healthy it 's about putting community use into those buildings I think we could have done a lot better and hopefully we 're going to get some feedback from our communities with regards to that recently I crossed the floor and spoke to a hearing on behalf of the Summit Road Protection Authority with regards to closing the proposal to close the Summit Road from rail pecky to give his pass overnight we as a city have pushed for recreation and their people to get out and get healthy we 've been incredibly successful with it we now have paths between Godley head and give his pass which is absolutely outstanding but we don 't follow it up by protecting those environments our generation are the ones that have to clean up our rivers our generation are the ones that have to protect our port hills and indeed the peninsula as a whole we 're the ones that have been handed this environment and this is not a want but a need and it 's going to be interesting to hear back from our communities about where they want this waiting it 's going to be an interesting journey because of those needs and have twos have to weigh up against the wants because the wants are what gives your city its heart that pumps the blood that gives us at soul it 's a friendly smile and that twinkle in the eye to want people to be here but you actually need the three waters and the roads to live here so thank you okay and risk a hippie with their CD and assured us that if localized with moving legislation so if it 's a very good reeling ratio paragraph in there because it 's important that this keeps us well under the two hundred fifty percent recommended by the New Zealand funding agency and then allows us a financial Headroom of mohini uncle uncle and call on our funds remembering that the council will need to front fund forty percent of any costs prior to the crowns sixty percent contribution so I think that 's really important to note that and another thing that we must also be prudent about and aware of is that the higher our capital investment and any facility in the higher the operating costs will be for the rate payer over the life of dead St which may be fifteen years or even more so I want to hear from people about their views about the size and scale and scope of our proposed facilities just to ensure that they 're both appropriate and affordable and affordabl into the future and I especially welcome as the mirror alluded to in her opening statements though any proactive communities who want to build and operate their own facilities there 's a targeted rate community looking at a way to Thunder they helped up and I think this was actually pursuing a bit further and doing some work around that I 'm not sure how that would actually be implemented in the metropolitan area but I 'm very interested in it it 's good to see our major cycleway programs are the remainder of the thirteen routes the plan for delivery over ten years and part of the reason for the ten years from now is that there 's these extra child challenges that we 've faced um for instance we thought we perhaps could take some roots down Kiwi rail corridors that have found that that 's not workable so extra money is required to to choose different routes which often longer and there 's also self health and safety legislation concerning the rail barriers that have editor costs as well and the mess of consultation programs that we with the people around each route so it 's comforting to know that so far we 've completed the three full routes in one section of the recognized shake rock and also it 's and growing daily so we have a prudent program near which is affordable and deliverable Oh continues and we 're still able to access the urban cycle wave fund and the NCBA funds to assist us to do that with our land drainage recovery program which is intention attention of to reduce the flooding in the prequel to pre quake levels but also while embracing environmental and waterway improvements we 're possible I 'm very our capital works so we can see the 48 million dollars that we spent on flopped in '_''_3914.69 was deployed again yesterday and has proved to be effective and diverting thousands of qmix of potential flood waters away from people 's homes but the Heathcott area now the next priority and we 're just being delivered now so I think this um this draft out really strikes a good balance a balance to deliver evils of service to continue our repairs to embrace the opportunities for betterment and improving our biodiversity our environment now City we 're possible and responding to in being prepared for events and including climate change and a balance between our and deep service ability and council secure information inflation previously but as far as I know we use an inflation rate of 3.3% which is actually the construction and although you 'll see some deterioration and their wastewater SCS due to delays and some renewals and it is a little bit of concern it 's about prioritizing these groups across the whole broad program we just can 't_''_3984.89 conceive and people make feedback on it and give us some guidance on what the priorities are so we have here a preferred option and the document and I really do look forward to people telling us if they have any preferences for one protein over another recognizing that we 're looking at substitutions at this stage in order to maintain a rates increasing under 5.5 along with you prudent level of debt and at the public for a weir they can do this they can mix and match between the high and low no negative one with the other the consultation document outlines very clearly what our financial challenges are what end climate change challenges are and there we still face illness would probably our main project does the albeit controversial was an arterial link at 29 million dollars plus the downstream mitigation if it 's at 17 and this is big money for cars I think councillor T Bhushan alluded to that previously but we also have a new community center for sand ovens of three million dollars and of course we hear the community leads project they need to be a pool project which is currently not included in any council budget but it is a leader in the way that we would like things to be delivered by it to the communities and I think we need to look at equity across the city when we 're looking at these sorts of projects so I 'd like to reiterate others views and comments on in thinking of staff who labored long hard over this document for months and months and months and with its contain strategies it 's been an incredibly huge amount of thank you yeah needy on a and Mike come I 'll tow endorse the work that 's gone on and into this and you um in a city where you know we have faced so many challenges and in the last few years so you know it does take a lot of effort to put these documents together I think there 's there 's several important points to make in terms of context and it 's not just the impact of the earthquakes but it is things like the forced amalgamation with the peninsula the cost of taking on the peninsula has been absolutely massive to the city and that happened long before the earthquake the cost of the earthquakes and obviously the relationship with central government has been a huge issue interesting to note that when the counts all did its own central city plan the cost was about 800 million of capital the government came in with 1.2 billion so you know it was on top of the 800 moon so there 's been a huge cost put on the city not just from the government what it has or hasn 't done as part of the cost share but on other decisions that have also been made like for example designating which has meant that we didn 't have the option of repairing the old central library if that was a choice that we made given our financial predicament so we 've had to build it new at it at a huge cost there 's also been the decision to close merge and relocate schools and we 're now as a council picking up the traffic safety improvements for those students because of the impact of those decisions decisions by the government the previous government to make it incredibly easy to demolish listed heritage buildings in our city which our community felt strongly should be retained has led to a huge demand on our heritage funding as a city so asking the question I think of can we afford to fix private fund private heritage buildings being fixed well our own publicly owned heritage buildings are put on hold there 's a really important question to ask there 's been another I think layer to the increased cost and burden of us as a city and that is the the duplication and emergence of entities being set up after the earthquake has been I think astronomic when you look at how much money is being spent on on on some of the projects whether it 's taxpayers or ratepayers we seem to have enabled this huge proliferation of entities often doing quite similar things using similar resources at a huge cost before we make decisions and I think we do need to look at that and look at how we can get a lot better synergy and efficiency and for me it comes down to actually council should be delivering some of these things rather than having separate new agencies doing it but you know there may the opportunities to look at that going forward we really do need to focus I think on the operational will we 've heard a lot today about the capital but actually the operational the basic maintenance of our city is a really important thing that we need to get on top of and I welcome having that conversation with our community and looking at how we can improve that I totally endorse the idea that you know we should be proud to be considered beautiful again because the psychological impact on people 's well-being of living in broken neighborhoods broken suburbs with untidy parks and misses streets it is actually quite significant and I think it is important that we adjust that can I just make a few other points one is that in regards to the the budget I still think that this budget is in terms of the capital it 's more of a coffee and croissants budget than a bread and butter budget and I think that 's the key thing that we need to address there 's some things in our budget which to me certainly make no sense at all Park Terrace is scheduled to have a three million dollar upgrade after we 've just fixed it so I can 't understand why we 'd be spending money if you look at some of the intersection safety improvements in the accessible city program there 's a whole bunch of money being spent again and again on the same stretch of roads that are linked into other projects which again it seems a huge duplication and waste it also seems for two blocks we 're proposing to spend four million dollars in the central city how far would that go to fixing some other broken roads in the suburbs a long way I would suggest Cathedral Square we 've doubled the funding for Cathedral Square we had four point six million in the cost year this budget is proposing to go to nearly ten million we 've got central city development contributions going to I think what are some of the wealthiest people in the city and we 're putting you know money in for private developers to have central city rebate contributions when we can 't afford to fix our own social housing what does that say about priorities people have touched on the northern arterial improvements you know the irony of spending you know close to seventy million dollars on those improvements for cards coming into the Central City while spending a huge amount of money on cycle ways to try and encourage people to use alternative means of transport while slowing the central city down and trying to remove cars from the Central City it seems to right I thought people were playing okay okay I 'll wrap up so just to say that you know there 's still a long way to go I think of fixing this capital program I think there 's a huge opportunity to still make some savings I just wanted to conclude with two points one is that I totally endorse the comment that rates are not an affordable way forward it simply is not reasonable to expect our community to continually face rates increases to fund the things that we need to do in a city and I welcome the opportunity to look at that and finally I 'll just leave with a quote from Edward de Bono and and just before I do that I just wanted to just give you the example of or I 'll read the quote first and finish with the example in the future he says instead of striving to be right at a high cost that will be more appropriate to be flexible and plural at a lower cost if you cannot accurately project the future then you must vexedly be prepared to just want to say I had the privileges going to the Littleton farmers market on the weekend and going to London Street where the council just closed the street we didn 't spend ten million dollars or sixteen million dollars as we 've got in our accessible City on that Street we simply by closing the street you got a much better safer pedestrian environment that gave a real sense of community so there 's ways that we can save money and I give you as that a real tangible example thank you I just ask that you also put the cathedral levy separate so that those of us who didn 't support it previously can have our votes recorded against all it 's it 's it 's not the vote today it 's the look that will be put separately when we get to the end of the LTP Dion yeah I was gonna say the same thing actually about there but I 'm not too happy with this to be quite honest I I have some struggles and the first thing that I have struggles with is as want to talk about actually this five the first reason that I I 'm not too happy about this is the way we are proposing this to our communities almost every core fundamental part of our what a council does in terms of its infrastructure is going backwards over the next ten years I don 't think that 's acceptable I really don 't our road network and I 'll just just give me a second and I 'll just go back to the right screen that I had here our carriage way is is decreasing in standard by ten percent over the next ten years that 's our roads the surfaces the stormwater is going backwards by about five percent compared to where it is now our wastewater is going backwards by about five percent I 'm pleased to see a will our fresh water supply is going up a little bit but we 're putting rates up there at double what they were before the earthquake and I know we have some major financial constraints around the earthquake and the recovery but I don 't think we are we need to be going to the government of last the last government this government sent actually you guys really need to support the city we are a big player in the South Island and you guys need to support the city because I am really upset that our main core infrastructure is going backwards in this plan that we 're proposing now I want people to dig into this and look at it there 's a lot of information in this actually there 's a heck of a lot of information and this is just on the capital stuff one of the things I 'm talking about with with optics I don 't think we as a council have had a real dig into the I know they have in the stuff and there 's probably that mix about management verse stuff but we need to because I 'm looking at this and I did some rough calculations last night then amongst all the other stuff that was going on around flooding if we spent another 50 25 million dollars on the roads over the next two years if that we get it would it be the same equivalent that we spend two million dollars in optics and we are going to be spending there anyway so if we spent twenty five million dollars more on road improvements we would get two million dollars savings and optics which is actually the same rates impact that you would have versus the optics if we 're going to be charging rates or the capex if we 're going to be borrowing it to do the work so I think there 's some real deep dives that we need to look at in that respect I think there 's some savings that we can have long term and actually make the city a better place in terms of the level of service the cycleways stuff I 'd I have to say this if you look at the cycle ways initially it was our fifty six million dollars sixty eight million dollars sorry after a Dutch person came here it was changed to one hundred and fifty six million dollars because they went from on street to off street if you look at two hundred and six million on top of what we 're spending yes yes you look at it it 's in a consultation document we have to ask you you know we have to ask people you know it 's before the rebate yes there is rebate but we still have to put a lot of that money and we have to you know I want people to actually look at that and go what do you value what do you want right now because we don 't have the money to keep the basic infrastructure up and that that does concern me one of the comments was to do more costs more yes and and in reality it does but with the example that I just said before doing more actually means we 'd save in the long run in terms of the operational costs that we have as a city doing less will cost more so that the equation doesn 't necessarily work as easy as it as it sounds and I know there 's probably more complications and the effect of it do really feel that we that and especially around the corner infrastructures in the infrastructure strategy as public it 's part of this and we don 't talk about it enough I just think we need to be spending more money the money that we do get and prudently sensibly and strategically around the long term infrastructure stuff and I you know when we 're talking about revenue I mean a fuel tax is great and in theory and stuff like that but I 'm going to repeat it here that I 've said a number of times before we already pay 15 to 20 cents per liter more than Courtland now so in effect were already subsidizing the north island for their fuel on the South Island so we need to say to the government yes fuel tax might actually help local government but you need to regulate that industry first because otherwise we 're just doubly taxing our poor people and Christchurch the residents they 're going to be paying the taxes anyway Camp Council companies yes I 've had a quick look at that and I do think we need we bought that we own than we did pre with quote because we 've bought pilot you know we 've we 've acquired some and and bought more for the port but are they performing the way that we wanted them to perform are we actually getting what we wanted to get out of them I do not think so I think we need to have some you know some actually you know how are they going to deliver for the city not just in a financial way but actually how can they benefit the residents of the city not just us as a city council you know the other thing that I think about when I think about revenue is we paid everybody pays GST on rates there 's a tax on top of a tax you know that 's a free fifty to sixty million dollar tax for the government I think there should be just seen in it back to us and saying here you go here 's your GST on your rates and that 's actually in 50 or 60 million dollars or even you we could just actually because it 's not fearful ratepayers who are paying a tax and then having to pay a GST tax on that again and the other thing that I think we need to be looking at as the depreciation on our assets we 're building a brand new city we 've got all these brand new assets and the government changed laws and it 's actually affecting how we can do our tech stake and other things like that in terms of what we can borrow against but I just wanted to finish on the Central City when it comes to transporting to the central city I think we really need to not just think about circle ways we need to be thinking about public transport so we need to be going kept in hand with the SE ek and actually looking at this and the long term plan process that both our councils are going through and saying how can we make our public transport system work in the long term plan you 'll notice we 're spending 23 million dollars on buying the bus exchange if we don be getting a good return on investment on that great asset that the government did build it 's part of the recovery plan so really I mean I 'm not happy about us reducing their levels of service another there 's also yes sorry I 'll start that again there 's also level of services and optics we were with where we have headed our example identified and that 's been moved but there are other things in there that that I think a lot of people would open their eyes at and balk at you know and we and I 'd really encourage people with they 're going to be looking at this long-term plan to look into those details around what is actually in what 's out and actually understand their and we yeah I 'm going to stop there I think I 've seen enough but that 's just where I sit with this at the moment thank you hmm is a amore proverb that says my pawn or my Pharaoh or t2 mahi if worker and chief pull together the job is done we 're in to balance the significant cost of work that needs to be done on our infrastructure the speed with which the work is done and rates affordability we have worked together to keep the proposed average rates increase as low as possible while we work to complete remaining earthquake repairs renew aging infrastructure and maintain a focus on regeneration thus draught LTP purposes proposes to keep rates at an acceptable level by deferring some aspects of the capital program in maintaining the current rate of borrowing this proposal meets our obligations imposed on every local authority which include ensuring prudent stewardship and the efficient and effective use of the city 's resources including effectively planning for future management of our assets we would not be here without an incredibly hard-working team who have gathered information to bring us answered endless questions often the same ones over and over responded to requests for even more information graciously and patiently we are indeed fortunate to have such a team of people who themselves are residents who go over and above for the good of the city so thank you for the work that widen to include a whole community so that we are all working together going forward we need to build active citizens by valuing and listening to our young people building their sense of responsibility to partner with us and to care for each other in our place we can do so much more when we work together my upon old my Pharaoh or t2 mahi we can do this together thank you um a great deal on on one of those points I think sometimes we look too hard at to keep a little project in and forget actually about the operational side and not around the maintenance because that needs work but there 's a lot of other things that we spend money on and like the amount of money we give to DCL regenerate regenerate christchurch it 's phenomenal and this is where the real rates increases come from I just like to correct day on around the cycle ways we 're not looking to add an additional two hundred million dollars it 's an additional 90 million dollars and up to six tubes in sixty six percent so I think that 's an important thing to factor and we 're in a difficult point of time where you know we 've got the cost of rebuilding us that they not just back to what we had before but actually what 's right for both now and into the future also continue to provide the core services without creating a rights burden on the people calling Christchurch home today and I personally don 't think we 've got that balance right the way the mechanism that we click rates does not work we have so many people actually on fixed incomes many of whom are elderly that are are struggling and we need to look at ways how we can collect revenue from different streams and potentially if your text may be there I think they would need to really expand to be more sub regional fuel tax is we have so many people moving out to where my hurry and Selwyn that still work in Christchurch in commuting you put in so much wear and tear on on the roads that we fund to repair so we rates by that but it was still paying for that infrastructure I do I do look forward to listening to the people and hearing what they have to say about this proposed long-term plan I don 't agree we 've got the balance right I do not send 5.5% is acceptable we cannot continually have five person plus race increases it just does not work there are a couple of points in the draft LTP that I just want to focus on today and one of them is the major cycle waste program which in this draft is actually proposed to be pushed right out until 2028 which is 14 years after it was started and well bizarrely there are some belief that these cycleways they 're everywhere this this program is only 100 kilometers of cycleways which represents under 5% of the total transport network in the city head into the only 50 kilometers of off road cycle ways that the city had before the program began then we were told it costs too much when the majority thus program is not funded by rates if we want to gives bugger or benefit to Christchurch and cost more than the entire cycle wave program we just have to look at the 12 kilometer 240 million dollar Christchurch Northern Corridor of which although originally the council sheer was 31 million dollars there 's actually 63 million dollars from previous and future council budgets for this project plus another 50 million dollars for downstream effects there is a huge amount of capital money spent are very very small Road in project and what does it do it adds thousands of noisy co2 emitting cars into a peaceful suburb and will add zero benefit to the people of st. Albans however the actual benefits of increase in active transport is huge on so many levels and completing the fully weave sock ways is integral to this I want to focus on one benefit or one of the completed cycle ways which is the papanoida parallel it goes past st. Albans primary st. Albans Catholic pepper our street school two-spirit preschools it is a stone 's to our way to another three schools include in papua new high school it goes past the or morale corridor which goes past another two or three schools this cycle was built with the majority of funding coming from NZTA in the government and now provides safe transport environment for so many children to get to school the question is why would we want to delay this opportunity for other truck trust Christchurch kids new zealand last year so the number of cyclists killed on our roads nearly quadruple and we know young children that cycle are vulnerable providing safe cycling is so important we 've lost a generation to cycling and we cannot afford to wait any longer and providing safe cycling infrastructure is key to this you know I could have moved an amendment today to try and pull the funding back into where as previously agreed but I 'm happy to listen to the people of Christchurch and get a mandate from them because this is important and it must be said though if we do not get these cycleways completed and if we do not improve active transport and public transport what we 've been seen in the CBD over recent times if going to see in the near future we need to act but I will listen to the people and then we 'll act at that point on another note at a community level it is extremely disappointing to see that the rebuild of the once very popular Shirley Community Center has been deferred so far out it doesn 't even make the proposed 10-year plan this is unbelievable that a previously well used community center which was destroyed by the earthquakes as if to hole in the community will not that will not be rebuilt until 20 years after the earthquake how is this acceptable what other communities will have this length of delay at the same time but then it 's other projects that have been added since the last long to implement all had massive increases in funding for one example naval point has gone from 750,000 to 10 million dollars yet this community still goes without a community center as a community board we 've advocated for this community and for some reason we make one step forward just to get booted back another two steps I wait and listen to the submissions and then at that point I 'll make an amendment once the people say that it 's also not acceptable I will support the draft long term plan going out for public consultation but I urge my fellow cancers it 's time to listen the city is about to speak thank you well I 'll just um bays and I think this I 'm really pleased with the quality of the debate and how people have contributed their their views their pensions their concerns and their support for elements of the of the draft long term plan and I reiterated as a draft it is going out for public consultation and we do invite the public to have their say but I kind of want to go back to the sort of essential question that we are asking our community and that is that there is a balance between the significant cost of the work that needs to be done on our infrastructure the speed at which that work has done and rates affordability and they are the three core critical elements that have and we have strive to keep the proposed rates increase as low as possible as it as low as possible that is the question that we ask ourselves could we reduce it we are staff to look at that they told us that we would have real concerns over some of our core infrastructure if we reduced it further but it is behavin on us to actually drill unto that I agree with the points that have been made are we able to do better than that and also we have to look at that the levels of service we have to look at the level of rates increases and we have to look at the level of debt and a number of you have commented on all of those so I think that this has been an incredibly good debate because what it shows is that this is a draft it is going out for public feedback we do invite that feedback and I think it 's going to mean that the the debates that we have when we finally have the final draft in front of us are think thank you to each and every one of you and thank you to the staff for all of the incredible work that you 've put on so far there is a lot more work to be done and in these times of floods a lot more water to flow under the bridge so on that note I will put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried and we move on to the authorization for the general manager finance and commercial etc to make any amendments that 's not amendment so that you can ask your own questions but just so just to tidy up to make sure alignment with the Auditor General 's report and and then approving the process for consultation so I 'll move that and Andrew will second that and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and what 's next Oh so I and did we move that we reapply Standing Orders or do they just okay I can just close the meeting right on that good week _"

    "text": "a long-term plan 2018 28 report and you 'll see in front of you that there are a significant number of recommendations that we need to go through and there are a number of number of resolutions that we have to deal with first the first will relate to receiving the information that 's contained in referred to and the staff report and including all of the documents that are attached to it we will be noting the recommendations of the council 's audit and risk management committee and I 'll be asking the Deputy Chair of the audit and Risk Management Committee to speak to that and then we need confirmation of the authority of myself and the chief executive to sign the letter of representation to audit New Zealand and I 'll be inviting representatives awarded New Zealand to speak to that speak to the report so so rather than rather than speak generally to the to the report I 'll save that for when we have the debate so I think I 'll start off with formally moving the recommendations one two and three that we received and Risk Management Committee and confirm the authority to sign the letter of representation seconded by Andrew and I 'd like to begin I just want to check with staff whether there is anything that you wanted to to provide us by way of information just in relation to these three metres if not I 'll refer to ref mangie and ask him to speak to the audit and Risk Management Committee report thanks Karl I 'm just a slave demure no sorry I think I 've been providing thanks Ian I 'm s played in the unfolding have been a number of minor changes to the consultation document and those changes are flagged and highlighted and the document that 's in the big tin can so I just wanted to make sure that you 're all aware of that thank you very much right over to you brief yeah thank you so the risk committee is charged with approving the process for the development of the long term plan the draft which includes the draft consultation document the financial strategy and the infrastructure strategy so we have reviewed that the content we 're just there to make sure that staff have followed the appropriate process and that all the plans do what they say they 're going to do so we have done that work we 've reviewed the financial the draft financial strategy we 've reviewed the draft infrastructure strategy and the draft consultation document and we 're happy that the appropriate process has been followed there and that they will link together and do what they say they 're supposed to do so we 're happy to advise the council that they can adopt that underlying information obviously subject to the Auditor General 's report which we have received and we 're happy with that we note that the preparation of the information has been supported by the appropriate management sign-offs and has followed the required process under the Local Government Act and therefore recommend that the council adopts the draft financial strategy infrastructure strategy and the draft consultation document with minor amendments allowed to the GM of Finance and commercial so a relatively straightforward process this year in terms of that process and so the ordering council to approve the draw oft ltp subject to amendments on the day and subject to the auditor-general support which will be presented a little bit later thank you um does anyone have any questions arising from the report from the audit and Risk Management Committee no move on and thank you ref and so the next one is the confirmation of the authority of the mirror and chip it seeks to sign the letter of representation of could I invite oh sorry I 'm just concentrating on three things at once you sorry I 'm having difficulties yet so I 'm auntie booths and entertainment thank you sorry suffering from quake brain today sorry good morning everybody no more for me to say there are conversation with the audit risk management company last week just to confirm the oddity is now complete and we are happy to issue an unmodified opinion only a consultation document that basically means that we 've locked the underlying support information that supports the document and are comfortable that it 's consistent with what reported the key issues in the CD are what we 're happy that that consultation document complies with various statutory requirements so when you adopt the consultation document today you would opt it with a clean old opinion and that 's probably I think first one we 've had for a while so thank you very much there 's anyone got any questions yes really not a question just a comment really just to thank called it New Zealand for their work around this and also I should have before to thank the audit risk committee and especially our independent chair sue Shelby the work they 've done around this is quite a lot of work for them to do so thank you he 'snot reiterate that thank you very much it 's um it 's a very tricky job it 's a tough job to go through such an extensive process as this and we really appreciate the way that your team has worked so well with them council staff them yeah thank you alright so so I 'll put those first three resolutions this is all this they haven 't been I should have included them okay so information noting the recommendations and confirming the authority to sign the letter of representation so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you the second well the the the the next recommendation that we will deal with although as I 've advised you it requires 75% approval for this to carry but it 's a temporary suspension of Standing Orders to enable members to speak more than once it removes the limits on the number of speakers and the general procedure for speaking and moving motions foreshadowed amendments and lost amendments so to set those aside moved by glen livingston seconded by tim Skindred i shall put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no I was expecting at least one day that 's carried thank you so the next one is adopts the information that provides the basis for the council 's draft and relied on by the content of that to be adopted by council so I 'm just working out where the amendments first so they fear there are more we over the page you 'll see you explained that before the council can adopt the consultation document must first adopt the information that provides the basis or the information in the consultation document and then you invite any people any members who might want to make amendments move the mean ones okay so that 's the that 's the all right well ian has just explained what I should have explained which was that before we can adopt the consultation document we must first adopt the information that provides the basis for the council 's draft 2018 28 long-term plan and relied on by the content of the consultation document and so at this point we open up the metaphor discussion any relevant amendments that may be moved I do actually have an amendment and I 'm still working on the detail of it and there are a couple of others who are in the same position so I 'm just going to adjourn the meeting just for the next 15 minutes and so we 'll reconvene at 48 five past ten at five plus 10 so it 's time want to and bring it back but I just want to adjourn the meeting so that we can get the wording of the amendments agreed my one involves an amendment to the to one of the questions to be asked in the consultation document so I just want to get the wording of that crystal clear I do want to kind of signal it to the audit office because they won 't know about it but I don 't think that there will be a problem with it and and just to tidy up I know that Yanni 's got an amendment in relation to a level of service and Sarah 's got an amendment in relation to some advice that that is required before the LTP signed off so we 'll just get the the wording finalized so if people could be back here at five past ten thank you _"

    "text": "sporting upwards and also to make sure that the interviews in this was just an admission on life hat include governance mere tear of infrastructure transfer an environment community relevant counselors in myself as well as staff so that you can earn Kathleen contractors so that we get that full view of the process the timelines or things that happen over that period of time I 'm just looking for you to consider an endorse these terms of reference thank you daddy I just had a question in regards to the timeframe and given that we assists we have assessments as a part of a rolling five-year program twenty percent a year is that timeframe sufficient enough to look at yeah I 'm just waited at the timeframes a bit too narrow and just wondered why we 're not going back further so in terms again it 's looking at the process and the appropriateness of the maintenance reviews at period of time so in fact we would have had reviews over that period of time between that 's mentioned and the report which will be indicative of what 's different last year was that the contractor changed so we what going back to the the month before the headlock Northants hadn 't happened actually gives us an opportunity to look at the assessment that was done last year by the previous contractor under the the sort of kind of pre pre impact of the hey block North inquiry but mind you when when was the last assessment done uh if I can help so my understanding of cheek so the timeline going back to the headlock North incident in early August 2016 will bring in in the previous assist bring every swing was it when was the previous assessment they 're not done and block severe they spread over the year so so there 's some potentially as late as mid 2017 so that they don 't do the 20% in one month per year as my understanding that they did this time they did a batch of them and one with latkes of it but they don 't they don 't do them exactly at the same time Ruby you 're only in one they did twenty-five and to July so they captured by this time period if you look at I can understand you 've got the heavy up north onto that in August 2016 I guess what I 'd like to understand is a little bit about but prior to that incident what will they do it and it may just be the same thing yeah I was just trying to pick up the last assessment so so maybe it should go to the to the last assessments were post the headlock north report you say no but you said that they weren 't all done post Havelock North you did they did do if I seemed so the previous round prior to the November December ones were done post the headlock north report hemlock North incident so they might have applied no but we 're not capturing the pre Havelock North so maybe maybe maybe take it back one more year take it back to the so so they captured they capture assessments whilst we still had secure bore status yes I know it 's only one it 's no problem we can take it make sure we 've got a really good view of the process yeah and not spend a lot of time doing extra works that we don 't need to know I don 't think it 's important just to know before Havelock North what were we doing yep I 've got no preference here 's what was being done just change under 2015 between August 2015 yeah okay look and I support that because I think my intention on all of us and I agree with the chief executive the focus is on getting the ball heads fixed nothing is to take us away from your primary focus of the work that we 've directed staff to do which is get it done as quickly as they possibly can get them sealed and up to status so that the drinking water assessor can sign them off medical officer of Health and we 're back without chlorine and our water so that 's what we want to achieve as quickly as possible but I think it is really important to understand all of the processes that we went through the standard we as a council because we rely on our on compliance and those three material respects to comply with the drinking water standards I think it 's maybe it is that we have to actually have a level of service that requires a higher level of reporting on the status of the ball heads than what we have at the moment patient you just said that that standard had changed no no I 'm saying that the the standard applied by the engineers is changed by Jones know by the engineers had changed it was the fact that the engineers didn 't sign off on the status when they had the previous few months you know so so City care was asked to a separate report but the previous year be aware assessments done and we meet the standard they signed them off as meeting the standard our Phil Dion you I 'm pleased to see the these terms of reference and keeping in mind that the prime objective which is quite clear under 18 is to provide assurance for the future of Christchurch 's and chlorinated water supply so of the important role of governance in there one of the the lessons learned from heavy lock North clearly was that and if governance level there wasn 't communication between the two councils and clearly this communication for governance for our city is going to be really important too so I 'm pleased to see these terms of reference do I just hit a question around what does the procedure are going to be on finding the person who 's going to do the review well I 'm I 'm been talking to people about who 's available who has the expertise I don 't think that we need high technical expertise except that they could get that and if they needed it but it 's somebody who needs to understand local government processes and the requirements of local government and we 're going to be is that going to be somebody locally or is it going to be somebody from well it 's an independent external review so it may be locally but I think finding those skills may require somebody coming in who 's not involved and anywhere there 's a audit and risk process internal audits that are a standard on different subject areas and water was always going to be the next one to be have a deep dive into there 's appropriate language as part of the auditing process and that was that was put on hold till after they have locked North inquiry so it may well be that that will represent an opportunity for a happy combining of the two approaches so I mean that 's up to the chief executive but it could well be that that one process which is already looking for that appropriate level of external auditing expertise will be available from my perspective it was good to make sure that somebody really outside of the situation outside of counts who hasn 't worked for Council or either lately potentially in the city as well because of that being impacted one way or another yeah all right so were there any other matters and the chief executives monthly report that people want to race Yanni Pauline sorry to that you know I think this is a really good thing the water list actually or trends trying to see and everything we do in council this type of reporting us that all be bring learnings and I think one of the key learnings out of this is what happened in the communications so I 'm really looking forward to seeing the result of this in making sure that this type of Gulf and the communication between the management of your governments doesn 't happen again as possible thank you very good Jonnie just a quick question in terms of the letter I know that there 's reference to New Brighton then Sumner but it has been along river corridors and other recreation spots as well and I just wondered you 've you 've got a comment in there that you know it 's important that people report it which which I agree with but I just wanted to know if we 're doing any work because part of the frustration I 've had as a councillor from local constituents as that they 've repeatedly reporting things that aren 't being are being fixed you know through the CSR process so look at the effectiveness of people reporting versus getting a response sorry so you mean in terms of customer service requests yeah repeated requests for you know the bins to be lighter than they 're not oh so literal is a particular issue and has been obviously over the summer season with a view that not all of it is just ordinary letter from people picnicking or things like that you know people have been dropping other rubbish around opens so there 's certainly looking at how to to make sure that we 're responsive in terms of things very visible things like that and such as the letter and particularly we expect weather events will mean that you know more people go and visit particular areas or weekends and so forth so there 's some work around there I guess in terms of CSR 's we actually have a reasonable response on CSR 's when we get 50,000 a month you know people ringing up with particular issues the the challenge for us is when you referred to say a contractor to deal with and getting the feedback and back so that 's still an issue for us and you know there was something on potholes recently it 's a good example of where you know immediately goes to a contractor and we expect to have some responses we 're also looking internally about whether there are more ways that we can be responsive in proactive around some of these things so for example flooding how can we look at anticipating events we get information sometimes the problem e worse sometimes it 's not accurate you know the forecasts so we react on those sorts of things as well so he 's been looking at some of those things but we do get a large number of CS hours to month and deal with those reasonably accurately and promptly um Erin just to follow on from the CSS because when you look at the charts each month they tend to always be very similar there 's always certain parts of our core business that keep popping up for CSS is a way to reduce those other than cutting off the phone lines which is one way another would be the relevant committee and then a process of how we may reduce that particular number if we considered that look at me knowing that we could love to do that I think that 's neat slant idea well thank you all right well I 'll remote I 'll move that we received the chief executives report and the other elements of the thanks Sara to second yep I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they no that 's carried thank you next item as the two longer structures on roads deed of license decision moved by Vicky seconder by what you did no need yeah Jonnie seconded by Yanni is there any discussion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried what a very good paper that was thank you in the funding review we can group chipboard peasants report appointing community board representatives and adopting terms of preference since which time we 've added another member of the funding review working group proposal which is councillor Gina 's chair of the multicultural subcommittee there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much well surely we 've got other items on the agenda oh there appears to be none and I 'll declare the meeting closed and thank you for the shortest meeting of the year Yeah right you _"

    "text": "we 've sent two years getting information from the about aspirations desires the staff have already hired consultants have come up with a very you know preliminary concept about proposed elements no no I mean a week we can we can you know we can look at that but but what I want to understand is that because my understanding is that that the the scope has to come back to Council for a decision so you so you come back with a recommendation on initial scope consultation and what with the advice that we 've had based on some legal advice that we haven 't seen is that we have to go out and just and consult on the proposed various options for sites once that 's finished then we go out again with the proposed concept is that we 're putting into the facility or Lantana but the shocks the initial concept comes back to council for the board was given the delegated authority to consult and engage on the initial scope and the proposed sites advise not make a decision here and maybe that scope depends on to how we do things like not Pune why where we just come up with one consultation document and given that we 've spent two years asking all of these questions to the community what are some legal advice I think it 's important that your way to receive them can we make sure that there is a process by which the council can if necessary make a decision such that the consultation the community board go out for includes the basic scope and the site because it seems to me they 've done massive consultation already that we 're prolonging a process where the community don 't want it prolonged so can we at least have that advice back through to the council so that if we need to make a decision so they can go out and do one consultation so you don 't get people King getting bored and restless by over consultation and that we can do that I think that the the kind of frustration for for me and kind of observing what 's gone on in this particular instance is that in order to a really good understanding of the challenges that each of the sites might present and what the benefits of them are and until you know they 're it 'll end up you know we we if you 've got to know what you 're working with first before you design what you 've got but only agree except that they are in the fortunate position of having a site that works and having a site that they will agree on and if it 's a predetermined position which is a rather risky thing yes a if the community don 't agree on that then obviously they have to go back and restart but if the community do agree with it why couldn 't they well they 're talking to them at community groups and things actually talk to them about what type of pool it involves as well because obviously there 's a budget that constrains what they 're able to do so it 's our here the concept the board was informed on Monday that the consultation process that we 're going out to do will be about the elements that need to form part of the hub so we 're not just going out on the site selection and the board has been informed of that the initial the first consultation is going out with in February will include the site and the stuff that involves the conceived that leads to a con we 're just receiving the report at the moment so we will ask for a cup so the to consultation rounds because the first one at the moment works and the board had what the board is working with his bulk and location we haven 't gone to the community we 've gone to the community in the past and they 've told that these are the different elements that we would like to see within our community we 've now gone back we 're now saying to the community where should a Linwood Wilson pool be placed and are these the right sort of things that you said you want to so basically Drive facilities with facilities for children and then after that we have to go for a second consultation and this is whether it comes back to the council is that the detailed design issue of Canada can the board sign off the concept design or does the concept and detailed design have to come back to the council so they 're going to yeah would be we 're two rounds of a complication that carry two so I mean it 's you have to go back with a design once you 've got the site we did that for qe2 which is another community facility it had other money attached to it anyway um look we 're only receiving the report I 'm quite happy that that that we we have a look at the advicing as going back to the community board and and see whether we can shorten processes are possible so would someone like to move that the community board report be received Yanni Sierra put the motion words in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you now I 'd like to invite Stuart bald and Dennis Aldridge from the Allendale reserve management committee to come forward thank you very much for your leave thank you I 'll read out our submission just just to get it done quickly this is about the Allendale hall repairs at the bottom of the rather than have a basin it 's a pretty early part of the settlement it 's pretty much settled in the late 1840s early 1850s the Annandale Hall quick repairs been a CCC work in progress for some time and it 's now nearly complete result has been to bring this hundred and twenty year old facility into the 21st century and to give it a new lease of life community and this committee thanked the city and banks potential community board for making this possible there are generations of local general local residents who appreciate the work that 's been done and look forward to good and social times at the reserve again the first point to make is the Annandale reserve management committee support the Banks Peninsula community boards recommendations that the council allocate the full annual rental of the reserve transport yard to the bank 's financial community board to enable them to allocate funding to this reserve at years the rental of the transport yard has been provided it has provided the only income for the reserve management committee to build and develop and expand and maintain and operate the entire reserve this has been a successful long term venture and has provided a large capacity venue for community operated events use of this reserve has produced funding streams through other community organizations for example the Chumley homes and the governor 's Bay Community Association and other community groups typical events held here are multi sports we ran a trifle and here for 17 years football cricket fairs golden oldies large community meetings private celebrations large community meetings have difficulty in finding venues with parking and seating capacity and this is a 300 meter hall that does all that for us and has done for years casual yees in the reserve include outdoor party events dog exercise golf practice horse riding touch rugby and shoreline bird-watching since the 2010 quakes the reservist had no income at all and the grounds of surrogacy deteriorated our committee has a list on the back of our submission here of pressing jobs state of repair and maintenance there are significant ground works to deal with and also additional building work to finish and this will take a number of years to complete and a lot of funding the second point we 'd like to make is the reserve committee has a contrary view to staff recommendation that a one-year allocation of these rental incomes from the reserve transport yard will have a significant impact on our operational recovery our job list has an estimated DIY cost Cindy said against it just to give you a bit of scale with present a health and safety constraints of work practice these sums will not remotely be sufficient to contract out the works presently there 's no alternative funding scheme proposed for potential reserve management committees and that clearly presents a difficulty for some time yet this fort was built in 1896 on six acres of Crown land that was used to used to be the police residence and station and a jail in from 1882 to date there has been transport related activity on this land in tents seat horse-drawn coach and Royal Mail of this location from 1882 until the 1920s that cottage business using volunteer one-ton truck used to operate until 1927 this area produced potatoes tomatoes carrots and fruit for the city market produce was also transported by Bullock and horse-drawn carts over dyes past and the road was sealed in 1957 governor 's patron transport and Banks Peninsula transport with the last general cartridge operators and operated from this reserved transport yard for more than 50 years we submit that for volunteer and reserve management committees to operate effectively they need really cash access on a day-to-day basis and we 'd like to point out how difficult it is to organize significant general works and repairs on that written and intermittent cash flows thank you thank you any questions Phil um I just wondered is that the whole have any here status yes we should give them when it was built it is a place where returned service people have been recognized and received and honored it 's about it 's just a very very old it 's an area that settled out there native the land was bought in assist its operation in 1880 it 's a way forward for travelers to a Corral and the other bays a tenuous route to hilltop the tops I think you guys me there any other questions Syria I 'm just quickly and with the the work that 's been cleaned at the moment the funds the proposed to come the community boards recommendations is that potentially they could take some of those funds and give them to another reserve management committee are you needing all of those funds at the moment we would need all of those stunts for quite a few years and there is some resistance yeah from our part that it 's diluted thank you thank you yes sir I just where 's he 's mentioned quite a bit about the history but I would like to make the point that act actually we see a tremendous future for this domain not not just for Allendale Governors Bay Peninsula the city as well actually we we have the potential to be one of the jewels in the crown of the pledge so if you look at preserves like and an extra would encourage members if you if you going no that way have a look at the hall what 's happening this is a it 's a tremendous facility now but it has a domain as well in sports and all those kind of things the two working together there 's a quaint group that are trying to resurrect the equine area at the back will link to the reserve and the foreshore walk and oil around to the jetty now the jetty is in a partnership with the council and we could see the same here to work through these kinds of funds as well did this it 's not just for our area it 's it 's 20 minutes from christchurch mmm and has the potential for you know in the past but we see into the future to be able to come over there use the hall use the domains for the salman church or whoever asked you know all these sort of personal the vintage car people of cambio and so we have a very active and quite energetic committee at the moment we this work if the community board recommendation was not adopted by council today and the income from the reserve was not able to be applied to the reserve management committee and clearly the valuable work that the community is doing on that reserve through the reserve management committee what would the effect of that be what would happen on the ground as a result of that decision I was a number of things for one the there 's been considerable expenditure on the hall right now but the wider is here this enormous amount of work to and we just quite don 't quite know how it 's gonna take place actually we you get constrained to the fact that you to the place that you can 't do a lot and so what potentially could be something great actually won 't be and that the sufism is whole areas of drainage and all those kinds of things that the the field doesn 't work now like a you used to be the home of a kind of cricket the diamond have a rugby club for years many years that the city and so was the halfway point you couldn 't play right before you couldn 't play cricket I couldn 't do anything on there the horse people oh there 's a very strong delegation to just come to us in this last week of it quite people wanting to resurrect that whole thing in the back but it needs enormous amount of drainage and kind of them you know for round formation all that sort of stuff we probably won 't actually achieve them so as Stuart said which is its laid in a band since the earthquakes it 's fall into disrepair but we see the potential of what could be but it won 't happen unless we get the support practical immediate a big event would be it would be difficult to to keep people engaged in the management cutting because unless there is some personal feedback coming back about achieving things you won 't find volunteer people who are prepared to spend that much time under adverse circumstances yeah it would be handed back to the city I 'm sure it 's look thank you I invite Pam Richardson to come forward for the bank 's peninsular Community Board and could we begin with the Allendale transport yard site so rather than dealing with your report first if we could move to your part a report item number seven Allendale transport yard site so could yes very happy to do that but just need to just want to remind the council of what the reserve management committee was about but just very briefly about what the reserve management committees are there are 15 of them across the peninsula Allendale was just one of them Robinson 's Bay the other other issue that we 've gotten our and our report this morning or it 's got a good outcome so they all have issues around they don 't actually have enough they don 't actually get any funding to support them to do some of their work some of them do a number of them do like the Akane 's Bay camping ground the devotionals camping ground the pigeon Bay camping ground and there are others that receive a little bit of funding are we she them help those reserve management committees do their work so though the reserve management committees enable communities to make decisions about their own local reserves you know by having direct and port and Stewart and Dennis actually talked about that people are people are interested in doing things so they have to have a little bit of money so they can do things but they are ultimately accountable to the council or to the community board and to the council they 're all different and some of them have several parcels of land but at the moment we 're actually going through a program of reviewing the policies and developing that is taking some time these reserve management committees are very old they go back to you know before backpacks but banks village to district council days early in district councils that are involved in those reserve areas so we are working in an you wouldn 't looking at coming up with some new guidance for reserved management committees so just just yes just moving on to the part a around that that reserve area right so Andrew would you is the one that we have in front of us then have a seconder for that Rick you need questions for discussion yep to check two things one as I was concerned that money from here could go to that other reserve management committee so don 't know how you want to deal with that and the second question I had was in the report this quite a lot of talk about they can 't have existing lease rights but as Fulton Hogan proposing to do something quite significantly different or is that I mean I just just trying to understand there 's any concern over what could possibly go there and so the council decided that 's what the report is very clear about there so so therefore it 's students rights put not be done but Fulton Hogan will be doing it 's a it 's a yard where they 've got tractors and trucks and stuff it 's the same use as was before but the responsibility if it turns out to get consent right but there 'll be protections built in around the scale of activity a positive night okay this is this council has been saying that we want our communities to take over the areas and take responsibility for them that begs for Nigeria there 's probably more prevalent than a lot of other areas would you say that allowing this community this I 'm sorry reserves group to have this income to put back into the line to do what they they can do for the community and be a value to the wider city we 're working on resilience and sustainability for our communities yeah and this is part of it so you need to be part of you know allowed to make those decisions and have a little bit of funding to help them move forward so if this funding was decided to not go to them and go into the big pool they are odds are that there is as this gentleman said that there 's be a the morale would the morale of this group would go down the Narelle sorry the screen go down and also the only other funding they could go for aspect council sort of much time and energy and loses a lot of money in this process so so we 're good to leave them alone they know what they 're doing side them to make sure we all get the best outcomes for our community and for the community board and the council it is achievable and as I said the way that the developing new policy to go around these so that all the reserve management committees are working on a similar sort of footing so their vision for the this particular area fits in with say the governor 's bay with regards to the walk that goes through from the pier thank you yeah Phil thanks Pam actually it was sort of my question really because you 've got the governor 's bay wharf if I recall and there is a track around which goes pretty close to L&L maybe and it 's a so I 'm just wondering how can practice we as a council support the links to the hall preps we 're through our packs and it 's one question because it would it 's a it 's but this this particular committee will have a reserve management plan that will be drawn up with them and with the community so but all of those things can actually brought enough people into it and the other thanks Pam yeah the other part too were clearly interested in is that the strong history in historical aspect of the building in the area so if there 's a way for us as Council in terms of funding to have some some historic link you know for this area so in fact yes I see that you have got the booklet here doesn 't he dove Harbor upstairs heaven look at that and that will be in there so it 's a it is a very important and of course we 've got living Springs just adjacent to the area as well so which is used by a lot of young all sorts of groups go to living springs to to rejuvenate themselves do all sorts of things so it 's great that we bet you 've got a good haul down there as well in a reserve area that can money going back to the reserve management committee but Yanni asked which I 'm not too sure of was actually answered about your last part of your recommendation on was three about actually being potentially allocated partially allocated to other reserve management committees well sure rationale behind that because obviously that could dilute the money go into the people obviously plan at the start it 's part of reviewing and developing the new policy going forward it 's just a suggestion it needs to be worked through and developing that new policy it will be worked through with the community to you know with that particular community to achieve that so it 's not a new black and white at the moment but it may be a consideration down the track but it 's it 's um because obviously it 's not a massive amount of of money and you 've got a very very big community board area and a cookies bread right across and actually you know when you expect small to start with it starts just become crumbs and it doesn 't really achieve what probably is to come back to Council for a decision ultimately isn 't it well come back to the community board will make the review but the right point the review they 'll be reported through to us for a decision well ultimately well why don 't we just take out all the words after well after reserve so that it 's all so you say take out or partially alligator to other reserve management committees at the discretion of the community board just in the meantime because I mean if you if this is really being put on theater as a holding position because of the review why not make that commitment now the the community know exactly what will the committee knows exactly what they can Eric speak and and then you know it then then they know that they 're going to be getting 14 and a half thousand dollars be very register question do we know how long the lease of Fulton Hogan is I 've been made in a variety I can 't_''_1807.79 haven 't me not have find it but well because I mean I was my preference would be to give them the income stream for three years or you know however long I mean I know the reviews going on but you know I just take on board the comments that were made it 's hard for them to plan when we 're expecting all this work to be done with these volunteer reserve committees on a year-to-year basis it would be much better I personally think if we could give them you know a bit more time than that but it is weird that we 're being asked to approve a lease with no no timeframe that I can find in the resolution Andrew yeah the original staff recommendation had a recommendation that we approve the funding for from the lease for a year so regardless of the length of the lease the original staff recommendation was that we approve the funding go to the reserve management committee for a year the reason the Community Board didn 't take that was because there 's no guarantee that the policy review will be completed within the year so we didn 't want to be board having the same debate again just to and to extend the the holding pattern essentially I think we need to be confident that the review will take into account the provisions of reserve management plans the funding needs of the reserve management committees respect the volunteer capability and all the work that 's done the reason we didn 't want a specific timeline whether that was one year or three years or what it might be is because we need that policy review to take place and to be effective and to be able to be implemented so we don 't want any impediments in the way when we get to that point and I think we need to be confident that the review and its recommendations and the community board decision-making around that afterwards will take into account the needs of the reserve management committees and the work that they do the community the reserve management committees our subcommittees of the community board so you know the community board is intimately involved with what they do there 's a liaison person on each of the reserve management committees would be approving a policy position or any changes is that that changed the outcomes how long is the list for that 's a really simple question but I just don 't think it 's good practice for us to agree to a lace without knowing that the timeframe along the lace is cool okay so I 'm a Bruce rijndael was here that he doesn 't seem to hurt sorry Bruce arendelle was to be here to provide a buzz I needed time friend always address it through another resolution making things if I may usually trucking trainer that you have the time frame with the with lease it was an early in paper this is the second paper and I 'm just not convinced that we weren 't told what it was in the first paper because I do you so no but it 's just a bit of a shame anyway we 'll just pop it pop it on hold at the moment we 'll just come back to us in a minute so if you 'd like to turn to your report home right and have has had a wonderful summer I 'm just absolutely amazed at the number of locals that you actually see locals people living in the bays actually down swimming this year it 's been amazing they 've all welcomed the high tides even a pigeon Bay we 've seen a little surfing on with the kids surfing all the high freedom camping continues to resolve those issues we have a very vigilant community the cruise ships have gone reasonably well there will be issues that we 're addressing with her a number of groups and things but life seems to be pretty comfortable and banks financial we 're enjoying the the fine weather and we look forward to what might happen over the next few days perhaps civil thief 's might be required but anyway we 'll all be ready to go because civil defense group meet regularly so I just want to talk about a couple of things that are good things that are going on and social housing in Echo as it 's an exciting development that 's underway they 're going to we 're replacing these old units section with five new ones we 've been a long time and for acara having some social housing we 've got a rest home we 've got an integrated Family Health Center we 've got a whole lot of things social housing as well so it means that our community is fittest that well sustainable resilient and how a small rural community should be operating so we 're delighted to see that moving forward and that will be happening shortly so just I 'd like to say in relation to that that the new integrated Family Health Center that 's being built with the district health board is the first Sods and the ground are being turned on the 24th of February so there will be a pets are well put the wool not not perhaps there will be invitations for anyone that 's interested in coming along and joining us on the old hospital side but it 's exciting for us in a garage to see that these projects all coming together so the next one is about another reserve management committee and this reserve management committee also they for a boardwalk and a car park that has just been completed that 's absolutely delighted well the community that the board the reserve management committee is delighted but the community is delighted to a great spot and you should all be going to have a look at it it 's just off the main highway and it 's that some got some trepidation boards on it it 's all all good stuff so it 's it 's wonderful the next one is about the rod Donald trust now you should all know about the Rob Donald trust and its focus on banks conventional walks that you will have all had information it as a council controlled organization associate you should know about it and Andrew as a trustee of that that organization but this is about them the the Rob Donald trust working with the board to look at how we can actually support them and what what they 're doing going forward it it provides there 's no doubling up on you know where the walking tracks might be or whatever it is it 's actually working together the walks and you can see a number of they 're the ones that they are walking with working with they 're part of City Council ones as well so some we 're looking at but working with them and then also included on and there we 've and put the know we have these strategic goals should be in there somewhere but we might perhaps we might have missed that off but we did actually include an hour but we do work off welcome the opportunity of working with the broad Donald trust and we did have the rod Donald 's trust tragic goals included in the last bit but it 's obviously dropped out and so then we move on to the next one is next what we 've resolved the Ellendale reserve I think in solutes we 've lost the picture up the top anyway it 's it 's all about our part a to part a issues we 've done the Allendale reserve the other one as as the international maritime labour convention and the board is looking for a way to move forward a path in front of you and Andrew what do you take us through this we 've got the paper and the recommendations on it so we 're dealing with this part ii '_''_2318.15 yeah yep is that right right right okay sorry right so Pam you 're happy for me too I 'm happy for your juicer I 'm standing in for Christine today and of course it 's a little turn so a little tongue focus yeah no that 's that 's absolutely fine so just some some background information really for councillor Littleton see Ferris Center is a voluntary organization it 's based on Norwich key in Middleton currently sited in a building which is on land which has been made available by independent probe adoring independent fisheries and it provides services to seafarers wealth and welfare services to visiting seafarers is currently only open three hours a day five days a week and that 's in a context obviously of a port that operates 24 hours a day seven days a week with large numbers of shipping visiting the port and obviously seafarers on those ships who are to contact their families while they 're ashore and so on a number of these seafarers are from overseas countries and typically poor are often Asian countries it wouldn 't be unusual to see particularly in the winter months seafarers huddled around our littleton library using our council Wi-Fi in freezing conditions and driving rain in the dark there have been a couple of examples in the last two years one quite recently of seafarers who have been been killed and that also demonstrates the clear need for welfare services and local services on shore in littleton so the maritime labour convention has been ratified signed up to by government there are a number of clauses in the maritime labour convention that are relevant to the matter that we 're considering today regulation four point four that each member shall ensure that there are sure based welfare services that are accessible seafarers have access to adequate facilities and service and technically competent competent person is employed at a welfare Center in relation to who 's responsible providing welfare facilities the convention suggests that this should be provided by one or in terms of funding the convention suggests that grants from public funds or levies on shipping or other dues from shipping would be appropriate forms of funding so really the questions for us in Littleton and questions that the community board wrestled with in dealing with this in its meeting what Seafarer welfare services should little tin heaven in particular is is what 's provided currently appropriate who 's responsible for providing them and we 're fortunate to have volunteers and the Seafarer Center very little term but realizing that they 're constrained because of the the amount of volunteer labor that 's available and also constrained because of funding and who should fund them and the the issue that was put in front of the community board was that appropriate way of funding would be a levy on shipping so essentially the employers of the people requiring the welfare services contributing to their onshore welfare now the port have made a small contribution a 5,000 contribution to the operation of the welfare Center I think it 's fair to say the seafarers Center would value the opportunity to further regime that resulted in a greater level of funding could be achieved and obviously this has come to us a council with some legal advice alongside around whether we 've got a legal or a moral obligation we obviously as Council and not a signatory to the maritime labour convention I 'd like to see us obviously take the advice from staff but then in the context of that advice look at what positive steps we could take to ensure better outcomes for our visiting seafarers to little term looking at how we can support the seafarers centre to achieve their object in the context of the issues that we 've heard about this morning so I just I 've just emailed it to everyone that I email that email round before and I 'll just run through it until I can get up on the screen so receive the report and attached legal advice noting the provisions of the maritime labour convention regarding seafarers welfare centers note the challenges facing the seafarers Center regarding the resources required to provide these services in the constraints they face due to fundraising shortfall in funding note the provisions of the maritime labour convention which suggests methods of funding which include Oliviana ships note that staff are continuing to discuss what the seafarers seen to the options that may be available to them for seeking funding and grants requi staff to meet with the seafarers center in littleton port company to explore a range of initiatives including the possibility of a levy on shipping that could support the seafarers center in that way with we 've we 've noted everything that the community ball considered I don 't really want to go back to situation of resolving that we don 't have any moral obligations to me it 's not a question of morality it 's a question that the seafarers Center needs a resolution the port company holds the key to one of the ones that are suggested under the maritime labour convention and you know what we can 't direct the port company to do this I take took out the reference to central government but we could talk to central government because if this was simply required if it was the country had to head to levy for the provision of these services then it would be a no-brainer everyone would do it and the resources would be well that the cost would actually fall where they lie and that is with the employers of these seafarers turn Aaron and thank you I totally agree I think the moral obligation is with the employers over the shipping companies and if there was some way in the future that we that we can allow the Littleton port company or any port in this country to be levied for the responsibility to these sailors have been really good but in the short term you know all community boards have a discretionary fund have you thought of using some of that in the short term for this okay as being used so is it something like dollar for dollar to the the port company or I 'm not sure because that you 've mentioned this figure before with regards to what was required or what was asked for so I realized there 's a pressure here but we 've got pressures right throughout so if it goes in a funding and we are stretched for funds I think it could be a very long wait or a very disappointing one picked I don 't know I 'm just saying it 's not going to be a bill in England think that we 're looking at every every possibility in terms of funding not just council funding in the is another way of seeing if it can be achieved um sorry Aaron and aimed Yanni so my question and meanness to year round number five you said before that we can 't get the Littleton pork company to or we can instruct them to but we own them I would have no CC HL was the 100 percent shareholder we have a letter of expectations we have to go through a process if we were to do that but we can 't_''_2857.44 do that right now so just a conversation with the little from port company at this stage may resolve the situation so I 'd rather go down the first duck track first yeah because I 'd rather propose an amendment or a pork company since the other ones that make all the money out of the port between them and the boats that they they paid the bill until such time that the Libby comes in and then watch how quickly the levy gets work through the port company have made enormous contributions to the Seafarer Center especially since the earthquake I mean you see those I think it 's the figure we were told I 've got a more neck since the earthquakes to the sea parrots on it and know that they have the only figure I 've got in front of me is the figure of 5,000 which was the grant from the port to the seafarers Center yeah I mean the port have been involved in conversations about the future of the center but my understanding is that the only financial contribution has been that 5,000 grant right and I think the fisheries company is putting up the site for the center to sit on can we just make that well it says to explore a range of initiatives including the possibility this is just an exploration meeting company before I go any stronger than that okay I 'd be okay with that if we can put a timeline on that weird speak some feedback on that because that conversation could take forever maybe two or three months yeah okay why don 't put request the deputy mayor and staff to meet what 's the Seafarer Center and Littleton port company and report back through the community board so I mean it 's May or something I would imagine by the end of March yeah yeah that would be a good start if by the end of month no oh yeah well okay more than two months it 's fine sorry babe thank you I 'd like to support an endorsement Erin 's just see it because I think the port is a council owned well you know we we have a a large interest in it and we do have an expectation that our organizations have a community focus this place needs a champion and I think that it just makes a lot of sense that it 's the port that is that champion and so it of sponsorship type arrangement where they are just as they sponsor other community organizations and the area where they could be a chief sponsor for for this which is much needed and demonstrates our care for this community of people who are a long way from home who are reliant on technology to connect with their families and at the moment that 's worth Faline edek w 'ite_''_3050.28 so I believe that we could really encourage a really strong champion type relationship from the port to the seafarers organization yeah well that 's why I put Andrew into the mix as well so Yanni just just to I 'm glad that you 've put some governance support in there I 'm a little bit worried about the staff meeting with the Cephas in it and a little support and I think we should be clear about governance to governance management to management and I would suggest that actually the Divi mission met with the chair or the board of the port company representatives because I concur with point that my two other colleagues have made you know we 've just keep some money into that significant money and it does seem to me that there is a there is an inherent responsibility should be on them to make a greater contribution but appreciate you want to set up a process for that to happen I just think we need to be talking to the border port not just management over expectations and I was going to ask staff when the leader of expectation and draft statement of intent are going back to Council for the port because and I think it should be quite soon general the next one income year so between now and June I think it 's like a first to March or deadline isn 't there normally like we 've just said one for vbase come through finance so I just wondered if it was also another opportunity we should take through that process to stress the importance of funding these local welfare initiatives hmm my view Dion is there any way within this that we can look at sort of saying that we actually do agree with the voluntary yeah what does it called the saying here is because there 's nothing really say yeah I mean I I want us to support it I mean I I lived on ships for quite a long time and you know I went around the world and around New Zealand and there are a lot of places that have very good facilities for people that get off ships and that 's the first thing you want to do when you get off the ship you don 't have any Wi-Fi you don 't have internet and you want to catch up with people on you know you 've your family your loved ones and stuff like this so I mean we 're saying nothing really so I 'd like to actually support it if they were support around the table for it it doesn 't mean that we 're going to be immediately doing something but I think we should actually show a you know some sort of moral obligation actually to support this and actually say that we 're a place that welcomes people that have on ships we welcome people that come from the airport in bringing economic benefits to the city through the the trade that the port has I just do not see a reason why we actually we 've got something in front of us that actually is looking at supporting those workers in that we 're actually not saying that we support it we 're just really say nothing yeah I have to confess that until this paper came forward I had never read the maritime labour convention have you read it no so I 've looked at census report came to us yes now but yeah but there 's a link to it and I 've read it and the thing is is that it covers a whole range of things that we cannot be possibly responsible for because we are not the signatory but alas if you want to take the section that deals with welfare centres and say that we support those provisions then that fits very well received the report and attach legal bias noting the provisions of the maritime labour convention regarding seafarers welfare centres number two we support council supports sorry which I 've lost support the provision of access to shore-based welfare facilities is set out in the convention and that covers all of the aspects of the welfare facilities which is what you referred to and then carry on three four five yeah at least we 're now saying something yep yep all right is there anyone else Aaron yeah I 'm quite glad that we 've seen this and it just highlights in our community some trade practices that go on because of international laws that you can come in and have people that are technically working in our country even though they 're employed under another nations flag but they are in our country they 're guests of ours in a way and they are very welcome here and very welcomed by the people of Littleton it 's been a trading port for well I don 't know a century and a half coming up to two centuries it 's it 's it 's an amazing place and some of them are fantastic people and for most of the fantastic people to be honest I struggle with the fact that they in our country for their luxury of a lot of the world being able to buy fish that 's come from our part of the world or us to be able to buy really cheap goods that will then dumped in a landfill in a few weeks after we 've opened them and played with them but that 's the nature of international trade but the international trade is possible because some of the people here are paid less than 600 a month and that doesn 't allow them to catch a bus to McDonald 's to use their Wi-Fi they need to use it in Littleton and so as a good international citizen it 's great that we do support this and that we do have a solution and sex or a way forward that will hopefully lead us to a solution to to keep these gifts of our city and a fair condition while they are here and and help them communicate with their families back home because there 's Dion Sidon he was probably not on less than 2 an hour working for the New Zealand Navy luxury but that 's not the luxury that everyone that works on these boats have and it is it 's a sad situation from some of them I know that some away for months and months and don 't see their children and their only chance to see them via Skype so let 's at least help offer them that luxury so we haven 't got a mover and a seconder for this resolution so you spoke to something that wasn 't moved was seeking didn 't say moved and seconded and so and yanny did you want to speak to it right and Dion can I second it oh no no it 's been a second oh but has it been so you can do yeah all right let 's find um nulls I 'll just say yeah I 'm happy that um and thank you for putting number two in there because I do think that we should have some sort of moral obligation to actually help facilitate you know the support for these people that do come in on the ships because as I said before we there for for the air hostesses the pilots and other stuff like that we 'd make it off a plane after they 've been on there for maybe twelve six hours two hours there 's great facilities for them to you know do that stuff and and we don 't have those same sort of level of facilities for people that have been on a ship for six months potentially generally it 's probably two or three weeks or something like that between port to port so I do is living on a ship myself I think it 's a good step forward and and I 'm glad that it 's been brought to our attention so that we can actually start getting some resolution towards it entry I think the approach that we 've taken here is is a good one if we 'd simply taken the staff recommendation that 's in front of us it wouldn 't have seen as actively do anything so I think the approach is right that we we deal with the port organization first of all to see what they were able to 've got the letter of expectation statements of intent process as a way of engaging more formally with the port if we need to do that I think the two-month time frame that we 've got in our resolution here should allow that to happen within the time frame of the letter expectation statements of intent process so I 'm pleased that we 're not just taking the staffer recommendation that we 're taking a more proactive approach about what we can do and what we can influence for a better outcome what we 're actually talking about here is the the quality of welcome that we 're offering to our seafaring visitors and you know those seafaring visitors are in an environment that without the complications of maybe oppressive employment situations and and other challenges just being at sea is a dangerous and lonely business in itself being separated from your family for weeks often months on end in that hostile environment isn 't easy for these people so when they do have the opportunity to come ashore it 's important that we provide a good a good set support people that inevitably have got needs when they 're ashore and they 're separated from their home country and their families as a little turn resident and someone who spent a number of years involved in businesses on the Main Street in Middleton I 've seen firsthand large numbers of seafarers often huddled outside our library in the wintertime in driving rain and freezing cold conditions and all they 're trying to do is to get a decent internet connection where they can actually see their children and their wives or partners on on a Skype call and I don 't think that 's the quality of welcome we should be offering to anybody let alone people that are already working in a challenged environment so I 'd like to think the resolutions that we 've got in front of us here when they 're implemented will produce a good outcome for the seafarers Center once we report back in two months the community board certainly have got a strong interest in this matter hence the rather unusual community board recommendation in the beginning I think we were just something that we could do beyond saying we don 't have any responsibility in this space I think we should take what responsibility we can at least as an influencer and I don 't doubt that if this first round of activity doesn 't produce anything better then we 'll be wanting to look at other avenues we can take to get to a better outcome very good alright I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and I 'll now move back to the bank 's bunch of report moved by Andrew seconded by Aaron I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed and no that 's carried thank you very much Pam one more oh yes those got to go back to the Ellen ter when I checked it off so so my apologies my previous meeting you were in overtime no no it 's fine Bruce yeah now we just wanted to know how long the lease was for it doesn 't say in the paper yeah so that is through to for works for the road maintenance in that area so it 's just for three years yeah yeah tie the funding from two that reserves can be for the three years to the term of the lease well we 'll just put for the term in the lace yep well we can 't do it beyond the term of the legs no no that 's correct we 're not going to lease it to anyone else yeah yeah but if I 'm hearing counseling at Hanson 's question and there is some work referred to in the report about getting a policy so you could could do that but we are also looking at doing a policy so you may have a situation we have this continuing over the term of the lease and the policy coming in was a different position in that time that 's acceptable but you just need to understand there 's a risk of that yeah I think for three years I 'd rather give the reserve committee some certainty of the funding for three years yeah and develop the policy that may be my the lease because I mean the the disadvantage of writing three years is that it 's three years from when three years from when the lease is signed I don 't know the term of the lease yep all right so we 've got a mover and a seconder for that so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you thank you to the gentleman at the back thank you right Kimani coastal board community board good morning I am starters right there happy new year to all of you don 't it 's alright to sail on the First Epistle so yeah I can just make up rules refreshed had you vitamin D so that 's really good okay I have here with me and my deputy chair Tim centers come to join today and also have board governments manager Joe Wells great team um no parties so straight them to it your Brighton Beach cyber playground well absolutely what can we say congratulations to you or what a team effort these photos you can see you down yesterday I tried to do a little video for you to see and have some reactions for from some other people they 're actually playing I had four people but my technology I 'm afraid has failed and I did promising these little children that they would be seen in front of the mirror and the counselors today and now I have to apologize this to them but we will send this little video to the IT and get see if we can get it for you next time but oh yeah sorry yeah no do that real bring it so we will do that but here we have some three of them that anyway that we did a film and you can see up V of it one must remember you 're a regular about someone else here words and then there was someone else from pre Bolton so actually other before people that interviewed none of them was from you Brighton so that was great news but what we had a brilliant day at the opening we had hundreds of people with the unfortunately you guys had and those people that worked on the project and you know I have to say about the pic the guys that worked on that project they were pouring colouring at two o 'clock in the morning they were working and virtually from 00 in the morning one morning till 00 at night people were trying chocolates over the fence just to keep them going seven days a week so to get that done on time they were literally packed the children and parents packed like sardines over the holidays has just been magic to watch the families enjoying playing together there 's still just a little bit of work to be finished off in the next few months but I hope that you all have been down to check it out or even have a play on it because I have to confess I 've actually been on top of the walker so it come on Lee in a pig ear so you can even do your Titanic version on the front of you know you don 't want to be a bit but you know what a fantastic way brides and so again congratulations following on from that book of course there were at the same time that all this has been going on the hots up what appalls DCL have analyzed the community feedback regarding the design and aspirations for the facility the final concept designs will be coming out shortly in the beginning of this year at the same time the council have been working on that connectivity improvements between the new brighton pedestrian water marine parade so we 're also going to be seeing the results of that consultation and february next we have Thompson Park this is just a bit of a board project that we consolidated a bit of funding from the annual plan the entrance and the car park there is quite visible as virtually plain nothing much a lot of potholes it 's a highly used park so we 've got a bit of concentration on that here wanting to get some landscaping done does just like a dust put in the sample just the witness was around I Love New Brighton me shortly on them it 's always an issue and from the car park to the playground so you know difficult for Prem 's but impossible for wheelchairs so we 're really pleased that we 're working with staff on that to to make some improvements oh I do want to bring up midges this morning and simply because it has been in the public arena lately in the media their staff are giving the board very regular updates we are kept fully informed and I have to say that the South couldn 't be working harder to resolve this and are absolutely dedicated to that they 're educating these pests there with good results up until the first week of January apparently there were no complaints recorded which reflected what they were actually seeing on site and the monitoring that was being undertaken unfortunately the mergers did peak again and mid-january when we had that rain storm but this is a work in progress but there are indications that it will improve as the much management plan is progressed in the board totally support this plan and all the work that the staff are doing another little Correctional net ponds that they had were draining to the sun-baked was the one closest to the reasons it 's not actually the one closest to the reason it 's the one closest to the plant so we 've even you know got probably better results once they are able to get to their second pond closer to the residence and drain and sun-baked that so good on staff and really do appreciate everything that they 're doing and hoping for a really good result cleaners implemented what we 've got here the board had a meeting just prior to Christmas with the Ministry of Education regarding of all the school sites that were closed across their Ward ela sets of them one in particular the community are interested in as the embroidery school site regarding the Roy Stokes Hall we 're just working with these groups they are keen to put a proposal together but unless we have already granted the community and extension for the end of February we are actually hearing from this community at the board meeting on Monday and staff have already indicated to the community that but should they require on Monday some more time to prepare a suitable proposal to take over the ownership and management of the Roy Stokes Hawk sector on that site and given timers of the essence the board like to request council support to request a further extension from the ministry of education you know the great solution will come up after your presentation so thank you yeah this is just pictures of the result of the January floods we 've shown you pictures before but these pictures show further destruction to the environment there 's been some more trees falling over as you can see this others that are in danger of falling over we 've had vegetation and more trapped loss and more land loss and as I 've seen before in the past this is consequence of the Reno mattresses on the history age that were damaged and earthquake that used to provide protection but don 't now but they just need to be fixed and maintained so that community is united to see this edge repaired and we are quite determined to work with staff to of the biggest issues at present so some really good things happening we 've got time I 've got the campground there we hit the South New Brighton camping ground following on from the other one this they most pictures that you saw before happen to be right in front of the camping ground there but we had the privilege of opening this new refurbished catch on the brush and block which was just marvelous a beautiful day but owners have absolutely transformed the campsite and created a real oasis for families to enjoy so good on them but you can unfortunately they had flooding from the history during that January storm and so hence the urgency for the remediation live so now on to the church so we had another opening of the New Brighton Union Parish last weekend which was exciting a very special and exciting celebration and what a journey that they 've had to be on for the past seven years to rebuild us this is another way of life community gathering place returned to New Brighton so here they are so check it out sometime hope some of you got Demi because look at those crabs it was absolutely stunning the sky was filled with colorful kites of all shapes and sizes and the beach was filled with children and families having fun so thank you for supporting that but it was absolutely jam-packed you know huge crowds car parking

there at this point and time and night stream playground are we under that weird we were you here we are the event that 's not not stream playground I must say that there 's not much stream playground is it not it is not street play it 's not it 's not Neil grandpas oh now that 's a that 's a lovely facility and we just can 't_''_4724.369 wait until the defeats has come down and it can be officially open because it 's that 's been constructed for quite some time and in families and children are absolutely loving it but it 's still behind done pizzas so we just mr. Watson is making some inquiries officially launched so we 're looking forward to there and the next one is the Templeton querying issues and is there report says we had a meeting and that 's that 's in saviour 's church with more than 200 people last Monday was a subsequent meeting at the Templeton Community Center with an excess of 500 people at that meeting so they 're really really proactively making the community aware of this if this proposal by Fulton Hogan to actually open a and a massive quarry and just on the boundary of Selwyn district council so when we 've upped our labels and that one councils and it 's just over the boundary so the effects of this quarry are very very much within our Ward and then within the city of Christchurch but the activity itself is just across the road and Selman so and that 's a and hasn 't been and a resource can seem deployed for you so that 's why I 'm commending me and the Templeton residents Association for being proactive in in being involved in communicating with fulton hogan prior to them everybody to be proactive in these situations rather than reactive by moving on the into the air Iranian community yelled and night celebrations and it 's it 's just lovely to see these things happening em in their room and air community multicultural community we 've got a lot to learn from each other as far as some culture and practices concerned and it 's just be really great to see and we can support these these multicultural ravines it 's just so pleasing it 's good for everybody not only that community but for everybody else as well Christmas dinner at the that was a brilliant event I see him in the in our report it mentions its forum for the elder community and I didn 't actually think it was to be able to community but most of them were the artist I was there and I really really enjoyed it but it 's such a wonderful community and the that that Rickett and West community and one of the best things that happened of course was when we had the community policing team move into that area and that community a really really really really well organized a community garden virtually all the food that was vegetables and all that stuff at that dinner was produced by by the community garden and one of them one of the one of the gentlemen Nick and T power he goes out and and does a lot of white baiting during the white break season as well and she is that around the community as well so it 's a really really really really lovely and community and so pleased that we could help support there as well formed the hoops yes I was there with the throwing a few balls and and with the with the community that 's at the brenston used to be the brenston and immediate site which is now than the site of the new and south will be school stretch food to that site but there 's an area there that 's used as a as a youth hangout the drop-ins area and it 's there was a really really lovely event and it was good to see those and akeem debris rims come to support these young people and that that activity we 're very very privileged to have that yeah and of course we 've got the Olympian gymnasia gymnastics an error an elbow in our ward as well at the Woodrum the deal at the Wigram airbase gymnasium has been taken over near by well it was given to Christchurch and it 's the Olympia gymnastics are operating out of there so that 's that 's a yeah it 's a lovely facility and they 're expanding the air room their activities to two different forms of gymnastics important to say that this is the first parkour organized group in Christchurch yes and if you 've ever seen parkour they 're running up the wall and run across the roof and doing things that we only thought that marsupials and awesome how they could do it 's pretty impressive it 's absolutely wonderful now moving on to all the university gear just we had a meeting yesterday thanks Gary with the Vice Chancellor rod car of the University we were with them were there and here would Pendleton why Maori community review around the University and we had the opportunity and we were invited by for dr. Carter and to have a meeting with him yesterday and we were absolutely I was absolutely blown away with the with the changes and and what 's happening at the university over the next 12 months is going to be absolutely massive absolutely massive so they 're shifting the whole College of Education and you know the Teachers College and to add to it to the opposite side if the of the campus completely so they 're going to be some massive changes more on-site student than residential units and air and going in there and it was it was really really helpful wouldn 't it get Gary really really helpful so that was that was really good I think in the parking review it it gave some really good honest information about healthful those car parks are and there 's a perception that they 're not full but because of construction and because of other things they are at a maximum and the student pays for four hundred dollars a year intact a for Mother 's list is about the same price as the twenty full package Tubby 's so when people think that the car parking at the Uni is very very expensive I was really surprised to find out that it is four hundred dollars for a year for on-site car parks here so it 's probably it 's probably not as bad as everything lead to believe now this month 's hyper helpful Brendon facts as some as Rickett and house and record and house was the first house in Christchurch to have electricity so did you know that first test and it also had an intercom so that the residents of the house could talk to the servants and say could you prove me up a cup of tea this morning please so that was some that was another fact is and it 's probably not well known that when the Dean 's family were coming when the Dean 's brothers were coming from Wellington and across Cook Strait they had a they had a barrel of nails now there was a storm and the and during the storm the barrel of nails so when they got to Rickett and and started to build Dean 's cottage they had to make their own nails out of pieces of timber so they they made made their nails like oversized toothpicks and that was what was used to actually hold together and the first Dean 's cottage which is still on site and it 's the oldest it 's the it 's the oldest and was the first house built on the Canterbury Plains so that 's a bit more useless information and the other thing that that amazed amazes a lot of people was when Jane Dean 's decided to emigrate from from Scotland she was packing her bags and what do you think she thought she should take rolls of wallpaper now what a funny thing for a lady to put in bag and when they 're coming out from from to building it build a new life and record in Christchurch was oh I better fill up my cabin truck with wallpaper and that wallpaper is still on the walls at a Trickett and house and we 've 've had it replicated so that this we 've got new rolls of that identical wallpaper so that 's another bit of useless information I don 't know it 's not useless at some have a hyper helpful rent in fact thank you very much so I think Jimmy would like to move the this report and would you like to second the report there any questions comments timbers and far away we 've come well over the 10 minutes I 'm sorry we 've gone over the 10 minutes well and truly I 'm sorry oh I 'm sorry too yeah taking so long no that 's okay I just didn 't want to mention that we 've got to view schools as well as the the Sevenoaks school that 's that 's going to be opening up there 's two more musicals on streams so we need to be aware of that as far as safety issues and all that stuff in the next 12 months we 've got two musicals I think thank you very much thank you very much oh no no that 's right we of the year but I we 've got we 've got three more boards to get through and I 'm sure I had hoped that we could get through them and then have a cup of coffee but we may have to stop and have a couple yeah yeah okay ignite I 'll pop the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you so well the next one is phenols from my Mari here would community board I don 't think you 're going to be very long are you sorry in turn so Aaron Campbell I don 't know if you were presented to the community board before I lost you you did present before so well I won 't make her special welcome then but welcome this nice good morning I think you for having me David Carr I can 't_''_5441.0 be here unfortunately so as a producer and also thank you for stepping in for met who was on annual leave well preserved by the way and happy to take the report as read I just make a and the recess committee meets on the 15th of January and approved the granting of the least operate the boat hire the groins recreation Lake it 'll be on a rolling month by monthly basis and there will be until a new head least can be signed between he can and the CCC mr. Henry Han has now been open for at least a couple weekends now it 's great to see the signs out advertise them that the boat hire and I 'm very optimistic that in the future the public and groups and you know holiday programs will return there may have missed out prior to Christmas and they 'll be utilizing the facility the atrophic issues just as Mike Cynthia we did get a memo from staff regarding the consultation around the university parking plan in the first area that was done the other part regarding traffic issues would be the Glenn Dobie idris Traven road residents association so in lane in the community presentation brought residents the board and stuck together to improve the understanding and communication on all sides of the issue primary focus of upgrade from a roundabout to a traffic light controlled intersection we appreciate the large amount of time that start spent on this and I was particularly pleased to learn of the number of accidents involving vulnerable road users falling out great a traffic light system has dropped considerably so the same thing at the intersections significantly improved under part six these significant projects and initiatives just a correction there under that five point one where it should be 6.1 and 6.2 for example just highlighting jelly park repair work has started that was some December that will be progressing for a you know what a substantial amount of time but in a rolling basis of the facility be open for the public use as much as possibly can the bike initiative is progressing and it 's probably half way through its full summer pool season runs so it 'll be great to see those results come back later in the year I think Elly will speak to the pool day there that we hoped joining us I 'm Vicki and I seen Newsline has a story about the completion of I put it up on Facebook is going to be what 's it now being used for and that was going to be decided by your community board after we were looking at artist-in-residence yes can you tell me what it is yes so regarding them I 'm gonna vote gatehouse the board and staff worked on an artist-in-residence program where discussions on other uses but very happy to have that assistance program of the year so there 's a team of three internationally renowned animators that will be living at the gatehouse while working on a latent on the latest project that 's being produced at the pyramid area so the the CCC 's community arts team will liaise with the production team regarding community outreach during this stay so hopefully that will inspire the development of for more local talent in that area your week before Chris well couple weeks before Christmas yeah yeah the studio opened in fear meet counselor Tina who did the opening and on behalf of the council council were invited and there 's one of the reasons the studio is ou able to them and with the artists in residence which made the difference between Christchurch in Auckland something 's a tipping point and a great one because in our worthy who 's the lead animator on that project as the lead animator on most of Tim Burton 's work and so he is one of the best in the world so if you look him up and are worthy on IMDB you 'll see and he 's got a film coming out soon called Isle of Dogs directed by Wes Anderson it is the story been on Newsline or anything like that mm-hmm I 'm not sure we 've got a update an airport yes I know but this is such a fantastic addition to the story it is and the animators are going to work with local students and they 're going to do a couple outreach programs and show them how a kid growing up in Linwood can go on to be one of the best in the world yeah and that 's the amazing story yeah it does need another story well done that 's really good news so to the heritage teams that you know done the the restoration of the gate house they 're releasing teams that are involved and came in and spoke to the board community arts team I 'm sure there 's lots of other teams and council that have dealt with it but Georgie 's first name those in particularly you know that 's a great outcome fantastic good question yeah alright so you 'd like to move this one errand receipt of this report then Jamie so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no its Carrie thank you very much Aaron Papa no Yanis Ellie Jones I will keep it snappy little guy look at this right through it 's just gonna flip through is it some Connor time or will you do it Christine thank you very much it 's my lovely sister Christine and that 's us we don 't need to see that okay so McFarland Park this is the next stage in the changeover from the Sullivans transitional Community Center project if you like so the transitional center is moving for the people living in that area totally unrelated to the shooting community center they 're completely different projects for different communities so that 's very exciting and the lines are here and March so that 'll be very cool this is a huge thing in our community at the moment with small burns park and pavilion upgrade interestingly the press reported a 2.3 million dollar budget on that I believe it 's really 1.2 1.3 but I 'm just getting those figures achieved hey oh yeah yeah well the figures I 've got and the board 's been given are around 1.2 total but that 's going to be absolutely fantastic and I have to say that the staff have been phenomenal in keeping the community informed about what 's going on and those story board picturing things on the fence are fabulous and also liaison directly with residents who are right by the park that 's been really good as well so can 't wait for that to happen and get underway and be open the edible awards the applications for those on the 2nd of March I this year what are you seeing where you put off last year you didn 't want to threaten me right ok my tomatoes are awesome this year so I think I 'll be taking that one out we 've got 35 people and then the awards this year down from around 45 last year which was a record but that 's because a lot of the older entrance I 'm just not entering anymore so we 're encouraging young ease through and through schools and through local groups so there 's still a great thing that we do in the ward we love it the jelly park pool party again this is a fantastic project that we do and we do this one with Pendleton why Marion here would staff put a huge amount of time and effort into that and this year we have more than 200 use involved in that on 260 local youths involved in that on the 8th of December so fantastic Children 's Day check that out on that 's citywide and that 's on red zone end and it 's always a fantastic family the board 's walking working together on that there 's a across the city it 's not you the big pattern are you just hitting Dave just just so the CNC is continuing as well this is just part of our keeping an eye on things as far as stress and pressure on residents and businesses are concerned this is a big big project in our Ward and it 's going to have some pretty significant impacts for residents and for traffic and the area C and C have been fantastic their constant engagement as as wonderful their fly throughs everything so that 's been fantastic as well but more on that that 's more again been in houses as an issue that we believe might be a problem across the city I know we 've we 've heard about Central City project on this these are a couple in Westminster streets and that house has just appeared the one on the right there which used to be the old Cohens weight-loss building in Casey one is interested don 't ask me how I know that and there 's a this it 's not just about the site for these places it 's the periphery as well and the problem that we 're having with these in the ward at the moment there aren 't a huge number this is another one on the corner of Papua Road and anise road this is on our site of of Papua Road and our ward I believe that one has been abandoned since virtually the day after the 2011 earthquake and the problem is that unless the building or the site is a health and safety risk or as a fire risk there is very little we can do and I 'm wondering if and the board would like to know whether we can have some initial advice from staff and perhaps it can go to regulations and consents with regards to what we can do as a City Council our measure seems to be very high the bar is high when it comes to deciding whether a site or of building is a fire risk you know it can look really like it might just self combust and use it doesn just get some advice and information on that and what are our powers limited to do is there anything we can do that could extend that so we can start getting rid of some of these eyesores and dangerous really and now it 's part of our recovery not to be looking at the same everyday off-street David this is another part of the recovery as well and I know the pressures that the councillors under and the issues around standards of repair but you know with this is just unacceptable and it 's not on any plan to repair so in these particular streets one of them are around Rugby Park but I think that 's pretty awful for people having to be walking dogs and walking along and driving past so we just want some emphasis and effort put on what the repairs of our pavements and roads please and and the ward and it worsens after rain we know that but it 's being exacerbated as well that 's a very good say so just if I could note the issue about the advice from staff on put a note there so nope note that staff will provide advice on abandoned abandoned properties because it 's not just the houses that are in here yeah and fire health and safety and fire risk in terms of yeah and we 've also had a number of staff changes in our community board governance team in the last wee one I just want to acknowledge the work that Christine is doing at the moment and she 's hit the ground running and come in and as just fantastic at keeping all of us in the loop and joking the whole lot of balls at once so Thank You Christine no it 's not quite right and it 's it 's it 's not just the community board I thought we 're going to go through rigor makes it very very performant yes so staff can provide advice to the regulatory performance committee as charms on all of the all of the it 's it 's on all of the risks around abandoned properties because it 's not just health and safety and fire risks it 's actually just living was looking for things in the TV sites as well the inside yeah all the hang on and empty sections section yeah point out that not all of the houses that abandoned makes it seem like people have just sort of dropped and don 't care but many of these will be he sort of under discussions still insurance issues they 're not have been that that 's not able to go back there might be a desire to so just that the word have been in itself sort of implies a lack of care well it might be it might be facing smoke damaged or something loose of it I know but but we 're only talking about when the council would take regulatory action yeah so so we 're not talking about you know people that haven 't settled their insurance and it 's really part of this would be actually because I agree I agree with Syria that we need to know why these buildings are like this it 's got to be part of of informing how we can manage them because you do not want what the current rules are and how they 're applied and whether and whether there are any changes to the to the regulatory framework we 've got a process in place around the CBD we have got we would need to design a completely different approach for residential and it does require a very careful and considered approach it 's a summer thing because some people are pretty embarrassed about we say abandoned vacant so just covers it yeah because I do you understand what 's you 're saying around abandoned vacant thank you Roddy 's and in decisions yeah know that CBD that 's the advice we 're looking for I think we wanted to kick off with just getting advice and I wanted that notice for the council on an agenda that 's all so well perhaps you could add to the thing and relevant bylaws because that way that because if regulatory performance are going to come up what are going to come up with some they 're going to consider the advice then it may well be that they can link start to give some direction I think you just wonder whether the housing subcommittee cruel so received that we 've it 's sort of why don 't you just get rid of it get rid of it we 're not going to note anything in the minute I mean it 's just I don 't want to turn this into her no no mayor things it is around the regulation yes it 's around its what finals no I just only asking food it 's just to get it can be circulated to everyone okay but it 's I just want somebody to look at what the current rules and regulations are and then try and look at what we need to do next it 's a perfectly valid thing that the community board have brought up I want a solution yeah ask whether that resolution or gives though what of that committee being able to look at things that ordering councils and regeneration plans because we 've been through this numerous times as a city and the advice has always been consistent so that we can 't do things through district plan and bylaws at us I just didn 't want to limit it to just do you know what the oh you you do know what all the rules are I don 't know what all the rules are and I 'd know the standard that triggers action and I couldn 't tell you hand on heart the sequence of events that staff have to go through to order compliance or compel compliance so I don 't know what that is so let 's just get a piece of advice written down referred to the relevant committee and then take it from there it 's just on the agenda now Mike well I was going to be Pauline second as the other council member I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that it 's carried sometimes I regret things I start Carolyn would you like to present your report and then and then we we will close the meeting and have a cup of tea and we 're going to be very short the only this is the only picture we 've got and we class at Barrington who has volunteered his window on several occasions to help the community board in its activities and this is the edible gardens sailors and what Ali was talking about the edible gardens awards that are due for judging this month and he put this great display out and these Tomatoes draped down the side and things and cooperation with the council which is almost unprecedented we 've got several parties most of them are without controversy I would have I would think the one that 's caused the most inks probably is Rebecca and Vernon every black fern and her dog and the rest of the world goes they attract at least once in their lifetime and tricks up and the locals are fed up with not being able to get out of their houses or get down the street the the it 's taken a very long time and I 'd like to thank the traffic engineers particularly John doar for the patience with which they 've gone through this because rocky road was raised a couple of years ago but it 's been difficult to terraces on the port hills who believe that once repairs am sorted the other terraces will be over packed as well so it 's taken claims been quite a stressful issue the other thing that we 've got from it was that half of rocky road is in Lynnwood central he 's good and we had to have a joint meeting this must test the patience of staff we had to have a joint meeting to decide one side of the road and the other side of the road and staff even tried to get it sorted at one time but we didn 't get a caucus on one in one part it didn 't provide a caucus so they had to in the end have two meetings on that but we 're going to head that we 're going to have that issue again with Dyess Pass Road which has been decided by the two boards I just want to mention one more thing we are organising in our board a licensing licensing briefing alcohol licensing briefing for residents and community groups in February and March we 're organizing have an informed community on these two issues and but we were beaten to one of those issues by the sprayin Network which is a Residents Association and sprayin who had a meeting of their only other day on alcohol licensing and they invited the Health Board and munity law and to explain the issues within good on them and I attended the meeting and it was extremely interesting I I have asked for additional information on the licensing laws too I 'll also provide factual evidence to support proposals that are opposed to extra alcohol licensing in an area on the grounds that the number of licenses does affect the community in terms of damage to the community with the additional numbers that can provide alcohol apparently the evidence is mixed but does fall on the side of the numbers of alcohol disputes as having an effect on the community personally I believe that alcohol should be subject to a change in attitude as smoking was we 're over the consequences of drinking too much alcohol becomes unacceptable to the community just as smoking has become unacceptable to the there for you that 's up apart from the patterns very good so I presume that this is a term and a full mover and seconder are there any questions so move Tim second to fill I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you and then knows how to clear these shortest meeting that I 've ever conducted over closed and have you switched off you _"

Carr to and to have a meeting with him yesterday and we were absolutely I was absolutely blown away with the with the changes and and what 's happening at the university over the next 12 months is going to be absolutely massive absolutely massive so they 're shifting the whole College of Education and you know the Teachers College and to add to it to the opposite side if the of the campus completely so there 's going to be some massive changes a lot more fun on site student than residential units and air really helpful wouldn 't it get Gary really really helpful so that was that was really good I think into the parking review it it gave some really good honest information about how all those car parks are and there 's a perception that they 're not full but because of construction and because of other things they are in a maximum in the students 400 dollars a year a point of event that for a student to pack for a month is list is about the same price as the 24 pack of studies so when people think that the car parking at the Uni is very very expensive I was really surprised to find out that there 's 400 for a year for on-site car parks here so it 's probably it 's probably not as bad as everything lead to believe yeah this is a much hyper helpful green face as as Rickett and house and Rickett and house was the first house in Christchurch to have electricity so did you know that first test and it also had an intercom so that the residents of the vroom the uppercut to you this morning please so that was some that was another fact is and it 's probably not well known that when the Dean 's family were coming when the Dean 's brothers were coming from Wellington and across Cook Strait they had a they had a barrel of now there was a storm and the and during the storm as they were crossing the the Cook Strait they lost the barrel of nails so when they got to Rickett and and started to build Dean 's cottage they had to make their own nails out of pieces of timber so this they made made their nails like oversized toothpicks and that was what was used to actually hold together and the first Dean 's cottage which is still on site and it 's the oldest it 's the it 's the oldest and was the first house built on the Canterbury Plains so that 's a bit more useless information and the other thing that amazed amazes a lot of people was when Jane Dean 's decided to emigrate from from Scotland she was packing should take rolls of wallpaper now what a funny thing for a lady to put in bag and when they 're coming out from from to build and build a new life and Richard in Christchurch was oh I better fill up my cabin truck with wallpaper and that wallpaper is still on the walls at at cricket and house and we 've had it and we 've had it and we 've had it replicated so that these we 've got new rolls of that identical wallpaper so that 's another bit of useless information on it no it 's not useless that summer hat I hypo helpful wren in fact thank you very much so I think Jimmy would like to move the this report and would you like to second the report there any questions no comments of other tempers and far away one over the ten minutes I 'm sorry we 've gone over the ten minutes well and truly I 'm sorry oh I 'm sorry too yeah taking so long no that 's okay I just did want to mention that we 've got school that 's that 's going to be opening up there 's two musicals on streams so we need to be aware of that as far as safety issues and all that stuff in the next 12 months we 've got two musicals I think thank you very much thank you very much all taken no no no that 's right we 're just I 'm being reasonably relaxed at the beginning of the year but I we 've got we 've got three more boards to get through and I 'm I had hoped that we could get through them and then have a cup of coffee but we may have to stop and have a cup of coffee yeah yeah okay ignite I 'll pop the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "my slide presentation well acara all been spun and has had a wonderful summer I 'm just absolutely amazed at the number of locals that you actually see locals people living in the bays actually down swimming this year it 's been amazing they 've all welcomed the high tides even a pigeon Bay we 've seen a little surfing on with the kids surfing all the freedom camping continues forward to resolve those issues we have a very vigilant community the cruise ships have gone reasonably well there will be issues that we 're addressing with her a number of groups and things but life seems to be pretty comfortable and banks financially we 're enjoying the the fine weather and we look forward to what might happen over the next few days perhaps civil defense might be required but anyway we 'll all be ready to go because civil defense group meet regularly so I just want to talk about a couple of things that are good things that are going on and social housing in a car as it 's an exciting development that 's underway they are in very poor repair on quite a large section with five new ones we 've been a long time waiting and for a car are having some social housing we 've got a rest home we 've got an integrated Family Health Center we 've got a whole lot of things social housing as well so it means that our community is fittest that well sustainable resilient and how a small rural community should be operating so we 're delighted to see that moving forward and that will be happening shortly so just I 'd like to say in relation to that that the new integrated Family Health Center that 's being built with the District Health Board is the first Sods and the ground are being turned on the 24th of February so there will be a pets are well put the walk not not perhaps there will be invitations for anyone that 's interested in coming along and joining us on the old hospital side but it 's exciting for us in a garage to see that these projects all coming together so the next one is also they had a bit of funding allocated from the City Council for a boardwalk and a car park that has just been completed that 's absolutely delighted well the commute that the board the reserve management committee is delighted but the community is delighted to a great spot and you should all be going to have a look at it it 's just off the main highway and it 's that some got some trepidation boards on it it 's all all good stuff so it 's wonderful the next one is about the rod Donald trust now you should all know about the Rob Donald trust and its focus on banks conventional walks that you will have all had information it as a council controlled organization associated to know about it and Andrew as a trustee of that meant organization but this is about them the Rob Donald trust working with the board to look at how we can actually support them and what what they 're doing going forward it it provides there 's no doubling up on you know where the walking tracks might be or and a collaboration to a complete number of the walks and you can see a number of they 're the ones that they are walking with working with they 're part of City Council ones as well so it 's um we 're looking at working with them and then also included on and there we 've and put the know we have their strategic goals should be in the assembly but we my pets we might have missed that off but we did actually include an hour but we do work off welcome the opportunity of working with the broad Donald trust and we did have the rod Donald 's trust strategic goals included in an aspect but it 's obviously dropped out and so then we move on to the next one is next what we 've resolved the Ellendale reserve I think is loose we 've lost the picture at the top anyway it 's it 's all about our part a two-part a issues we 've done the Allendale reserve the other one as as the international maritime labour convention and the board is looking for issues so you 've got the paper in front of you and Andrew would you take us through this we 've got the paper and the recommendations on us so we 're dealing with this part ii '_''_288.14 yeah yep is that right right right okay sorry right so Pam you 're happy for me too I 'm happy for you I 'm standing in for Christine today and of course it 's a little turn so a little tongue focus yeah no that 's that 's absolutely fine so just some some background information really for councillor Littleton see Ferris Center is a voluntary organization it 's based on Norwich key in Littleton currently sited in a building which is on land which has been made available by independent probe adoring independent fisheries and it provides services to seafarers well set welfare services to visiting seafarers is currently only open three hours a day five days a week and that 's in a context obviously of a port that operates 24 hours a day seven days a week with large numbers of shipping visiting the port and obviously seafarers and in particular the ability to contact their families while they 're ashore and so on a number of these seafarers are from overseas countries and typically poor are often Asian countries it wouldn 't be unusual to see particularly in the winter months seafarers huddled around our littleton library using our council Wi-Fi in freezing conditions and driving rain in the dark there have been a couple of examples in the last two years one quite recently of seafarers who been been killed and that also demonstrates the clear need for welfare services and local services on shore in Littleton so the maritime labour convention has been ratified signed up to by government there are a number of clauses in the maritime labour convention that are relevant to the matter that we 're considering today regulation 4.4 that each member shall ensure that there are sure based welfare services that are accessible seafarers have access to adequate facilities and service and that a technically competent competent person is employed at a welfare Center in relation to who 's responsible providing welfare facilities the convention suggests that this should be or voluntary organisations and in terms of funding the convention suggests that grants from public funds or levies on shipping or other dues from shipping would be appropriate forms of funding so really the questions for us in Littleton and questions that the community board wrestled with in dealing with this in its meeting what 's the fare of welfare services should Littleton happen in particular is is what 's provided currently appropriate who 's responsible for providing them and we 're fortunate to have volunteers and the seafarers center there in Littleton but realizing that they 're constrained because of the amount of volunteer labor that 's available and also constrained because of funding and who should fund them and the the issue that was put in front of the community board was that appropriate way of funding would be a levy on shipping so essentially the employers of the people requiring the welfare services contributing to their onshore welfare now the port have made a small contribution a 5,000 contribution to the operation of the welfare Center I think it 's fair to say that the seafarers Center to see whether a better funding regime that resulted in a greater level of funding could be achieved and obviously this has come to us at Council with some legal advice alongside around whether we 've got a legal or a moral obligation we obviously as Council and not a signatory to the maritime labour convention I 'd like to see us obviously take the advice from staff but then in the context of that advice look at what positive steps we could take to ensure better outcomes for our visiting seafarers to little term looking at how we can support the seafarers centre to achieve their objectives in the context of the the issues that we 've heard about this morning so I 've just I 've just emailed it to everyone that I email that email round before and I 'll just run through it until I can get up on the screen so receive the report and attached legal advice noting the provisions of the maritime labour convention regarding seafarers welfare centres note the challenges facing the seafarers centre regarding the resources required to provide these services a shortfall in funding due to due to a shortfall in funding note the provisions of the maritime labour convention which suggest methods of funding which include Olivie on ships note that staff are continuing to discuss with the seafarers seen to the options that may be available to the emphasis in funding and grants request staff to meet with the seafarers centre in Middleton port company to explore a range of initiatives including the possibility of a levy on shipping that could support the seafarers centre in that way with we 've we 've noted everything that the community Bal considered I don 't really want to go back to situation of resolving that we don 't have any moral obligations or to me it 's not a question of morality it 's a question that the Cepheus Center needs a resolution the port company holds the key to one of the ones that are suggested under the maritime labour convention and you know what we can 't direct the port company to do this I took out the reference to central government but we could talk to central a matter of course of every port and the company the country had to head to levy for the provision of these services then it would be a no-brainer everyone would do it and the resources would be well that the cost would actually fall where they lie and that is with the employers of these seafarers turn Aaron and thank you I don 't under I think the moral obligation is with the employers over the shipping companies and if there was some way in the future that we that we can allow the Littleton port company or any port in this country to be levied for the responsibility to these sailors have been really good but in the short term you know all community boards have a discretionary fund have you thought of using some of that in the short term for this okay as being used so dollar for dollar to the the port company or I 'm not sure because that you 've mentioned this figure before with regards to what was required or what was asked for so I realize there 's a pressure here so many different communities in community boards so if it goes in a funding and we are stretched for funds I think it could be a very long wait or a very disappointing one picked I don 't know I 'm just saying it 's not going to be the bill in England looking at every every possibility in terms of funding not just cancer funding and this is another way of seeing if it can be achieved um sorry Aaron and aimed Yanni so my question and meanness to year round number five you said before that we can 't get the Littleton pork company to or we can instruct them to but we own them I would have no see CHL was the 100 percent shareholder we have a letter of expectations we have to go through a process if we were to do that but we can 't_''_827.44 do that right now so just a conversation with a little from port company at this stage may resolve the situation so I 'd rather go down the first track first yeah because I 'd rather propose an amendment the Littleton port company since the other ones that make all the money out of the port between them and the boats that they they paid the bill until such time that the Libby comes in and then watch how quickly the levy gets work through the port company have made enormous contributions to the Seafarer Center especially since the earthquake I mean you see those I think it 's the figure we were told I 've got a more neck since the earthquakes to the sea parrots on it and know that they have the only figure I 've got in front of me is the figure of five thousand dollars which was the grant from the port to the seafarers Center yeah I mean the port have been involved in conversations about the future of the center but my understanding is that the only financial contribution has been that 5,000 grant right and I think the fisheries company is putting up the site for the center to sit on can we just make that well it says to explore a range of initiatives including the possibility this is response from the port company before I go any stronger than there oh okay I 'll be okay with that if we can put a timeline on that we would expect some feedback on that because that conversation could take forever maybe two or three months yeah okay why don 't put request the deputy mayor and staff to meet with the Seafarer center and little some port company and report back through the community board so I mean it 's May or something I would imagine by the end of March yeah yeah that would be a good start if by the end of month no oh yeah well okay more than two months it 's fine sorry babe thank you I 'd like to UM support an endorsement Erin 's just see it because I think the port is a council owned well you know we we have a large interest in it and we do have an expectation that our organizations have a community focus this place needs a champion and I think that it just makes a lot of sense that it 's the port that they could enter into some kind of sponsorship type arrangement where they just as they sponsor other community organizations and the area where they could be a chief sponsor for for this which is much needed and demonstrates our care for this community of people who are a long way from home who are reliant on technology to connect with their families and at the moment that 's worth Faline adequate so I believe that we could really encourage a really strong champion type relationship from the port to the seafarers organization yeah well that 's why I put Andrew into the mix as well so Yanni just just to I 'm glad that you 've put some governance supporting there I 'm a little bit worried about the staff meeting with the Cephas in it and a little support and I think we should be clear about governance to governance management to management and I would suggest that actually the Divi mission mate with chair or the board of the pork company representatives because I concur with the point that my two other colleagues have made you know we 's put heaps of money into that significant money and it does seem to me that there is a there is an inherent responsibility should be on them to make a greater contribution but appreciate you want to set up a process for it to happen I just think we need to be talking to the board of port not just management over expectations and I was going to ask staff when the leader of expectation enter a statement of intent are going back to Council for the port because and I think it should be quite sane generally year so between now and June I think it 's like a first to March or deadline isn 't there normally like we 've just said one for vbase come through finance so I just wondered if it was also another opportunity we should take through that process to stress the importance of funding these local welfare initiatives shouldn 't be off the hook mmm my view I 'm dealing is there any way within this that we can look at sort of saying that we actually do agree with the one I mean because what we 're saying here is because there 's nothing really say yeah I mean I want us to support it I mean I lived on ships for quite a long time and you know I went around the world and around New Zealand and there are a lot of places that have very good facilities for people that get off ships and that 's the first thing you want to do when you get off a ship you don 't have any Wi-Fi you don 't have internet and you want to catch up with people on you know you 've your family your loved ones and stuff like this so I mean we 're saying nothing really so I 'd like to actually support it if they were support around the table for it it doesn 't mean that we 're going to be immediately doing something but I think we should actually show a you know some sort of moral obligation actually to support this and actually say that we 're a place that welcomes people that have ships we welcome people that these people I work in bringing economic benefits to the city through the trade that the port has I just do not see a reason why we actually we 've got something in front of us that actually is looking its prepare supporting those workers and that we 're actually not saying that we support it we 're just really say nothing yeah I have to confess that until this paper came forward I had never read the maritime labour convention have you read it no so I 've looked into it census report came to us yes now but yeah but there 's a link to it and I 've read it and the thing is is that it covers a whole range of things that we cannot be possibly responsible for because we are not the signatory but alas if you want to take the section that deals with welfare centres and say that we support those provisions then that fits very well received the report and attached legal base noting the provisions of the maritime labour convention regarding seafarers welfare centres number two we support council supports we support the provision we support the provision of access to shore-based welfare facilities is set out in the convention and that covers all of the aspects of the welfare facilities which is what you want food to and then carry on three four five yeah at least we 're now saying someone yep yep all right is there anyone else Aaron yeah I 'm quite glad that we 've seen this and it just highlights in our community some trade practices that go on because of international laws that you can come in and have people that are technically working in our country even though they 're employed under another nations flag but they are in our country they 're guests of ours in a way and they are very welcome here and very welcomed by the people of Littleton it 's been a trading port for well I don 't know a century and a half coming up to two centuries it 's it 's it 's an amazing place and some of them are fantastic people and well most of the fantastic people to be honest not can be paid so poorly and that you can trade in our country for their luxury of a lot of the world being able to buy fish that 's come from our part of the world or us to be able to buy really cheap goods that will then dumped in a landfill in a few weeks after we 've open them and played with them but that 's the nature of international trade but their international trade is possible because some of the people here are paid less than 600 a month and that doesn 't allow them to catch a bus to McDonald 's to use their Wi-Fi they need to use it in Littleton and so as a good international citizen it 's great that we do support this and that we do have a solution and sex or a way forward that will hopefully lead us to a solution to to keep these gifts of our city and a fair condition while they are here and and help them communicate with their families back home because there 's Dion Sidon he was probably not on less Navy 19600 and three good square meals the luxury that that 's not the luxury that everyone that works on these boats have and it is it 's a sad situation from some of them I know that some away for months and months and don 't see their children and their only chance to see them spire Skype so let 's at least help offer them that luxury so we haven 't got a mover and a seconder for this resolution so you spoke to something that wasn 't moveable seeking did say moved and seconded and so and Yanni did you want to speak to it like right and Dion can I second it no no it 's been Sikandar but as it being so you can do yeah all right that 's fine um Niles I 've to say yeah I 'm happy that um and thank you for putting number two in there because I do think that we should have some sort of moral obligation to actually help facilitate you know the support for these people that do come in on the ships because as 've got great facilities there for for the air hostesses the pilots and other stuff like that we make it off a plane after they 've been on there for maybe twelve six hours two hours there 's great facilities for them to you know do that stuff and and we don 't have those same sort of level of facilities for people that have been on a ship for six months potentially generally it 's probably two or three weeks or something like that between port to port so I do is living on a ship myself right I think it 's a good step forward and and I 'm glad that it 's been brought to our attention so that we can actually start getting some resolution towards it entry I think the approach that we 've taken here is a good one if we 'd simply taken the staff recommendation that 's in front of us it wouldn 't have seen it actively do anything so I think the approach is right that we we deal with the port organization first of all to see what they clearly we 've got the letter of expectation statements of intent process as a way of engaging more formally with the port if we need to do that now the two-month time frame that we 've gotten our resolution here should allow that to happen within the time frame of the letter expectation statement of intent process so I 'm pleased that we 're not just taking the staffer recommendation that we 're taking a more proactive approach about what we can do and what we can influence for a better outcome what we 're actually talking about here is the the quality of welcome that we 're offering to our seafaring visitors and you know those seafaring visitors are in an environment that without the complications of maybe oppressive employment situations and and other challenges just being at sea is a dangerous and lonely business in itself being separated from your family for weeks often months on end in that hostile environment isn 't easy for these people so when they do have the opportunity to come ashore it 's important that we provide a good a good set support people that inevitably have got needs when they 're ashore and they 're separated from their home country and their families as a little term resident and someone who spent a number of years involved in businesses on the Main Street in Littleton I 've seen firsthand large numbers of seafarers often huddled outside our library in wintertime in driving rain and freezing cold conditions and all they 're trying to do is to get a decent internet connection where they can actually see their children and their wives or our partners on on a Skype call and I don 't think that 's the quality of welcome we should be offering to anybody let alone people that are already working in a challenged environment so I 'd like to think the resolutions that we 've got in front of us here when they 're implemented will produce a good outcome for the seafarers Center once we report back in two months the community board certainly have got a strong interest in this matter hence the rather unusual community board recommendation in the beginning I think we were just something that we could do beyond saying we don 't have any responsibility in this space I think we should take what responsibility we can at least as an influencer and I don 't doubt that if this first round of activity doesn 't produce anything better then we 'll be wanting to look at other avenues we can take to get to a better outcome yep very good all right I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and I 'll now move back to the _"

    "text": "Pam Richardson to come forward for the bank 's peninsular Community Board and could we begin with the Allendale transport yard site so rather than dealing with your report first if we did move to your part a report item number seven Allendale transport yard site so could yes very happy to do that but just needed just want to remind the council of what the reserve management committee is about but just very briefly about what the reserve management committees are there are 15 of them across the peninsula Allendale is just one of them Robinson 's Bay the other other issue that we 've gotten our and our report this morning or it 's got a good outcome so they all have issues around they don 't actually have enough they don 't actually get any funding to support to do some of their work some of them do a number of them do like the Akane 's Bay camping ground the devotionals camping ground the pigeon Bay camping ground and there are others that receive a little bit of funding are we she receives a little bit management committees do their work so though the reserve management committees enable communities to make decisions about their own local reserves you know by having direct and port and Stewart and Dennis actually talked about that people are people are interested in doing things so they have to have a little bit of money so they can do things but they are ultimately accountable to the council or to the community board and to the council they 're all different and some of them have several parcels of land but at the moment we 're actually going through a program of reviewing the policies and developing that is taking some time these reserve management committees are very old they go back to you know before backpacks but banks village to district council days early in district councils that are involved in those reserve areas so we are working in an you wouldn 't nothing at coming up with some new guidance for reserve management committees so just just yes just moving on to the part a around that that reserve area right so Andrew would you like to move the we have in front of us then drop a seconder for that rep you need questions or discussion yep to check two things one as I was concerned that money from here could go to that other reserve management committee so don 't know how you want to deal with that and the second question I had was in the report there 's quite a lot of talk about they can 't have existing lease rights but it 's Fulton Hogan proposing to do something quite significantly different or is that I mean I just just trying to understand there 's any concern over what could possibly go there so the council decided that they couldn 't work out the number yeah that 's what the report is very clear about there so so therefore it 's to use rights but not be done but Fulton Hogan will be doing it 's a it 's a yard where they 've got tractors and trucks and stuff it 's the same use as was before but the responsibility if it turns out to get that consent right but there 'll be happen if we lease it to them on a positive night okay this is this council has been saying that we want our communities to take over the areas and take responsibility for them that begs for Nigeria there 's probably more prevalent than a lot of other areas would you say that allowing this community this I 'm sorry reserves group to have this income to put back into the line to do what they they can do for the community and be a value to the wider city we 're working on resilience and sustainability for our communities yeah and this is part of it so you need to be part of you know allowed to make those decisions and have a little bit of funding to help them move forward so if this funding was decided to not go to them and go into the big pool they are odds are that there is as this gentleman said that there 'd be the morale would the morale of this group would go down the Narelle sorry the screen go down and also the only other funding they a bureaucrat criticals process which takes so much time and energy and loses a lot of money in this process so so it 's good to leave them alone they know what they 're doing side them to make sure we all get the best outcomes for our community and for the community board and the council it is achievable and as I said the way that the developing new policy to go around these so that all the reserve management committees are working on a similar sort of 40 to their vision for the this particular area fits and let 's say the governance bay with regards to the walk that goes through from the the pier okay thank you yep so thanks Pam if you that was sort of my question really because you 've got the governor 's bay wharf if I recall and there 's a track around which goes pretty close to L&L maybe and it 's a cyclone I 'm just wondering how can press we as a council support the links to the haul preps we 're through our packs and that 's a popular walking driveway that goes through there as well but this this particular will have a reserve management plan that will be drawn up with them and with the community but all of those things can actually bought and people are in charge and the other thanks Pam yeah the other part too were clearly interested in is that the strong history in historical aspect of the building in the area so if there 's a way for us as counsel in terms of funding to have some some historic link you know for this area so in fact the booklet here doesn 't heed of however upstairs heaven look at that and that will be in there so it 's a it is a very important and of course we 've got living Springs just adjacent to the area as well so which is used by a lot of young all sorts of groups go to living springs to to rejuvenate themselves do all sorts of things so it 's great that we 've actually got a good haul down there as well and a reserve area that the money going back to the reserve management committee but you only ask question not to shrug was actually answered about your last part of your recommendation on three about actually being potentially allocated partially advocated to other reserve management committees well sure rationale behind that because obviously that could dilute the money go into the people obviously paying at the start it 's part of reviewing and developing the new policy going forward it 's just a suggestion it needs to be worked through and developing that new policy it will be worked through with the community to you know with that particular community to achieve that so it 's not black and white at the moment but it may be a consideration down the track but it 's it 's um because obviously it 's not a massive amount of of money and you 've got a very very big community board area and it cookies bread right across and actually you know when you expect small to start with it starts just become crumbs and it doesn 't really achieve what probably is needed at the well Council for a decision ultimately isn 't it well come back to the community board we 'll make the review but the point the review they 'll be reported through to us for a decision well ultimately be well why don 't we just take out all the words after well after reserve so that it 's or so you say take out or partially alligator to other reserve management committees at the discretion of the community board just in the meantime because I mean if you if this is really being put on there as a holding position because of the review why not make that commitment now that the community know exactly what will the committee knows exactly what they can are expect and and then you know it then then they know that they 're going to be getting 14 and a half thousand dollars artistic Christian do we know how long the lease of Fulton Hogan is I 've been maybe enough right I can 't_''_563.8 be no to find it but well because I mean I was just from what we heard from the deputation income stream for three years or you know however long I mean I know the review is going on but you know I just take on board the comments that were made it 's hard for them to plan when we were expecting all this work to be done with these volunteer reserve committees on a year-to-year basis it would be much better I personally think if we could give them you know a bit more time than that but it is weird that we 're being asked to approve a lease with no no timeframe that I can find in the resolution Andrew yeah the original staff recommendation had a recommendation that we approve the funding for from the lease for a year so regardless of the length of the lease the original staff recommendation was that we approve the the funding goes to the reserve management committee for a year the reason the community board didn 't take that was because there 's no guarantee that the policy review will be completed within the year so we didn 't want to be back here making the same decision just to and to extend the the holding pattern essentially I think we need to be confident that the review will take into account the provisions of reserve management plans the funding needs of the reserve management committees respect the volunteer capability and all the work that 's done the reason we didn 't want a specific timeline whether that was one year or three years or what it might be is because we need that policy review to take place and to be effective and to be able to be implemented so we don 't want any impediments in the way when we get to that point and I think we need to be confident that the review and its recommendations and the community board decision-making around that afterwards will take into account the needs of the reserve management committees and the work that they do the community the reserve management committees our subcommittees of the community board so you know the community board is intimately involved with what they do there 's a liaison person on each of the reserve management committees including Alan Dale I can 't or any change is that that changed the outcomes how long is the list for that 's a really simple question but I just don 't think it 's good practice for us to agree to at least without knowing that the timeframe along the laces for okay so I 'm Abreu Springdale was here that he doesn 't seem to them sorry Bruce arendelle was to be here to provide a buzz I needed time friend always address it through another resolution making things if I may usually trucking trainer that you have the time frame with the with lease it was an early in paper this is the second paper and I 'm just not convinced that we weren 't told what it was in the first paper because I do you so know but it 's just a bit of a shame anyway we 'll just pop it pop it on hold at the moment we 'll just come back to it in a minute so if you 'd like to turn to your report right and have we got _"

    "text": "I 'm Stewart bald and Dennis Aldridge from the Allendale reserve management committee to come forward thank you very much for your understanding enabling our chair of the other Community Board to leave they do I 'll read out our submission just just to get it done quickly this is about the Allendale Hall repairs at the bottom of the rather than have a basin it 's a pretty early part of the settlement it 's pretty much in the late 1840s early eighties the Annandale Hall Quaker it appears been a CCC work in progress for some time and it 's now nearly complete result has been to bring this hundred and twenty year old facility into the 21st century and to give it a new lease of life community and this committee thank the city and banks potential community board for making this possible there are generations of local general local residents who appreciate the work that 's been done and look forward to good and social times at the reserve again the first point to make is the Annandale reserve management committee support the Banks Peninsula community of the reserve transport yard to the bank 's financial community board to enable them to allocate funding to this reserve at the discretion of the community community board now for many years the rental of the transport yard has been provided it has provided the only income for the reserve management committee to build and develop and expand and maintain and operate the entire reserve this has been a successful long-term venture and has provided a large capacity venue for community operated events use of this Reserve has produced funding streams through other community organizations for example the Chumley homes and the governor 's Bay Community Association and community groups typical events held here a multi-sports we ran a triflin here for 17 years football cricket fairs golden oldies large community meetings private celebrations large community meetings have difficulty in finding venues with parking and seating capacity and this is a 300 meter hall that does all that for us and has done for years casual use in the reserve include outdoor party events dog exercise golf practice horse riding touch rugby and shorelines bird-watching since the 2010 quakes of surrogacy deteriorated our committee has a list on the back of our submission here of pressing jobs on the agenda to bring this facility into a good state of repair and maintenance there are significant ground works to deal with and also additional building work to finish and this will take a number of years to complete and a lot of funding the second point we would like to make as the reserve committee has a contrary view to staff recommendation that a one-year allocation of these rental incomes from the reserve transport yard will have a significant impact on our operational recovery our job list has an estimated DIY cost Cindy said against it just to give you a bit of scale with present a health and safety constraints of work practice these sums will not remotely be sufficient to contract out the works presently there 's no alternative funding scheme proposed for potential reserve management committees and that clearly presents some difficulty for some time here this hall was built in 1896 on 6 acres of Crown land that was used to used to be the police date there has been transport related activity on this land in an intense seat horse-drawn coach and Royal Mail service operated to lit Littleton and to Charteris pay out of this location from 1882 until the 1920s that cottage business using multi one ton trucks used to operate until 1927 this area produced potatoes tomatoes carrots and fruit for the city market produce was also transported by Bullock and horse-drawn carts over Di 's past and the road was sealed in 1957 governor spade transport and Banks Peninsula transport with the last general cartridge operators and operated from this reserve transport yard for more than 50 years we submit that for volunteer reserve management committees to operate effectively they need really cash access on a day-to-day basis and we 're not point out how difficult it is to organize significant general works and repairs on an intermittent cash flows thank you thank you any questions so um I guess wondering does the the hall have any here status yes we should give them when it was built it is a place where returned service people have been recognized and received very old it 's an area settled out in Athens the land was bought in 1876 and the police station was built in 1877 and assist its operation in 1980 it 's a way forward for travelers to a Corral and the other bays there was a tenuous root to hilltop thank you guys me there any other questions sir I 'm just quickly and with the the work that 's been cleaned at the moment the funds the proposed can the community boards recommendations is that potentially they could take some of those funds and give them to another reserve management committee are you needing all of those funds in Thailand we would need all of those stunts for quite a few years and there is some resistance yeah from our part that it 's diluted thank you thank you yes Sood I just where 's he 's a mention quite a bit about the history but I would like to make the point that actually we see a tremendous future for this my not not just for Allendale Governors Bay Peninsula the city as well actually we we the crown of the pledge so if you look at reserves like the little river one this is not just a hole and an extra would encourage members of you if you going over that way have a look at the hall what 's happened this is a it 's a it 's a tremendous facility now but but it has a domain as well in sports and all those kind of things the two working together there 's a equine group that are trying to resurrect the equine area at the back we 'll link to them so the reserve and the foreshore walk and all around to the jetty now the jetty is in a partnership with the council and we could see the same here to work through these kinds of funds as well then this could it 's not just for our area it 's it 's 20 months from Christchurch and has the potential for you know in the past but we see into the future to be able to come over there use the hall use the domains for the salmon church or whoever car people of Cambria and so we have a very active and and quite energetic committee at the moment we just need some assistance to actually try and make this this work if the community board recommendation was not adopted by council today and the income from the reserve was not able to be applied to the reserve management committee and clearly the valuable work that the community is doing on that reserve through the reserve management committee what would the effect of that be what would happen on the ground as a result of that decision I was a number of things for one the there 's been considerable expenditure on the hall right now but the wider is here this enormous amount of work and we just quite don 't quite know how it 's gonna take place actually we you get constrained to the fact that you to the place that you can 't do a lot and so what potentially could be something great actually won 't be and the diseases as whole areas of drainage and all those kinds of things that the the field the home of a kind of cricket the diamond have a Rugby Club for years many years that was the training ground because many the plays came from the city and so was the halfway point you couldn 't play right before you couldn 't play cricket I couldn 't do anything on the horse people oh there 's a very strong delegation to just come to us in this last week I 've in quite people wanting to resurrect that whole thing in the back but it needs enormous amount of drainage and kind of them you know for round formation all that sort of stuff we probably won 't actually achieve them so as Stuart said which is its laid in a band since the earthquakes it 's fall into disrepair but we see the potential of what could be but it won 't happen unless we get the support practical immediate of things event would be it would be difficult to to keep people engaged in the management caddy because unless there is some personal feedback coming back about achieving things you won 't find volunteer people circumstances yeah it would be handed back to the city I 'm sure it 's low _"

    "text": "so you come back with a recommendation on initial scope consultation and what with the advice that we 've had based on some legal advice that we haven 't seen is that we have to go out and just and consult on the proposed various options for sites once that 's finished then we go out again with the proposed concept is that we 're putting into the facility or Lantana at the inner shops the initial concept comes back to Council for another board was given the delegated authority to consult and engage on the initial scope and the proposed sites advise not make a decision here and maybe the scope depends on the site well yeah it just it just seems contrary to how we do things like not Puna why where we just come up with one consultation document and given that we 've spent two years asking a lot of these questions to the community oh yeah but also some legal advice I think it 's important that you wait and receive them okay can we make sure that there is a process by which the consultation the community board go out for includes the basic scope and the site because it seems to me they 've done mass of consultation already that we 're prolonging a process where the community don 't want it prolonged so can we at least have that advice back through to the council so that if we need to make a decision so they can go out and do one consultation so you don 't get people King getting bored and restless by over consultation that we can do that I think that the the kind of frustration for for me and kind of observing what 's gone on in this particular instance is that in order to do the consultation on the site you need to have a really good understanding of the challenges that each of the sites might present and what the benefits of them are and until you know there it 'll end up you know we we if you 've got to know what you 're working with first before you design what you 've got but oddly agree except that they are in the a site that they will agree on and if it 's a predetermined position which is a rather risky thing you say if the community don 't agree on that then obviously they have to go back and restart but if the community do agree with it why couldn 't they well they 're talking to them at community groups and things actually talk to them about what type of call it involves as well because obviously there 's a budget that constrains what they 're able to do so it 's our here the concept the board was informed on Monday that the consultation process that we 're going out to do will be about the site and around that initial sort of what I think you said elements that need to form part of this hub so we 're not just going out on the site selection and the board has been informed of that the initial the first consultation was going out with in February will include the site and discuss that involves the concept that leads the way we 're just receiving the report at the consultation rounds because the first one at the moment works and the board head what the board is working with is bulk and location we haven 't gone to the community we 've gone to the community in the past and they 've told that these are the different elements that we would like to see within our community with now compare we 're now saying to the community where should a Linwood Wilson pool be placed and are these the right sort of things that you said you want to so basically Drive facilities with facilities for children and then after that we have to go for a second consultation and this is where staff looking at who makes the final decision whether it comes back to the council and is that the detailed design issue of Canada can the board sign off the concept design or that the concept and detailed design have to come back to the council so they 're going to be too long yeah well there were two rounds of a complication that carry two so I mean it 's you you have to site we did that for qe2 which is another community facility it had other money attached to it anyway um look we 're only receiving the report I 'm quite happy that that that we we have a look at the advicing as going back to the community board and and see whether we can shorten processes have possible so would someone like to move that the community board report be received Yanni Ciara put the motion works in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "good to be back in terms of the year ahead of us we have a significant although a small agenda today significant issues to deal with councillor Gough and I councilor golf good morning everyone this is the first but that we 've ever had since the rules were changed that allow a counselor to attend a council meeting by audio visual or audio alone and on this occasion it 's audio alone looking good Jamie but this is a reminder to everyone to use your microphones Jamie won 't be able to participate in the meeting fully if he can 't hear you so it 's really important that you switch on your microphones when you 're commenting the next item so he 's not an apology I 'm just simply saying that so do I have any apologies and I don 't because he has now regarded as part of the meeting declarations of interest there were no declarations of interest of buyers prior to the meeting and now we move on to public participation and the public forum and I 've been advised that flip-out christchurch Andrew good morning thank you very much for inviting me to come and talk to the to the council today I have a presentation which I 'm going to go through very very quickly it 's a two-part thing it 's to a background of what what flip-out actually is and then there 's an issue that I have with some flooding that I 'd like to to bring up with you as well isn 't Bromley it 's been open for about a year and a half now and it 's quite a bit of successful adventure for for the east side of Christchurch I 'll just look through some of these I know you have these already on on your iPad so you could you look there we have a mission and there 's our are the things that we want to have in the mission here 's the facility itself 1700 square metres facility it has a wide range of different surfaces that people can bounce on and we also have supporting things like cafes and on-site Wi-Fi we have 65 on-site carpark spots as well last year and we 're moving towards making this a venue for entertainment in a broader sense not just as a trampoline arena so we have live bands a play there break dancing circus performance that 's those stuff as well now this is quick view of the inside of the facility if you haven 't been there already I do recommend you can just even come and have a look it 's it 's it 's very visually impressive here 's some of the investments that we have put into the facility is about 1.3 million dollars in the fit-out now the the building itself was about seven million dollars of remediation after the earthquake we have about a two hundred fifty seven sixty five thousand dollar payroll per year it 's been a three-year project for me so far and we 're on an eight-year lease we involve a lot of community groups school groups and other groups and use this facility quite extensively we 're trying to expand what we 're doing to keep it interesting for everyone we have we have activities for all ages all abilities as oldest this boys just starting to learn to walk and we have quite a quite high end people as well in their special programs we do offer a lot of courses classes activities for again a wide range of people one of the next things that we 're going to incorporate into flip out is is technology it flipped out and that 's really bringing technology into the the environment so things like the Internet of Things will be put in to flip out to make it more stimulating for the people that are actually doing the physical activity we 're looking at some image capture technologies as well and some VR technologies as well so the next few years we have some good plans to bring that sort of technology into setup we are a good community citizen we do a lot of outreach programs with festivals that the City Council organizes we go out to schools bring air tracks and and coaches out to help kids learn some of these activities we do host club set flip out parkour clubs slackline clubs martial arts and breakdancing clubs all that I 'd like to bring up with you today and it 's to do with flooding on air on the rain events we do have it is particularly busy for us obviously not too many people want to go to the beach or the pool or other places and so generally flip-out becomes extremely busy during the rain events on a rainy day we can have up to about a thousand people come through the facility in one day and unfortunately right now we have surface flooding that happens last year we had eight days of surface flooding this is a surface landing that goes right way across the road it floods half of our property and and makes the the operation next to impossible to run half of our car park gets flooded which means those 65 car park spots are irrelevant because when we 're busy we need those car park spots and they 're flooded there 's no no street parking when it 's flooded there 's no cycle pedestrian or accessible access to the facility when it 's flooded we have had loss of property the in the flooded area and they 've been damaged I suppose it 's very dangerous and after that there 's a huge cleanup exercise that we have to do after the event happens all of our garden beds are all woodchips so of course when the flood happens all the widgets get lifted up and then get spread around the neighborhood this is a photograph of the actual event you can see in the in the center up there 's a cyclist who wants to come to flip out there 's no way that they can get there we have to move all the cars from our parking lot where they 're parked and when the people walk back from the cars of course it 's raining and they 're getting soaked and they 're not very very happy at all the impact on a business now we 're getting to the point where people are phoning us up when it 's raining saying is the is the road flooded if the roads flooded none I 'm coming and that 's totally unacceptable of course I 've talked a of flooding you can see in the in the first photograph there that 's the tide line where it 's coming up to our building we have a 60,000 foam pit that 's just on the other side of that door if the if the foam pit gets wet we 'll have to replace the foam in there and that 's a very big risk big concern for us of course if there is flooding inside we will have to close the business for that day do clean up and that 's a huge impact on our revenue of course so I 'd like to you know actually I think they actually was required is allocate some funds and resources to create this problem it 's been seven years where this problem has been existing in this in this area we have brought this up to Council last year there 's been no action they have the council has put pumps but the pumps have not been effective at all we 've had one day where they they pumped this water into the storm sewer I 'm sorry into the we 've got rid of the water after about an hour and a half all the other activities have not done any the water stays there for seven or eight hours obviously the kids safety is at stake and flip-out I think has met all those obligations as far as the resource consent being part of the community adding a lot to the community and we think we 've gone well beyond what we what we the requirements will we need we need to get infrastructure to run this business though it 's the bottom line and right now as you can see it 's it 's hindering us doing business in Bromley that 's all I have for today so I please if you have any questions please let me know sorry Jamie these are not the best ways to raise these issues with the council because you get five minutes and I 've allowed you obviously quite a lot over there simply because you wanted to state your case my proposal is that we refer this to the land drainage recovery program we can group which Paul in Committee I know that this piece of work is on the work program but I 'll ask them to respond to you to reach Lee if that 's okay with you it 's just a concern of mine because we need some action yeah and and appreciate you I mean it as a channel that 's available to you so thank you very much for coming thank you right the next item on the agenda is no I don 't need a resolution we can just make that happen and we 'll come back to Council formal and drainage go how do we get progress on this it 's been a journey Jonnie don 't do that the next person is lundi howard end of life choice Christchurch regarding the end of life choice vowel okay can you hear me because I speak quite quietly and okay so in the 70s and 80s I lived in Nelson and was a bit of an activist was involved in native flora section council so a lot of our native for us and now there because we had stalls and we ran a in New Zealand at the time okay so six years ago I moved down to Christchurch and now I found myself again in a bit of an activist role I 'm secretary of the end of life choice group in Christchurch as you you 'll know David Seymour 's bills just gone through the first reading in Parliament and is referred to justice as select committee with deadline for submissions on the 20th of February so we intend to run a few information stores between now and that date as part of a democratic process we know that 75% of people support this legislation in the polls but they don 't necessarily realize it 's important to put in submissions so unfortunately it seems virtually impossible to find anywhere in Christchurch where you can legally hold an interactive information store especially one that 's deemed political as we are so we 've farmers markets malls don 't seem to be available street stalls I think are not legal you do sometimes see charities but it 's very rare to ever see any sort of activist type of store return put inundated with information that they it 's impossible to guarantee that we can ever get anything in there you can 't just go into a library anymore and ask them to put up information it 's all centralized and has to be distributed and then if they don 't have the space they just don 't put it up so the council website invites applications for permits or consents for amusement devices mobile shops street performers hawkers and retail stores as well as a one-hour speaking slot and Cathedral Square and you do sometimes see information stalls of a political nature apps are rare rallies like the TPPA one or climate change but those ants this isn 't what we seek what I 'm asking is where are the outlets for interactive promotion of ideas ideals questioning around issues of social importance and encouragement of public debate there seems to be such a fear of upsetting people if they don 't agree with you but I would say clearly everyone has to be allowed to promote their own particular views and I recognize that means people that don 't agree 're not all into social media and I think it especially older generations by not having these outlets freedom of speech is limited and we depend increasingly on trying to force media interest in order to get coverage with the risk of bias of any non conformist ideas I 'm talking freedom of speech democracy versus PC and dislike of any messy controversy I do believe that it is the council 's obligation to facilitate or enable that process of allowing the unimpeded right to inform and be informed my recommendation is that there could be a few central spots made available around our city which would be suitable for stalls where the aim is to disseminate information around a campaign make a protest ideally they would be sites with consistent local foot traffic so not tourist centers I don 't actually believe the Cathedral Square is appropriate for this purpose and covered and with easy car access or parking for conveyance of tables and display material and one of my thoughts was possibly outside libraries thank you very much and this was my suggestion that you you come and the public you 've also highlighted the issue which does need debate and obviously there are questions and answers and I totally understand your point around engagement I mean you can get engagement across social media but as you say not that 's not for everyone so it 's an opportunity to actually have a conversation we see a lot of groups in different places in the city in terms of stalls and things like that there are options that are available and libraries are certainly do engage and some of these tough issues from time to time as well so what I 'm going to do is I 'm just going to ask the head of the chief executives office to to go with you and to talk through some of those options and and and then if there are still some gaps and things like that we can we can have another conversation about that but it 's great that you 've brought this to the council and and obviously that is something that we might get one of the the committees to look at as well but you 're not aware of and that will help get kickstart the process I did actually speak to a member of Casca because I happen to know him and he said they 'd had the same problem okay that 's great all right thank you very much no deputations by appointment no presentation of petitions so we 'll move to the council minutes the recess committee minutes in the Health and Safety Committee minutes that someone like to move that they be confirmed and received yep will be demoting Jamie Gough Jamie Gough seeking the black dawn your pardon Oh motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that it 's carried and if I could move item number 16 which is the resolution to include the supplementary reports in the meeting so I will move that seconded by Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then I 'll move on to items Asian 9 so item 8 is the district licensing committee update of committee requirements would someone like to move that David all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and the next item is the appointment of a hearings panel for the Summit Road proposed prohibition at times on Road restrictions and I won 't have counselors who are proposed to be part of the hearings panel to move this one so Phil Clearwater seconded by Pauline cutter I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we 'll move on to the below-ground wellheads and drinking water supply status update a little bit ahead of schedule but Bess that 's good right so all right yeah we were due to start this item and Anna five minutes so look what I 'll do is I 'll just adjourn the during the meeting for five minutes people want to grab themselves a cup of coffee and bring it back then that 's fine but we 'll we 'll start on the dot of ten ten o 'clock thank you you heeds and drinking water supply status update report and I 'd like to hand over of the situation that we find ourselves on yeah well thank you it 'll come as no surprise to you the events of Havelock North in August 2016 and in response to that the whole industry has been looking very very closely at the security of their water supplies across the country so there was an inquiry established and they had two reports Stage one report from the have lockable supplier it came out in May 2017 and we were very interested in those results and that left levels from criticism but a lot of parties involved in the the security of them and the health of drinking water the stage from the stage one report we then took a very very close look at the regime of looking at these world heads looking at our water security our compliance with the drinking water standards with with quite some rigor and we call one of our technical people made the inquiries of our contractors to say look what 's the regime we want to make sure that we are still fully compliant with all of the stuff that was under North they hadn 't addressed the rest of the country the implications for the rest of the country which was coming in stage two the contractors came back said well yeah well when we look at them and the light of what we 've seen in the stage one report there are some things that we could be doing to improve them so we got them to do an assessment of all the wells around the city they routinely go and inspect and maintain and check the pumps and check everything 's working again this is just a routine operational thing that they 've been doing for probably over a deep more but we were looking at it through a new lease and they came back with a whole bunch of recommendations that not some of those cable entry ducts I was tied to say through the beans a couple of cracks in their concrete there 's water getting onto the floor of some of these things so we said like guys not good enough you need to be putting on a program to to improve all of those those with a proposal to do a whole range of work on 103 bore heads and and we put that in play and we had some costumes at that point about 800,000 200k in the current year with the other 600 and the following year and that that program started in July August last year and we 've been monitoring progress and see care of me giving me weekly update reports because that 's how seriously I was taking this position fast-forward to this December the 6th when the stage 2 report came out and there was some 51 recommendations in that stage to report and amongst the key ones for us was that they said they were recommending that we should have no longer have reliance on secure status of well heads to meet the drinking water compliance they strong recommendations for mandatory water treatment and chlorination but none of those have been accepted by the the real focus as the Ministry of Health yes what that lead and then one of those recommendations was that the the director-general of health used the Paras under the existing legislation to give director-general of health then sent a statement on the 20th of December bringing that to the attention of world water suppliers that they should not rely on secure well status they should consider a treatment until any recommendations had been now agreed by the government we were considering that and we were preparing a paper for Council after leave after that event in the meantime technical staff have been going through their normal program of of doing the independent engineering assessment of well hits to commute confirm compliance with the drinking water standards so the consulting engineers in the light of these reports that were very critical on on one of their peers a consulting firm they are taking much more rigor in their assessment of the well heads and they were reluctant just to sign off on the well heads so this was on the round the 15 16th of December the draft report that I 've not even I had seen at that stage but there was having discussions with the drinking water Assessor about what that meant I arranged to meet with the medical officer of health 22nd of December and it was at that meeting AB Alice doors on leave Rahman pink was the the medical officer of health at the time we said look there is the consequence of the Director General 's letter and the the reluctance of the professional engineers to sign off on them on the wells meant that that could imply that we no longer meet the secure status which was one of the three criteria for meeting the drinking water standards and that 's when we put the paper to council I wrote a paper finishes of that day and and sent it off to my general manager copied and the the legal people CEO and suggested that this is needs to be addressed with that time you know we were going into into the Christmas period I was planning to work through anyway because there 's still a lot of work to do at the same time we were reviewing our water safety plan and the water safety plan is a critical piece of group a critical document because the water safety plan is what gives assurance to the water standards and that 's the means of which compliances is agreed and so we during the break we reviewed the water safety plan I reviewed the business continuity plan that we 've got things up and running I was getting weekly reports from City care who gave me progress reports every Friday afternoon and to date they 've completed seven of the whole program those seven of course are the most critical ones that we have in the city and they 're now completed I 'll hand over so that 's just a quick background or where we are and I 'll hand over to you can I just because just to emphasize just that period of time when you had asked City care to undertake a review of the wellhead status you were in conversation with the medical officer of Health and the drinking water Assessor right throughout that period so that 's July August that 's correct so one of the first initiatives such a serious issue we engaged with the medical officer of health and the drinking water Assessor in fact we did a site visit and also the drinking water reference group which is the group that we set up in response to have like North which is all of the five local councils the CDHP II can and we share our knowledge and share experiences and share information so that was one of the one of the things that was highlighted in the Havelock North report that 's not an issue for Canterbury so the obligations under the drinking water standards the three that we 've highlighted in the report there in terms of relying on secure for head bore water status that that is an ongoing obligation it 's not something that you have to comply with once a year and take boxes it is a total 365 days a year obligation and if there are transgressions you have to report them and if there are breaches to the to the bore heads has picked up by an ongoing assessment then they have to be reported that 's correct so we every year we do we do a.m. a report to the the drinking water Assessor on the drinking water standards to the July and was reviewed and we got the feedback and an August saying that everything was hunky-dory at that point we still had secure status and in fact and there were complimentary of the response responsibly taken to date on the on the on the drinking water enquiry so and and that that statement about the response to the drinking water inquiry that was actually repeated and the later of the 22nd of December last year is that that 's true so we 've had a good strong working relationship all the way through it 's important to note that the quality of the drinking water has not changed and so it 's still as as good as it ever was and we manage that risk we test that we do more testing bacteriological testing then then we need to under the drinking water standards at the time to give ourselves that assurance because I 'm well aware as I reported in September 2016 that we have this residual risk in Christchurch where we do not treat the water and that 's the risk between the time we take a 24 hours later there is that 24 hour gap where if there was a contamination event I wouldn 't know about it no that 's my biggest concern and that 's why we actually have a very rigorous regime of water testing but in august when you 're talking to the drinking water Assessor the program of action that you 've decided to take through City care is sufficient to meet the ongoing obligation and criterion 2 that 's great so that wasn 't agreed but that changed and December 2017 okay thank you tonight hand to you to the medical office of Health Alistair Humphrey to get the the public health background on this ok good morning everybody thanks for giving the opportunity to speak to you today and the first thing I want to say is that we in Christchurch were very proud of our water we love our water we know the difference between our water and everyone else 's in the world because we occasionally the opportunity to compare them but from my perspective as a public health physician I am also satisfied and have been here that Christchurch City Council as a supplier goes above and beyond what it needs to do to keep our water safe not withstanding that most of the time it doesn 't treat the water Christchurch City Council has always been responsible about keeping the community safe from problems with its group water following the earthquake very promptly the council took the decision to chlorinate the water it was a temporary measure it was vital that it was done and they did it the Christchurch community also participated in keeping themselves safe at that point we remarkably had no gastro outbreaks following the earthquake that is very unusual so you as the council and the council staff have been mindful of the safety of the water for as long as I can remember and the first thing I will say about this is our routine responses as a community are what we are dealing with here we are not responding to the Havelock North inquiry that is very important to understand we have in place a safe regime that has been there for a very long time we comply with that and Christchurch has complied with the drinking water standards throughout it is a routine process that the boar head security is is assessed and that 's laid out in the paper you 've got the boar heads are assessed and a rolling programme once every five years fifth every year and that is what has determined the chair here feel the independently commissioned engineers have come back and said that though they gave provisional status for a number of years they could no longer give that provisional status and that was their decision as soon as they had made that decision we were in a situation where we were being told in effect that there was no barriers to contamination for her drinking water and as a community and as a supplier the council have to respond to that it 's commendable that the council in fact had already responded even before they got that and that 's that the work that John Mackay has already spoken about there already was in place a program to seal in those Bor heads and also as it happens to deal with we had had significant transgressions in the past so we have a water supply where there have been no transgressions as far as I 'm aware except a few in the reservoirs where there were cracks part of the program was to deal with that as well so the point here is that the staff at the City Council the council as a supplier have been ahead of the game all the time they were still ahead of the game but the engineers told us in December that we no longer had secured status secure status just to remind you is dependent on three things one there should be no transgressions there have been no transgressions to the water should be aged appropriately so old water is safe water and a model was used to calculate the age of Christchurch 's water and it is indeed old water therefore safe the third criterion was where we failed and as John has outlined to you there were pretend leaks in the system at the well heads those have to be dealt with to make the water safe so following that report that process if we can the program that 's already being put in place but in order to meet your obligations under the drinking water standards it is important that there is another barrier to to contamination for the community of Christchurch we have more than 300,000 people effectively now relying on a water supply it with no barriers and I always have considered the rigor with which Christchurch monitors the water and invests in its reticulation system to be a barrier in itself the secure status of the drink of the groundwater is also another barrier as far as I 'm concerned as a professional that is a multi barrier approach some people will say you should always chlorinate I think Christchurch is a special case we don 't need to always chlorinate we have a special set of circumstances at the moment which means in order to commit keep our community safe as the City Council has always chosen to do in the past we need to chlorinate the water so I support your chief engineer 's recommendations don 't make his recommendations that the water should be sign-off secure status for our groundwater and then we can go back to enjoying the water that we 've enjoyed for many decades ok thank you ok questions Erin and you think that explanation from from both of you it is very very clear the question that came to me through members of the public and I do agree with them is if there there is a if there 's a potential risk to our water and our water supply because this chlorination process will take time to implement it 's not a switch little we flipped on today no doubt that why if there is a danger or a risk why is it warm or to notice not issued straight away a boil no to what boil water notice is not required there is no imminent risk to the community we have not had transgressions if we had transgressions that would be different we would definitely be issuing a boil water notice but there is no imminent risk this is about dealing with the long term risk and making sure that supply in the long term is a safe not necessary in the interim period what is important is that the council gets on with the work expeditiously but as our council knows well disasters don 't tend to stick to timelines so if we got an outbreak it could be today or tomorrow or in three months time once we 've got the chlorination process and in place so that 's what I think some people are struggling with including myself yeah as I say it 's we 're dealing with an imminent risk there the probability is extremely low the consequences may be high but in the meantime we have a system set up that has I 've been identified there the engineer as a shortcoming in one area it hasn 't changed anything that has been the same for a while they have come back to us and said these are issues you have to deal with in my view there is not an imminent risk to the population we have not seen for decades you know our water has been safe there 's no change in that but this is a process to keep our long term it 's not about once those well heads are sealed in we will be back to a safe situation but chlorinating over a period of months is a way of dealing with that risk over a period of months there 's not a kind of day-to-day risk here that requires a boil water notice hmm yeah knee yeah I just wanted to check on the process um you just want questions to the medical officer of health or are you nice its staff okay so number let 's put three questions as well as stuff going to address those questions that we 've put in like last night when we got the report what 's the process around that process of addressing those right so should I ask those questions now again or yeah I can 't just yep okay I 've got you Pauline Phil serie Dion um thank you but they have to be relevant to the paper that it is relevant so in regards to the issue of consultation with Tonetta Fennell and the cultural perspective around putting chlorine into our water what view or have an obligation engage with MALDI over this decision if I could I had talked to Gabriel our advisor yesterday and of course it 's similar to the bit of Gloucester health their first priority is for the health of their people and so they fully support if we if there 's through the opinion of them the health authorities that we have to chlorinate the water and then then then it must be but they 're obviously they 're not the same view to restore it to its previous condition to Leicester the early advice we have on that the second question was I was just trying to understand obviously nothing 's changed in terms of from last year to this well the previous year and the year before that in terms of the the ball hits but they were signed off one year they 're not signed off the next year so just trying to understand with the earthquake we must have had a program to assess the different wellheads what did that show and had any of the well heads being picked up through the five year a program to get fixed or where they 've still been signed offers okay system contractors we found I mean did the repairs over a period of time it 's all finished so that issues were dealing with their own earthquake issues what 's changed as the standard that the engineers expect when they 're doing the wellhead security assessments so the standards changed because I 've had the heavy lock findings which haven 't come in to to law yet no no I don 't think that the standard has changed is that the right word or is it is it that the amnesia of assessment of compliance changed and it 's actually much more sensitive and rigorous perhaps in relation to their obligations to sign off on secure status isn 't it pretty clear from the report that I mean if surface water can get in then that 's not acceptable so how can we have one year have that being identified as a possibility and next year it 's it 's in that yet signed off and next year it 's still the same but it 's measure of something secure the risk aversion of professional companies that have to rely when they when you read the criticism of those of the engineering company that assess they have lock North Wales and none of them want to put that risk onto their professional indemnity insurance but to turn Yanni 's question around it may well be that the quality of the assessment that was done in previous years was not of a high enough standard for the protection that we require for our water supply yeah what was deemed acceptable no what was but it 's not what was deemed acceptable to them they may not have met a sufficient standard to provide real protection to our water supply in relation to the obligations under the drinking water standards so I 'm not letting the previous engineers off the hook by a gloves that the standard has changed just because of the Havelock North enquiry I don 't_''_4027.84 I don 't think that 's that 's right you can make that assessment now I think we do have to look at the quality of the work that what the cause was it 's exactly so the the line and the report and the three point one in the city care water report section four point five point three two ball water security criterion to the boy it must be sealed at the surface to prevent the egress of surface water so it 's pretty black and white it 's not sort of and I would have what I can 't understand is if we 've had all the assessment post-earthquake and all these independent engineers looking at these things signing them off when we 've got water egress how has that been allowed to happen that is the question of all these companies that are doing these regulatory inspections are now we 're off and that 's why we 're seeing a lot more rigor in their assessments and that 's quite right they 're the standard to which they were applying to their assessments of the security the world heads may not have been what was not up to scratch obviously so is there a sort of independent inquiry I mean can we have a recommendation inquiry so that one can we deal with that separately we 're asking for measures to go back to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee and I would like them to consider the update and the monthly progress report and if they feel that it is appropriate to review that which is something I favor myself but it is something that I would rather deal with separately from this and if you want to add some wording to number four then I 'm quite happy that review the the process for reporting on it but to have the draft water safety plan now before the infrastructure transport an Environment Committee for approval when completed adds the layer of governance which I think has been messing I do think it needs to come in front of the full council and also I had another question in regards to audit and risk and I know we 've got a P exception on the agenda today would you prefer that I ask those questions in the public or in the px section question so no item on the agenda for orders and rest our agenda around the legal advice in relation to this report do you want questions around px audit and risk reports previously that identified water quality now or do you want that in the PX section yeah because I have no idea what you want to ask it 's really hard to give you guidance but what I really want to understand is given that we 've got an order and risk in money and given that this would have been one of the huge risks identified as in terms of a variety of mechanisms you know contract management performance monitoring assessment of infrastructure and drinking water quality I just simply want to understand what process we have in place to make sure that you know the operational aspects of what counts is doing here are aligned or aligned with the audit and risk program because when I read through that there 's a there is a misalignment well yeah there will be a followup with audit and risk absolutely but I 'm quite happy to work on some wording around around us and in and given that we 're being and noting provision and just ask staff to report to the infrastructure and we 'll find it some wording around a review of the past inspection regime and we will and will have that report back to the council of that 's all right Pauline yeah cool so who was next Pauline so that was one of the 51 recommendations from the inquiry back to government and so that 's an anticipation of what the crown might do we have no idea what the what the government might do with that recommendation but in the meantime he was asked to use the existing regulatory powers and bring those to the attention I 'm thinking for suppliers there could be more to come depending on what the crown decides to do what the recommendation is for Aquarius but I would also draw your attention to another item in our report which is a matter that we left on the meta that we left on the table lying on the table which was a recommendation from one of the committees saying that that we oppose the the permanent you know direction maybe we need to find some words that that incorporate our desire to see this as a mechanism by which we can and yet but but ensure that that remains the position with central government as well Alastor can I just make a comment on that statement to inform the director-general Christchurch has never relied just on on secure status there 's a lot of investment that accounts all in them with the mandate from the community has put into an effective additional barrier we go above and beyond all the monitoring requirements and backflow monitors maintenance of the reticulation system that can affect some may say is is a better barrier than treatment because actually it prevents all sorts of different infections or contamination of the water not just bacterial and viral so it 's important to look at that in the right kind of context and it 's still important to remember that this is not about what the director-general says this is not about the head lock employer this is about our routine processes we have always been safe and we have always in effect heard a disinfection in our water yeah but I think that the point that councillors are you know sort of grateful in with at the moment is that clearly what has happened in terms of that secure status has been influenced by both of those factors right I 've got Phil Cera Dion and so my question really is in relation to the complexity of all of this and like we have a recommendation in relation to informing the community around these decisions and that we would do that and connection in conjunction with the medical officer of Health and informing the community but I 'm just wondering given how complex this is should we as accounts or not also be considering how in fact we go wider around the drinking water as one part of Christchurch 's water issues and is the Pretz potential that the government central government might also work with us so in fact people understand what actually is happening especially in connection to what drinking water safety so what what I would like to see is a in fact maybe as a council we should go wider should have a whole education program so that there 's better understanding I have been following social media and some of the comments have been quite interesting and and would indicate a lack of knowledge about some things including the fact that there is no treatment applied to water that 's bottled because of course there is but it 's UV treatment and but that we 're not talking about a permanent solution here we 're talking about a temporary solution and I think in a longer term if we 're looking at getting back to well and in the short term getting back to or the medium term getting back to secure status then we will be relying on the multi-barrier approach that we 've always had as a city so but I think it would be useful and I agree with you I think that we need a very wide media campaign and listening to the the the public participation that we had just before we cannot just rely on social media so we 're going to have to I think buy some advertising with very clear messages that the risk is no greater than it was the risk has not changed the risk is slight the risk is smelly but the consequences of anything going wrong are huge and that 's the difference and that 's what risk is it 's it 's it 's probability and consequences when you 've got low probability and high consequences you tend to think around the probability shall we take the risk we did that when we considered the shallow boards in the northwest are we prepared to take that risk for the whole city that 's the question it just in further than that in anticipation of the release of the stage to report we did work with our communications people and started preparing a communications plan ahead of the report landing and in that the result the whole range of community education advice even an advertising schedule for whatever the outcome might have been so that there is that work has already been done thank you um in Thank You Laster your approach has been incredibly helpful and clear throughout this I 'm just wondering if you 've an extra barrier so the the actual management of the system itself and I 'm wondering if mitigation might have an option that doesn 't chlorination that would satisfy you through management so it 's very clear that the the likelihoods lemaise ERDAS comes when there 's rain events and it 's potential surface water egress into the well heads if we were able to have a management system which had contractors of staff on site during rain events checking for water if there was any sign of water entering any of the wild heads that that particular wellhead was switched off until it could be cleaned would that satisfy you as to the safety of our water supply without having to go through the full preemptive chlorination of our entire city supply the question it really is seems to me to be rather a technical one but the first point I 'd make is that there are 103 wells dotted through the city so it 's quite a lot of wells we 're talking about secondly it 's very important to understand that although flooding is has been presented other contaminants might get in we cannot predict every eventualities that 's the point if if we could we would deal with it on a kind of you know we could we see exactly what was going to happen the point about the drinking water standards is they 're set up to protect from all eventualities if you like it 's an all-hazards approach so I don 't think it would be reliable to say okay we think maybe flooding is a risk deed it could be what what about other risks what about leakages from sewage pipes that are unpredictable so I don 't think we 're in a situation where we can just kind of guess what that hazard is going to be and try and respond to that we have to have something that is going to fix the water keep it safe for the period of a time until we know that the the system is sealed properly now I think some people have raised the issue of well maybe UV treatment is an option but actually from a financial perspective that is so expensive that what is in effect a short period of time so chlorination is technically in my view is the only technical approach but John Mackay may have comments on whether there are alternatives but as far as I can see it 's energy else is quite right and of course with flood events to have people standing at foreheads when most people are deployed looking at flooding homes or flooding streets and that the type of resource we 're talking about there as as as huge and UV not not practicable for a temporary solution a high investment high capital it needs building meets land meets and mechanical equipment so not able to be deployed quickly either so that would take a longer time and much higher cost thank you and it 's good to hear because I think beach I mean some of our communications would see that we 're looking at all options and and non-chemical ones haven 't_''_4939.05 been presented that 's case there 's been some commentary social media and and in the general media about the delays and I 'm just wondering if since we 've have been with the UL sort of preferred us to yet being foreign 18 prior to now so but while we had the the council right staff have the delegation should they choose to use it to actually proactively chlorinator our city supply and while there hasn 't been an imminent risk you 're asking us to do it now would you have preferred us to do it earlier as an organization the work was already started between senior staff from health and city city council as soon as they got the information on the 22nd I suppose in the best of all possible worlds what we 're saying is things should happen as promptly as possible I think it would still have required the council to come to a decision anyway but I said my answer is yes as soon as possible but if the question then is has there been an unnecessarily large risk presented to our community because of that delay the answer is no because nothing has changed as we 've said it 's the rigor of the application of the the standards by the engineering get on with this let 's get it done as soon as possible so that we can lift chlorination as soon as possible so one of the concerns I have is with our engagement with the community so it 's been a decision taken that there should be a council decision rather than a staff one and that presumably is for for elected members representatives of the community to be able to take other things into account then maybe the technical detail that staff would use and I 'm just wondering given that you don 't have any great concerns about the delay so far whether you 'll be concerned about a further delay should we choose to consult with the community over this it seems that we have a local government once it gets to a council space we have obligations under the Local Government Act and with issues of high significance which this is clearly to consult with our communities and being that there is no great urgency and there is no imminent for us whether we should be consulting with the community over this whether you consult to deliver a safe water supply you now know that the engineers have told you that it is not completely safe you can 't_''_5118.57 unknown that you have to in my view react promptly and therefore I think it 's it 's good that the council are considering this it 's good that they 're taking a decision but I think they need to take a decision promptly with the best technical information that they have received from from health and from their engineers I don 't think it is appropriate this this is not in my view because that conditions arise under the Health Act it is not in my view a an issue that should have delay built into it by a consultation process I strongly agree that the public need to be clearly informed about your reasons for this and my view certainly over the last few days is that we have a community who understand these things there are some misunderstandings as the mayor has said but by and large the questions I 've received from the community and I have received a few have been people understand the risks and they also understand that the processes that are being put in place to keep their water safe in the past and so they should because it 's money that 's going into it so I don 't think it requires a consultation I think it requires information and I think it requires a prompt response Thanks um was this the first year we 've used this engineering company the first time we 've used this company for wellhead security assessments and why did we change because we 've now got a panel of consultants that we use for three waters work and the previous consultant wasn 't on that panel and so there was a panel member who had suitable experts so we chose to use procured panel now that that 's that 's called the question I have around the the well heads is how is there any idea of how many well hits we have that are at risk under the current circumstances that we 're facing you know that that 's covered on the report there are 103 all at varying degrees written on the the most severe first but the total total is hundred three so as we get through the the program of work the natural pace of those repair should pick up because there isn 't so much work involved yeah so what I 'm thinking is is do you think there would be a time where we go through the most critical ones to start with and then we can go back to the the drinking water Assessor and say we have done this amount we 've done those critical ones do you think and then go back to the engineers and say this is the work program we 've done on these critical ones do you think we 've got enough of those critical ones done to actually then be able to sign off on the drinking water standards is secure then we can go back to the drinking water assessor and say that 's the engineers are signed off on those certain ones that we 're at most at risk and then we can get back you know satisfy those conditions to unclear about if we looking at so we will progressively get that that statutory assessment done as we complete the program rather than waiting to lead and if it is able to be done on a zone by zone basis we will certainly endeavor to do that so Adnan and but that will really depend on that agreement and alignment with the drinking water Assessor who has to sign off on that on the safety plan but the engineers have to sign off on these are insecure slavers and so obviously there may be some that are worse off than others and we 've seen that graph in the report but do you do you have any indication of where we may get to in that point where the engineers may be able say okay we 're happy and satisfied that the worst ones are done the ones that are still yet to be done under the work program okay under the current you know as drinking water standards and that they will be happy to sign off the entire swath of the work program that 's been done in the entire city so out the water if we 've gone yet not right I 'd be speculative don 't want to speak for the drinking water assessment we would have to make that cool and we 've said December this year but we will be using best efforts to bring that forward by utilizing multiple crews where we don 't need the specialist lining contractor where you get another other crews to count go and do the other minor repairs and then progressively get the the sign-off by the independent engineers and hopefully get to a point of agreement with the drinking water assessor where there are satisfaction that there are sufficient controls in place it 's sufficient security or look up above the below ground well heads in order to give us back that status and look at the explanation but I can 't speak before the drinking waters it was believed okay and the other question that 's related around this was this a lot of them were a number of the number of the well heads are leaning on towards what councillor Templeton was saying was around flooding now if other ones that have got lower risk could we then get to a point in the city where we could turn off full-time chlorination but then part thought what if there was a flooding event that would maybe sort of looking at some of the other well heads actually just turn it on and times until we got to the internet it 's not just flooding that cause contamination it could be just high groundwater levels which you wouldn 't even see so you could have faux high groundwater get close when it don 't know host so it 's it 's not something you can easily predict I think I made the point that there 's a there 's an array of predictable problems which we are aware of there 's also the unpredictable problems it 's an All Hazards approach not let 's pick try and pick off those that we think causes problems the other one that these there was a lot of questions that I 've been getting from people or around and these two these two parts to this one is is the safety of infrastructure perspective there 's you know is there anything that we can say to actually allow those fears to people or is there actually some real risk that there is opposed if we do go down chlorination there is no health risk from chlorination quite the opposite the whole point of chlorination is to reduce health risk chlorination has been used for more than 100 years worldwide chlorination takes place in most cities in New Zealand as we speak and has done for quite some time Christchurch is an unusual exception there are there is a theoretical risk which some people might be aware of of what they call disinfection by-products where chlorine has been shown in some very old papers to have reacted with the biomass in pipes and those byproducts can have a have a health effect however those papers are old and the more recent papers have suggested that it is not chlorine in fact that is the risk there but it 's bromine part byproducts which we obviously are not putting into the system in any case disinfection by-products are one of the many substances that therefore they are kept at a very very safe level anyway and we are alerted to them if they were to go up moreover John Mackey has proposed air scouring of the pipes in order that the biomass is reduced another way of absolutely minimizing those disinfection by-products so the answer is no there is not a health risk from chlorine and I suppose given that people are reading the newspapers today and of heard that chlorine has been used in Syria they might have difficulty understanding the difference between using chlorine as a chemical weapon using chlorine for the benefit of people obviously chlorine as it is used in drinking what it is kept to a very very low level that just removes microbial contamination and the skill of the of the engineers is ensuring that they put in as little as they need to to just ensure that there 's enough chlorine in there to do the job that it 's required to do and it doesn 't have at those levels it comes nowhere near causing any health effects I 've got one more of this it changing tune a little bit more on the finances and point six point seven and it says additional and this is to John an additional budget may be required for further improvements to the wellhead recommendation sorry the wellheads recommended and the latest wellhead security assessments can you just explain a little bit more just what that means and how much potentially more we might be liable for if we go down this program to get up to the drinking water standards as mentioned in there yes so that 's the gap I think we talked about before between what the independent engineers assessed and needed done as against the eight hundred and forty thousand dollars in the program that city care had suggested so we haven 't got the final Phyllis what that gap is so there 's still some discussion to be had with the drinking water Assessor the the assessment engineers and our contractors as to what we agree would was the extra would need to be done over and above the eight hundred and forty I don 't expect I don 't anticipate that 's going number just yet but we 're certainly in and so we will let budget specifically come well and this challenge we 've been tasked to to find this within existing maintenance of maintenance budget so it may mean that other things of lesser importance would be deferred okay I mean and that comes back to my initial point was where do we get to to the point where we may actually end up saying were actually we 've got enough of this done so we can actually turn the chlorination off but obviously that will come later in a group all the way through the recommendations we 're making it crystal clear that this is for a temporary period that we want staff to be working hand in glove with the drinking water assessor to see if we can switch any of it back on without the chlorine if we can and so so we 're going through zone by zone that 's very challenging because as you can see from the maps the nature of the zones are you know there 's one large zone and some very small 're challenged staff to do that at the same time that we 've challenged them to find the budget from within their existing provisions and does it appropriate for it to go to a tea or Azam 's significance to come straight to Council no no it 'll go through a tea but all come through it 'll come back to Council with a recommendation just thinking because of the exceed the importance of this and the end of time frame that we 're talking about there 's a there 's always a delay between it going to a committee and in stress we can always bring it forward there are three council meetings a month yeah um so and Ava Tim very clear and reassuring summary of the situation a question for you it 's my understanding that you you make the decision to live the chlorination what do you need to be certified to do that what what is what is what do you need to know and how will you know that it 's time to lift the chlorination order secure bohr status is what we will independent engineering assessment and a second question from John and staff I think a lot of people are worried that this is we 're heading down a slippery slope of permanent chlorination and can you give us reassurances that there is not a bit going to get them and how he 'll we know that it 's not going to even that 's not my shirts I can give unfortunately that because the other thing that 's in play here is what the government does with the 51 recommendations from the inquiry the inquiry recommends to government that we mandate adequate treatment across all New Zealand and that we and we while we might fail to engage in that debate by saying because the special case or a special exemption that would be the path I think I 'm hearing is the way that Christchurch might want to go by little powere well one ta well if so but we don 't know what those what the government 's response to those recommendations will be yet so that 's sir there 's the 64,000 question I suppose will they have it 's they wouldn 't require legislation necessarily sorry might come under regulations rather than a change in statute and I don 't know you know depends on I think it would be most unfortunate if the government didn 't allow for public engagement and that conversation but I 've heard them talking about transparency so maybe that would be included right David 's tomb and Erin thank you 103 wells that need to be remedied and obviously it 's our objective to do that as quickly as possible the seven that have been remedied today what was the process to select those seven and do they reflect well it 's that we 're a greater risk or where we going and going forward with the repair program are you identifying well his that proposed a a potential greater threat to do those first yes there that there was a an assessment done on on the criticality of the well here 's that were selected first the ones and the main pumps which are in Beckenham they were subject some of that severe flooding we had in July so quite risk and of course the the the schedule was prepared in consultation with them our own technical people in the drinking water assessor and the contractor start that done in the order of the most important though the remaining ninety six that we have to to deal with there any that of severity that we have already done well have we dealt with the absolute worst or really or how many more at that high-end of exposure to risk would we have to deal with yeah that 's difficult to know the detail we 'll just name them in here um they what they might entail would have to would I could come back to the ET and say well this is the amount of work and the rest say I think in the one of the reports from City care there is a a a costing with against each of the well hits and you detect by inference that the greater the cost the more work that needs to be done so that 's on page sorry it 's my plate Tim Erin Sarah thank you um John this to have too much time first Christians within late January now it 's going to take 60 days to implement the chlorine if we go that way so we 're looking at expediate to the program somewhere hopefully and October but it may be December but it could be longer but so we 're looking around 79 months hopefully that we would have to chlorinate taking in the sixty days to sit up at cetera what 's regards to that could and I know Alistair you mentioned that we can 't really rely on it being a flood event that would be the contamination that could be a blown sewer or something along those lines but if we were to sit up at the chlorination would it be possible to sit that up to implement it because I 'm not an engineer I don 't know how you do that to implement in the event of something coming towards us as and if we got a few days or a week of a storm of ink coming could we do that rather than implement it straight away within the sick to see are we able to cut down the time that we think we chlorinate if we go their way it would it would make a lot of sense to try and roll this out within within within the two months we talked about after in discussions with City care at their response after the earthquakes there 's six to eight weeks to deploy the chlorination and and I expect that would be the the best way and we started all that once would quite far away be the best way of deploying the chlorine which gives during that 60 days you could do quite a bit of mains cleaning as well to reduce the impact so Sorel and staggering up our suggests that we do a mains cleaning program in parallel with establishment of of these 56 period and locations that require skid mount of chlorination equipment located each one of those sites so with the chlorine do you sit it all up and then dinner it starts took too much Sun or do could I guess my question is could you set it up to be able to an event to the troubles don 't know when that event might be so ground water intrusion for its for example there 'd be no weather event associated with that perhaps so well and I don 't know that that would meet the requirements but what securing the board heads would that save from a contamination from a serve leak the wood I can 't through through that Nicolas okay okay thanks now the second question is with and I don 't_''_6355.98 I wouldn 't want to wait council staff down on a report or a review of where we 've been and here we 've got here until it 's the concentration should be on expediate in what we 're doing and looking at it later on but uh I think to get following all this to have a review or a post event report on how we 've got them what 's happened would be really important but the count support counseling I 've got a recommendation that through that as he committee it so it comes back to Council through is he that they look at a below ground well he has undertaken prior to June 2017 and since because I think what we need to understand is counselors and that 's why don 't I don 't just by that it 's the standards have changed what were the previous standards good enough and was and was the not not the results of the inquiry but the events of August 2016 were they sufficient to be the wake-up call that actually the country needed I totally understand and I totally respect that guy the chair of the committee coming back and reporting to full council but this is of such significance to the city I 'm not a member of the Audit Committee I 'm not I mean no I can 't yeah what I think that it should that the review should come to full council well but it should become why do I get council staff to do two things when they can just come back to full council because they can come back through at eat I mean as he might pick up some of the some of the issues that they want so I mean it is important to have the specialist committee that actually has the that the detailed knowledge and has the ongoing oversight responsibilities for this program of work so I mean it 's not unusual for it to go through a committee first but the full report will come to council I totally realize that and understand that I think that 's of such significance that you know this but but please do go and in every counselor can go to individual committee meetings and I would encourage that perhaps when you get to that one pauline it might be worthwhile holding it as a separate meeting and as a specific item of the agenda the issues that have been considered here so I guess in that case will non-members of the Audit Committee get a chance to speak and be part that discussion because I think we do that by invite Bob cheer and I totally respect it as well but I again I 'm saying that this is such a significant issue yeah no but it 's a it 's a it 's a question I speaking people have the right to speak but not to vote that 's the only difference generally speaking oh yeah it 's such a significant issue I think I understand this completely the conference is about to wind jammie jammie-jammie the conference is about to end well you can talk telecom though no Jamie Oh your rings right there you don 't bacon think you yeah okay pick them okay I don 't know have you emailed the resolutions to Jamie yeah I think we 're still working on another recommendation to go right so the end there now right okay so we 've got I just think we should continue and get this done rather than break for morning tea do we have a legal requirement to break for a particular after okay okay all right I 'm Erin I 'll go to you yeah I just have a couple of follow-ons but we I may have to depart the room because I 've been consuming lots of water it 's not chlorinated you I 'm in a preload just in case that didn 't have a decision my a different color now my two questions that have to isn 't through the question processes you mentioned weakened in before which posed one of the greatest risks this one 's been especially around that flooding we met flooding have been happened the last one not just the one but and was that then tested and were there any transgressions when we had the flooding event at that well he had given it was one of the worst there 'll be no transgressions at all right and that was just confirming one of the worst and head floating all around yeah cool that 's a good start and then the other one is what assurances can we give the public that wants the schedule of works the accelerated schedule works it 's completed and these are been finished to the standard that you 're expecting what insurances can we give the public that the engineers and then the water assess of wolf sign off and say they are secure we are happy there will be no chlorine so the engineers have confirmed and writing that once we have implemented their that 's good and then the other one is the water Assessor himself so we were as long as we had round water is secure they there then that the supply would be compliant with the drinking water standards so that would be signed off as well immediately Sarah then Mike thank you I 'm just wondering if farming this China we 've had concerns over the previous monitoring but the other thing many comments by members of the public who want reassurance that the the governance response has been appropriate and I 'm just wondering if part of the reporting that comes back should include that as well with the delays and all sorts of things you 've been quite a lot of questions around that we never would have major things happen there the fire response those kind of things we 've had some form of reporting and I know that 's been through the civil defense but whether that should happen as well to reassure people that the response has been appropriate which um which recommendation is it can you go back up to four so that the other sort of the other governance processes and reporting and and all those kind of structures that may have allowed Beauty erections for example no no because that deals with the technical not the process so it looks at the review of the inspection regime the monitoring and assessment but not that reporting structure for those types of things to counsel on this instance we 've covered thereby strengthening and reporting through this and I think a report so that we can learn from what hazards and potentially in the way of a filtering so there were things that right here dozens no examples process and there are helping questions about the delay in our response and having a a review just to look at that very I there was an assumption that there 's been a delay in the response council this is the first council meeting of the year so there hasn 't been a delay in our response you know and so I just I just think that what the last thing that I want to do is to take people 's minds off the fact we can if we implement temporary chlorination that we can get it out of our water as quickly as possible it 's that 's my priority so you know reassure people that there hasn 't been a delay then it would be really good but there have been questions and this is the first council meeting of the year there is no delay this is the first opportunity this council has had to react to it the council staff have had delegation on this matter they relinquished that this week so this is the first time this council could deal with the matter so I just kind of want to put that to be there is no delay that has caused any risk to our communities that is any greater than any risk that they 've ever faced in relation to our water so I just think that it 's a side issue but it is an issue that that that obviously council council laws will want to raise at some stage in the reasonably near future but not through a reporting mechanism to a committee so and that is occasion so I 've got Mike next thank you my questions that were actually around what Tim was talking about that the 60 days for a nation after the earthquakes how long to take to actually once that decision was made to chlorinate how long did it take weeks so you 're sort of saying before that you 're gonna wait to everything set up and then do all the floor nation at once is that so that indicated really the risk isn 't that high that you 're not putting in mine as soon as you possibly okay as soon as possible we have to purchase the equipment from what I took from your last answer there was Jewish gonna sit everything up instead of doing the machine to get one online and start dosing it straight away you 'll wait till everything 's ready to go and then dose it all over the hashkee I think that 's the best advice because if we start timing that over different parts of the city that Florida because of integrated way and network arrangement we want us to tell people can plan for things there are people who are going to have to make other provisions people on dialysis people with tropical fish people who rely on chlorinated water for there might be food manufacturing so we 've got a degree of that we 've got to give them a precise date otherwise they could be reaching from one zone to another so when someone gets chlorine when they didn 't think through eternity we don 't want to have that situation no chlorine and the waters gonna put another risk for some people it will it 's bad information about informing people I mean people on dialysis use chlorinated water all over the country country they just need to be deep dechlorinator for that purpose same with tropical fish so we know that at the moment that the risk hasn 't changed we 're just obviously aware there 's an issue but there 's no change to the risk so technically what we could say is this is where the water is there it 's been the same as it always has been if you 're concerned bore your actually make the order lots of places secure status yeah that that is not an appropriate and responsible position for a supplier to take to rely on a boil water notice the a boil water notice is an emergency provision that has a limited value it was remarkable that after the earthquake the people of Christchurch continued to boil their water for up to more it was what was up to the point at which the water became chlorinated and we knew that because we carried out telephone surveys the reason it was remarkable is because all the evidence suggests from all over the world that boil water notices have little value after the first few days people boil their water rigorously at first and then one day they don 't do it nothing happens they feel they 're okay they then don 't boil their water then the problem happens so boil water notices are not the solution for a long-term risk and so another question so although our our waters and zones those zones aren 't isolated they can the networks integrators and it all joins out that if we did have an outbreak in one zone could that be control to that one 's own or to filter through to the whole of the new clue normally if there is any transgression and as Alice to say this general yet that we are surprised we do chlorinate in that given zone and we try to isolate as much as we can to stop the spread of any contamination beyond at the immediate vicinity and that 's the same within the the actual city etc it 's asking staff to put the zone picture up there because I think people need to see the size of the zones that we 're talking about when we quite rightly are trying to look to isolate zone by zone but when you look at the central pressure zone then it is most of Christchurch there was the ability to isolate pictures of that it 's just that that whole zone now is connected there is still a possibility yes and we are start to do the honors on a case by case basis where it can be done but you 've well between zone between zones so there was someone else Glen yeah thank you just one question on the regulatory time frame have you got any sense of in terms of government you know coming out of stage two when any regulation helps maybe new government early days so are you thinking maybe later in this calendar year yeah well certainly my mind my advice from from the inquiry is that they have that could be a do report that 's gone to the the DG has gone to the department internal affairs as well and enter the ministers who call for it and they 're there they 're there is staff advice adviser advice being prepared for for government to consider and I believe all that advice will be in with government by June this year so what happens after that there 'll be another process they leave the consideration around what the responses right I had no sense of how long things take through through the house but you know how soon after that a regulatory measure would not go through Parliament that 's guy that 's my it was stitched real rigor tree okay it 's a it 's a question for the executive for drinking water statements there 's a provision and a health egg this is we go mean the drinking water standards he needs to be consultation for at least three years because I don 't know about the same for government so the cabinet would make the decision yep so any more Gani but I just wanted to check on on the repair program I note that in the city care report it says that the repair program would not address the surge getting into the water system as the flooding in July last year so in terms of the repair program I just wanted to understand are we looking I know we want to get this done as soon as possible I understand that that fit areas that are susceptible to flooding in terms of raising that the station out of ground like the Burnside Park one are we looking or do we get a choice around the level of investment to secure the ones that you know we may consider that the recommendation is to repair the program well this D look at the the program to bring them all above-ground we 're better off to wait to end a beautiful life because once once they 're repaired to a waterproof standard one one could argue that there are as good as on the path well if as far as ingress of surface water is concerned and we 're talking about some fairly high-tech ceilings here that are quite effective we can you know we can decide through the LTP process that the city wants to bring all of the the world below ground wells above ground and that would be a consideration that the council would make at the LTP capital program review so it is all possible but these wells deliverables they have an an average life of 50 to 60 years and you would be walking away from that investment if you did it early so there 's an economic argument here as well let 's make the best use of the assets that we have keep them in a good pipe operative condition and reduce the risk when we replace those wells at the end of their useful life we then replace that with an above-ground structure but was very precise just just a quote from the city care report the residual risk which will remain following completion of the repair works include chamber onion Dacians require then design rainfall events river waterway flooding so what I can 't understand is given that and we also told that in the July event that we got the river water onion dead at a number of well heads contaminated them with sewage wastewater which had been washed in vast surcharge surge networks pump stations so why wouldn 't we raise those ones at least above ground just do two things here there 's raising the the Chamber 's rather than the the bracelet well hit above ground means a new annual which is I don 't matter dealer so it 's just about putting our extra rises on the chain so it 's above a given flat vehicle and we 're doing there city wide flood mopping to determine what those flavors are so the ones that got will that we 're being asked to approve is going to stop sewage getting into them absolutely going to reduce the risk of that contamination occurring absolutely what do we need to actually stop up from there oh it 's all about investment so but the city care report says that if we go with the repair that they 're proposing it won 't stop that from happening in extreme events we 've heard over and over that the flooding along the history over for example there 's no longer considered extreme that it happens on a regular basis so I mean I just I just worried that there may be cases where we actually want additional investment and I know it will cost more but to actually address that what does seem a very real risk that we 've actually I know it may not be recorded as a transgression but I would have thought from a health point of view it 's a pretty significant risk that is very real to people so these things can be can be work can be waterproof entirely and that 's something we give you progress on those and give you that assurance that that method of contamination won 't occur on these and penalties can I just ask the medical officer health and those July flood events there was no boil water notice issued and and so even though the sewage got into the the water supply it was no no no no what sewers have not good you might say that possibly an accurate keeping creates an attrition that something that [Music] sorry that I 'll just I 'll quite the thing so it 's totally accurate during the rainfall event of 22 22nd July river water and indebted a number of well heads contaminating them with sewage waste water which had been washed and via surcharge surge network pump stations so it didn 't go into the water supply I yeah so so the issue was that it got into the wellhead but it didn 't get into the water system and the mitigation for that anything should anything get in it that now has some pumps that pump it straight out again and secondly it has an alarm that on standby and get that alarm immediately with a 60 minute response time so those medications are they what provides the confidence that that is not a risk so we but we would know would we know within 24 hours whether it had been contaminated no of them within an hour right because the sump pumps going to do its job and the wit floor alarm has been a trigger and so while the sump pumps that off the the person on call has got the alarm and to go out so just understanding in terms of a risk point of you if we know within an hour what 's the source and then go and and chlorinating given that we know something 's happened versus what we 're being told now is that we should just chlorinate that less than it one mechanism though there 's other mechanisms that we might not be as obvious as a July storm event possible here 's a two-minute break before debate please because I don 't must need the debate and I need to leave [Music] sorry I didn 't turn my like to come to you now thanks actually heard tolling of Yanni 's questioning and it may have been along the same line some started it but the apology business has been covered but it 's really just around the rolled out versus deployment so I just want to be clear on it is it 60 days to build and put in place some temporary infrastructures chlorinate the water supply and then another six to eight weeks to deploy the chlorine into the supply or from the chlorination redeployed reasonably rapidly I heard an Italian what it sounded like a matter of hours this is the event okay okay so the sixty days is the entire deployment so from the city but then it 's chlorinated immediately once the sixty days is that but I think you might have missed the questioning Jamie that said that the reason for choosing the one day for implementing it was so that people who need to dechlorinate like people who are using dialysis or filling a tropical fish tank or producing beer or they need to they need to be able to dechlorinate from rather than just a roll out across the city they need a date oh yeah no Dennis tell us when I guess the thing really comes down to an airtight arrest and them from the from the medical standpoint that may be an unacceptable risk but it follows on I guess of what Kim was questioning was with the mythical officer of health be comfortable with us putting in place the infrastructure and then in the event is there there was heavy rainfall or was something that we think would heighten the verse 60 termination of a motor supply to being deployed chlorination or is there just too many variables there into the garage to take with it the answer is there 's just too many variables and too big a risk to take with that hopeful thank you very much thank you all right well look we 'll just a June for five minutes well in four minutes we 'll come back at 35 thank you you again that would be great we 've just tidied up some of the resolutions as well in order to sort of raised during the questions I would like staff to publicly advise of the error in the correction and report option to paragraph 7.8 so John if you would like to report on it bring your attention to the report we have left them there the operate the annual operating costs of temporary chlorination which now will put to the front percent monthly operating cost because we 're not likely to be tolerating for a year so we thought would Express sales and monthly so that needs to be amended 7.8 read maintenance slash ongoing costs of 270,000 which we made up of two hundred and ten thousand dollars with a wellhead maintenance and sixty thousand dollars for increased water quality monitoring and that 's the new text okay yeah I think that 's the cut and paste there he goes all right so thank you so now we 'll move on to the resolution so that we just note that the changes to the resolution said you want to move up so we 've tuned for into a request to staff to report through a tea sowho which will come cost of undertaking further improvements on monthly progress with them permitting the wellhead improvement works with the draft water safety plan for approval when completed and with a review of the inspection regime for the monitoring and assessment AB low ground well heads undertaken prior to June 2017 and since because what that will do is it will enable us to actually look at what the inspection regime was before and after and whether the inspection regime change whether the standard changed or whether in fact we didn 't have a sufficiently good standard before and is that something that really was throughout New Zealand given that it we really came to the fore when the have-nots North incident occurred in August 2016 and if we could move up the list sorry I assumed we vetted approve the installation of temporary chlorination for up to 12 months that means that if that were required for more than 12 months it would have to come back to Council for another decision so that makes it clear that we 're only authorizing temporary chlorination for 12 months up to 12 months the that was left to lie on the table that was referred to that was to be referred to the council meeting on the 22nd of February and that 's resolves that a long term that yeah long term to represent that long term the council wants to retain that Sun chlorinated drinking water system relying on secure bore status accordingly the government opposes any government move to what Oh optimism optimism accordingly the council opposes any government moved to remove its ability to rely on secured board status to comply with drinking water standard New Zealand and opposes mandatory permanent chlorination and then item 8 just simply notes that that resolves that matter and staff no longer need to report back on the matter it 's dealt with and then item 9 asked the chief executive to undertake an overarching independent external review of this matter so that the council can provide assurance for the future of our uncorrelated water supply and report back to the council so that 's to the full council not through a tea but to the full council and that 's just to pick up 'm willing to move this oh can I just say something that I think is important in light of what 's happened with have look the wording as it stands implies that Christchurch City Council would rely solely on secure borer status and I think the case for Christchurch is they have never relied solely on secure board status there are other processes such as the monitoring the the rigor of the monitoring program backflow monitors maintenance of reticulation system right and that 's important it 's a very important point to make because should central government come back to you and say well you have said you 're just relying on secured board stages you have say secure board status and other processes that yet how would you say to rely on reversibility yeah poses well but as theorem is there a way of signaling to government that we don 't actually want them to pick up that recommendation or doesn 't mention you can I mean I suppose you can do that anyway but I think the point is you 've not relied on secure point is reliance also augmented that with all those other important processes yeah well accordingly the gut that council opposes any government imposed mandatory permanent chlorination all right so question you 're just before the debate the starts number three will that be put separately it can be if you want to yeah I think we 'll make it easy for people to speak to and I can 't imagine you know it 's not supportive of all the others and once three 's put in most the others fall into line anyway but yep I won 't have it as a two separate debates though okay did you have a question clarification on the amendment to number four cuz I mean there was comment made that counts as carotene committee meetings that 's actually not it 's not in the past councilors have been unable to well regardless like so there was comment around whether that could be the full counts other than the significance and I thought there was gonna be a moment to that effect so I would like to either signal an amendment to number four in that regard 's other committees like finance and performance my order and rescue actually do have some role in this and I don 't think it 's fair just to go to one committee that excludes other councillors because I don 't think we really want to get into a detailed debate Council run all these different things I think they 're so significant we should have an opportunity as a full council to consider them well are very strongly disagree with that I think that it 's important to have the lens of the subject matter committee making the recommendations to council who rather than the staff and making the recommendations to Ripley to Council but but that 's fine you can you can move an amendment you 'll move an amendment there that 's to report to full council through the floor dov 'è second order a full committee of council there 's no second oh it 's powerful wonderful second a thank you so so I 've moved the the resolution as there a seconder for us Andrew right well look nobody nobody wanted to be in the position pristine and wonderful water supply nobody ever wanted to be in this position as a city we have been in this position before where a recommendation has come before council where we decided not to chlorinate and that was two years ago in 2016 and in September a recommendation came forward that because of the risks around the northwest shadow ball was that it was recommended that we should chlorinate in their area and we chose not to do that the focus on the shallow bores arose because of the hemlock north enquiry it it was always on this council 's agenda for a very long time to stop reliance on the shallow boards and to go for the for additional deep bores and those areas and that as a program of work that 's still being undertaken but we have closed off the shallow bores we agreed to do that as a matter of urgency and we brought that work forward there were risks and we decided as a council that weighing up those risks providing people with the information that they would require knowing that we have an our pure water supply we were able to make that decision and it was against the advice of staff and it was against the advice of the medical officer of health but that was the decision that we made this one 's slightly different because we 're not just talking about one area of christchurch that can be isolated we 're talking about losing secure Boer status from ballhead status from Boers that are right across the city a hundred and three I think in total and of course there are a significant number that are no problem at all because they 've all been built above ground since a particular time but the below ground bore heads do present us with this problem in many respects it doesn 't matter whether it was as a result of the Havelock North inquiry that there has been an increased sense of risk and risk aversion in terms of the sign-off of the engineers but we cannot rely on the status the secure status of our Boer heads and that is not a risk that I 'm prepared to take and the because although the risk the probability the probability is slight it is unlikely that there would be any event we haven 't had any transgressions and significant rain events that have already been mentioned so the risk is very small but the consequences they 're huge and when you think about the potential consequences you take an area of Hemlock north and the number of people that were affected they 're three to five people died and there were thousands and fected there would be hundreds of thousands potentially exposed here in Christchurch and how many deaths could possibly occur so although the risk is small I mean sorry I 'm going to help say whiskers two things it 's probability and consequences so although the probability is small the consequences are high this puts a red flag around the risk for me and that 's why I 'm moving the recommendation Andrew we 've heard a lot of detailed information today by way of the answers to the many questions that have been put and also the information that was quite dinner provided in the report and in previous in my mind the way forward is reasonably obvious we 've lost our secure status we need to regain that as soon as possible and I believe that the steps that we need to take in the meantime are pretty clear as has been said the reality is that the risk of contamination is low but the consequences of contamination could be probably more than significant we as a council I 've got a responsibility to take seriously the advice that we 've been provided in the information that 's been put in front of us and we certainly have a responsibility for the health of our residents the health of our citizens to make sure that we do the responsible thing to ensure that the quality of our water supply is not a risk to public health adding chlorine to our drinking water isn 't something that I 'd vote to do lightly and I do that only in context of the advice that we 've received from the medical officer of health and I agree to it only on the basis that this is only a temporary measure such time as the wellheads are once again able to be signed off by the engineers as secure and as we 've heard their arrangements already entrained to allow that to happen and there 's an understanding on the part of the engineers of what the interventions that are required are and there 's an agreement that once those interventions have been completed then sign-off can and will occur so I 've got a very high level of confidence that what we 're talking about here is temporary will be temporary and that we 've got the ability and the confidence to do what needs to be done as quickly as possible so I don 't support permanently chlorinating the drinking water and the decision we 're making today definitely does not do that I do support temporary chlorination for public health reasons on good and responsible advice for the shortest time possible and expediting the program of work that 's required to achieve that as quickly as possible so I 'll be voting today in favor of the resolutions I 'm just going to go around the table now that they want to say something so Vikki I will also be supporting it I think we 're in a situation where we either do this or we get told to do it I cannot imagine for a moment that the medical officer of health can let a situation where he perceives there to be any risk to public health and he would not act on that so as I perceive it we either do this or the medical officer of Health will tell us to do it so it 's going to happen one way or another I think what 's really important is that this is a public health issue and I totally get why the medical officer of health could not do nothing he cannot sit by and watch renal failure in a six-year-old or something like that that could have been prevented I don 't think as counselors we can either actually every day we deal with issues of Public Safety we deal with them in psycho ways and pedestrian crossings and traffic lights and everything so safety has to be one of the things that making sure that we get a long-term safe drinking water without chlorination and if we are going to persuade the government that we are worthy of an exemption given the recommendations of the high block authority we actually want Alastor on our side to do that and I want to see that they will want to see and want to know that we will act if there is any possible threat to public safety so I think long-term I think what we do short-term actually impacts our capacity to have an exemption long term as well I think there are three three things in here that give me some comfort give me more comfort one is the addition of up to 12 months and recommendation 3 1 is recommendation 7 where we actually make clear what our viewers about the long-term non chlorination of Prost huge water supply and what I 'd also like to see but I don 't need by way of a recommendation because I 'm sure staff will agree to it is that we actually provide some uncorrelated water for those who want it in public I don 't think it needs a resolution in order to make it make that happen so I will be voting in favor of this thank you Yanni hmm yeah I think what 's a rather than canvas the arguments that have been put forward or the points that have been made I mean I I don 't think any of us wanted to be in this situation I personally value Christchurch 's precious water and you know that there is a responsible course of action that we have been asked to take and you know I think to oppose putting an chlorine on a temporary basis would would not be responsible at the moment having heard from the medical officer of Health and having heard that the assessment of the secured boars that they are no longer secured so I think we do have to make this decision today I think there 's two other questions that really do need to be answered and I think you know the focus has to be as it 's been said getting our permanent what are getting the temporary chlorination finished as that has to be the focus today what we need to do to get there but there are other things that we also need to pick up on this and that is a full audit review of how we got into this situation in 2003 there were learning points that were identified through our committee the need to modify some wellheads and other items to reduce risk the need for improved inspection and testing procedures to identify potential problem areas and deal with them before the problem occurs so you know 15 years ago we actually knew that there needed to be in movements and will be very interesting in the report and order that gets done to see what was done as a result of that what was done after the earthquake because I think some people will really want to understand with the millions and millions hundreds of millions of dollars spent on infrastructure repairs and on assessments how we could have had such a dramatic change in in less than twelve months time from system being okay and secure to suddenly being unsecured I think the other status is only one way of reducing risk and I hope that counselors will look at things like the surge contamination of our well heads that won 't be covered under this repair program that will be hopefully identified as something that we should also be doing to jusuru so you know I would love not to be able to chew I would love to not have to put chlorine into our water on a temporary basis but I feel that that is the responsible thing to do I guess there 's someone who has a young daughter and and thinks of the health consequences if even though the risk is low but the consequence could be huge I think we need to do the responsible thing today I would just make the point that this should be going to the full council you know I wouldn 't expect the rig and consensus committee who lost the accredit eight or the council monitoring the accreditation it 's a full council consequence as we 're seeing today and it should be the full council that looks at the response not just audit and risk have a role to play in this have already had reports around us and I think we need the full council taking responsibility okay thank you first of all I want to thank dr. Ellis Humphries and DHCP and our staff I think it 's some example of working together and I think that 's the key and I think that that should give a lot of reassurance to everybody in the city so think you will fit the work you 've done I think it 's crucial I 'm totally opposed like everyone around this table of with regards to permanently chlorinating our water in the city and I think as Vicki said items three and seven edie reassurance to to us and to the city that there will not be the case if you really look at the 60 days to implement if we take from today making the decision today to temporarily chlorinated our water we 've got 60 days to implement if we expediate the process which we 've also asked our staff to do we 're looking at between seven and nine to get that done us as quickly and as professionally as possible so I think I 'm hopeful that we 'll we finish this within 12 months of well but short of it as also it 's been suggested said that risk is a combination of likelihood in consequence the likelihood has wrought the very low however the consequence with a population of 300,000 as extreme and if we lock it the most vulnerable being infants children and the elderly and we have a medical health system which is pretty well under pressure anyway what hasn 't been mentioned is if we have a health system that is inundated by illness through contaminated water there are those in our community who need assistance with health that may not get it and the adir life risk would raise as well so it 's not just those that are affected by contaminated water so I will be supporting this I think I tongue ate the last one with regards to a review after all this because I would hate to add pressure to our staff I would like them to concentrate on and our staff are happy and can sign off and get back to normal so but I think following all this to have a review as it extremely important and that should be to full council as discussed and put up there so I will be supporting this but I 'd definitely make sure that it is a temporary measure thank you thank you clean thank you I support all the recommendations which to me obviously sequential and hugely proactive so when you look at these here these will stand as part of the paper trail for us looking back well why I say that is if you look at any crisis or any movor LOC North inquiry in that the two stages has traced the systemic breakdown so we are acting now we 're being proactive before we have a public health crisis and the government will look at this and they will want to know from subcommittee onwards that we 've taken this seriously and that we 're obtaining all the information getting our reports in place acting so I 'm fully behind this the if you look New Zealand or public health outbreaks they can always be traced back to governance and their attendant decision-making issues management etc so the way I look at this today we 're addressing these systems today to head off any mandatory treatment which which if you look at stage two of the headlock north report that 's pretty strong on the fact that appropriate and effective treatment of drinking water should be mandated by law provisions should be made for exemptions for mandatory treatment only in very limited circumstances the way I see this we have to earn number seven okay we have to do this stuff today if you want to be chlorine free permanently the short ads are actually is you 've got to put and place the chlorine treatment now so if we want to build this case this exemption to the government we have to be sensible about it not everyone wants it but we 've got to do it now and in ensure that we are permanently chlorine free in the future so that that 's about all I have to say on that but I run else I don 't want the water to be chlorinated but we have to think of Christchurch 's reputation we think have to think of the manner of the council we have to ensure that our drinking water remains chlorine free in the future by sleep or innately now okay Aaron well see clean I 'm wow this is this is a big decision and it was asked before why some of the my fellow councilors kind of wish we weren 't here and why are we in the situation we 're in the situation because we 've put our hand up to be councilors and sometimes there will be some really really tough decisions to make today is one of those this council actually didn 't chlorinate the northwest which is where I live where my three children live the youngest of which when you made that decision was months old and I applaud you for that I 'm happy and I 'm happy to take that risk we did boil the water that our baby had and either that or we gave at coca-cola just kidding but will actually be one of the unintended consequences of chlorinating the water in Christchurch Christchurch has some of the most purest beautiful drinking water in the world and when it starts the taste and smell like a swimming pool people will opt for other drink options that will be a consequence bottled water sales will go up that will be a consequence for a council that is anti plastic in the environment often contacted by a number of P constituents in the last few days around this all asking us not to chlorinate today all of them not one contacted me and said please chlorinate the water which leaves me with a bit of a dilemma because we 're now risk versus consequence and every single day people face face risk in their lives when you cross the street just under forty people a year are killed as pedestrians crossing the street here block north between three and five people who were very immunocompromised at the time that they contracted that illness this the amount of sugar people have this drinking alcohol there 's going to the beach 115 people day and this debate today is about do are we willing to take a risk with our water as low as that risk may be but the consequence is very very high versus the quality of that water and not messing with it now I 've heard the debate that we need to stand together with Alistair and the DHB which I 'm a part of and make a united front that we 've we have made a balanced decision here and come up with the right outcome for our people for this period of time before we get back to our untreated drinking water that is absolutely true but the part of that debate is there 's all those people who don 't want their water treated they would rather manage their own risks and life and those people aren 't being represented in the debate at this point but we do need to consider those people because they are so passionate about the water of Christchurch I do agree that we need to be responsible but by falling into line and being responsible that doesn 't necessarily send our water it may also send a message that we 're willing to fight for our water and for our water to be untreated so let 's balance that up as we make our decision thank you no I 'll wait to hear the rest of the debate before I decide on number three Thank You Phil so I think what 's important is that this what we 're deciding day isn 't only around the chlorination obviously it 's really around accelerating that whole well heat repair program and it 's a combination of interventions that is going to work so we so we returned to be able to not have to chlorinate so and I think that it 's essential that the partnership with the medical office our health but that really continues so that in fact what Christchurch can be as executives special exemption status and I think that have it continuing that partnership in a constructive way that will help give us credibility not only to the Christchurch people but also with the government and I think the it 's been said but I 'll repeat it is as it was before what has changed and to become clear today is actually how the standards the application of those has been changed by the by the engineers and and we 've got really no option and I think it 's an encouraging that in fact in August and as a the Ettie committee reconsider a lot of these reports that the close church wasn 't only compliant at the time in fact we were complimented and Alistair referred to that today I think retaining that the committee is part of a process that we work through is really really important I think that that way this this quite technical work can be focused and in effect we can become quite effective so in fact we work with the whole of Council this is a situation that I would not have liked as if many of us have said to be in but the fact is that we are if we don 't make a decision to to temporarily chlorinate this water today we 're most likely going to be forced to do it and that has to achieve with our uncorrelated water for the long-term future I mean I value the uncorrelated water in Christchurch I 've got a lot more years to live I hope and I would hope to live those years with uncorrelated and chemically treated water we are in a really good situation where we do have water in our city that we can draw on that is naturally treated in such a way that it has low consequences to the drinking that we have I wanted number four to come back to Council to the full council initially but a compromise that we had was number nine where we said that we 're going to have an over arch a review of this process so that we can understand why we 've got to this point how we 're going to be better so that we can make those assurances to our people in our city and to the government and to anybody who visits our city that when they turn the tap on they are going to be safe that they are not going to get sick and there is think that is a very very important place for us to get to especially in light of recent circumstances that have happened around the country one of the things that I 've been thinking about recently is actually around the testing regime that we do have and I do wish that in the future we could have very quick testings such as like five-minute tests to understand where the pathogens have come in and I think there 's some good research and I hope one day is going to actually get there so we can actually get really quick testing and then answers about what 's in our water so that actually all water supplies can actually have an instant understanding of what 's in their water and at the moment I think it 's 24 hours or something along that line you know technologies and an exponential curve I think you know we 're going to prime research and development opportunities there for somebody anyway I 'd value living in a society or in a city where water is pristine I I will support temporarily correlating the water but make sure that we are doing what we can everything we can so that our water can stay you know untreated for its life Thank You Pauline Cullen as I go along but I don 't say reassured lottery effect big thanks to all so Humphries for joining us with us on this serious issue and also to thank you for recognizing that council staff are doing temporary work in going above and beyond its responsibilities to enter into space so we know that we 're experiencing far more frequent and more intense rain events and Butterfield 's and it 's these events among others which are putting our drinking water at risk currently and will continue to do so until we see all these bore tears and we have looked at every option to avoid this it 's the last thing I ever thought I would agree to but we are faced it 's been sealed with lowest high possible situation but I want to assure you that the Ettie committee infrastructure transport and Environment Committee well it should have a microscope on this program actually we have already sealed and our secured status reinstated and the flooring removed as an absolute priority and to happen as soon as possible I also want to to note that in May last year after stage one report the isie committee already instructed staff to include water quality monitoring reports into the three waters reports that come in every two months and to include the minutes of the candidate drinks and water reference group which was formed in response to receive updates on the program regularly and we requested the council to write to government with Arab fluorination those last two roaming recommendation today it 's already received that the resolution our states up to 12 months which gives me some comfort it 's a temporary nature and we would have to revisit this resolution effects to change but I also know that the infrastructure required to temporarily chlorinators is significantly different than that which would be required for permanent chlorination with an increased cost as well for permanent it also gives me some comfort than the temporary permanent concern so reluctantly I must also agree to the temporary treatment while we the people of Christchurch but we also need to embrace the situation as an opportunity to up our game at them again in the long run we will be assured of the safety of their water in our residents thank you Mike thank you I totally oppose the addition of any chemicals to our pure pristine water obviously there 's times when water does have to be chlorinated like after the earthquakes what we do know following obviously the removal that chlorination there have been no incidents no transgressions no problems with our water supplies those well hits haven 't changed the still the same today as they were before obviously the provisional status on air water supply has changed to unsecured but everything else is the same when the previous council made the decision to not chlorinate the water in the northwest that was a good decision the actual risk of contamination was higher than what we 're facing now but obviously fewer people were affected but there were still thousands of people that would have been affected had there been an outbreak but you knew that risk then no outbreaks because the risk probability of that contamination is so low we are obviously a we announce brought to attention the problem well I have a few issues with the whole timing of this you know the world doesn 't stop turning because it 's Christmas and we do have a recess committee and I personally think more should have been done efforts truly serious it 's going to be 90 days from the time of its reported to Council for time we chlorinate the water I think that is too too long and that needs to be addressed and we need to take on learnings move in moving forward and I do struggle you know when I weigh this up and I understand if we voted no to chlorinate what would happen it would most likely bleed chlorinated by order but we do have a right to make that vote we 're not forced to make the vote to chlorinate we can 't allow it to be ordered I 'd still don 't agree with comment that will be done desire consequences if we do not vote if than that that 's just a statement without proof I personally haven 't made up my mind I listen to the debate but our water has been perfect we 've been through a lot as remained perfect people were aware after the earthquakes and they took precautions and no one got sick we can inform the public we can give the public the choice of what to do I 'm not gonna cover ground that has already been covered my both beer and all of us is engagement with the community now we 've heard that there is no urgency there 's no imminent risk the delay hasn 't caused undue risk thus far and a further delay I believe wouldn 't do that as well as counselors now that the decision has come to us we have obligations under the Local Government Act to take into account the views of our community and one of the times that we were able to not do that as if there is urgency over a public health matter we 've been told that their urgency doesn 't exist and so we should that during the Cathedral debate where the numbers were different in the consultation to the to the final decision it was made clear to us in the debate that it 's not the eyes it 's not the numbers that matter it 's the whys and while we have a view as a council that probably the overwhelming feedback from the community might be against chlorination that 's just numbers what we haven 't heard from the community is the reasons for that I 've had Facebook messages and posts those kind of things some Bentley opposed some not opposed to on the temporary measures but what I have also heard his phone calls and emails from people who I concerned that they have had no chance for input one woman who called me last night concerned because she had you know only a few hours to be able to put any information together to potentially put a deputation to counsel for example and that 's been my concern throughout this we can 't just abdicate our responsibilities under the Local Government Act just because it 's inconvenient it 's of things this is of high significance and we should be consulted with our community thank you Jamie I 'll come to you now thanks for that we and yeah this is a difficult one I I believe that if we 'd like to have an exemption the future meaning in the long term that we have pure chlorine free water then I think the fact of the matter is we need to demonstrate today that will act and manage risk intelligently prudently and appropriately in doing that and in tandem and in collaboration with the medical officer of Health is the way to go about that do I want Christ which is water chlorinator absolutely not but it 's not the question and it would be misleading to suggest that it was without context and the context and the reality of the situation of us if we choose not to chlorinate now then it will almost certainly be imposed off anyway lose clout lose credibility and substantially increase the risk of not receiving an exemption going forward meaning it could likely result in long-term chlorination so good decision-making is same part of a board or a Norton Risk Committee will recall even the simplest of those risk management matrixes not giving any decision-maker a free pass to ignore risks that has a low likelihood in high consequence and that 's exactly where we 're at words that puts you in the red zone when you need to take immediate action and at least that puts you in the yellow or moderates eye so simply put and decision not to do this now as much as I don 't like it would mean we 've failed as governors and even more simply put it 's clear that if we want our waters to be chlorine free in the long term and I most certainly do then we need to make this prudent they 'll be at difficult decisions very in support the recommendations it 's done reluctantly but the right decision more often than not isn 't the easiest one so with a view to the future and a view to having chlorine free pure water and Christchurch are very reluctantly with support the recommendations in front of us because on and leading a motion right over prudent decision making as a result so I will be supporting these recommendations to say thanks despite hearing an excellent report in August stating for supplies and achieve full bacterial compliance a result that I understand has not been achieved before new engineering assessments of Christchurch Wells have revealed some may be susceptible to contamination especially in heavy rainfall events there is a slight probability of our drinking water being contaminated but the consequences of this risk are huge at the council it is our responsibility to provide safe water drinking water and a duty of care to protect our residents especially the vulnerable the young the old the pregnant and the immune compromised the steps recommended in this report these recommendations will achieve this temporary temporary cut the chlorination while continuing a very thorough work programme and review process will achieve protection for our vulnerable and ensure that permanent chlorination will never have to be considered full Christchurch water I 'm particularly reassured by 0.7 and 9 and hope it will also reassure our fellow residents that we as a council and to chlorinate our water permanently therefore I am in full support of these recommendations today thank you Dave David East thank you with only a couple of speakers to follow me he 's probably been seen pretty much around the room and I do concur pretty much with the thoughts of Jamie expressed a few moments ago and that once we find ourselves in this invidious position and we are taking a morally responsible approach should we choose not to I believe the medical officer of Health has no no other course of action but to instruct us to chlorinate anyway having said that I am impressed with the the program of works that 's proposed but I would suggest to staff that they produce a list of the repair program and the order that they intend to attack this repair and hopefully in some fashion or other we may be able to consider a zoning approach to returning to a foreign non-chlorinated water and parts of our city I 've said before and other debates a fairly contentious issue that I 'll die in a ditch over it I be a few people who want to fill the ditch in before but for me this is an absolute pride and feature of Christchurch that we do have the the best water I believe almost in the world and there are a lot of precedents that I believe that we can put a case even if government did decide that they wanted to chlorinate and in the country the Christchurch is unique we do have a pristine water supply and the processes by which we extract our water by which we monitor our air extraction and the quality of their water puts us I believe streets ahead of many other municipal municipalities in this country and we need to retain their status forever Thank You Jimmy my friend our visitor me from over overseas they always remind me to say to him hi church when expects every day at the priest the fresh air the otherwise when I open and turn on the tap water I can 't drink the purest water so they needed here as a local authority and also City Council we has the opportunity and a this is always possibility but right now we need to look a defect was affected now because we all security status know from the water supply had been changed changing from the provision secure to unsecure for how to wait to fix the visa problem so we need to know worked in a together I know we all prefer you know is the permanent is the kind of know any law coordinate which Inc the pure water but father in a temporary or in a procedure no we have to soon as procedure we can achieve all along tango well procedure absolutely we find the root cause is from hospital Wanda was always the kind of heads need to be improved needed to be the fix then this one aspect but simultaneously because even the the risk the proper tunity is the law we hope we are aware even slope as nada zero still more or less the probability of percentage so the procedure for this a temporary coordination of water actually is functioning to reduce those a percentage reduce the risk of this handle of large the contamination so taneous way no summit any we can do it and also I 'm happy you know we have time friend within the up to a year we can fix the most appropriate an apartment in a back to the normal situation we can all enjoy daily basis all the purest what the in the world and also the in here you know we take these the two kind of ways first a while no we can back to the provision of security status from the unsecured to the secure the Alwyn we can meet the kind of standard of the water supplied New Zealand the standard that 's when we are all aware the direction of the the hell 's the issue the stamen but we need to continue to reveal that his wife to keep the culture tenable the water is purest water in the world so I supported this the recommendation thank you great yeah I 'll be quick all the issues have been covered but just to reference the the shallow boards in the northwest it 's important to understand the only reason we made that decision we wouldn 't have improved that at all we can 't_''_12116.6 do that in this case even though you know we 've discussed it about the zones and what-have-you but the world 's obviously cover the whole city I mean you know clearly this is a short-term inconvenience discomfort annoyance for people but you know water quality is the biggest issue that local and central governments all over the world are going to face over the next 10 20 30 years and what we 're doing now yes there is short-term inconvenience but actually we will have a very very secure water supply system once we 've done this and maybe it takes this type of event to really kick things on and maybe do stuff that we should have done that maybe should have been done in 2003 or whatever it was but that will happen so I think short-term inconvenience but we will end up with a much safer water supply system in the end and then we 'll be back to our lovely Christchurch quality of water thank you look I 'll just close off the debates that you 've participated in the debate today I think all of you have made a significant contribution to the to the discussion and I want to thank you for that I 'm gratified that in the knowledge that someone else would intervene and make the decision in our place you still chose to make a decision today and I 'm also grateful to staff that that they made the decision to relinquish the delegation that had been made under the Health Act and to restore the decision to the council even though it 's for a temporary measure I think it 's really important that it is the council that debates it in a very open way and the route and the way that we have I also want to as others have acknowledged the council staff the medical officer of health and in her absence the drinking water Assessor who have collaborated throughout the process last year the programme of work that was in place was good enough to retain compliance and within three months that went to not good enough and we lost our secure status now result of increased risk aversion on the part of engineers or others with our evidence to back it up I 'm a very much an evidence-based person and I want to see the evidence one way or the other maybe what was being done before wasn 't good enough maybe the fact that there were no transgressions back then as there have not been subsequently maybe that was a matter of good luck rather than good management we 've all said we value our pristine ground water supply and I guess this is my challenge to the council when we look at the fair that we test more than we legally are obliged to in order to maintain that confidence and our groundwater we need to ensure that the inspection regime for our bore heads is also second to none and that 's something that I think that we will get out of buses referes said an opportunity for us to actually consider whether well we 're going to have to live up to the expectation in order to go to central government with the absolute commitment to retaining our you all very much for the way that you 've participated in this debate and on that on that note I will put the resolution all those in favor say over now wait a minute we want to deal with item three first which is the temporary chlorination provision so I will put item three all those in favor say aye those opposed say no would you like to just put your hands up so Aaron queuing Mike Davidson and Sarah temple thank you thank you thank you I will put the whole resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much so I would like now to move that we go and see the that we adopt the resolution to exclude the public has set out on pages 37 and 38 of the agenda and page 16 and supplementary agenda and that Jeromy Smith chair of Christchurch City Holdings Paul Monroe chief executive of crusher 's city holding Center is a snow chair of New Zealand crush '_''_12414.53 Cinzia be permitted to remain after the public are excluded for item so I 'll put that motion all those all those in favor say aye oh no sorry would you like to stick into the Andrew it 's okay all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you I propose that we are June for lunch and come back you _"

    "text": "again that would be great we 've just tidied up some of the resolutions as well in order to sort of pick up on some of the issues that have been raised during the questions I would like start to publicly advise of the era in the correction and report option to paragraph 7.8 so John if you would like to report on it bring your attention to point seven point eight on page 50 of the report we had left them there we operate the annual operating costs of temporary chlorination which now were put to the front percent monthly operating car because we 're not likely to be tolerating for a year so we thought would Express sales and monthly so that needs to be amended seven point eight read maintenance slash ongoing costs of 270,000 which we made up of two hundred and ten thousand dollars with a wellhead maintenance and sixty thousand dollars for increased water quality monitoring and that 's the new text okay yeah I think that 's the cut and paste there he goes all right so thank you so now we 'll that the changes to the resolutions that you want to move up so we 've tuned for into a request to staff to report through a tea sowho which will come back to Council with recommendations on the update on the cost of undertaking further improvements on monthly progress with implementing the wellhead improvement works with the draft water safety plan for approval when completed and with a review of the inspection regime for the monitoring and assessment of low ground well heads undertaken prior to June 2017 and since because what that will do is it will enable us to actually look at what the inspection regime was before and after and whether the inspection regime change whether the standard changed or whether in fact we didn 't have a sufficiently good standard before and is that something that really was throughout New Zealand given that it we really came to the fore when the have-nots Northland Siddhant occurred in August 2016 and if we could move up the list sorry I assume we vetted approve the installation of temporary chlorination for up to 12 months that means that would have to come back to Council for another decision so that makes it clear that we 're only authorizing temporary chlorination for 12 months up to 12 months the item number seven is and this picks up the item that was left to lie on the table that was referred to that was to be referred to the council meeting on the 22nd of February and that 's resolves that a long term that yeah long term to represent that long term the council wants to retain that Sun chlorinated drinking water system relying on secure bore status accordingly the government opposes any government move to what Oh optimism optimism accordingly the council opposes any government moved to remove its ability to rely on secure bor status to comply with drinking water standard new zealand and opposes mandatory permanent chlorination and then item 8 just simply notes that that resolves that matter and staff no longer need to report back on the matter it 's dealt with and then item 9 asked the chief executive to undertake an overarching independent external review of this matter so that the council supply and report back to the council so that 's to the full council not through a tea but to the full council and that 's just to pick up on on some of the issues so I 'm I 'm willing to move this Oh can I just say something that I think is important in light of what 's happened with have look the wording as it stands implies that Christchurch City Council would rely solely on secure Bor status and I think the case for Christchurch is they have never relied solely on secure Bor status there are other processes such as the monitoring the rigor of the monitoring program backflow monitors maintenance of reticulation system right and that 's important it 's a very important point to make because should central government come back to you and say well you have said you 're just relying on secured board status you have say secure Bor status and other processes that yet how rules to to rely on reversibility yeah poses well but as theorem is there a way of signaling to government that we don 't 't mention you can I mean I suppose you can do that anyway but I think the point is you 've not relied on secure is reliance you 've relied on secure board stages but you have also augmented that with all those other important processes yeah well accordingly the gut that council opposes any government imposed mandatory permanent chlorination all right so question you 're just before the debate the starts number three will that be put separately it can be if you want to yeah I think we 'll make it easy for people to speak to and I can 't imagine you know it 's not supportive of all the others and once three spot then most the others fall into line anyway but yep I won 't have it as a two separate debates though okay did you have a question clarification on the amendment to number four cuz I mean there was comment made that cancels carotene committee meetings that 's actually not it 's not in the past counselors have been unable to well regardless like so there was comment around whether that could thought there was gonna be a moment to that effect so I would like to either signal an amendment to number four in that regard that it should be the full council given that there 's other committees like Finance and performance like order and rescue actually do have some role in this and I don 't think it 's fair just to go to one committee that excludes other counselors because I don 't think we really want to get into a detailed debate council run all these different things I think they 're so significant we should have an opportunity as a full council to consider them well are very strongly disagree with that I think that it 's important to have the lens of the subject matter committee making the recommendations to council who rather than the staff or making the recommendations directly to Council but but that 's fine you can you can move an amendment you 'll move an amendment there that 's to report to full council through the for Dover second order a full committee of Council there 's no second row who resolution as there a seconder for us Andrew right well look nobody nobody wanted to be in the position of considering a report that contained a recommendation for chlorinating our pristine and wonderful water supply nobody ever wanted to be in this position as a city we have been in this position before where a recommendation has come before council where we decided not to chlorinate and that was two years ago in 2016 and in September a recommendation came forward that because of the risks around the northwest shadow pools that it was recommended that we should chlorinate in their area and we chose not to do that the focus on the shallow bores arose because of the hemlock north enquiry it was always on this council 's agenda for a very long time to stop reliance on the shadow boards and to go for the for additional deep bores and those areas and that as a program of work that 's still being undertaken but we have closed off the shallow bores we agreed to do that as a matter of urgency and we brought that work forward weighing up those risks providing people with the information that they would require knowing that we have an excellent process for testing second to none because we value our pure water supply we were able to make that decision and it was against the advice of staff and it was against the advice of the medical officer of health but that was the decision that we made this one 's slightly different because we 're not just talking about one area of Christchurch that can be isolated we 're talking about losing secure Bohr status from ballhead status from Bohr 's that are right across the city a hundred and three I think in total and of course there are a significant number that are no problem at all because they 've all been built above ground since a particular time but the below ground Bohr heads do present us with this problem in many respects it doesn 't matter whether it was as a result of the have lock north and quarry that there has been an increased sense of risk and risk aversion in terms of the sign-off the secure status of our Bohr heads and that is not a risk that I 'm prepared to take and the reason I 'm not prepared to take that risk is because although the risk the probability the probability is slight it is unlikely that there would be any event we haven 't had any transgressions and significant rain events that have already been mentioned so the risk is very small but the consequences they are huge and when you think about the potential consequences you take an area of Havelock North and the number of people that were affected there three to five people died and there were thousands and fected there would be hundreds of thousands potentially exposed here in Christchurch and how many deaths could possibly occur so although the risk is small I mean sorry I 'm going to whiskers two things it 's probability and consequences so although the probability is small the consequences are high this puts a red flag around the risk for me and that 's why I 'm moving the recommendation Andrew we 've heard a lot of detailed information today have been put and also the information that was quite in there provided in the report and in previous briefings as well and having considered all of that information in my mind the way forward is reasonably obvious we 've lost our secure status we need to regain that as soon as possible and I believe that the steps that we need to take in the meantime are pretty clear as has been said the reality is that the risk of contamination is low but the consequences of contamination could be probably more than significant we as a council I 've got a responsibility to take seriously the advice that we 've been provided in the information that 's been put in front of us and we certainly have a responsibility for the health of our residents the health of our citizens to make sure that we do the responsible thing to ensure that the quality of our water supply is not a risk to public health and in chlorine to our drinking water isn 't something that I 'd vote to do lightly and I do that only in medical officer of health and I agree to it only on the basis that this is only a temporary measure and these only needs to be a temporary measure until such time as the wellheads are once again able to be signed off by the engineers as secure and as we 've heard their arrangements already entrained to allow that to happen and there 's an understanding on the part of the engineers of what the interventions that are required are and there 's an agreement that once those interventions have been completed then sign-off can and will so I 've got a very high level of confidence that what we 're talking about here is temporary will be temporary and that we 've got the ability and the confidence to do what needs to be done as quickly as possible so I don 't support permanently chlorinating the drinking water and the decision we 're making today definitely does not do that I do support temporary chlorination for public health reasons on good and responsible advice for the shortest time possible and expediting the program of work that 's 'll be voting today in favor of the resolutions I 'm just going to go around the table now because it just makes sense everyone 's indicated to me that they want to say something so Vikki I will also be supporting it I think we 're in a situation where we either do this or we get told to do it I cannot imagine for a moment that the medical officer of health can let a situation where he perceives there to be any risk to public health and he would not act on that so as I perceive it we either do this or the medical officer of Health will tell us to do it so it 's going to happen one way or another I think what 's really important is that this is a public health issue and I totally get why the medical officer of health could not do nothing he cannot sit by and watch renal failure in a six-year-old or something like that that could have been prevented I don 't think as counselors we can either actually every day we deal with ways and pedestrian crossings and traffic lights and everything so safety has to be one of the things that we look at very very carefully my focus is on making sure that we get a long-term safe drinking water without chlorination and if we are going to persuade the government that we are worthy of an exemption given the recommendations of the high block Authority we actually want Alastor on our side to do that and I want to see that they will want to see and want to know that we will act if there is any possible threat to public safety so I think long term I think what we do short term actually impacts our capacity to have an exemption long term as well I think there are three three things in here that that give me some comfort give me more comfort one is the addition of up to 12 months and recommendation 3 1 is recommendation 7 where we actually make clear what our viewers about the long term non chlorination of Prost huge water supply and what I 'd also like to see but I 'm sure staff will agree to it is that we actually provide some uncorrelated water for those who want it in public spaces whether it 's libraries of water whatever else but I don 't think it needs a resolution in order to make it make that happen so I will be voting in favor of this thank you Yanni hmm yeah I think what 's a rather than canvas the arguments that have been put forward or the points that have been made I mean I I don 't think any of us wanted to be in this situation I personally value Christchurch 's precious water and you know that there is a responsible course of action that we have been asked to take and you know I think to oppose putting an chlorine on a temporary basis would would not be responsible at the moment having heard from the medical officer of Health and having heard that the assessment of the secured boars that they are no longer secure so I think we do have to make this decision today I think there 's two other questions you know the focus has to be as it 's been said getting our permanent sorry getting the temporary chlorination finished as soon as possible and allowing our water to be uncorrelated that has to be the focus today what we need to do to get there but there are other things that we also need to pick up on this and that is a audit review of how we got into this situation in 2003 there were learning points that were identified through a committee the need to modify some wellheads and other items to reduce risk the need for improved inspection and testing procedures to identify potential problem areas and deal with them before the problem occurs so you know 15 years ago we actually knew that there needed to be improvements and it 'll be very interesting in the report and audit that gets done to see what was done as a result of that what was done after the earthquake because I think some people will really want to understand with the millions and millions hundreds of millions of dollars spent on infrastructure repairs and on in in less than 12 months time from system being okay and secure to suddenly being unsecured I think the other thing that 's really important is that the secure bore status is only one way of reducing risk and I hope that counselors will look at things like the surge contamination of our well heads that won 't be covered under this repair program that will be hopefully identified as something that we should also be doing to Jusuru so you know I would love not to be able to chew I would love to not have to put chlorine into our water on a temporary basis but I feel that that is a responsible thing to do I guess as someone who has a young daughter and and thinks of the health consequences if even though the risk is low but the consequence could be huge I think we need to do the responsible thing today I would just make the point that this should be going to the full council you know I wouldn 't expect the Riggin consents committee who lost the accredit eight or the as we 're seeing today and it should be the full council that looks at the response not just one committee because many other committees with finance and performance audit and risk have a role to play in this have already had reports around us and I think we need the full council taken responsibility first of all I want to thank dr. Alistair Humphries and dhp and our staff I think it 's some example of working together and I think that 's the key and I think that that should give a lot of reassurance to everybody in the city so think you will fit the work you 've done I think it 's crucial I 'm totally opposed like everyone around this table with regards to permanently fluorinating our water in the city and I think as Vicki said items 3 and 7 edie reassurance to to us and to the city that there will not be the case if you really look at the 60 days to implement if we take from today making the decision today to temporarily chlorinate our water we 've got 60 also asked our staff to do we 're looking at between seven and nine months so although is saying 12 months we are hoping to get that dentists as quickly and as professionally as possible so I think I 'm hopeful that we 'll we finish this within 12 months of well but short of that as also it 's been suggested said that risk is a combination of likelihood in consequence the likelihood has wrought the very low however the consequence for the population of 300,000 as extreme and if we look at the most vulnerable being infants children and the elderly and we have a medical health system which is pretty well under pressure anyway what hasn 't been mentioned is if we have a health system that is inundated by illness through contaminated water there are those in our community who need assistance with health that may not get it and the adir life risk would raise as well so it 's not just those that are affected but contaminated water so I will be supporting this I think I 'm I tongue ate the last one would hate to add pressure to our staff I would like them to concentrate on expediting this and getting to an end zone where Alistair and our staff are happy and can sign off and get to normal so but I think following all this to have a reviewers are extremely important and that should be to full council as discussed and put up there so I will be supporting this but I definitely make sure that it is a temporary measure thank you thank you clean thank you I support all the recommendations which to me obviously sequential and hugely proactive so when you look at these here these will stand as part of the paper trail for us looking back why I say that is if you look at any crisis or any you know that the heavy lock North inquiry in that the two stages has traced the systemic breakdown so we are acting now we 're being proactive before we have a public health crisis and the government will look at this and they will want to know from subcommittee onwards that we 've taken this our reports in place acting so I 'm fully behind this the if you look at anything that 's ever gone wrong major tragedies in New Zealand or public health outbreaks they can always be traced back to governance and they 're attended decision-making issues management etc so the way I look at this today we 're addressing these systems today to head off any mandatory treatment which which if you look at stage two of the headlock north report that 's pretty strong on the fact that appropriate and effective treatment of drinking water should be mandated by law provisions should be made for exemptions to mandatory treatment only in very limited circumstances the way I see this we have to earn number seven okay we have to do this stuff today if you want to be chlorine free permanently the short answer actually is you 've got to put in place the chlorine treatment now so if we want to build this case this exemption to the government we have to be sensible about it not everyone wants it but we 've got to do it now and the future so that that 's about all I have to say on that but I urge you to to please support the recommendations like to run else I don 't want the water to be chlorinated but we we have to think of Christchurch 's reputation we think have to think of the manner of the council we have to ensure that our drinking water remains chlorine free in the future by sleep or an 80 now okay Aaron well see clean I 'm wow this is this is a big decision and it was asked before why some of the my fellow councillors kind of wish we weren 't here and why are we in the situation we 're in this situation because we 've put our hand up to be councillors and sometimes there will be some really really tough decisions to make today is one of those this council actually didn 't chlorinate the northwest which is where I live where my three children live the youngest of which when you made that decision was months old and I applaud you for that I 'm happy boil the water that our baby had and either that or we gave at coca-cola just kidding but the and that will be if we if we chlorinate will actually be one of the unintended consequences of chlorinating the water in Christchurch Christchurch has some of the most purest beautiful drinking water in the world and when it starts the taste and smell like a swimming pool people will opt for other drink options that will be a consequence bottled water sales will go up that will be a consequence for a council that is anti-plastic in the environment often contacted by a number of P constituents in the last few days around this all asking us not chlorinate today all of them not one contacted me and said please chlorinate the water which leaves me with a bit of a dilemma because we 're now risk versus consequence and every single day people face face risk in their lives when you cross the street just under 40 people a year are killed as pedestrians crossing the street ahead block north between 3 and 5 people who were very immunocompromised the amount of sugar people have this drinking alcohol there 's going to the beach 115 people a year drown there 's risk and life every single day and this debate today is about do are we willing to take a risk with our water as low as that risk may be but the consequence is very very high versus the quality of that water and not messing with it now I 've heard the debate that we need to stand together with Alistair and the DHB which I 'm a part of and make a united front that we 've we have made a balanced decision here and come up with the right outcome for our people for this period of time before we get back to our untreated drinking water that is absolutely true but the part of that debate is there 's all those people who don 't want their water treated they would rather manage their own risks and life and those people aren 't being represented in the debate at this point but we do need to consider those people because they are so passionate need to be responsible but by falling into line and being responsible that doesn 't necessarily send a message to the government that we can 't manage our water it may also send a message that we 're willing to fight for our water and for our water to be untreated so let 's balance that up as we make our decision thank you no I 'll wait to hear the rest of the debate before I decide on number three Thank You Phil so I think what 's important is that this what we 're deciding day isn 't only around the chlorination obviously it 's really around Excel that whole wellhead repair program and and it 's a combination of interventions that is going to work so we so we returned to be able to not have to chlorinate so and I think that it 's essential that the partnership with the medical office our health that that really continues so that in fact Christchurch can be a special executive special exemption status and I think that have it continuing that partnership in a constructive way that will but also with the government and I think the it 's been said but I 'll repeat it there 's no real change in the water quality it is as it was before what has changed and to become clear today is actually how the standards the application of those has been changed by the by the engineers and and we 've got really no option and I think it 's an encouraging that in fact in August and as a the Ettie Committee reconsider a lot of these reports that the close church wasn 't only compliant at the time in fact we were complimented and Alistair referred to that today I think retaining that the committee as part of a process that we work through is really really important I think that that way this this quite technical work can be focused and in effect we can become quite effective so in fact we work with the whole of Council this is a situation that I would not have liked as if many of us have said to be in but the fact is that we are if this water today we 're most likely going to be forced to do it and that has dire consequences for the future of what we 're trying to achieve with our uncorrelated water for the long-term future I mean I value the uncorrelated water in Christchurch I 've got a lot more years to live I hope and I would hope to live those years with uncorrelated and chemically treated water we are in a really good situation where we do have water in our city that we can draw on that is naturally treated in such a way that it has low consequences to the drinking that we have I wanted number four to come back to Council to the full council initially but a compromise that we had was number nine where we said that we 're going to have an overarching review of this process so that we can understand why we 've got to this point how we 're going to be better so that we can make those assurances to our people in our city and to the government and to anybody who visits our going to be safe that they are not going to get sick and there is no question in anybody 's mind about that and I think that is a very very important place for us to get to especially in light of recent circumstances that have happened around the country one of the things that I 've been thinking about recently is actually around the testing regime that we do have and I do wish that in the future we could have very quick testings such as like five-minute tests to understand where the pathogens are come in and I think there 's some good research that I hope one day is going to actually get there so we can actually get really quick testing and then answers about what 's in our water so that actually all water suppliers can actually have an instant understanding of what 's in their water runs at the moment I think it 's 24 hours or something along that line you know technologies and an exponential curve or thank you we 're going to prime research and development opportunities there for somebody anyway in a city where water is pristine I I will support temporarily correlating the water but only so that we can get there secure status to make sure that we can you know untreated for its life serious issue and also to Fallujah in space so we know that we 're experiencing far more frequent and more intense rain events and Butterball 's and it 's these events among others which are putting our drinking water at risk currently and will continue to do so until we see all these broad ears and we have looked at every option to avoid this it 's the last thing I ever thought I would agree to but we are faced as being saved with lowest high consequence situation but I want to assure you that the ethic committee infrastructure transport an environment pretty well it should have a microscope on this program actually we have already done it we 're very aware that getting these balls sealed and our secure status reinstated and the chlorine removed as an absolute priority and to happen as soon as possible I also want to to the issue committee already instructed staff to include water quality monitoring reports and to the three waters reports that come in every two months and to include the minutes of the candidate drinking water reference group which was formed in a response to receive updates on the program regularly and we requested the council to write to government with their opposition to enforced chlorination those last two and the recommendation to it 's already received that the resolution are states up to 12 months which gives me some comfort it 's a temporary nature and we would have to revisit this resolution effects to change but I also know that the infrastructure required to temporarily chlorinators is significantly different than that which would be required for permanent chlorination with an increased cost as well for permanent it also gives me some comfort than the temporary permanent concern so reluctantly I must also agree to the temporary treatment while we strengthen our multi barrier approach to our water safety for the people of Christchurch but we also need to embrace the situation there 's an opportunity to up our game and the safety of their water and our residents thank you Mike thank you I totally oppose the addition of any chemicals to our pure pristine water obviously there 's times when water does have to be chlorinated like after the earthquakes what we do know following obviously the removal of that chlorination there have been no incidents no transgressions no problems with our water supplies those wellheads haven 't changed the still the same today as they were before obviously the provisional status on air water supply has changed to unsecured but everything else is the same when the previous council made the decision to not chlorinate to the water in the northwest that was a good decision the actual risk of contamination was higher than what we 're facing now but obviously fewer and people were affected but there were still thousands of people that would have been affected had there been an outbreak but you knew that risk then and you made that decision and what happened there were no outbreaks because the risk what the probability of that contamination is so low we are obviously a we few issues with the whole timing of this you know the world doesn 't stop turning because it 's Christmas and we do have a recess committee and I 've personally think more should have been done efforts truly serious there 's going to be 90 days from the time of this report to Council for time we chlorinate the water I think that is too too long and that needs to be addressed and we need to take on learnings move in moving forward and I do struggle you know when I weigh this up and I understand if we voted no to chlorinate what would happen it would most likely bleed chlorinated by order but we do have a right to make that vote we 're not forced to make the vote to chlorinate we can allow it to be ordered I 'd still don 't agree with comment that 'll be done desire consequences if we do not vote if we do not vote to chlorinate it is no proof than that that 's just a statement without proof I personally haven 't made up my mind perfect we 've been through a lot as remained perfect people were aware after the earthquakes and they took precautions and no one got sick we can 't inform the public we can give the public the choice of what to do I 'm not gonna cover ground that has already been covered my vote Biron all of us is engagement with the community now we 've heard that there is no urgency there 's no imminent risk the delay hasn 't caused undue risk thus far and a further delay I believe wouldn 't do that as well as councillors now that the decision has come to us we have obligations under the local eight to take into account the views of our community and one of the times that we were able to not do that as if there is urgency over a public health matter we 've been told that their urgency doesn 't exist and so we should be consulting with our community over this formally I know that during the cathedral debate where the numbers were different in the consultation to the to the final that it 's not the eyes it 's not the numbers that matter it 's the whys and while we have a view as a council that probably the overwhelming feedback from the community might be against chlorination that 's just numbers what we haven 't heard from the community is the reasons for that I 've had Facebook messages and posts those kind of things some be remotely opposed some not opposed upon the two temporary measures but what I had also heard his phone calls and emails from people who I concerned that they have had no chance for input one woman who called me last night concerned because she had you know only a few hours to be able to put any information together to potentially put a deputation to council for example and that 's been my concern throughout this we can 't just abdicate our responsibilities under the Local Government Act just because it 's inconvenient it 's difficult it clashes with long-term plan consultation process those kind of things this is of high significance and we should be consulting with our community thank you and yeah this is a difficult one I believe that if we 'd like to have an exemption the future meaning in the long term that we have pure chlorine free water then I think the fact of the matter is we need to demonstrate today that will act and manage risk intelligently prudently and appropriately in doing that and in tandem in collaboration with the medical officer of health as the way to go about that do I want Christ which is water chlorinator absolutely not but it 's not the question and it would be misleading to suggest that it was without context and the context and the reality of the situation of us if we choose not to chlorinate now then it will almost certainly be imposed off anyway lose clout lose credibility and substantially increase the risk of not receiving an exemption going forward meaning it could likely result in long-term chlorination so good decision-making is largely about f-type arrests and risk management in one that same part of a board or a Norton Risk Committee will recall even the simplest of those risk management matrixes that has a low likelihood in high consequence and that 's exactly where we 're at words that puts you in the red zone when you need to take immediate action and at least that puts you in the yellow or moderates eye so simply put and decision not to do this now as much as I don 't like it would mean we 've failed as governors and even more simply put it 's clear that if we want our waters to be chlorine free in the long term and I most certainly do then we need to make this prudent they 'll be at difficult decisions very in support the recommendation it 's done reluctantly but the right decision more often than not isn 't the easiest one so with a view to the future and a view to having chlorine free pure water and Christchurch are very reluctantly with support the recommendations in front of us because I think it 's acutely foolhardy and putting the blinkers on and leading a motion right over prudent decision making as a result so I will be supporting these recommendations stating all council supplies achieve for bacteria compliance a result that I understand has not been achieved before new engineering assessments of Christchurch Wells have revealed some may be susceptible to contamination especially in heavy rainfall events there is a slight probability of our drinking water being contaminated but the consequences of this risk are huge at the council it is our responsibility to provide safe water drinking water and a duty of care to protect our residents especially the vulnerable the young the old the pregnant and the immune compromised the steps recommended in this report these recommendations will achieve this temporary temporary cut the chlorination while continuing a very thorough work programme and review process will achieve protection for our vulnerable and ensure that permanent chlorination will never have to be considered for Christchurch water I 'm particularly reassured by 0.7 and 9 and hope it will also reassure our fellow residents that we as a council and Beaman utley oppose any move by central government to require us to chlorinate our water permanently therefore I am in full support of these recommendations today thank you Dave David to follow me and he 's probably been seen pretty much around the room and I do concur pretty much with the thoughts of Jamie expressed a few moments ago and that once we find ourselves in this invidious position and we are taking a morally responsible approach should we choose not to I believe the medical officer of Health has no no other core selection but to instruct us to chlorinate anyway having said that I am impressed with the the program of works that 's proposed but I would suggest to staff that they produce a list of the repair program and the order that they intend to attack this repair and hopefully in some fashion or other we may be able to consider a zoning approach to returning to a foreign non-chlorinated water and parts of our city I 've said before and other debates with fairly contentious issues that I 'll die in a ditch over it I 'll die in a ditch in this one perhaps would be a few people who want to fill the ditch in before but for me this is an the the best water I believe almost in the world and there are a lot of precedents that I believe that we can put a case even if government did decide that they wanted to chlorinate and in the country the Christchurch is unique we do have a pristine water supply and the processes by which we extract our water by which we monitor our air extraction and the quality of our water puts us I believe streets ahead of many other municipal municipalities in this country and we need to retain that status forever Thank You Jimmy my friend our visitor me from over and overseas they always remind me to say to him hi church when expects every day at the breeze the fresh air the other ones will open and turn on the tap water entering the purest water so they need here as a local authority and also City Council we have the opportunity and a responsibility to provide quality of drinking water to the residents this is our responsibility but right now we need to look a defect was affected now because we all security from the provision secured to unsecure for how do we to fix this problem so we need to rework dinner together I know we all prefer you know it 's the permanent is that kind of know any local teammate which Inc the pure water but other in a temporary or in a procedure no we had to sue Lee 's procedure we can achieve our long-term goal but procedure absolutely we find the root cause is from all those below Wanda was always the kind of health need to be improved need to be the fix then this one is paper Massa material because even the the risk the opportunity is the law we all we are aware even slope as nada zero still more or less the probability or percentage so the procedure for this a temporary coordination of water actually is functioning to reduce those a percentage reduce the risk of this kind of learn the contamination so we have to face the factor so this is not a nice way no summit any we can do it and also I 'm happy you know we have the most appropriate an apartment in effect to the normal situation we can all enjoy daily basis all the purest what the in the world and also the in here you know we take these two kind of ways first the world no we can back to the provision of security status from the unsecured to the secure the Alwyn we can meet the kind of standard of the water supply de New Zealand the standard that 's when we are all aware the direction of the the health the issue the stamen but we need to continue to reveal that his wife to keep the culture to cater book the water as purest water in a war so I supported these the documentation thank you great yeah I 'll be quick but just to reference the the shallow balls in the northwest it 's important to understand the only reason we made that decision is because we could shut off those shallow balls otherwise we wouldn 't have approved there at all we can 't_''_3098.589 do that in this case even though you know we 've discussed it about the whole city I mean you know clearly this is a short-term inconvenience discomfort annoyance for people but you know water quality is the biggest issue that local and central governments all over the world are going to face over the next 10 20 30 years and what we 're doing now yes there is short-term inconvenience but actually we will have a very very secure water supply system once we 've done this and maybe it takes this type of event to really kick things on and maybe do stuff that we should have done that maybe should have been done in 2003 or whatever it was but that will happen so I think short-term inconvenience but we will end up with a much safer water supply system in the end and then we 'll be back to our lovely Christchurch quality of water thank you look I 'll just close off the debate I 'm want to think initially councillors for the way that you 've participated in in the debate today I think all of you have made a significant contribution to the to the discussion and that in the knowledge that someone else would intervene and make the decision in our place you still chose to make a decision today and I 'm also grateful to staff that that they made the decision to relinquish the delegation that had been made under the Health Act and to restore the decision to the council even though it 's for a temporary measure I think it 's really important that it is the council that debates it in a very open way and the route in the way that we have I also want to as others have acknowledged the council staff the medical officer of health and in her absence the drinking water Assessor who have collaborated throughout the process last year the programme of work that was in place was good enough to retain compliance and within three months that went not good enough and we lost our secure status now I 'm not one who says that this is a result of increased risk aversion on the part of engineers or others without evidence to back it up I 'm a very much an evidence-based or the other maybe what was being done before wasn 't good enough maybe the fact that there were no transgressions back then as there have not been subsequently maybe that was a matter of good luck rather than good management we 've all said we value our pristine groundwater supply and I guess this is my challenge to the council when we look at the fact that we test more than we legally are obliged to in order to maintain that confidence in our groundwater we need to ensure that the inspection regime for our bore heads is also second to none and that 's something that I think that we will get out of the saz referes said an opportunity for us to actually consider whether well we 're going to have to live up to the expectation in order to go to central government with the absolute commitment to retaining our ability to not chlorinate our pristine water supply so thank you all very much for the way that you 've participated in this debate and on that on that note I will put the resolution all we want to deal with item three first which is the temporary chlorination provision so I will put item three all those in favor say aye those opposed say no would you like to just put your hands up so Erin queuing Mike Davidson and Sarah temple thank you thank you thank you I will put the whole resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much so I would like now to move that we _"

    "text": "kids and drinking water supply status update report and I 'd like to hand over to John McKee to commence with just a brief overview of the situation that we find ourselves on yeah well thank you it 'll come as no surprise to you the events of Havelock North in August 2016 and in response to that the whole industry has been looking very very closely at the security of their water supplies across their country so there was an inquiry established and they had two reports Stage one report from the hemlock North acquiring came out in May 2017 and we were very interested those results and that live levels from criticism a lot of parties involved in the the security of and the health of drinking water the stage from the stage one report we then took a very very close look at the regime of looking at these world heads looking at our water security our compliance with the drinking water standards with with quite some rigor and we called one of our technical people made the employers of our contractors to say look what 's still fully compliant with all of the stuff that was under stage one report which really related just to have locked north they hadn 't addressed the rest of the country the implications for the rest of the country which was coming in stage two the contractors came back said well yeah well when we look at them and the light of what we 've seen in the stage one report there are some things that we could be doing to improve them so we got them to do an assessment of all the wells around the city they routinely go and inspect and maintain and check the pumps and check everything 's working but again this is just a routine operational thing that they 've been doing for probably over a deep more but we were looking at it through new leads and they came back with a whole bunch of recommendations that not some of those cable entry that 's as tight as they could have been as a couple of cracks in the concrete there 's water getting onto the floor of some of these things so be putting on a program to to improve all those those aspects that 's what they did so they came back with a proposal to do a whole range of work on 103 bore heads and and we put that in play and we had some costumes at that point about 800,000 200k in the current year with the other or 600 in the following year and that that program started in July August last year and we 've been monitoring progress and see currently giving me weekly update reports because that 's how seriously I was taking this position fast-forward to this December the 6th when the stage 2 report came out and there was some 51 recommendations in that stage to report and amongst the key ones for us was that they said they were recommending that we should have no longer have reliance on secure status of well heads to meet the drinking water compliance they strong recommendations for mandatory water treatment and chlorination but none of those have been accepted by them so the the real focus is the Ministry of Health yes what that lead director-general of health used the powers under the existing legislation to get better compliance with drink water standards across the country the director-general of health then sent a statement on the 20th of December bringing that to the attention of world water suppliers that they should not rely on secure well status they should consider a treatment until any recommendations had been agreed by the government we were considering that and we were preparing a paper for Council after leave after that event in the meantime technical staff have been going through their normal program of of doing the indepen engineering assessment of well heads to community confirm compliance with the drinking water standards so the consulting engineers in the light of these reports that were very critical on on one of their peers a consulting firm they are taking much more rigor in their assessment of the well heads and they were reluctant just to sign off on the well heads so this was on the round the 15 16th of December the draft report that I 've not even I had seen at that stage but there was meant I arranged to meet with the medical officer of health and the drinking water Assessor on the morning of the 22nd of December and it was at that meeting AB Alice doors on leave Rahman pink was the the medical officer of health at the time we said look there is the consequence of the Director General 's letter and the the reluctance of the professional engineers to sign off on them on the wells meant that that could imply that we no longer meet the secure status which was one of the three criteria for meeting the drinking water standards and that 's when we put the paper to Council I wrote a paper finishes of that day and and sent it off to my general manager copied and the the legal people CEO and suggested that this is needs to be addressed with that time you know we were going into into the Christmas period I was planning to work through anyway because there 's still a lot of work to do at the same time we were reviewing our water safety plan and the water safety because the water safety plan is what gives assurance to the drinking water processor that we are compliant with the drinking water standards and that 's the means of which compliances is agreed and so we during the break we reviewed the water safety plan I reviewed the business continuity plan that we 've got a whole lot of things up and running I was getting weekly reports from City care who gave me progress reports every Friday afternoon and to date they 've completed seven of the whole program those seven of course are the most critical ones that we have in the city and they 're now completed I 'll hand over so that 's just a quick background or where we are and I 'll hand over to can I just because just to emphasize just that period of time when you had asked City care to undertake a review of the wellhead status you were in conversation with the medical officer of health and the drinking water Assessor right throughout that period so that 's July August that 's correct so one of the first initiatives of health and the drinking water Assessor in fact we did a site visit I think good October to look at some of the work and also the drinking water reference group which is the group that we set up in response to have like north which is all of the five local councils the CDHP II can and we share our knowledge and share experiences and share information so that was one of the one of the things that was highlighted and Havelock North report that 's not an issue for Canterbury so the obligations under the drinking water standards the three that we 've highlighted in the report there in terms of relying on secure for head our ball water status that that is an ongoing obligation it 's not something that you have to comply with once a year and tick boxes it is a total 365 days a year obligation and if there are transgressions you have to report them and if there are breaches to the to the bore heads as picked up by an ongoing assessment then they have to be reported that 's a report to the the drinking water on the the compliance with drinking water standards to the year ending June this last year it was forwarded in July and was reviewed and we got the feedback and an August saying that everything was hunky-dory at that point we still had secure status and in fact and there were complimentary of the response responsibly taken to date on the on the on the drinking water inquiry so and and that that statement about the response to the drinking water enquiry that was actually repeated and the later of the 22nd of December last year is that that 's three so we 've had a good strong working relationship all the way through it 's important to note that the quality of the drinking water has not changed and so it 's still as as good as it ever was and we manage that risk we test that we do more testing bacteriological testing then then we need to under the drinking water standards at the time to give ourselves that assurance because I 'm well aware as I reported in September we do not treat the water and that 's the risk between the time we take a test and the time we get the results which is 24 hours later there is that 24 hour gap where if there was a contamination event I wouldn 't know about it no that 's my biggest concern and that 's why we actually have a very rigorous regime of water testing but in august when you 're talking to the drinking water Assessor the program of action that you 've decided to take through City care is sufficient to meet the ongoing obligation and criterion that 's correct so that wasn 't agreed but that changed and December 2017 okay thank you tonight hand to you to the medical office of Health Alistair Humphrey to get the the public health background on this okay good morning everybody thanks for giving the opportunity to speak to you today and the first thing I want to say is that we in Christchurch were very proud of our water we love our water we know the difference between our water and everyone else 's in but from my perspective as a public health physician I am also satisfied and have been satisfied for the 18 years or so I 've lived here that Christchurch City Council as a supplier goes above and beyond what it needs to do to keep our water safe not withstanding that most of the time it doesn 't treat the water crisis city council has always been responsible about keeping the community safe from problems with its groovy water following the earthquake very promptly the council took the decision to chlorinate the water it was a temporary measure it was vital that it was done and they did it the Christchurch community also participated in keeping themselves safe at that point we remarkably had no gastro outbreaks following the earthquake that is very unusual so you as the council and the council staff have been mindful of the safety of the water for as long as I can remember and the first thing I will say about this is our routine responses as a community are what we are dealing with here we are not responding to the Havelock North place a safe regime that has been there for a very long time we comply with the drinking water standards drinking water Assessors and I oversee that and Christchurch has complied with the drinking water standards throughout it is a routine process that the boar head security is is assessed and that 's laid out in the paper you 've got the boar heads are assessed in a rolling programme once every five years fifth every year and that is what has determined the chair here feel the independently commissioned engineers have come back and said that though they gave provisional status for a number of years they could no longer give that provisional status and that was their decision as soon as they had made that decision we were in a situation where we were being told in effect that there was no barriers to contamination for her drinking water and as a community and as a supplier the council have to respond to that it 's commendable that the council in fact had already responded even before they got that and that 's that the work that John a program to seal in those Bor heads and also as it happens to deal with the reservoirs which were the place the only places where we had had significant transgressions in the past so we have a water supply where there have been no transgressions as far as I 'm aware except a few in the reservoirs where there were cracks part of the program was to deal with that as well so the point here is that the staff at the City Council the council as a supplier have been ahead of the game all the time they were still ahead of the game but the engineers told us in December that we no longer had secured status secure status just to remind you is dependent on three things one there should be no transgressions there have been no transgressions to the water should be aged appropriately so old water is safe water and a model was used to calculate the age of Christchurch 's water and it is indeed old water therefore safe the third criterion was where we failed and as John has outlined to you heads those have to be dealt with to make the water safe so following that report we are in a situation where sensibly we should expedite that process if we can the program that 's already being put in place but in order to meet your obligations under the drinking water standards it is important that there is another barrier to to contamination for the community of Christchurch we have more than 300,000 people effectively now relying on a water supply it with no barriers and I always have considered the rigor with which Christchurch monitors the water and invests in its reticulation system to be a barrier in itself the secure status of the drink of the groundwater is also another barrier as far as I 'm concerned as a professional that is a multi barrier approach some people will say you should always chlorinate I think Christchurch is a special case we don 't need to always chlorinate we have a special set of circumstances at the moment which means in order to commit keep our community safe as the City Council has always chosen to do in support your chief engineer 's recommendations don 't make his recommendations that the water should be temporarily chlorinated until such time as the independent engineering company sign-off secure status for our groundwater and then we can go back to enjoying the water that we 've enjoyed for many decades ok thank you ok questions Erin and you think that explanation from from both of you it is very very clear the question that came to me through members of the public and I do agree with them is if there there is a if there 's a potential risk to our water and our water supply because this chlorination process will take time to implement it 's not a switch little we flipped on today no doubt that why if there is a danger or a risk why is it warm or to notice not issued straightaway a boil no to what boiled water notice is not required there is no imminent risk to the community we have not had transgressions if we had transgressions that would be different we would definitely be issuing a boil water notice but there long term risk of making sure that supply in the long term is a safe supply so boil water notice in my view is not necessary in the interim period what is important is that the council gets on with the work expeditiously but as our council knows well disasters don 't tend to stick to timelines so if we got an outbreak it could be today or tomorrow or in three months time once we 've got the chlorination process and in place so that 's what I think some people are struggling with including myself yeah as I say it 's we 're dealing with an imminent risk there the probability is extremely low the consequences may be high but in the meantime we have a system set up that has I 've been identified there the engineer as a shortcoming in one area it hasn 't changed anything that has been the same for a while they have come back to us and said these are issues you have to deal with in my view there is not an imminent risk to the population we have not 's no change in that but this is a process to keep our waters safe in a in a kind of medium to a long term it 's not about once those wellheads are sealed in we will be back to a safe situation but chlorinating over a period of months is a way of dealing with that risk over a period of months there 's not a kind of day-to-day risk here that requires a boil water notice hmm Yani yeah I just wanted to check on the process um you just want questions to the medical officer of Health or a nice staff okay so number let 's put three questions as well as stuff going to address those questions that we 've put in like last night when we got the report what 's the process around that burner the process of addressing those right so should I ask those questions now again oh yeah okay just yep okay I 've got you Pauline Phil Sara Dion um thank you but they have to be relevant to the paper that is relevant so in regards to the around putting chlorine into our water what viewer advice have we received in that regard and do we have an obligation engage with MALDI over this decision if I could I had talked to Gabriel our adviser yesterday and of course it 's similar to the Minister of Health their first priority is for the health of deaf people and so they fully support if we if there 's through the opinion of them the health authorities that we have to chlorinate the water and then then then it must be but they are obviously they 're of the same view after restore it to its previous condition so that 's though the early advice we have on that the second question was I was just trying to understand obviously nothing 's changed in terms of from last year to this well the previous year and the year before that in terms of the the bore hits but they were signed off one year they 're not signed off the next year so just trying to understand with the earthquake we must have had a program to assess the different well heads being picked up through the five year order or through the earthquake repairs and we 're on a program to get fixed or where they 've still been signed off as okay ceased again in drilling contractors we found I mean did the repairs over a period of time that it 's all finished so that issues with Quakers shoes what 's changed as the standard that the engineers expect when they 're doing the wellhead security assessments so the standards changed because I 've had the have lot findings which haven 't come into law yet no no no I don 't think that the standard has changed is that the right word or is it so is it that the amnesia of assessment of compliance changed and it 's actually much more sensitive and rigorous perhaps in relation to their obligations to sign off on secure status isn 't it pretty clear from the report that I mean if the surface water can get eaten then that 's not acceptable so how can we have one year have that being identified as a possibility and next and next year it 's still the same but it 's not son doff surely that 's a kind of black-and-white measure if something 's secure the risk aversion of the professional companies that have to rely when they when you read the criticism of the engineering company that assess they have like North Wales and none of them want to put that risk onto their professional indemnity insurance but to turn Yanni 's question around it may well be that the quality of the assessment that was done in previous years was not of a high enough standard for the protection that we require for our water supply yeah what was deemed acceptable no what was but it 's not what was deemed acceptable to them they may not have met a sufficient standard to provide real protection to our water supply in relation to the obligations under the drinking water standards so I 'm not letting the previous engineers off the hook by a globster that the standard has changed just because of the Havelock North enquiry I don 't_''_1389.85 I don 't think that 's that 's do have to look at the quality of the work that was being undertaken before because remember have a lot north what the cause was it 's exactly so the the line in the report and the three point one in the city care water or for section four point five point three two board water security criterion to the boy it must be sealed at the surface to prevent the egress of surface water so it 's pretty black and white it 's not sort of and I would have what I can 't understand is if we 've had all the assessment post-earthquake and all these independent engineers looking at these things signing them off when we 've got water egress how has that been allowed to happen that is the question of all these companies that are doing these regulatory inspections are now aware of and that 's why we 're seeing a lot more rigor in their assessments and that 's quite right they 're the standard to which they were applying to their assessments of the security the world heads may not have been was of independent inquiry I mean can we have a recommendation to actually go back and look well there was an inquiry so that was the have no I 'm talking about situation when can we deal with that separately we 're asking for measures to go back to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee and I would like them to consider the update and the monthly progress report and if they feel that it is appropriate to review their which is something I favor myself but is something that I would rather deal with separately from this and if you want to add some wording to number four then I 'm quite happy that review the the process for reporting on it but to have the draft water safety play now before the infrastructure transport an Environment Committee for approval when completed adds the layer of governance which I think has been missing I do think it needs to come in front of the full council and also I had another question in regards to audit and risk and I know we 've got a P exception there genders a public or in the px section question so no item on the agenda for audit and rest today no no we 've got a P X section on our agenda around the legal advice in relation to this report do you want questions around px audit and risk reports previously that identified water quality now or do you want that in the PX section yeah because I have no idea what you want to ask it 's really hard to give you guidance but what I really want to understand is given that we 've put an order in risk in money and given that this would have been one of the huge risks identified as in terms of a variety of mechanisms you know contract management performance monitoring assessment of infrastructure and drinking water quality I just simply want to understand what process we have in place to make sure that you know the operational aspects of what counts is doing here are aligned or aligned with the audit and risk program because when I read through that there 's there is a misalignment well yeah there will be quite happy to work on some wording around around us and and and given that we 're I just wonder whether that they will that that should stop being a noting provision and just ask staff to report to the infrastructure and we 'll find it some wording around a review of the past and speech and regime and we will and we 'll have that report back to the council of that 's all right Pauline yeah cool so who was next Pauline right so that was one of the 51 recommendations from the inquiry back to government and so that 's an anticipation of what the crown might do we have no idea what the what the government might do with that recommendation but in the meantime he was asked to use the existing regulatory powers and bring those to the attention I 'm thinking for suppliers there could be more to come depending on what the crown decides to do what the recommendations for Aquarius but I would also draw your attention to another item in our report which is a matter that we left on the table which was the recommendation from one of the committees saying that that we oppose the the permanent you know direction the direction for permanent claw relation and an actual fact maybe we need to find some words that that incorporate our desire to see this as a mechanism by which we can and yet but but ensure that that remains the position with central government as well Alistair and I just make a comment on that statement the director-general Christchurch has never relied just on on secure status there 's a lot of investment that accounts all in them with the mandate from the community has put into an effective additional barrier we go above and beyond all the monitoring requirements and backflow monitors maintenance of the reticulation system that can affect some may say is is a better barrier than treatment because actually it prevents all sorts of different infections or contamination of the water not just bacterial and viral so it 's important to look at that in the right kind of context and it 's still important to remember that this is not about what the employer this is about our routine processes we have always been safe and we have always in effect heard a multi variant approach even though we might not have used disinfection in our water yeah but I think that the point that councillors are you know sort of grateful in with at the moment is that clearly what has happened in terms of that secure status has been influenced by both of those factors right I 've got Phil Cera Dion and so my question really is in relation to the complexity of all of this and and like we have a recommendation in relation to informing the community around these decisions and that we would do that and connection in conjunction with the medical officer of Health and informing the community but I 'm just wondering given how complex this is should we as accounts or not also be considering how in fact we go wider around the drinking water as one part of Christchurch 's water issues and is the Pretz potential that the government central government might also work with us so in fact people understand what so what what I would like to see is a in fact maybe as a council we should go wider than just talking about informing people but in fact we should have a whole education program so that there 's better understanding I have been following social media and some of the comments have been quite interesting and and would indicate a lack of knowledge about some things including the fact that there is no treatment applied to water that 's bottled because of course there is but it 's UV treatment and but that we 're not talking about a permanent solution here we 're talking about a temporary solution and I think in a longer term if we 're looking at getting back to well and in the short term getting back to or the medium term getting back to secure status then we will be relying on the multi barrier approach that we 've always had as a city so but I think it would be useful and I agree with you I think that we need a very wide media campaign and listening to the the just rely on social media so we 're going to have to I think buy some advertising with very clear messages but the the the the the challenge for everyone is that the risk is no greater than it was the risk has not changed the risk is slight the risk is smelly but the consequences of anything going wrong are huge and that 's the difference and that 's what risk is it 's it 's its probability and consequences when you 've got low probability and high consequences you tend to think around the probability shall we take the risk we did that when we considered the shallow boards in the northwest are we prepared to take that risk for the whole city that 's the question there justin further than that in anticipation of the release of the stage to report we did work with our communications people and started preparing our communications plan ahead of the report landing and in that the result the whole range of community education advice even an advertising schedule for whatever the outcome might have been so that there is that You Laster your approach has been incredibly helpful and clear throughout this I 'm just wondering if you 've been really complimentary about the processes that we have as an extra barrier so the the actual management of the system itself and I 'm wondering if mitigation might have an option that isn 't chlorination that would satisfy you through management so it 's very clear that the the likelihoods lemaise Erdos comes when there 's rain event and it 's potential surface water egress into the well heads if we were able to have a management system which had contractors of staff on-site during rain events checking for water if there was any sign of water entering any of the wild heads that that particular wellhead was switched off until it could be cleaned would that satisfy you as to the safety of our water supply without having to go through the full preemptive chlorination of our entire city supply the question it really is seems to me to be rather a technical one but the first point I 'd make is that there are 103 wells dotted through we 're talking about secondly it 's very important to understand that although flooding is has been presented as an example of how egress of surface water or other contaminants might get in we cannot predict every eventualities that 's the point if if we could we would deal with it on a kind of you know we could we see exactly what was going to happen the point about the drinking water standards is they 're set up to protect from all eventualities if you like it 's an all-hazards approach so I don 't think it would be reliable to say okay we think maybe flooding is a risk deed it could be what what about other risks what about leakages from sewage pipes that are unpredictable so I don 't think we 're in a situation where we can just kind of guess what that hazard is going to be and try and respond to that we have to have something that is going to fix the water keep it safe for the period of a time until we know that the the system is sealed properly well maybe UV treatment is an option but actually from a financial perspective that is so expensive that that would be an inappropriate cost for a short for what is in effect a short period of time so chlorination is technically in my view is the only technical approach but John Mackay may have comments on whether there are alternatives but as far as I can see it 's and else is quite right and of course with flood events to have people standing at foreheads when most people are deployed looking at flooding homes or flooding streets and that the type of resource we 're talking about there as as as huge and UV not not practicable for a temporary solution a high investment high capital it needs building meets land meets and mechanical equipment so not able to be deployed quickly either so that would take a longer time and much higher cost thank you and it 's good to hear because I think beat only some of our communications would see that we 're looking at all options and and non-chemical ones haven 't_''_2301.049 been presented that and in the general media about the delays and I 'm just wondering if since we 've lost our secure status on the 22nd whether it would have been with the UL sort of preferred us to have been coronating prior to now so but while we had the the council right staff have the delegation should they choose to use it to actually proactively chlorinate our city supply and while there hasn 't been an imminent risk you 're asking us to do it now would you have preferred us to do it earlier as an organization the work was already started between senior staff from health and city city council as soon as they got the information on the 22nd I suppose in the best of all possible worlds what we 're saying is things should happen as promptly as possible I think it would still have required the council to come to a decision anyway but I said my answer is yes as soon as possible but if the question then is has there been an unnecessarily large risk presented to our community because of that delay 've said it 's the rigor of the application of the the standards by the engineering company that 's changed and therefore the messages let 's get on with this let 's get it done as soon as possible so that we can lift chlorination as soon as possible so one of the concerns I have is with our engagement with the community so it 's been a decision taken that there should be a council decision rather than a staff one and that presumably is for for elected members representatives of the community to be able to take other things into account then maybe the technical detail that staff would use and I 'm just wondering given there you don 't have any great concerns about the delay so whether you would be concerned about a further delay should we choose to consult with the community over this it seems that we have the local government once it gets to a council space we have obligations under the Local Government Act and with issues of high significance which this is clearly to consult with our communities and being that for us whether we should be consulting with the community out of us whether you consult with the community or not you have a an obligation to deliver a safe water supply you now know that the engineers have told you that it is not completely safe you can 't under that you have to in my view react promptly and therefore I think it 's it 's good that the council are considering this it 's good that they 're taking a decision but I think they need to take a decision promptly with the best technical information that they have received from from health and from their engineers I don 't think it is appropriate this this is not in my view because as that conditions arise under the Health Act it is not in my view a an issue that should have delay built into it by a consultation process I strongly agree that the public need to be clearly informed about your reasons for this and my view certainly over the last few days is that we have a community who understand these things there are large the questions I 've received from the community and I have received a few have been sensible questions people in Christchurch understand I think most most people understand the risks and they also understand that the processes that are being put in place to keep their water safe in the past and so they should because it 's their money that 's going into it so I don 't think it requires consultation I think it requires information and I think it requires a prompt response Thanks was this the first year we 've used this engineering company the first time we 've used this company for well-paid security assessments and why did we change because we 've now got a panel of consultants that we use for three waters work and the previous consultant isn 't on that panel and so there was a panel member who had suitable experts so we chose to use procured panel now that that 's that 's called the question I have around the the wellheads is how is there any idea of how many well hits we have that are at know that that 's covered on the report there are 103 all at varying degrees of of repairs required then there been triage that were written on the the most severe first but the total of total is hundred three so as we get through the the program of work the natural pace of those repairs should pick up because there isn 't so much work involved yes so what I 'm thinking is is do you think there would be a time where we go through the most critical ones to start with and then we can go back to the the drinking water Assessor and say we have done this amount we 've done those critical ones do you think and then go back to the engineers and say this is the work program we 've done on these critical ones do you think we 've got enough of those critical ones done to actually then be able to sign off on the drinking water standards is secure then we can go back to the drinking water Assessor and say this the engineers are signed off on those then we can give back you know satisfy those conditions to unclear innate if we do that yes and that 's an option we are looking at so we will progressively get that that statutory assessment done as we complete the program rather than wait until the end and if it is able to be done on a zone by zone basis we will certainly endeavour to do that so ednan and but that will really depend on that agreement and alignment with the drinking water Assessor who has to sign off on that on the safety plan but the engineers have to sign off on the terrain secure service and so obviously there may be some that are worse off than others and we 've seen that graph in the report but do you do you have any indication of where we may get to in that point where the engineers may be able say ok we 're happy and satisfied that the worst ones are done the ones that are still yet to be done under the work program ok under the current you know as drinking water the enticement through the work program that 's been done in the entire city so that we can go back and get you know unclear if we 've gone yet I 'd be speculating and I don 't want to speak for the drinking water assistant we would have to make that call and we 've said December this year but we will be using best efforts to bring that forward by utilizing multiple crews what we don 't need the specialists lining contractor we can get another other crews to count go and do the other minor repairs and then progressively get the the sign-off by the independent engineers and hopefully get to a point of agreement with a drinking water Assessor where there are satisfaction that there are sufficient controls in place a sufficient security on the gap above the below ground well heads in order to give us back that status and the condensed declaration but I can 't speak for the drinking water service bleep ok and the other question that 's related around this was this a lot of them were a number of the towards what councillor Templeton was saying was around flooding now if we could address those ones and and then of the other ones that have got lower risk could we then get to a point in the city where we could turn off full-time chlorination but then part what if there was a flooding event that would maybe sort of looking at some of the other well he 's actually just turned it on and times until we got to the Internet it 's not just flooding that could cause contamination it could be just high groundwater levels which you wouldn 't even see so you could have five high ground water you don 't know so it 's it 's not something you can easily predict I think I made the point that there 's a there 's an array of predictable problems which we are aware of there 's also the unpredictable problems it 's an All Hazards approach not let 's pick try and pick off those that we think the other one that these there was a lot of questions that I 've been getting from one is is the safety of chlorination in itself from a health perspective and from an infrastructure perspective there 's you know is there anything that we can say to actually allay those fears to people or is there actually some real risk that there is opposed if we do go down chlorination there is no health risk from chlorination quite the opposite the whole point of chlorination is to reduce health risk chlorination has been used more than 100 years worldwide chlorination takes place in most cities in New Zealand as we speak and has done for quite some time Christchurch is an unusual exception there are there is a theoretical risk which some people might be aware of of what they call disinfection by-products where chlorine has been shown in some very old papers to have reacted with the biomass in pipes and those byproducts can have have a health effect however those papers are old and the more recent papers have suggested that it is not chlorine in fact that is the risk there but it 's bromine part products which we obviously are not putting into the many substances that are monitored as part of the drinking water standards and therefore they are kept at a very very safe level anyway and we are alerted to them if they were to go up moreover John Mackey has proposed air scouring of the pipes in order that the biomass is reduced another way of absolutely minimizing those disinfection by-products so the answer is no there is not a health risk from chlorine and I suppose given that people are reading the newspapers today and have heard that chlorine has been used in Syria they might have difficulty understanding the difference between using chlorine as a chemical weapon using chlorine for the benefit of people obviously chlorine as it is used in drinking water is kept to a very very low level that just removes microbial contamination and the skill of the of the engineers is ensuring that they put in as little as they need to to just ensure that there 's enough chlorine in there to do the job that it 's required to do and it doesn 't have at those levels it comes nowhere of this it 's okay and it was just on the finance more changing and showing a little bit more on the finances and point six point seven and it says additional and this is to John an additional budget may be required for further improvements to the wellhead recommendation sorry the wellheads recommended and the latest wellhead security assessments can you just explain a little bit more just what that means and how much potentially more we might be liable for if we go down this program to get up to the drinking water standards as mentioned in there yes so that 's the gap I think we 've talked about before between what the independent engineers assistant needed to be done as against the eight hundred and forty thousand dollars in the program that city care had suggested so we haven 't got the final Phyllis what that gap is so there 's still some discussion to be had with the drinking water Assessor the the assessment engineers and our contractors as to what we agree would was the extra would need to be done over and above don 't anticipate that 's going to be significant but as we haven 't got the number just yet but we 're certainly in and so we will let budget specifically come well and this challenge we 've been tasked to to find this within existing maintenance of maintenance budget so it may mean that other things of lesser importance would be deferred okay I mean and that comes back to my initial point was where do we get to to the point where we may actually end up saying we 're actually we 've got enough of this done so we can actually turn the chlorination off but obviously it 'll come later all the way through the recommendations we 're making it crystal clear that this is for a temporary period that we want staff to be working hand in glove with the drinking water assessor to see if we can switch any of it back on without the chlorine if we can and so so we 're going through zone by zone that 's very challenging because as you can see from the maps the nature of and some very small zones and it may not be so straightforward but we 're challenged staff to do that at the same time that we 've challenged them to find the budget from within their existing provisions and does it appropriate for it to go to a tea or a zoo as a significance to come straight to Council no no it 'll go through a tea but it will come through it 'll come back to Council with a recommendation just thinking because of the the importance of this in the end of time frame that we 're talking about there 's a there 's always a delay between it going to a committee and in stress we can always bring it forward there are three council meetings a month yeah so aim David Tong in reassuring summary of the situation a question for you it 's my understanding that you you make the decision to listen to the chlorination what do you need to be satisfied to do that what what is what is what do you need to know and how will you know that it is what we will look for that has to come from the engineering and independent engineering assessment and a second question with John and staff I think a lot of people are worried that this is we 're heading down a slippery slope of permanent chlorination and can you give us reassurances that there is not a bet going to get them and how hell we know that it 's not going to even that 's not enough it 's like a gift unfortunately that because the other thing that 's in play here is what the government does with the system and recommendations from the inquiry the inquiry recommends to government that we mandate adequate treatment across all New Zealand and that we and we while we might fail to engage in that debate by saying because the special case or a special exemption that that would be the part I think I 'm hearing is the way that Christchurch might want to go a little power well one ta well if yes so but we don 't know what those what the government 's response to those recommendations 64,000 question I suppose will they have to legislate they 'd have to change the drinking water standard so it 's they wouldn 't require legislation or necessarily sorry it might come under regulations rather than a change in statute I don 't know depends on I think it would be most unfortunate if the government didn 't allow for public engagement and that conversation but I 've heard them talking about transparency so maybe that would be included right David 's tomb and Erin thank you 103 wells that need to be remedied and obviously it 's our objective to do that as quickly as possible the seven that have been remedied today what was the process to select those seven and do they reflect well it 's that we 're a greater risk where we going and going forward with the repair program are you identifying wellheads that propose a a potential greater threat to do those first yes there was a an assessment done on the on the criticality of the well heads that were selected first the ones and the main pumps which hadn 't been had in July so quite severe flooding of contaminated stormwater and that posed a great risk and of course the the the schedule was prepared in consultation with them our own technical people in the drinking water Assessor and the contractor start that done in the order of the most important though the remaining ninety six that we have to to deal with there any that of severity that we have already done well have we dealt with the absolute worst already or how many more at that high end of exposure to risk would we have to deal with yeah that 's difficult to know the detail we 'll just name them in here they what they might entail would have to would I could come back to the 80 and say well this is the amount of work and the rest say I think in the one of the reports from City care there is a a a costing with against each of the well hits and you detect by inference that the greater the cost the more work that needs to be done so that 's on you um John first question I got I got two questions so I want to have too much time first Christians within late January now it 's going to take 60 days to implement the chlorine if we go that way so we 're looking at a free expediate to the program somewhere hopefully in october but it may be December but it could be longer but so we 're looking around seventy nine months hopefully that we would have to chlorinate taking in the sixty days to sit up at cetera what 's regards to that could and I know Allister you mentioned that we can 't really rely on it being a flood event if that would be the contamination that could be a blown sewer or something along those lines but if we were to sit up at the chlorination would it be possible to set that up to implement it because I 'm not an engineer I don 't know how you do that to implement in the event of something coming towards Isis and if we got a few days or a week of a implement it straight away within the sick following the 60 days I 'm just trying to see are we able to cut down the time that we think we chlorinate if we go that way would it would make a lot of sense to try and roll this out within within within the two months we 've talked about in discussions with City care at their response after the earthquakes there 's six to eight weeks to deploy the chlorination and and I expect that would be the the best way and we 'd started all that once we would go far away be the best way of deploying the chlorine which gives during that 60 days you could do quite a bit of lanes cleaning as well to reduce the impact so it 's a rather staggering at our suggest that we do amazing programs in parallel with establishment of of these 56 different dynamic locations that require skid mounted chlorination equipment located at each one of those sites so with the chlorine do you sit it all up and then dinner it starts too much Sun or do up to be able to implement immediately if there were an event hitman or an event to the Troubles who don 't know when that event might be so ground water intrusion for its for example there 'd be no weather event associated with that perhaps so well and I don 't know that that would meet the requirements but what the securing the poor heads would that save from a contamination from serve leak the would I came through through their negatives okay okay peace the second question is with and I don 't_''_3717.97 I wouldn 't want to wait council staff down on a report or a review of we 've really been and here we 've got here until it 's the concentration should be on expediate in what we 're doing and looking at it later on but uh I think that following all this to have a review for a post event report on how we 've got them what 's happened would be really important but to the count support council I 've got a recommendation that through that as he committee it so look at a review of the inspection regime for the monitoring assessment at below ground well here it 's undertaken prior to June 2017 and since because I think what we need to understand as counselors and that 's why don 't I don 't just by that it 's the standards have changed what were the previous standards good enough and was and was the not not the results of the inquiry but the events of August 2016 were they sufficient to be the wake-up call that actually the country needed I totally understand and I tell you respect that guy the chair of the Audit Committee killing beckoned reporting to full council but this is of such significance to the city I 'm not a member of the Audit Committee I 'm not I mean you can go to oh yeah I can yeah what I think that it should that the review should come to full council well but it should become why do I get council staff to do two things when they can just come back to full council because they can come back through of the some of the issues that they want further clarification on before it comes back to count so I mean it is important to have the specialist committee that actually has the that the detailed knowledge and has the ongoing oversight responsibilities for this program of work so I mean it 's not unusual for it to go through a committee first but the full report will come to council I totally realize that and understand it yeah thickness of such significance that you know this but but please do go and in every counselor can go to individual committee meetings and I would encourage that perhaps when you get to that one pauline it might be worthwhile holding it as a separate meeting and as a specific item of the agenda the issues that have been considered here so I guess in that case will non members of the Audit Committee get a chance to speak and be part that discussion because I think we do that by invite Bob G and I totally respect it as well but again I 'm saying that this is such a a it 's a question I need the chip it 's down to each chair but but generally speaking people have the right to speak but not to vote that 's the only difference generally speaking oh yeah that 's such a significant issue I think I understand this completely the conference is about to wind jammie jammie-jammie the conference is about to end well you can telecom though no Jamie oh you know one joke that you don 't waken thank you yeah oh don 't cry Beckham okay I don 't know have you emailed the resolutions to Jamie I 'm sure that you do look yeah I think we 're still working on another recommendation to go its height so the end there now right okay so we 've got I just think we should continue and get this done rather than break for morning tea do we have a legal requirement to break for a particular after okay okay all right I 'm Erin I 'll go to you yeah I just have a couple of follow-ons but we I may have to depart the room not chlorinated you in a preload just in case anyone have a decision enter my body 's never seen so much water it 's normally a different color now my two questions that have arisen through the question processes you mentioned beacon in before which post one of the greatest risks this one 's been especially around that flooding we met flooding had been happened the last one not just the one but and was that then tested and were there any transgressions when we had the flooding event at that well he had given it was one of the worst yeah there 'll be no transgressions at all right and that was just confirming one of the worst and head floating all around yeah cool that 's a good start and then the other one is what assurances can we give the public that once the schedule of works the accelerated scheduler works is completed and these are been finished to the standard that you 're expecting what insurance is can we give the public that the engineers and then the water assess of wolf sign off and say chlorine the engineers have confirmed that once we have implemented their recommendations they will sign off the whales as secure but that 's good and then the other one is the water Assessor himself so we were as long as we had round water is secure they there then that the supply would be compliant with the drinking water standards so that would be signed off as well immediately Sarah then Mike thank you I 'm just wondering if farmers China we 've had concerns over the previous monitoring but the other thing many comments by members of the public who want reassurance that the the governance response has been appropriate and I 'm just wondering if part of the reporting that comes back should include that as well with the delays and all sorts of things you 've been quite a lot of questions around that we never would have had major things happen there the fire response those kind of things we 've had some form of reporting and I know that 's been through the civil defense but whether that should happen as well to reassure people it can you go back up so that report at the moment talks about the assessments but not the other sort of the other governance processes and reporting and and all those kind of structures that may have a large Beauty erection for example no no because that deals with the technical not the process so it looks at the review of the inspection regime and the monitoring and assessment but not that reporting structure for those types of things to counsel in this instance we 've covered thereby strengthening and reporting through division and I think they don 't know a report so that we can learn from what has happened potentially in the way of researching so there were things that ITN doesn 't know examples process and there are there have been questions about the delay in our response and having a a review just to look at that very I there was an assumption that there 's been a delay in the response council this is the first council meeting of the year so there hasn 't been a delay in our response you know and thing that I want to do is to take people 's minds off the fact that we need to get this work done so that we can if we implement temporary chlorination that we can get it out of our water as quickly as possible it 's that 's my priority so I 'm to reassure people that there hasn 't been a delay then it would be really good but there have been questions and it would be this is the first council meeting of the year there is no delay this is the first opportunity this council has had to react to it the council staff have had delegation on this matter they relinquish that this week so this is the first time this council could deal with the matter so I just kind of want to put that to be there is no delay that has caused any risk to our communities that is any greater than any risk that they have ever faced in relation to our water so I just think that it 's a side issue but it is an issue that that that stage in the reasonably near future but not through a reporting mechanism to a committee so and that is something that we can address on a on a different occasion so I 've got Mike next thank you my questions that were actually around what Tim was talking about that the 60 days for a nation after the earthquakes how long to take to actually once that decision was made to chlorinate how long did it take weeks six to eight weeks so so you 're sort of saying before that you 're gonna wait to everything set up and then do all the floor nation at once is that so that indicated really the risk isn 't that high that you 're not putting in mine as soon as you possibly okay as soon as possible we have to purchase the equipment from what I took from your last answer there was Jewish gonna sit everything up instead of doing the machine to get one online and start dosing it straight away you 'll wait till everything 's ready to go and then dose it all over the hash we start timing that over different parts of the city that Florida because of integrated way and their work arrangement we want us to tell people 's a given date this is to date so they can plan for things there are people who are going to have to make other provisions people on dialysis people with tropical fish people who rely on chlorinated water for there might be food manufacturing so we 've got to be clear that we 've got to give them a precise date otherwise they could be reaching from one zone to another so when someone gets chlorine when they didn 't think through eternity we don 't want to have that situation so chlorine and the waters gonna put another risk for some people it will it 's bad information about informing people I mean people on dialysis use chlorinated water all over the country country it just needs to be deep dechlorinator for that purpose same with tropical fish so we know that at the moment that the risk hasn 't changed we 're just obviously aware there 's an issue but there could say is this is where the water is that it 's been the same as it always has been if you 're concerned bore your water only people choose what they want to do to actually make the order there are lots of places secure status yeah that that is not an appropriate and responsible position for a supplier to take to rely on a boil water notice the a boil water notice is an emergency provision that has a limited value it was remarkable that after the earthquake the people of Christchurch continued to boil their water for up to it was was up to the point at which the water became chlorinated and we knew that because we carried out telephone surveys the reason it was remarkable is because all the evidence suggests from all over the world that boil water notices have little value after the first few days people boil their water rigorously at first and one day they don 't do it nothing happens they feel they 're okay they then don 't boil their water then the problem happens so boil water notices that although our our waters and zones those zones aren 't isolated they can the network 's integrated isn 't it all joined job that they can 't give you operated in different configurations so if if we did have an outbreak in one zone could that be control to that one zone or what a filter through to the whole of the network normally if there is any transmission and as Ellis to see this general yet that reservoirs we do chlorinate in that given zone and we try to isolate as much as we can to stop the spread of any contamination beyond at the immediate vicinity and that 's the same within the city is asking staff to put the zone picture up there because I think people need to see the size of the zones that we 're talking about when we quite rightly are trying to look to isolate zone by zone but when you look at the central pressure zone then it is most of Christchurch there was the ability to isolate pictures of that it 's just that that whole zone now is starting to do that honors on a case-by-case basis where it can be done but you 've also said that there 's a potential around leeching as well between zones so there was someone else Glenn yeah thank you just one question on the regulatory timeframe have you got any sense of in terms of government you know coming out of stage to win any regulation hips maybe your government early days so are you thinking maybe later in this calendar year yeah well certain my mind my advice from from the inquiry is that there could be a report that 's gone to leave that the DG has gone to the department internal affairs as well and enter the ministers who call for it and they 're there they 're there is staff advice advisor advice being prepared for for government to consider and I believe all that advice will be in with government by June this year so what happens after that there 'll be another process to lead the consideration around what the responses right I had no sense of how long things take through through the a regulatory measure would not go through Parliament that 's guy that 's my concern it 's why I ask the question about whether it was statutory or regulatory okay it 's a it 's a question for the executive for drinking water statements there 's a provision under health aid this is going to mean the drinking water standards he needs to be consultation for at least three years because I I don 't know about the central government so the cabinet would make the decision yep so anymore Yanni but I just wanted to check on on the repair program I note that in the city care report that says that the repair program would not address the surge getting into the water system as the flooding in July last year so in terms of the repair program I just wanted to understand are we looking I know we want to get this done as soon as possible I understand that that for areas that are susceptible to flooding in terms of raising the the station outer ground like the Burnside Park one are we looking or do secure the ones that you know we may consider that it 's more beneficial long-term who makes that call the recommendation is to repair the below ground well here 's a live look that the the program to bring them all above ground we 're better off to wait to end a beautiful life because once once they 're repaired to a waterproof standard one one can argue that there are as good as and above well if as far as ingress of surface water is concerned and we 're talking about some fairly high tech ceilings here that are quite effective we can you know we can decide through the LTP process that the city wants to bring all of the the world below ground worlds above ground and that would be a consideration that the council would make at the LTP capital program review so well it is all possible but these wells deliverables they have an an average life of 50 to 60 years and you will it be walking away from that investment if you did it early so there 's an economic argument here as that we have keep them in a good pipe operative condition and reduce the risk of ingress of surface water and I think we then when we replace those wells at the end of their useful life we then replace that with an abrupt ground structure that was very precise just just a quote from the city care report the residual risk which will remain following completion of the repair works include chamber onion Dacians require then design rainfall events River waterway flooding so what I can 't understand is given that and we also told that in the July event that we got the river water onion dead at a number of well heads contaminated them with Seward wastewater which had been washed in vast surcharge surged networks pump stations so why wouldn 't we raise those ones at least above ground so do two things here there 's raising the the Chamber 's rather than the well here the bracelet well hit above ground means a new annual which is I don 't matter dealer so it 's just about putting on extra rises on the chain so doing their city wide flood want me to determine what those flavors are so the ones that got will surge in them in July last year the repair program that we 're being asked to approve is going to stop sewage getting into them absolutely gonna reduce the risk of that contamination occurring absolutely what do we need to actually stop up from there oh it 's all about investment so but the city care report says that if we go with the repair that they 're proposing it won 't stop that from happening in extreme events we 've heard over and over that the flooding along the hiss get over for example there 's no longer considered extreme that it happens on a regular basis so I mean I just I just worried that there may be cases where we actually want additional investment and I know it will cost more but to actually address that what does seem a very real risk that we 've actually I know it may not be recorded as a transgression but I would have thought from a health point of view to people so these things can be can be work can be waterproof entirely and that 's something we can come back with the regular monthly TV boards to give you progress on those and give you that assurance that that method of contamination won 't occur on these and penalties can I just ask the medical officer health and those July flood events there was no boil water notice issued and and so even though the sewage got into the the water supply it was no no no no what sewers have not good xiety because we do make statements that are possibly inaccurate keeping creates our nutrition that something that [Music] sorry that I 'll just I 'll quite the thing so it 's totally accurate during the rainfall event of 22 22nd July river water and indebted a number of well heads contaminating them with sewage waste water which had been washed in via surcharge surge network pump stations so it didn 't go into the water supply I yeah so so the issue was that it got into the wellhead but it didn 't get into nothing get in there that now has some pumps that pump it straight out again and secretly it has an alarm that goes to a scatter a system and there 's people on standby and get that alarm immediately with a 60 minute response time so those medications are there what provides the confidence that that is not a risk so we but we would know would we know within 24 hours whether it had been contaminated no of them within an hour right because there 's some pumps going to do its job and the wit floor alarm is gonna trigger and so while the sump pumps start off the the person on Paul has got the alarm and tell him to go out right away so just understanding in terms of a risk point of you if we know it within an hour what 's so uh so and then go and and chlorinating given that we know something 's happened versus what we 're being told now is that we should just chlorinate less than it one mechanism though counsel there 's other mechanisms that we might here 's a two-minute break before debate please because I don 't listen either debates and I need to leave [Music] sorry I didn 't turn my microphone on Jamie have you got any questions I just like to come to you now thanks actually heard tolling of Yanni 's questioning and it may have been along the same line some started it but the apology business has been covered but it 's really just around the role versus deployment so I just want to be clear on it is it 60 days to build and put in place for some temporary infrastructures chlorinate the water supply I mean another six to eight weeks to deploy the chlorine into the supply or from the chlorination redeployed reasonably rapidly I heard an Italian what it sounded like a matter of hours this is the event okay okay so the 60 days is the entire deployment from the city but then it 's chlorinated immediately once the 60 days is that but I think you might have missed the questioning Jamie that said that the reason for choosing the one day for like people who are using dialysis or filling a tropical fish tank or producing beer or they need to they need to be able to dechlorinate they need to know what data is going to apply from rather than just a rollout across the city they need a date oh yeah no deadest else when I guess the thing really comes down to an airtight arrest and them from the from a medical standpoint that may be an unacceptable risk but it follows on I guess of what Tim was questioning was with the mythical officer of health be comfortable with us putting in place the infrastructure and then in the event is there there was heavy rainfall or was something that we think would heighten the verse 60 termination of a water supply to being deployed chlorination or is there just too many variables there into the garage to take with it the answer is there 's just too many variables and too big a risk to take with that thank you very much thank you all right well look we 'll just a June for five minutes well you _"

    "text": "and now we move on to public participation and the public forum and I 've been advised that flip-out Christchurch Andrew Moss would like to come and speak to the council good morning thank you very much for inviting me to come and talk to the to the council today I have a presentation which I 'm going to go through very very quickly it 's a two-part thing it 's to a background of what what flip-out actually is and then there 's an issue that I have with some flooding that I 'd like to to bring up with you as well isn 't Bromley it 's been open for about a year and a half now and it 's quite a bit of successful adventure for for the east side of Christchurch I 'll just look through some of these I know you have these already on on your iPad so you could you look at we have a mission and there 's our are the things that we want to have in the mission here 's the facility itself 1,700 square metres facility it has a and we also have supporting things like cafes and on-site Wi-Fi we have 65 on-site carpark spots as well last year we had about 75,000 visitors we have employed 12 staff and we 're moving towards making this a venue for entertainment in a broader sense not just as a trampoline arena so we have live bands of play there break dancing circus performance that 's those stuff as well now this is quick view of the inside of the facility if you haven 't been there already I do recommend you can just even come and have a look it 's it 's it 's very visually impressive and here 's some of the investments that we have put into the facility is about 1.3 million dollars in the fit-out now the the building itself was about seven million dollars of remediation after the earthquake we have about a two hundred fifty seven sixty five thousand dollar payroll per year it 's been a three-year project for me so far and we 're on an eight-year lease we involve a lot of community groups school groups and other groups expand what we 're doing to keep it interesting for everyone we have we have activities for all ages all abilities as you can see here we have kids from one years old this boys just starting to learn to walk and we have quite a quite high end people as well in their special programs we do offer a lot of courses classes activities for again a wide range of people one of the next things that we 're going to incorporate into flip out is is technology it flipped out and that 's really bringing technology into the the environment so things like the Internet of Things will be put into flip-out to make it more stimulating for the people that are actually doing the physical activity we 're looking at some image capture technologies as well and some VR technologies as well so over the next few years we have some good plans to bring that sort of technology into setup we are the community citizen we do a lot of outreach programs with festivals that the City Council organizes we go to schools bring air tracks these activities we do host club set flip out parkour clubs slackline clubs martial arts and breakdancing clubs all a resident at flip out this is the the event that I 'd like to bring up with you today and it 's to do with flooding on air on the rain events we do have it is particularly busy for us obviously not too many people want to go to the beach or the pool or other places and so generally flip-out becomes extremely busy during the rain events on a rainy day we can have up to about a thousand people come through the facility in one day and unfortunately right now we have surface flooding that happens last year we had eight days of surface flooding this is a surface landing that goes right way across the road it floods half of our property and and makes the the operation next to impossible to run half of our car park gets flooded which means those 65 car park spots very relevant because when we 're busy we need those car park spots and they 're flooded there 's no cycle pedestrian or accessible access to the facility when it 's flooded we have had loss of property flooded cars you know cars that have been parked in the in the flooded area and they 've been damaged I suppose it 's very dangerous and after that there 's a huge cleanup exercise that we have to do after the event happens all of our garden beds are all woodchips so of course when the flood happens all the widgets get lifted up and then get spread around the neighborhood this is a photograph of the actual event you can see in the in the center up there 's a cyclist who wants to come to flip out there 's no way that they can get there we have to move all the cars from our parking lot where they 're parked and when the people walk back from the cars of course it 's raining and they 're getting soaked and they 're not very very happy at all the impact on a business now we 're getting to the point where people are phoning us up when if the roads flooded none on coming and that 's totally unacceptable of course I 've talked a little bit about this already we have a high risk of flooding you can see in the in the first photograph there that 's the tide line where it 's coming up to our building we have a 60,000 foam pit there 's just on the other side of that door if the if the foam pit gets wet we 'll have to replace the foam in there and that 's a very big risk very concerned for us of course if there is flooding inside we will have to close the business for that day do clean up and that 's a huge impact on our revenue of course so I 'd like to you know actually I think the actually was required is allocate some funds and resources to scrape this problem it 's been seven years where this problem has been existing in this in this area we have brought this up to Council last year there 's been no action they have the council has put pumps but had one day where they they 've pumped this water into the storm sewer I 'm sorry into the into the waste water sewer and that was reasonably effective we 've got rid of the water after about an hour and a half all the other activities have not done any the water stays there for seven or eight hours obviously the kids safety is at stake and flip-out I think has met all those obligations as far as the resource consent being part of the community adding a lot to the community and we think we 've gone well beyond what we what we the requirement so we need we need to get infrastructure to run this business so it 's the bottom line and right now as you can see it 's it 's hindering us doing business in Bromley that 's all I have for today so I please if you have any questions please let me know sorry Jamie these are not the best ways to raise these issues with the council because you get five minutes and I 've allowed you obviously quite a lot my proposal is that we refer this to the land drainage recovery program we can group which Paul in cottage cheese she also chairs the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee I know that this piece of work is on the work program but I 'll ask them to respond to you to reach Lee if that 's okay with you it 's just a concern of mine because we need some action yeah yeah and and appreciate you I mean it as a channel that 's available to you so thank you very much for coming thank you right the next item on the agenda is no I don 't need a resolution we can just make that happen and we 'll come back to council from the land drainage group how do we get progress on this it 's been a journey Yani don 't do that the next person is Lundy Howard end of life choice Christchurch regarding the end of life choice bill okay can you hear me because I speak quite quietly and okay so in the 70s and 80s I lived in Nelson and was section council so a lot of our native for us and now there because we had stalls and we ran a huge petition the merrier declaration which was the biggest ever in New Zealand at the time okay so six years ago I moved down to Christchurch and now I found myself again in a bit of an activist role I 'm secretary of the end of life choice group in Christchurch as you you 'll know David Seymour 's bills just gone through the first reading in Parliament and is referred to justice as select committee with deadline for submissions on the 20th of February so we intend to run a few information stores between now and that date as part of a democratic process we know that 75% of people support this legislation in the polls but they don 't necessarily realize it 's important to put in submissions so unfortunately it seems virtually impossible to find anywhere in Christchurch where you can legally hold an interactive information store especially one that 's deemed political as we are so we 've farmers markets malls don 't seem to do sometimes see charities but it 's very rare to ever see any sort of activist type of store the return put up information in libraries and community centers there now so inundated with information that they it 's impossible to guarantee that we can ever get anything in there you can 't just go into a library anymore and ask them to put up information it 's all centralized and has to be distributed and then if don 't have the space they just don 't put it up so the council website invites applications for permits or consents for amusement devices mobile shops street performers hawkers and retail stores as well as a one-hour speaking slot and Cathedral Square you do sometimes see information stalls of a political nature at our rare rallies like the TPPA one or climate change that those aren 't this isn 't what we seek what I 'm asking is where are the outlets for interactive promotion of ideas ideals questioning around issues of social importance and encouragement of public debate there seems to be such a fear of upsetting people if they everyone has to be allowed to promote their own particular views and I recognize that means people that don 't agree with me please don 't say Facebook you know we 're not all into social media and I think it especially older generations by not having these outlets freedom of speech is limited and we depend increasingly on trying to force media interest in order to get coverage with the risk of bias of any non conformist ideas I 'm talking freedom of speech democracy versus PC and dislike of any messy controversy I do believe that it is the council 's obligation to facilitate or enable that process of allowing the unimpeded right to inform and be informed my recommendation is that there could be a few central spots made available around our city which would be suitable for stores where the aim is to disseminate information around a campaign make a protest ideally they would be sites with consistent local foot traffic so not tourist centers I don 't actually believe the Cathedral Square is appropriate for this purpose and covered and with easy car access or of my thoughts was possibly outside libraries well thank you very much and this was my suggestion that you you come and make the presentation because I think and and making it and the public you 've also highlighted the issue which does need debate and obviously there are questions and answers and I totally understand your point around engagement I mean you can get engagement across social media but as you say not that 's not for everyone so it 's an opportunity to actually have a conversation we see a lot of groups in different places in the city in terms of stalls and things like that there are options that are available and libraries are certainly do engage and some of these tough issues from time to time as well so what I 'm going to do is I 'm just going to ask the head of the chief executives office to to go with you and to talk through some of those options and and and then if there are still some gaps and things like that we can we can have another conversation about that the council and and obviously that is something that we might get one of the the committees to look at as well but I think there are options available to you that perhaps you 're not aware of and that will help get kickstart the process I did actually speak to a member of Casca because I happen to know him and he said they done the same problem anyway yes okay that 's great all right thank you very much no deputations by appointment no presentation of petitions so we 'll move _"

my my invitation to join came from Michael Bloomberg a little bit long ago but threads it 's I did say no need to turn I did say at the time there I didn 't really want to sign up to a compact or or a covenant and this we were and this that was actually gonna be done you know like I there 's no point just saying you 're gonna do something there 's no point signing something and having a big signing ceremony you know we do that all the time and other portfolios and but I really wanted us to sign up to this because we we meant it and we were going to measure it and we were going to torch yes oh so and you guys have worked so hard on this and I 'm sorry for being flippant about the time but you know I 'd much rather work and then the basically the tools for how we then deliver you must be very proud of what you 've done so I 'm certainly gonna take great pleasure and signing up so so Yanni moved it seconded by Dion oh no no I 'm gonna let Sara 's second sorry no I apologized dejan ver Sierra 's I know you did but no I 'm gonna let Sara Sikandar oh I 'll find something for you to mobile second will give you something else you give you will give you will give you a 44 thousand dollar grant from the creative industry support fund to the boom room okay quite important and I like Gordon like I look this this joins us with us there were seven and a half thousand yeah yes know who makes no odds but but Kevin and Helen will tell you that getting to cabin neutrality or net cabin neutrality by 2050 which is what we 're signing up to get effectively work to get to is a huge task so two and a half million tons of carbon and I mean at Nick carbon neutral by 2030 and then the city as a whole working through a framework to get there by 2050 so this is not a big step from where we got last time but it it is going to be a huge effort and actually it 's going to mean all of us have to make a huge effort not just the ones sitting around this table but everyone but it does mean that we need certainty clarity and very clear policy and actions from the entire city I think it 's actually incredibly exciting I can 't think of a bigger challenge for any city and if the cities do it then the world will be okay because if you look at the map of where these all are every one of these cities is under threat it 's just how it how it is it is their biggest threat yeah and their biggest opportunity yeah Mike and then Yanni Thanks I 'd like to thank Amir on her leadership it starts around climate change and I 'm very supportive you sign in the global covering up mirrors of over 7,000 cities committed to working together what we know is 75% of global emissions come from cities and if climate change is going to be addressed cities are key no matter how big or small it all adds up it 's fair to say that carbon neutrality is tough and collaboration amongst the cities is key but one thing I just want to add is it 's really easy to speak and it 's really easy to sign covenants and alliances and programs but the end of the day words aren 't gonna get us anywhere and what is needed is action and we 're at at a point in time where it 's almost getting too late for that action but we 're not quite there so what I really want to see and as a city you know we 've said some really good targets but what we now need to see is actually action to achieve those targets yep Jonnie I was a counselor who was involved with the development of the climate smart strategy set on that hearings panel and heard the number of 'm reminded that we weren 't allowed to call it a climate change strategy because we may offend the government so it was called a climate smart strategy it 's really really not very smart because change is coming and we do have I think a responsibility to address it so I 'm really supportive of this I totally concur we 've signed so many MO use of things like electric vehicles in the past where we haven 't seen action but I think you know four years ago with the new council coming in we 've had a lot of work but we 're trying to get the pros as the city to what I think is a much more sustainable approach to dealing with our environment which I wholeheartedly applaud so that 's why I was just really happy to move this and I concur that this is the start or the sorry this isn 't the end of work this is actually just a step along a big journey but it is important that we commit to it I would just make reference to one of the which is really good that we were proposing to remove was a council energy policy in relation to our social housing and you know there are things that we can do locally that will make it they might seem small but they actually make the difference when they let it up and so that 's why I think you know when we look at things like policies we should have some understanding of what the choices are around where we put our priorities and our resources but very happy to support this well I 'm really looking forward to joking and I 'm an all sort of kind of flippancy aside I do tell people that my favorite booker 's of me has ruled the world and it is it 's an important reminder that is at the city level that the difference is made it 's not at the nation-state level you know you just can 't stand at a border and keep out global terrorism and keeper pandemics and you can 't change the effects of climate change either you need at the cities to sign up and that they were no longer part of the Paris Accord the cities stood up and said we 're count us on where we 're going to be there and that 's what we need and I want to be part of that Network I want Christchurch to be a part of that network as our other cities in New Zealand and as if people have said I think this takes us to 4409 no 4999 I think we have one off no four thousand seven thousand four hundred and ninety nine so we went off 7500 so it might wait just for one more City to sign up so that we can be number 7500 but no it 's just I think that 's going to be good for the city and but yeah everyone who said that this is about action that that starts well we 've already started the action but we have to deliver

    "text": "benign okay yep yep all right so Phil would you like to introduce us okay um look a lot of work has gone into this report on the DC 's rebate for social housing basically and the staff will speak to it the committee are now reacting Council to agree to the development contributions rebate scheme that for social housing developments so that in fact that 's also and that there 's a clear policy in the staff will explain the evidence in the report around councils development contribution policy and this part on social housing fits quite nicely there are two other parts and to the recommendations to one was to ask staff to investigate options for housing Plus which is an organisation as a joint social housing venture between the Beckenham Housing Trust and Methodist Mission and the other one is a venture which not know how far national Moriah are establishing to so separate we 're really asking the staff to do some citrus of investigation around those two projects otherwise the risk of the paper is relation to the DC policy all right so you 'd questions oh sorry okay Jamie brief Sarah um love the thrust of what we 're trying to achieve here with the outcome but my question is around staff justified I guess the DC rebate scheme in the inner city one for the fair pit we 've got a green frame a lower height less people thus the infrastructure was open there and the secret city and then trying to create an incentive promote an outcome actually made financial sense also increase the capital value as a result so our rate tape goes up can you help just with expanding on the pros and cons there about how this isn 't dangerous and as far as Preston City closed because punishment the ideas of Genesis for this proposal was the damage or loss to the social housing stock suffered post earthquake and a direction the previous government was taking towards more third sector provision of social housing so that really has been to encourage that third sector provision and to get our total stock back to where it was the your comment about the rape tape increasing ISM correct we the spread the required rate across a wider capital value so it does have a slight beneficial effect for existing ratepayers but yeah just made into what Kevin said that the beneficial impact of this is also Amboy Lodge and non-financial so it 's ultimately metaphor Council to decide on but if you want social housing and if you want more of it then equally if you want an affordable housing where issue and previously it exploded with syndra City developments one of the levers that we do have is he says in applying a DC rebate is pulling one of those leaders it 's very health when just as a supplementary you comfortable around the president sort of side of it that city mission for its are poor a homeless shelters gonna be paying DC 's are we comfortable that this is that the line is right and it 's not a dangerous precedent I suppose we had a similar debate with the establishment of the central city de savory bites and prepare to save us some apprehension then that would be exhausted very rapidly in the reality is that of the time frames in the Central City rebates well well it 's not a fan per se aunt exhausted so it depends on the value that you want to ascribe to social Endora fordable housing what I was gonna ask but actually thinking about is there any reason this can 't just tap into the current plan that we 've got because we do have funds left on that I guess that 's possible but I think you need to be aware that the it 's difficult to explain but the DC rebate for both for the central city and for this operates well within the margin of error for the total DC revenue and so it really doesn 't impact on rates per se it just adjusts some of the debt and a repayment timeframe for that debt that we have on the gross infrastructure so it 's not a hard-and-fast amount that we were budget it would be of cattle was volition or if you wanted to review the other rebate schemes given that they have been in existence for some time and aunt exhausted I 'm are but they 're not exhausted and these certainly more funding and those rebate schemes not yet allocated them in what 's proposed for here I think there 's still five million left on the central city okay thanks for me thank you I 'm looking at 6.13 in the potential cost serious one in Croesus wise or the implications for the LTP and Draft LTP are currently so does that I mean I completely support the intent of us absolutely but does a formal decision council decision on this today mean that the proposed 1.5 million automatically goes into the draft LTP and we need to find particularly something else to come out so do my best to explain is guaranteed what 's a complicated ratio Murray and DC so the worst-case financial situation as articulated here yeah materially so if the in what we 're talking about is as rebaiting so effectively foregoing revenue yeah which is the last two years we 've received we have 40 million dollars worth of revenue per annum for DC so as given size this is kind of still within the margin anticipated and forecast it 's difficult forecasting DC revenues because it 's subject to the development secure and equally on the expenditure side and if we were to spend 1.5 million dollars in the next financial year then the impact of the cost of borrowing would be a point zero two of a percent and the I 'm not expecting and that all of this money would be rebated in the first year I expect that would be rebating over a period of time and might be over three or five years probably in all likelihood and then it 's a second order about which of the the capital projects that the DC 's are ascribed to a poor match to Ana sins go ahead and then winders that expenditure occur so all of those things washing out it 's unlikely to have a an impact in in the short term on the LTP and the impact Afeni is likely to be very small over the medium term so we wouldn 't have to budget anything afford us now it 's not a LTP issue to budget for this you we are if we know you 're anticipating that at some point in time because of developments and that you need to aid construct infrastructure and that the development contribution is designed to pay for yeah yeah given that the entire playing field of social housing is changing quite quickly in this country and is there any chance that we can claw back this money through any new government schemes or anything they 've flagged because it 's obviously there is a financial loss to the council it 's not really a cost and you 've explained that well but they must be putting up some funds to encourage so they don 't have to spend all the money in build all the social housing themselves you know putting a dollar gets even back tightening it 's not aware of any funding that is available but I 'm certainly agree that this counts ad this government rather is more likely to be amenable to setting up such a fund but at the moment there 's nothing available yeah yeah I understand the government don 't pay these things no no does housing New Zealand PADC yes yes they do so if it 's a government authority they do but if it 's a government department they don 't the crown is exempt right and there are gray areas around what is an isn 't the crown but housing New Zealand is definitely not the crown no I think it 's just about goombah your accelerative private but it doesn 't cover housing New Zealand cuz this isn 't it they 're not a chip it only covers chips yes yes ain 't done yes I think it might change I think we 'll have access to it could we specifically say there is for community housing providers then as part of the resolution because that 's a distinction agree agree to a development contributions rebate scheme for community housing providers with capital C h MP housing providers undertaking be clear well their community housing or should we cook are they registered the you know wonderful at the stage we should if whether we should actually be so specific because we 're asking for investigations for for example no AFR and be a quitter I would think but I just want to make sure that in fact and Trust which could you could do do you know the benefit from the skilling easier will they will teacher to qualify all right take out that undertaking take out community housing providers undertaking and put on the words after social housing developments is detailed in attachment 1 in excluding in excluding excluding housing New Zealand

    "text": "strategic capability central city regeneration tech lung barrier science project update I of course some chair this committee and but I shall gonna hand over sorry if you yeah I 'll hand over to you this is the report on the central city of regeneration tech Ling various sites update sorry I just couldn 't find the paper well we had a very good report on this and we 're recommending receiving the report and approving the continued use of the frame we can talk it to tackle buildings or sites that are barriers to the regeneration of the central city but so I 'm happy to move it yeah but yeah can I have a second right turn okay so brief yeah hi I just wanted to get an update on the two fat Indian site which we discussed previously not doing it and I 've sent an email to the owner there are three factors that contribute to that discussion and I look forward to catching up with them an end of January to further the discussion okay because oh yes I is the chief 13 units basically no reason that it 's still standing it 's also a page 505 Manchester Street okay and also I mean while I 'm here the these seem to be mainly commercial buildings are we looking at residential and I give an example actually of a place on Montreal Street just on the next block which is a kind of red building is it so so how we handle in residential sites so there and we addressed the development form on there but I 'll recap that for you and those properties do not currently represent a significant barrier to the regeneration of the Central City and mainly because those sites are generally fenced or here vegetation at the front and the buildings are back from the boundary however we encourage residents and yourselves to use our existing enforcement team to identify those and we will investigate them on a case-by-case basis every day and it looks pretty in poor condition okay Jonnie thank you um just wanted to check in terms of at the buildings that we have on the lust with pot 1 as within longer timeframe with commitment hold what why is that being put up higher than the other ones which are still awaiting decisions on future our city it 's in your heads so I mean just in terms of the public perception of the fact that we 've got our own buildings that we don 't have a commitment to do anything with at the moment it just seems to me a bit of an anomaly my colleagues and in their perks unit who charged with looking after being the custodians of the heritage assets for the city I believe that you have agreed a process with for them to lead around the the heritage assets across the city I also understand that um some of the decisions that you made around that whirring public excluded so um but it probably is about all that I should say on that matter right now I just don 't see how that building gets a higher for a higher we 're at the list compared to the other ones where intentions yet to be confirmed which we haven 't done yet the rest is identified in terms and those within a longer timeframe and we our intentions are yet to be confirmed yeah so and to that 's the priority of the list and within those categories there 's no identification of which ones okay so we could easily just put that end of intentions yet to be confirmed the other thing is I was just mindful that there 's a number of derelict sites in the suburbs which you briefly touch on I think the building inspectors are going to do some work over summer but some of us are really concerned that there 's some really key sites like the old scalar UPS item Alston which you know over summer you know the risk for vandalism graffiti fire arson you know is there anything we can do on the short-term around some of those really key sites that we 're aware of in terms of getting so it 's the Central City regeneration team the right people to answer this question it 's in the report six point seven no you guys aren 't the right people can we get someone that can if you to have that discussion about what we can and can 't do and I can take that out after this meeting with our forcement team to review all of the available tools to us to support them understand the options and opportunities are if these sites are not impinging on public space do something if they believe the building is dangerous or insanitary those are the only two conditions under the Building Act we can 't do it because they don 't look good or they 've got graffiti or they may be attacked by people who asked us those are the only tools that we have there 's in Sena Terry which is there there 's a rest and Penn Station or something or they 're actually dangerous and could fall on someone and kill them dangerous to neighbors but if they 're not deemed as that then there 's not much we 've talked about this previously yes but it 's all set out in six point seven and six point eight it makes it crystal clear that priority is assigned to surveying non residential commercial properties and to support the socio economic roles of centers so the only potential barrier sites outside the Central City area that building inspectors will begin to compile a catalogue of these privately owned prominent buildings fronting streets which are unoccupied baking etc sites building that involve the use of cordoned operator etc so you know you 're using this paper to ask a question that 's not relevant say why is it in here Pauline we are good Thank You Dion I just have one question and it was on the post office box building the old post office suddenly report me I 've lost the page it said that there are here we go extent of the fall zone is substantially reduced has it reflected on the actual the barrel holding yeah that 's the one it 's the holding room pulpit we have just been working with the engineers have been re-engaged by the owner and looking at all of the options for that site and we are going to keep the barriers where they are for the meantime until that is confirmed and signed off by the structural for that for that to recede and you call that really great because it 's in there and the other one was now talking about the square is the the tidiness of the cathedral there 's still conversations going on there yes we have allocated a staff member to work with the restoration trust on operational matters concerning and immunity actually we had my contact with the chair of the trust until such time is the trust is fully formed in the legislation is in place it 's not appropriate for him to be having the detail of discussions that we were proposing so I guess we 're facilitating the conversation to happen as soon as possible once that occurs yeah the bill shall pass today it 's um doing its committee stages at the moment so after question time they should be straight back onto it and then it should go straight into its third reading as they 're under agency I just um and but but but it needs to be signed by the Governor General for it to take effect so it may not be till the site needs tidying so bad yeah no it does absolutely all right I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carriage thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you for working so hard to get through so many items of the agenda this morning so let 's see if we can lift the pace River and to assist in these matters I 'm going to leave item 24 to lie on the table to the meeting of the 22nd of February and the reason that I 'm doing that is because there has been a director not a director a notice to come through from the Director General of Health in relation to the it 's a it 's a statement made under Section 69 triple ZC of the Health Act 1956 in ER tasks in particular Christ Church around the drinking water supply and the issue of non-treated drinking water so we need to get some legal advice on the nature of the notification and we 're not going to consider any matters relating to the three waters until we 've got that advice so we 'll move back to item 21 it just on item 24 there 's a whole part of other stuff and that item that the report can supply on the table that the whole opening or closure of wicket and Road I 'd like to find out that because it 's whether it wither and actually closes till April or closes it 's just the three waters and ways this is and the report there was work deals with the reckoning road as well so what I 'm sorry but the if we open it up then we 're going to debate the entire paper okay I 've got about 23 emails on the subject side we can can we take that offline and can Dave can you get Bucky the answer to her question okay thanks thank you so we 'll move back to the central city residential program I 'll come back to the development contributions rebate paper when we get to just before we get to the nerf if our national Moriah Charitable Trusts because the the two of them hand-in-glove so I 'll deal with the central city residential program paper first and it 's item 21 and Jamie Gough would you like to present this is it you is the development foundation it 's relatively self-explanatory take a issue-by-issue approach with withwith the forms there in the specific one was really geared around inner city residential I think we 're all pretty clear on what we want to achieve with respect to housing in the Central City and I think we 're all very clear that these probably hasn 't been the progress made that we would have liked fundamentally the feedback that we were getting from from the development community of the areas that the DC rates with DC rebate scheme works for them they find that it certainly assists those cost savings are passed on to the consumer so some of the stuff that would have started with a five now starts with a four and the stuff that would have started with a six starts with a five so that 's good it would benefit developers if there 's only one developer in the world but luckily there 's more than one so it 's open to anyone so that 's why it 's been effective though complimentary of that but I think we 're all very cognizant of the fact that there space there are limited levers that we can pull you know such as LV ours cost of land cost of construction all of that is outside of our control the development contributions one is inside our control so that was encouraging in the recommendations that you 'll see here and actually sorry I just need to put my annotations on me because I 've highlighted some of the differences in the alternate staff recommendation but things like the city maintenance and that 's what Suffolk cleanliness there I think has fallen well behind particularly if we want to really showcase the Christchurch central salient creative space to live so I think the additions that staff have made to the original recommendation I think is positive it notes that the the residential program is currently in development and intended to accelerate the delivery of Central City residential development there 's the only other additions that differ there are in to a and recommending interventions and tools to support housing delivery in the Central City totally agree with that be encouraging new and more diverse housing models very supportive there because it more of it 's also the ones underneath and it 's a whole spread that we needed for cities from a function parts to see enhance the central city living experience again that 's pretty straightforward and a site-specific and neighborhood scale enabling central city housing but I 'm sure that something good anyway I think that this is very much a work in progress the barrier sites has been one piece of work the development forum is done which has been encouraging its trending in the right direction there 's still a lot more work to do but to highlight a couple of those things there and we 're all aware that the land value and the Central City has been propped up artificially and that 's that 's discouraging because the developers obviously going to go where it 's financially attractive and well said helps with the development contributions rebate there 's probably still margin in greenfield developments in greenfield developments on the outskirts of the city aren 't going to help our rebuild so for Christchurch rebuild to work we 're going to need a central city to be residents and I 'm really heartened this council gets that we 're on the same page but I think our staff equally on the same page so this is the beginning of a new piece of work here and I think our first development forum meeting and I encourage it would come if you if you 'd like to that we really will try and focus on what those interventions are and what we can be doing we can 't below the levers because some are outside of our control but if we can indirectly affect them I think we should be keen to do that and the ones that we can directly affect we should most certainly be trying to pull those levers and the only other thing that I dared is they if you look at the attached port there 's the program aims and I 'll just quickly highlight those because it just really illustrates how our staff have done a magnificent job of identifying what the barriers are in what we need to be addressing that 's 20,000 people target inside the central city it with both arms and in doing everything that we can do in that space if we continue to do what we are currently doing we won 't get there so we need to do something differently and in my view that is one of the top priorities I think for this council if we 're going to be successful at seller eight residential delivery de-risk the development and the delivery of the diverse diverse housing stock so it 's across the board the demand has been there for the higher price departments but because it is not competitive enough at the lower end and with the factors that I mentioned LV ours cost stallion cost of construction we 're not getting it across the line so that 's the challenge and it 's a big one but staff get it you guys get it and and we 'll be tackling that with the development forum so I think there 's a pretty good set of recommendations there but happy to answer any questions and I 'm not sure if the team you want to speak to anything more than at all Casa birkoff has covered most things I think the only thing I 'd add related to 2a is that some intention to deal with a range of interventions and tools to support housing deliveries entirely in line with that the new housing minister 's tasted objectives in the area so yeah I think I found the development foreman credibly valuable one of the things that really struck me was the the the absolute confidence and the sell ability of residential developments inside the four avenues and and particularly within the Central City part of that an absolute belief that build them and they will come and you know it does need to be a range of price points but we 've been saying that all the way along and in every price point could be catered for everyone knows that this is what 's holding back the central study so people where I think this is a good time for me to say it but there are things that really do not help our situation the building they will come is indeed completely and we 're hearing that the viability is challenging even with the development contributions rebate so that helps but you still get to a price point where people just go you know what it 's not enough to get us over the line because it 's more attractive to do it elsewhere and that 's really challenging for us as a local authority because that 's not what we want people to say so you 've been 1.2 million dollars on a small town house and the CBD and by mention out and you know even heat for the same price you know it 's just yeah I mean that 's the challenge yes and you know lvr you know realists the banks are saying you have to have 80% pre-sales before you will get funding yeah so it 's very hard to get people across the line so a developer looks and goes way too hard and it 's the last thing that we want yeah so Jamie you 'd like to move this Beadle and my second buddy on the staff recommendation yeah it 's sorry I should have got to get better more of the discussion it 's just is this weak typo there I 'm not sure if that 's been picked up but it was just repeated around there five aims or something there was of that that strongly endorses that five that emergent yes right and there 's actually four items to i know take out the emerging aims just put no no no sorry take out the werid 5 yep thank you right Deon seconded Jonnie I just had three questions um it would appear to me that this is doing work that regenerate Christchurch was asked to do regards to the central city so why are we doing this work and not regenerate given that we 've funded them and put that into the letter of expansion so this work has is focused on not the planning end but the delivery end of the spectrum which i think is one of the key differences between the week that regenerate has has been asked to do and we 've also made a point of identifying that this is a piece of work for council to take a lead partnerships and alliances emerge here this is also 20,000 people is not just ambitious it 's somewhat audacious him so in 2050 is longer than the current life of regenerate Christchurch so we also need to have a mind to that longer term and who are likely to be the players who will still be around at that time realizes that I mean I see under 3b we 're asking them to review the central city plan why don 't we wait for no no progressing the requirement for regenerate Christchurch to immediately review the plan well lay it hasn 't happened we 've been waiting for a long time hang on look doc the our staff are not here to answer questions about what regenerate Christchurch as orison so the question is shouldn 't we wait till that 's happened which you know we thought was gonna have in a November it 's not gonna happen in January we 've been told before we agree to what what we do in response to it so that we 're not duplicating work we 're not duplicating work with due respect of focus it 's a it 's another signal to regenerate that you want this piece of work done and in I guess wrapped around the rest of the resolution in the program and signalling the support in partnership that was different from the advice we had a fire performer fellow and on a second my mentor was around social and affordable housing how is that being fed into this process so within the work areas the diversity of housing includes all forms of housing so we 're looking at not only social and affordable and market housing but also new housing models both from delivery and occupation so it will cross the whole housing spectrum which is being looked at through the the housing policy which we currently got yeah Phil and then Vicki I think you 've been reference to my question but really as how when we 've signed off the district plan and can you obtain some changes how we might go about I guess and improving the plan so in fact there 's more support for development of housing the central city I don 't the price of the land I mean if there are issues that it 's perceived to be planning barriers then there may be scope to progress that through a regeneration plan but all the advice we 're giving is actually the housing rules particularly the central city had pretty liberal and but are most things to happen okay not to be and just in relation to their coaching new and more diverse housing models that you just touched on then are we actually is that really a hitting thing or is it just a theoretical construct or how is it what do you want to elaborate onto a bit more these be emerging aims of the program but like Co housing and various other models like that as part of the program so that sort of detail is not worked through but it is an actual given we 've had Jason twill and others here more recently who have really ignited the whole conversation about alternative ways of delivering housing that 's been picked up not only by I think by council but by others within the development community and as we move forward and looking at ways that we can assist with there so it 's not all necessarily about incentives it may be around other other areas of support and we might be able to advocate particularly to to its theoretical construct moment okay thanks right so it 's been moved and seconded I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "and then moving on to item 23 Pauline do you want to introduce this one as well please so the main features of this is an on page three one nine six point two the two signalized cycling pedestrian crossings one on armor Street I guess it 's Cambridge over to Victoria Square and one on Colombo now these have been strategically placed on the desire lines and also the existing on street cycle lanes going along have been removed to provide wider footpaths and also to keep the cyclists away from the tram tracks is that proving to be quite an issue for cyclists and the note number two as the parking restriction subcommittee also approved the parking and stopping restrictions OSP five point six that meeting was held a couple of days after this one the allocation of parking has been determined in accordance with the council parking strategy which prioritizes mobility PT loading in shorts day parking in commercial areas one committee member voted against the plan solely because and it was Erin because he thought there was sufficient mobility parking but mobility parking actually turns out but as a result of that the et Committee has requested a workshop on mobility parking noting to the vanilla ice remains in place yay and also the other change it was the committee had a workshop on this which was fantastic without DiCaro and the we could have criticized the the square shape of some of the curving on Colombo Street the the concrete curbing so we suggested we didn 't want to repeat of one other area and Christchurch that we 're all familiar with so we requested the cubes be rounded an otaku oh we 're happy with that so that 's been altered so you 'll know that you 'll notice that they 've been rounded now and all the costs are meant by otaku but the optics is the City Council so I think those are the main points in the committee voted to support this project thank you are there questions on this item yawning yeah I emailed these three do we have a safety order on the design because it inherently looks quite dangerous for heavy vehicles turning I 'm particularly with increased we do have a safety audit we 've just recieved the safety audit the main axes to the convention center is Durham left and to our my armor bridge has been upgraded to class 144 turn right into the Convention Center and then through the conventions seem to lift out on to Colombo Street so that 's the main access through to the hip for heavy vehicles to them and Convention Center and we are aware that there probably needs some packets and gap and parking on the east side of Colombo Street where it exits just down from the hotel so just when you look at the Colombo Street armored intersection it 's very hard to see how you know buses and trucks will traverse that safely can they turn into the appropriate Lane without going on to the other lines and have you done it for the you know the big buses and the big trucks that would serve a significant incentive excuse service the Convention Center yeah okay and we can 't require them only to come and arm straight and past experience in this location has we 've just received the tracking from o to Cairo they tracked that with an 11 meter rigid track that has some issues looking at the tracking and the curb we received from the safety audit I look if the liver made of rigid has some issues we would actually have to ask them to run a larger vehicle around there and distinction well we 've only just received it yeah well how can we be approving something without absolutely and foremost a poster so we 've heard that you 've got a safety audit which has got no concerns but at the same time it sounds as though you do have concerns because of the information that you 've just provided length vehicle so it doesn 't include a big B train so what we have to do is just double check that the Convention Center is intending to be serviced only with vehicles up to their length it would appear that they have designed you know Takara have done the design they 're also designing the Convention Center so we just need to confirm that they aren 't listens from so necessary it really for us to get circulate the safety order if we were to defer a decision on this item until we 'd got that further piece of information what would be the implications of that be given that this is our last council meeting until the end of January yeah so it would cause delays as van services yes okay thank you adding there are no leave transfer they 're leaving liters so there are be trained so I 'll just make it very clear 11 meter is a rigid track the tracking that has been done not with only just received and with owners aware of it isn 't 11 meter rigid track so we 're talking about clam Bo Street right and their ticket to the Convention Center so we need to confirm the two coaches and the trucks coming down Colombo Street South right into our my Street there is no issue with them coming down and right into the convention so we need to confirm that and if we were just judge we could do tracking in that within half an so we can we legally prohibit them from using this intersection we can legally prohibit any vehicle from using any intersection we can do that but that 's not before you today so and then just the final question I had was the emergency services so have we got any written confirmation from emergency services about the design and their feedback said I to carry that when your kit questions came through Jonnie Oh to carry have stated re-emergence of service consultation for parking resolution resolution occurred reading as it says with chief fire officer crusher central fire station commander than New Zealand place our Stuart and the operations manager of st. John 's they happy were there okay thank you so now I 've got Mike Tim and Dion Mike got a couple of questions firstly I guess around process because obviously works currently been and to take it on this stretch of road what would happen if we said no to this resolution concern that workers you see mr. chair and through you the agreement was there 's a there 's a take a little minute to get of the city is that Sarah in the day was was delivering some projects and then council with its ASC was funding some when we talk about this particular project initially council were to fund Colombo and armor Street and odor carry were building the squid 's alluded to in the report that money was changed over to Sarah before it became Oh Takeru that was agreed on so they are delivering as part of the government side of thing so it 's really the government mandate that 's already been agreed they are delivering this project our role here or councils role is to prove the on-street restrictions as in controls and parking of that project of that delivery yeah it just seems that just doesn 't seem to be bright my opinion but because obviously it 's quite far down and so basically all we can do is approve these resolutions but because of the fact that it 's there it 's just that to me it does not work as good prices should work this does not work unless we should have been resolving these before the Square when it first started there was some issues with the redesign na correct me if I 'm wrong a Victoria Square working group was set up that was agreed to that it was refurbishment of the square not a redesign of the square now that that was agreed to we 're not in a we 're rebuilding a city we 're not in a normal process of in this case its government through their agency Sierra down to Oda carry delivering these projects in Christchurch it 's not it 's not normal process that normal prices but I would hope as we move forward we actually try and make the process work a bit better and quite frankly even if when you look at the street it 's gonna be closed for six months they said massive amount of time for actually a small stretch of road and we 're sitting across the city when we have a carro doing rating projects they 're taking too long and they 're making our city come to a standstill and I think it 's something we need to but a message questions mm-hmm and furthermore Colombo Street obviously was sort of signal as the cycling street are we looking at put in showers is this resolution actually allowed put sharrows down as part of Colombo Street so the yeah so that 's not include sure is not a shake it that doesn 't need to be a resolution to what Sheridan Street so Cheryl is not a control it 's not a so we 're a psycho symbol and a dedicated cycle lane gives the legal meaning to the cycle lane that a vehicle cannot interact that 's a control but ash arrow as in a shared Lane does not require resolution of council that was how the shara was approved nationally okay so therefore if we want to get a shower oh say from the start of the 30k point of Colombo Street right around to where the showers begin after here if it 's Street what do we need to do to get their selection through the chair government when they approve the National soil sharrows trial put out a draft sharrows got to the sharrows that states so should not be used in areas over 50k and then it depends on volumes and one of the things that is important with Colombo Street is that we maintain those lower volumes so a Sheriff would be a safe cycling emphasis would be safe slightly infrastructure last question end on page three to six of our ginger has a picture obviously of of the Colombo Street we 're the cycle and pedestrian crossing us and it 's offset to Oxford Terrace so I biked only quite frequently and as I go past there the actual crossing it 's not opposite it 's directly on the Oxford Terrace I 'm just trying to work out what 's sort of happening so it was there I don 't believe the curb line in Oxford Terrace you 're talking about Oxford east of Columbus tree yes yeah I don 't believe that 's been completed yet last time I was David yeah on the the North line yeah basically the in turn on to Oxford Terrace there is a cycle way is basically up district is directly opposite that later so is it this yeah so the cycle lane is on the south side of the Oxford intersection the intersection so that section of Oxford is being built like the shed she designs out here so you 'll find that it will be all tiled and there 'll be a small entrance and vehicle movements I believe on that our only westbound okay thank you Tim thank you Stevo could you ask at a crow because when they first came in with their design for the Convention Center I 'd have to say this is an improvement of the old one because the old one was an absolute dog were in Peterborough Street trying to get and 11 me to track let alone at B train God for bird anytime outside the small hours of the morning was an absolute nightmare but with regards to this with an 11 meter track or a B train or whatever when when they first came and talked about the Convention Center I asked them if they would talk to the production side because of all due respect again I don 't think anyone here drives a with all the the measurements etcetera I would like to know from attacker that they have talked to the deliverers and the production companies etc to get an idea that this is really going to work because I 've really concerns because the last one was a dog although it worked because you made it work but it was a nightmare this is an improvement but I do want to know that they have done what we have asked them to do Jim one one thing on I 'm not sure of I can 't cheat but sometimes when you run a tracking circle for a vehicle sometimes some of the worst vehicles for turning circles can be so I owe to Karen may come back to us and I will definitely check thank you sometimes the deals dirham 11 meter trucks you know the two wheels in the front are some of the worst on the road yeah so they can have the worst steer so if they have used that vehicle that when I 'm just reading straight off what we saw yeah yeah but I will definitely an avid train or whatever most under sections in the Central City you 've got across the lines it 's just a wide as I mean the design for us for predominantly cars but a big trucks of yeah but think if you could stay thank you very much thank you deal well we 're not quite there yet because I 've got a question from Sarah but I 'll note that you 're happy to move this that 's great Sarah thanks just following on are there any other similar projects where all Takato is in charge of the design that will be asked to do the road controlling authority stuff coming up and if the are are you able to come to us earlier with these things or not through the chair there is a number of projects coming up the whole of the east frame here footbridge out here and Cambridge terrace between Kilmore and its east of Colombo Street the section outside the band Rotonda it 's coming to you and I think there 's a little bit of the lane still that has to come workshops on every one of them yes but they need those workshops need to be early enough so what we 've got here is that so the government in or tacit are able to do things that local government can do I 'm not sure that they understand it so is local government we have to be open to be able to decide not to certain not to do something at every decision when we get to the decision-making point but what 's happening is that these things are coming so late work is underway you know there are signals and already that that mean that we 're effectively rubber standards and that she that 's not allowable under the Local Government Act we need to know enough about what 's happening about these things so that we can be free to decide not to early enough in the process otherwise we 're not meeting our legal obligations and that 's quite different the obligations that central government have and I frequently think that there isn 't understood at all by central government and those who work for them so yes anything to a queer base so training their own pool yeah we can work without a car oh yeah in the beginning of next year and they have no problem with fronting up with a workshop and bringing those earlier and the new year before the reports come through so can I just check on the agreement then so with the delivery being done by the you know the the crown and by the council does well Taco itchy have the ability to sign off on the whole design overt end counsel just the road controlling Authority controls because all of the other projects we actually sign off on the sort of concept design feast my understanding was is through the J TRP right back in the days of Sarah yeah the initial all of the AAC works yeah we had a structure set up where viable goats for a technical review panel then up through the project control group project steering group and we 'd bring it through a workshop and to counsel for your approval before the work started but we 're dependent on attack arose bringing to you yeah so that 's the situation we 're at the moment we 've received this recently and now we 're bringing it to you and to seek the resolutions for the work that 's to underway there we 're that you know that makes these things at risk so but that 's the risk that they take and getting into this yeah but knowin Council needs to sign off or does someone have the delegation to sign off the neutral design and what we 've previously done is certainly bring them through the council for sign-off so we 've we 've had a pretty thorough process nice yeah so it was not just the resolutions per se although it could include the resolutions but I think if you think about the ones such as Manchester and Cambridge Durham the full design came before council for approval so he had the plans which showed what was what it was going to look like and that had all that you know the plethora of resolutions required to legalize it and then once there happened they win its were a tender answer that but what we have done is bring it to you once we 've received it I think and so we have been encouraging them to bring their to Council so no one has signed off on the design we just think after doing the technical content of the design that will have been passed offices so technically correct from you curbing type C drainage type your signals all the technical elements will have been reviewed by council offices yeah but that doesn 't necessarily cover the technical concept design so I think it 's important that we I mean what we 're talking about now is the more general how do these kind of projects get approved and what 's the process I think if there was a need for a detailed discussion on that that would be better had at the committee as a way of understanding how we could get more better information earlier or what the limitations of our decision-making are for future processes what we 've got in front of us today is a set of recommendations that we 've already heard what the got to where we 've got to where we need to get to today 's either improving this or or not so that we can move on issue of timing at the workshop and we have made that clear that it would be good to get a little bit earlier but at the end of the day we are legislating this and also we did make some changes will be at mitre and if we wanted to make major changes I supposed to be good we 'll just delay it all but the committee was supportive of this it I see workshop in a meeting the other day and I can 't see any issue with it today and I 'm not hearing anybody moving any substantive amendments to this either so Dion had indicated he was gonna move it Paul in your second okay great so is there any debate on this so Sara Dion Sara just really briefly I mean I mean like I 'm uncomfortable with this design I 'm comfortable the weight changes and things but but I 'm really uncomfortable that I 've been put that there is almost no option but to approve it and that process I 'm really unhappy with and should that happen again I 'm likely to vote against the vote against it because we wouldn 't have the opportunity to sign off my concept design so yeah thank you deal um you know I think this this has to go through because the work may actually finish before Christmas or the two roads might actually open in the next few days they 've been busting their backsides to get that done but the thing is here that if we roll back a little bit I just wanted to make sure that people were aware of what 's going on here well Tucker doe are charged with and and it 's been its contractual II written and that they 're charged to do the roadsides of any anchor projects so they were going to do the the side of the road of Colombo and our mastery but not the other side of the road in that side the sides that they were doing it was 3.5 million dollars they 've whole road they don 't have to it 's not part of the agreement and they 're paying for it so they 're saving us about through they 're actually saving the right pays three million dollars or something close to that for doing this and that 's why it 's comfortable that 's from what I understand is why it 's come to us like this so there 's a the process is a bit you know and we because it is like we 're almost there hand has been forced but we do not have any control over what will target o do on their side of the inka projects that 's the way that the central city recovery plan an accessible city thing has been written that 's the agreement that we have apparently but we do have control over the side and we do have to sign off on the side that we are responsible for which is the other side but we 're saving quite a considerable amount of money for the ratepayers here so I actually want to see this go through get it early next year in that road look absolutely beautiful great Thank You Phil human I think there 's been some confusion about these processes because certainly I recall that when the committee dealt with the hospital corner we hadn 't had a workshop and we spent two hours really working through with the attack row staff and our own staff to find some resolution and that was a laborious process however we have had a workshop on this item and there 's been a lot of opportunity for the committee members to actually discuss it so I 'm a wee bit mystified I 'm aware this is a long agenda but there 's been a lot of attack or items so I I just think all together yep this this has gone faster than perhaps people to like but it better that there 's good reason to actually progress it and I think to be fair to attacker oh they did respond well actually running us a workshop and I think that that 's some fear to just comment on Aaron and then Mike oh yeah I voted against it yeah percentage-wise the number of disability car parks on mobility car parks has gone up but it 's still three for the whole area there 's one and there should be some enough in the convention center but we haven 't seen that you don 't know what that number is but there 'll be one there so if you 've got a convention with a couple of thousand people let 's just hope that 's not disability related because one can go and then up by the Town Hall this tooth so I don 't know that 's that 's not a level of service that I want to see that doesn 't create equity in the city but also that number percentage-wise has changed because we 've taken out so many car parks along Colombo and armor Street they were all car parks both sides of the road and they were full whenever there 's a concert at the Town Hall they were full whenever there 's an event and Victoria Square they were full and and so if the city becomes successful going forward not quite sure is on and the parking strategy that hasn 't been done from the north of the city yet they 'll Park in there somewhere but the other one is then once all these sites have built out at 13 years but bus is going to the convention scene the fear of a successful convention with a couple of thousand people and then and a successful one Tamizh where they go and do day tivities you line up 50 buses to try and clear people from the Convention Center and you want to do a turnaround time of about 30 minutes I 've never seen that traffic management plan for the Convention Center so I think excursions from conventions in Christchurch are going to be quite flawed just thrown it out there thank you Mike and then yawning thank you I will be supporting this I 'm not happy with the process but I want to address a couple of things and I won 't go into too much detail but I really think councillors should actually keep effects before they start spelling often and public some of the statements you you should have a walk down Colombo Street and see actually the amount of work that 's gone underway before this has come to council before it come to our workshop to actually look at so I 'll support this because really we don 't have much choice but once again we need to actually get this done better in the future we need to have more to say at the start of this projects before they come to us when the works already underway for us to make decisions that we can 't really go back on because of the work quite frankly and I said it before our tack row have caused us nothing but headaches they are going so slow around the city as a joke they should be working night and day to get their streets open and they 're not weeds nothing needs to change it needs to change soon because people are gained frustrated and to the point of breaking we need a city back and we need to work completed quickly Jonnie yeah I mean I totally endorse what what 's been said need a government department to build local roads in a city like in playgrounds when Council has been doing that for a hundred years so it just you know I think I totally agree that it 's ridiculous to get this after work has already been so far down the track but I won 't be supporting it I just think I think you need to vision what will happen when the convention centers built when the town halls reopened and all the stuff in terms of Performing Arts precinct and the traffic that 's going to be in this area is going to be extraordinary and often those places will have multiple events on at the same and we 're taking away car parking we 're not I don 't think adequately providing for the heavy vehicles that will go through this area and we don 't seem to have any traffic management that makes any sense for this massive Convention Center that 's being built and the last thing I want to do is create an inaccessible city and a city that becomes more dangerous because we 're be going through this area so I think there 's a lot more things that we should be looking at here possibly one weighing are my street in certain directions if that 's if there 's issues with the turning I think we definitely as councillors should have learned from Sony so straight that we actually should see the safety order before we approve these sorts of designs and restrictions so that we don 't have to lean people said what 's the cost of delaying it you know not proving it today well what 's the cost of doing it getting it wrong and then having to come back but we didn 't say there 's some straight lot more I would suggest then actually getting it right the first time so um I just don 't think this design adequately addresses the significant use that will be occurring at this intersection with all the new developments that are happening in this area and I totally concur with Erin in terms of where is the car parking in this area we haven 't got any car parking off street so many of the car parks now ahead of things like the convincing sin to even being built why not leave the car parking there into what 's actually you know close to completion rather than remove it right now so that just hurts those local businesses that have invested in the central city and we heard that through the submissions so I won 't be supporting it Pauline favorably yes there is parking loss but this is a city of the future this is the way we 're going we there are suggestions of parking buildings going and around here there is a parking plan to be done so parking will be addressed but there 's other ways to get into the city and you know what do we want to congestion tax or something in the future this is going to be a difficult area to drive around so that you find another way to get in there 's subways so I think this is I agree with everything diancie don 't think it 's going to be wonderful the whole Victoria Square project was an amazing collaborative new design or the reformation of it and in these traffic works providing theirs might see that they can keep them done quickly and that 's the key I agree with it it 's going to be a really good result for the silliness is going to be a beautiful area so please support it I 'll put the motion all those in favor against you want those votes recorded so if we can note though so Yanni and Aaron voted against so that 's carried so are now adjourn the meeting we 're at 15 either during the meeting until 2 o 'clock when we 'll come back with Mir in the chair and _"

    "text": "now I 've been asked to leave so items 9 and 10 we 're going to leave until Glenn Livingstone gets back but item 9 I think it 's probably appropriate that Leanne chairs that rather than me chairing that as I 'm trustee of the Housing Trust and we have got item 21 which Leanne has asked that we consider when she 's present so if we now move to item 22 so now we 're we 're into the infrastructure transport now Environment Committee items item 22 the central city proposed bus passenger sales installations pauline do you have any comments on this one there are no result of consultation it makes a huge difference so the consultation was held in November this is to improve accessibility of the bus stops and to ensure user satisfaction with the number and quality of shelters you 'll see the images on page 305 and 306 page 305 as a council shelter page 306 images in each shell the cost is 24k for but if head shall come on board that 's reduced to 12,000 and noting here that normally community an exception for central city area marked plan a in which both of these set so the the committee approved both of those unanimously so I 'd like to move them and deal most second or in sorry can we just we please note in the recommendation that we had a discussion that that we give the one by the the skatepark a street art treatment 2d_:_112.64 graffiti so we 've lived it with breathing Donoghue to follow up by the staff and I note in there and this was a question that I got actually provided there is evidence that this reduces graffiti now in my own uninformed little mind I have the idea that it would reduce graffiti our we need proof of this or is it clear that that is the case a really obtainable so you 're comfortable that that will go the evidence will support it and will go ahead yep all I can say as Breen is working with the team to get it appropriately painted when it does go in on that particular site so we will monitor it over the coming years very proactive in removing it yep all right that answers the question thank you further questions Yanni yeah I just can 't see from this around how we 're prioritizing the placement of bus shelters is there a master list or a protestation process based on usage that we 're that we 're following you serious and Brendan could give you the detail of it I 'm sorry I have texture which is not quite here yet or she 's on the way yes it does it looks at the number of people if you have a look at them principally they are in going so it 's where people will be waiting for buses where you hop off a bus and come home here we go we we prioritize based on usage how many passengers are using the bus stop in question so if we target ones that are used by more people we get more value back to the shelter then there are other aspects such as Watson the peripheries the retirement home is there a school so those are the things that have not so much black there are other things that we consider so having a prioritization that you can actually go back to and defend it 's very useful for staff because we have a set budget and we have to get the most out of our budgets where do they rank on that list where do they rank well they obviously rank reasonably high up in the list to be considered for this year because you know we have quite a number of shelters around the city and we 're just basically working our way down through the list and again it 's the passenger numbers that trigger what we look at the list is pretty much every single bus stop in the city and what are the locations that don 't have shelters so that list would be basically a list of bus stops without shelters so I 'm just but if we 've got a hundred people using a bus stop without a shelter yeah that would be up the top yes so so we must have some sort of idea around I don 't know the top 20 or yes again stop ID and then the next column it 's the patronage and then the next column is if it if it 's yes for shelter or no it doesn 't have shelter and we just go through each of those it is pretty much as basic as that and we look through that and see in terms of patronage which is the next bus stop on that list it doesn 't have a shelter and as you say a bus stop that has a hundred passengers per day would it ring alarm bells if it doesn 't have a shelter okay a timing issue if the bus stop has objections and requires a consent that can take a lot longer and that 's why it 's really good to get as many in as we can that don 't need a consumers I understand that I was just looking at obviously got the new commercial development happening further up more he 'll serve is there another sheltered stop further our commercial development you mean by the supermarket it 's where the old railway station needs to be yeah again I be at that particular bus stop right okay and then just two other very quick questions one is how we thought about putting recycling bins and where we 've got rubbish bins given that we want to be kind of sustainable that 's a question I can 't answer can we can I ask that we get some advice back on that because I would have thought a recycling bin next to the Roche button would be it would be a good thing at the one at the skate park so that would be duration other than bus stops but I 'm sure we can get some information back on what yeah I think through the let 's just go okay so can we get some a memo back to the committee on what we are doing or what we could do to put recycle bins or stops thank you fine a question but the final one was really support the straight-up thing but it shall will serve requirement to provide as I understand some sort of community advertising and the digital ones and so could we actually ask that of street art of local artists work that they 've been doing could we actually get or make a request that they just lay some of that things they have to display every so often something to do with the community as part of the contract we can go back to our show and discuss it further with them can we just do it like why do we need to be have a contractual obligation without shell so we would have to discuss first and then advise okay we may not all be on the same page with regards to what 's edge shall put on because I would prefer to go back to the Kentucky Community Board to ask them if there 's going to be a commit a a community or segment and advertising that are their needs and wants that it needs to be promoted by that local community board so I don 't think personally I don 't want this council to make that make a recommendation I 'd like to come from the community so is there if we were to get into that kind could have input in the way that tim has just described how about we have a look at the contract don 't have to have a look at the detail of it if there is any opportunity for us to do there 's certainly opportunities for council to buy space but what you 're looking for is community free of space I 'll have to actually have a look at the fine what the contracts is and we can come back to you and then let 's get develop then how do you allocate that out if you want to that 's the question I think doesn 't let 's get this back to the committee so just really information on what level of come what what level of community inputs the contract with ad shell allows in terms of bus stop there 's not design is is it 's talking about advertising with the new screen so they 're coming up there you roll the adverts every on if I know 30 seconds 50 seconds something like that and so your what I think counselor Johansson 's asking about community messages local or whatever now we 'll see what what the contract allows for in that obviously from our perspective we share the advertising revenue and so you know that 's the basis of our agreement at this point in time they provide and maintain and those bus shelters and then we share the revenue coming from it so I 'll go back and have a look at what the contractors and what it does say and you 'll come back to the Committee on that Rick fantastic thank you all right I 'm Sarah just quickly with the patronage numbers as that assist is that though that you can sort of measures of how many people hop on and off the bus does it include you know gold card users all of those kind of people who are born for phrase of every user every user irrespective of cards gold cards or cash it 's a boarding number it 's not an alighting number so it gives you an indication of how many people are waiting to get on a bus including schoolkids and could including school kids recorded yeah thank you deal nope okay and Tim we picked up your comment before that 's fine so no further questions so can I have a mover for this item please so move by outlet as it been moved and seconded already right okay that 's all good okay debate okay so I put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried and then _"

    "text": "and then moving to item 8 endorsements of the final christchurch alcohol Action Plan and this has been referred to a number of times in considering the previous item Phil this came through your committee I 'll get you to introduce this one place it certainly did and we had very full discussion at committee level around us and again I 'm so pleased the staff have done a lot of work on this and clearly in conjunction with the police who are here today too and that 's a key part of the section plan and in fact counsel certainly alone is not able to do this at all it requires that those strong partnerships and besides the council in the police of course the district health board and community Public Health are a key part of achieving these goals and I think the previous discussions made it really clear about in on one part of the city there are huge problems in terms of the harm that alcohol abuse can cause and this is a really a play into to cover all there so one thing though I this is an action plan you 'll be aware that we didn 't make a decision on the local alcohol policy and I 'm Dave this then is not up for discussion really this is around the action plan and things that we can do with the support from staff so staff might like to answer equations alright thank you very much indeed for that introduction and for making that clear do we have questions for staff Dion Sarah deal I 've got two questions the first one is have the institutions or all bars owners and in the industry being consulted or worked through with this the the industry is a part of this plan you 'll notice on the back that it 's listed in a number of the actions in terms of staff training and supporting the 9su wise model for staff building capacity in the industry the forums that we 're going to be involved in safer Christchurch has already held the first one that has the industry is that they are invited and also part of the alcohol Accords which are also listed so yes this is more the safer this the safer Christchurch and the community development component of the work that we do and we and we have been very careful at the beginning of this plan to differentiate between the roles and our responsibilities under the Act as compared with our community development work so it is important to separate that out okay yeah no because it was just some of the concern and this is this will lead into a question so forgive me some of the concern I 've had is that from from some in the industry have gone well actually we haven 't been told about this and they 're worried about these are the licensed premises so the ones who have under under their own ex you know have to do all of the enforcement and the whatever they do they 're they 're worried that it 's going to make it harder for them to operate their business I suppose is that what the intention is of this there 's nothing regulatory or compulsory about the action plan the action plan is really a framework for and sometimes on a project-by-project basis with other partners to work on alcohol issues of importance to the communities so if there 's no compulsion on businesses to be a part of this at all yeah I just I just don 't want to see eggshells wait thank you that 's good thank you Sarah hi I 'm HD I ain 't gonna ask about delay because it seems it and I really like what 's in here I like it a lot um but it seems like when we talk about um you know one of council 's responsibilities as policy those kind of things it actually it almost specifically doesn 't mention the fact that we could and that that would really enhance the priority area three here and it seems to sort of avoid that and I 'm not sure if that 's to avoid controversy and to avoid the concerns that Dion here may be but it would seem to me there 's counsel getting on and doing a lap would be a key part of that priority area three for us the two like but alone whether the council did or didn 't have a lab and and so those the lack of hard wiring if you like between the alcohol Action Plan and the let is absolutely intentional and it 's designed to enable this to function on the same the lap is a regulatory tool yeah and so while there may be a dotted line between the two in terms of desired outcomes and they operate in completely different spaces you know it 's just that if there 's if there 's action plans it would seem that one of the actions council could do to contribute towards the outcomes that we wanted here would be to do the nape and it 's just odd that that isn 't and there is one of the actions and that will be something that the Council considers at some point but to almost preempt a council decision to have a led by having it as in action I think to work towards and we 've already made a council decision to work towards a new lamp so you may decide to have one more you can carry on with our safety and community development without being yeah but it seems almost like a bit of a lost opportunity because then we could decide here that we want to bolster that their process I 'm not sure that that would be the intention of the resolution here to impact on any future decision regarding elect I think what we 're hearing quite loud and clear is that there are two separate processes yes there 's a link between the two but there 's also a distinction between the two and the way that we endorse this christchurch alcohol action plan needs to take into account that there is a further decision-making process and we shouldn 't preempt that decision-making process so that this stands alone regardless of what the outcome of that process is and obviously what the outcome of that process is will be subject to further debate on that process rather than this process any further questions you rev thank you this is an action plan and I 'm looking through and it 's got some excellent strategies in there but to me they there 's a lot of things like encourage collaborate support investigate monitor promote but I 'm not seeing a lot of hard-edged action and there 's one piece for me I think in the community space which is quite important it 's on page 82 or 25 of the document where we 're looking at supporting citizen part enable and support citizen participation and licensing processes we 've got here support the development of web-based public notification of all alcohol licensing applications investigate strategies to increase assistance to communities seeking involvement and licensing phrases communities tell us time and time again they don 't want new liquor shops in their communities plain and simple so I don 't see that there 's any action here unless I 've missed something yeah your your tool to deal with licensing decisions like that is a lap and what this action playing is advocating is providing communities with the tools to enable them to have their views taken considered as part of any licensing decision whether there 's a let there or not okay we do have an implementation plan currently being written July she 's been funded by health promotion agency and Richard myself in the DHB are part of the advisory group that work with her so that will that will specify we 're already in partnership with these multiple groups that are listed at the back there and best practice projects are being developed we just haven 't got to be more specific stage thing great thank you so Ann Vicki yawning thank you thank you very much all the work you 've done to provide us with this information you talked about a high profile social marketing campaign to address binge drinking and harmful drinking obviously have you got the resources to do that it would be health promotion agents responsibilities that now joined the advisory group so it 's about partnering our part of that might be ensuring that those resources and those key consistent messages were at public events that the council was supporting right for example yeah can I follow through the question please do yep just how do we strengthen that collaboration in terms of the council events things as that can you see that really necessarily about doing a lot of new things that each of the individual partners weren 't already doing but we know that if we do it together with the overlay of best practice that we 'll get better outcomes thank you Vicki the follow-up the point that ref was making because time and time again we get applications for off licenses or more liquor stores in locations where there are already 618 of them around and unless somebody is regarded by Anna as at the alcohol licensing outfit is having status in that debate they 're not allowed to submit so there 's quite a it 's quite a formal sort of process and quite off put in for a lot of people and also they 're sometimes not regarded as having status before that is there anything that we could possibly look at that would create a more creative solution rather than the current one which doesn 't seem to create a solution it creates a solution for the alcohol industry but not for the communities that they 're going into there that we haven 't thought of your regulatory tool is you 're late yes I understand that 's Fort so is this something that 's not in here that isn 't a lab that we could do in the meantime and no because it 's a very legislative in prescriptive process but the what if we had a temporary ban on any more liquor stores we were unable to do that other than through a lap thank you yawning it 's a similar point what what I don 't see is us putting the resources and to enable the community to participate and these district licensing processes have you considered or window we can set other resources that that we could put on I mean you 've got who 's leading but there 's no resources attached the there is information and guidance and templates on the council website for people who want to oppose or have their views known in a license application process so that includes a template for a community and that resource I I would imagine will continue to evolve to provide communities with the best possible support in having their views if we were looking at say on page 25 the the monitor and provide communities with information about risk factors which may increase harm and you 've got a G outlet density are we doing that now or and if so how is that proposed to change or is that just sort of staying the same it 's a my understanding us that Canterbury Community Law is going to be doing some of that work yeah so maybe I guess one actually great so this is about the partnership keep any tweaking within our own boundaries I mean I guess our boards going through an interesting thing where we 've got the license and Ferry Road and trying to get information around the harm it will be very interesting I 'm not sure our council systems are able to record CSR 's around things like broken glass in relation to alcohol licenses at the moment thank you so now into supplementary questions and and then Sarah and this is really not a question but a response to some of the end points being made about what king communities do and lobbied and fought against allocate outlet being bought into the community and and the community law have got very good advice that they can offer and that process of fighting we are still in questions of magnet so this might be better handled in debate sure that that 's fine thank you funding to the questions that Vicki in yeah no that 's absolutely fine we can come to that and debate there 's no problem so Sarah and then Tim I 'm just super aware that when we do eventually get to the lathe and it is a different thing to us that you know as we 've seen it can be quite a highly fraught quite judicial process with risks of litigation all of those kind of things is there anything in here for example stuff on reducing alcohol related to crime and violence in the nighttime economy kind of statements and that but we deliberately reduce the wanting to reduce title is for the reduce exposure accessibility and availability are any of those statements likely to lead to us being seen is for example predetermined and what sign off on those kind of statements now what I mean if we 're signing off an action plan that sees we 're deliberately is accounts of looking to reduce exposure in accessibility and availability of alcohol and that we 're looking to reduce the impacts in the night-time economy are we going to open ourselves up to judicial concerns from businesses in the Central City for example saying that we 've been predetermined here at the lab well maybe if Gail explains those terms first well I 'll just answer inclusive if you need to read the whole document and away in context because it talks about social supply not just the yeah they do but they 're allowed to buy out of that yes so it 's it 's about who then passes it on to those that are underage I mean that 's only the youth SP but yeah so so this is more vet aspect of it and the diagrams tried to we sure and we well I feel we 've been very careful to do that we have had this look looked at by our 's why we don 't have the leopard here that we don 't wish to blue that boundary at all really because this is part of that other work that we do already and the neighborhood decision and at the Metropolitan seizure pages 2 3 it talks about the scope of this in the fact that each of the partners already have statutory responsibilities yeah out of the edge and then it talks about the role of the council and that there 's been here to separate the functions so we felt that they had their editors referred to a couple of other times in the document as well but hopefully I mean I do hope we hear yeah and I mean it 's pretty clear that one will be in the context of the other any discussion that we have around the lap will be in the context of the fact that we have this alcohol action plan and any consideration of the actions in the alcohol action plan in the future if and when we do have a lap we 'll be in that context as well so though they 're two separate pieces of work it 's not uncommon for counsel to wear two heads in so we 're pretty used to navigating those okay I 'm quite keen to move this on so we 've got Tim Vicki and then back to Phil Tim thank you really but you can 't get an application for an hour look at outlet the community feels and this is all anecdotal but I would support it that they are behind the eight ball because the applicant has advantage now that 's the feeling and the communities so there 's one of the big questions and I guess it comes back to should we be looking at how we can change that perception or how come if it does it as a valid statement how can we changed it because our communities make up what isn 't the whole kind of essence of why we here so how can we do that because I looked through this like for instance working with event organizers with the alcohol if you don 't have an alcohol management plan that 's not acceptable 't actually get one if you 're that unprofessional we talked about sports clubs there are a lot of groups that do a lot of training with this stuff and I think you know it has to improved over the last ten years surely so how can we are we missing the major point here with trying to reduce the accessibility of alcohol gained that is a leather shoe so that 's regulating how well where and when people can access alcohol as a regulatory issue you 've dealt with through the lack shouldn 't we do the let first in and with because the I mean sorry I mean it 's just I mean I appreciate the work that has been done but you know in my history with events we were it so that we went through our alcohol management plan and our processes and best staff and you know you always got someone talking thousands of people at events so we 've always wanted to but you were always trying to be virtual but when they say with council events which are free and you 've got it from elsewhere so isn 't the elsewhere the problem you 're saying that it 's the lips and therefore shouldn 't we combine the two to work hand in hand the two if we have both we need to make sure they do we hand at hand yeah but I think there 's any requirement to have one before the other you know we 're intentionally made been built operate independently but but that a single point problem as access to alcohol with it 's for young people in the problems that take so if you reduce the excess should would it not be the startup point in it and this document deals with socialist exits and the lack will deal with commercial X 's and I think again the point is made clear there are two different streams of work that deal with problems or issues with inevitably cross over but the the function of each work stream is is quite different even though they both lend to outcomes that obviously combine into one space okay Vicki and then Phil and then we 'll get a mover and have one will go on under with the priority area three reduce exposure accessibility and availability and to pick up Tim 's point and reps earlier point about how an application comes in it 's notified the community then has to mobilize allow recent one and Hornby and do in a quite a lot of work to actually stop that happening so if there are are areas Lynwood maybe Wilson maybe Hornby maybe maybe there 's a lot of others where we feel that there are enough already could we not have an automatic response from all of these amazing people that you 've got together to write this and you 've obviously done huge amounts of working putting this together because you 've even got white elephants and red frogs involved which is just amazing so that the could we have an automatic response such that any application for those areas that we already know to be over stopped with with liquor stores particularly could have a automatic objection go and from all of these organizations that would you so it 's because Tim 's point is that by around sort of and then people have gotten a meeting it 's already three weeks into their hearing and they 've got to have everything in was in another two weeks and they 've never done that sort of thing before and it requires a lot of effort on their behalf and mobilizing others could there be some okay we 've got enough of these and these and we want to as one of our priorities reduce exposure etc and availability exposure availability and accessibility could we not have just some trigger that just means there are applications that go in or some process that levels the playing field for the community versus the liquor store is is is the question appropriate though for the piece of work that we 're considering at the moment there 's certainly resources on the council we decide to assist communities they don 't know that given and we can look at whether there 's a way to alert communities at an earlier stage perhaps or even to have pre or you know template documents larger range of template documents that they can access no more licenses in a particular areas through you but there is also a process by which people make application and there 's Tim C 's is an unequal playing field and level playing field and so what I want to do is level up those who are opposed to it to those who wanting to make money from it maybe that 's something that the steering group could discuss in more detail of UT no no I 'm not and I think boundaries the key because we 're very concerned or not I type in a different I totally get that but you 've got together an amazing array of community organizations all of whom are on the same page in relation to alcohol and I just think there must be something outside of waiting for a lab that we can do that 's that 's a bit creative that actually to makes it a bit fairer so you 've heard loud and clear I think from a number of counselors this morning that this is an area of real concern we 've certainly heard that there are actions that would address some of these issues but we also know that that will take some time I think there 's a very strong message which has come through today around the proliferation of liquor outlets in certain areas that are not supported by the community whether that 's something that can be further considered as a result of what 's in this document or whether it 's something that needs to be put on the radar for other discussions certainly it 's clear that that 's a concern in a number of areas of the city and it 's something that we 'd like to be able to address whether through this piece of work or whether through the lap or in some other way but there 's a strong message that that 's a concern Phil did you have a question right okay I 'm keen to wrap up on questions on this so yarning I just appreciate we 're not gonna find all the answers today but when I look through their actions there 's no time frames as well and particularly the one around citizen participation a report back on what what we can do I mean a number of us will have ideas and we 'll have opportunities to learn in the next few months I particularly think with what happens in Ferry Road so are we able to get a report back on what those strategies would could could be and what funding would be required to introduce a safe across huge under councilor the other ways that there 's no reason why that report couldn 't come here and be more if you wished would that be report bit more appropriate to bring to the relevant committee or maybe I well not instead I have a few ideas that we could great to get in to talk about and debate when we get yeah if we 're going to debate this soon after should we not have some resolution that talks about the timeframe for the implementation planning done so that the issue that people have raised today around the actions we get some under so we had a note in if we made an item to which was a note so note be reported back to Council and at this particular date or I mean my concern is that we 're doing the LTP some of these things might require budget which I don 't see how we get a chance to have that discussion because of the timing of this right do we want this reported back to Council or do we want it to come to the to the committee go yep yep so will be reported to the council via safer christchurch and the social community development and housing committing which i think is appropriate in this place and certainly not saying that safer christchurch isn 't the right place for this to come to but just given the level of interest in this particular issue the committee has got the ability to consider that and then make recommendations previously when we did the lap we were advised that there was no evidence that there was a proliferation or a harm with alcohol licenses in lower socioeconomic areas do we have enough information or do we have processes underway through this action plan that we will be able to lowest socio-economic barriers [Applause] so currently there 's business we can get the information yeah I mean the information mr. come is is you know the information has to come from the people who are either policing the ambulances maybe Aviva for the family violence so that is why we 're using this collaborative approach it 's only as strong as its data gathering there are some challenges with some of it we already know that it 's our intention of this one of the core things that we share that information all right thank you now are there further questions we 're still in questions we 're not yet in debate are there are further questions Jimmy and I 'm really keen to move this on weekly ask a question because I review your particular mention regarding to the timeframe is five years are you already commenced from the 2016 up to the 2020 what five years am i right action most important is for implementation but you mentioned that did I have an implementation because I could keep up I just say for asexual but my concern a years particular 2018 to 21 those three yes that 's a key key time period you put on those the party on the definite definite can check the kind of unit or maybe the definite sector or nothing you 're already put on there okay okay thank you and this is a question all right yeah well that 's exactly where I 'm coming from so Phil have you indicated that you 're happy to move this and then you 're happy to second so now let 's move into debate and yawning okay because lots of things that I wanted to say but couldn 't_''_1941.04 because it was question time but we actually ran a forum safer Christchurch strategy committee Rina forum deal was exactly the kind of issues that you 're talking about here we hit the police and we hit the mutant Edie the emergency department of the hospital the senior clinician there and we had our representatives from the industry and we talked through a lot of these issues and we brought people to give that we had 60 people here and they talked about their obviously very high concern that we all have about alcohol harm so we might have to do that again and remind you to attend those of you who are interested what are the thoughts that we I hear what you 're saying is that communities don 't feel as if they have enough power one of the great initiatives that came out of that was or an idea actually was that the Community Law Center meets with community board cheer people and takes them through a framework of how they can address standing up opposing alcohol outlets in their community so to share that knowledge and to empower each other so maybe even collectively community board chairs can write up a statement in and that can be the kind of collective impact sort of approach that we 're talking about here so we need to empower these groups to do that and that 's about this is what this is all about this christchurch alcohol action plan is just about that it 's about bringing us together and collectively fighting this issue and empowering each other so obviously i 'm Phillip look I think that the decisions a day who sort of really raised I guess that the seriousness of the whole problem of alcohol and something that in fact as a society and probably as a council we haven 't given us the same serve attention as we have to other massive issues and like what is in the report is that the estimated cost of what we 're talking about in New Zealand is 6.5 billion dollars each year so in fact how we address this is actually does take some careful planning and if there is no silver bullet for this money at all and the problem and there however there are clear actions which are being undertaken in the the implementation plan well it will address those I can as clearly there 's a sense of frustration around this now that 's been raised been raised by counsel sad a however it is clear in the report that this this plan action plan isn 't a substitute for leopard the leopard all and and in a minute and it 's the focus is on the non-regulated if anything no and it 's my personal view is that as a council we should ask that the lepre proceeded with Forth Worth as quickly as soon as possible because all the questions have been raised today in terms of concern actually are focused around there and and I get there is that area in between though that I think we we are clear on and that is that where communities need support to make their objections for example around look at look at outlets and the proliferation of them there is something that clearly has come clear I think today through the questions and something which I 'm sure as a council neck community development work as a staff that we can approach so well yep there 's a I think there 's a lot at it it is a fairly high level in this action plan that can be achieved it 's clear that we know with the support of the police and community community mental health and community public health that in fact we can make a lot of progress on this we sure have a that are in front of us thank you Jonnie Tim Dion yawning yeah we litigate the points that have been made but I just make one point which i think is really important and that is that there 's a there 's a community planning deficit in the city and it existed before the earthquakes but it 's been exacerbated post earthquake and that is that the communities are shut out of planning because it costs too much and the people with the most amount to gain have the most resources and the people who often can lose the most have the least amount of resources so you know I 've previously put forward to council that we need to look at a fund to set up a community planning Institute or Center where the community can actually good advice can attain expert advice technical advice to participate in these very complicated legal processes and you know we haven 't even talked about our district plan our district plan should be the vehicle by which we control land use in our city and you know the key objectives on that urban design and to reduce the need for for consents so there 's a huge barrier to community participation and land-use decisions and I think it 's time that we do address and you know I think if you look at the community law which has been mentioned and here that 's been an excellent model for some legal services but I think it needs we definitely need to get that report back around the implementation plan around what would be required to have a proper well resourced Community Planning Center in our city that enables people to participate because at the moment people do feel shut out there 's a lack of information a lack of resources in huge barriers and you know I think the other thing is that the community boards are going through participation and these processes and it would be good at some stage maybe as part of the implementation plan to talk to them but you know I think it 's important to have an action plan but we do need to get some firm things in terms of time frames resourcing and stick coming back Tim thank you first of all I 'd like to thank everyone and all the groups that worked on this I think it 's outstanding and it 's a hell of a lot of work and looking at that the other side of the leap I mean it 's a very complicated process but thank you very much for you and all those that took part of it I think it 's good and I will support it I guess we as community board to get the information is mailed out to us when people make applications but it I guess it 's looking at the process and turning it on its head perhaps because if the let with bureaucratic seniority if you like I think the left should actually come to this group into work from this group because this group seems to be the one at the coalface with the human beings that we all represent it 's not Europe you 're critic or bureaucracy that we should be representing a process that is actually the people that would make it and why does all their our processes and turning them around because the last thing I think and I will disagree with my colleague tamati the last thing that we need is another organization or body or group that the public need to go to although designed to to be streamlined bureaucracy for most human beings but most of our citizens as foreign to them they don 't be part of it although they their lives are controlled by it whether it 's from the central government of Council but it 's not a natural process we live it we look at the websites we go through it all but it is not a natural process so I think if we can do that with regards to the licensing information coming to community boards the get there is the community board to the community and if we can somehow turn that round so the application clock starts when the community board says it starts not from when the application is made to the council so that the community board has time to look at its community and tries to get it out there I think feeling because whether you go to community law or whatever organization you go to for a lot of these people in our communities that is intimidating to come to plate their meetings like this or community wards and you will see every time that that you hear public attending there 's the odd one or two that have a piece of paper and you can see the hands are trembling it is a foreign process and we need to turn that around so I endorse what you 've done I think this is absolute fantastic I think the process should be turned on its head and the let comes to this group rather than the other way around so I will support this today deal mr. chair I just want to ask if I might have a potential conflict of interest due to my last name here you can allow me to speak you 've got one too many Jews Oh this thank you very much so it 's much ly appreciated now I I do support this the concern that I did heaven that was voiced by a few was around Christchurch and it 's it 's perception of its aspect of fun when it comes to entertainment industry in the city I suppose and there were a few who were concerned about is this just going to suppress the whole thing and actually make it you know more difficult for people to create responsible environments for people to enjoy enjoy going out and having a drink but I think that 's you know the strength of that is actually this might help create environments and actually foster those environments so that we do create a really good nightlife in the city that 's responsible that keeps people safe because that 's what I would like to see and I think many people in our communities would like to see safe environments where people can have fun the one thing that really is interesting in this for me is is these two elements really the prolific ation of off licences in our communities which has been spoken about before but supermarkets are a big concern for me I think it 's irresponsible actually to have alcohol at the start got families who go in and buy their milk they breed their groceries and then they have to walk past with their kids with all the booze and everything like that that 's just via I think we need to address it as a society I firmly believe that and I think that 's where some of the normalization of just grabbing a bottle of alcohol with the kids see that all the time the mum and dad go to the go home we 'll go to the park or whatever like that but we just spoke about before in the last so that 's that 's where I think this is really helpful and I think it enables us to have those conversations and I hope we do have those conversations and actually start sitting down and thinking about that with the Lynwood village one that we just had before I think this is also helpful to sort of start working with the framework as we are working with you know that resolution for to actually start looking at what I what are the other opportunities that we have support it on the proviso that we actually still want to make some fun in our city Aran year the we could have probably done the lap today because most people are generally speaking to me Rasmus questions about it but that aside I just want to go to page 72 of our agendas and where it says reduce alcohol related injury and illness now normally as a council we work on facts and the facts here of very loose like alcohol attributable injuries through a cc is 11% it 's a strange number there for 350 million dollars because an ACC form doesn 't even have alcohol on it so that 's a nice kiss so if you 've chopped your thumb off tomorrow and gone to the hospital then I ask you if you 've been drinking or when was the last time you had a drink they if they can smell it they may record it they may not and then the other one around that is Edie attendances there 's between 18 and 35 so a 100% difference and eating presentations which jumps up to two-thirds so let 's when we 're looking at this we need to go well beyond if we 're going to be community leaders and be saying to departments like ACC you 've got to put it on the form we 've got to have the facts and if there is a 350 and I suspect that 's way higher than 250 million to alcohol each year because if you get a big care accident alcohol-related that can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollars so alcohol should have an ACC component in it and it doesn 't and I suspect that 's why it 's not on the form and I think that 's a responsible of society in general to not even have it there but these numbers are pretty loose this is a stat and the irony of us making this or putting this through in the month where New Zealand drinks the most alcohol absolutely can is the irony is not lost on me enjoy this silly season thank you i Jimmy happy to receive in those this alcohol action plan because we 're aware this paper almost 4,000 Assamese maturity of empathic concern in the city of crisis have this alcohol-related a lahar so this is good a response to the wider community but even a moment we focus on only in the agency like okay church in a police as well as city HPSA but we got into the implementation plan my view no stakeholders and also the key community should be the wider otherwise whether it can be the implement successful or maybe the effective or efficient I thought so there 's mostly important however at least they give us a strategic view now we can see quite clearly here set up not only the vision because which is kind of strategy part strategy but you did have the objective strategy and and also the priority the area there 's many full implementation so implement a moment we need to focus on is in implementation but implementation Narayana he mentioned earlier timeframe and the party to support in the wider community support we can make it happen this most important I 'll put motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you will _"

    "text": "okay so if we could have staff to the table please thank you so Pauline [Music] certainly if this was going to be a permanent alcohol ban we would be doing you know a far more robust community consultation process with it being a temporary Bend the council 's alcohol restrictions by law allows a allows a temporary ban to be put in place using the decision making and consultation approaches required in part six of the local government and we believe that the process undertaken meets that requirement so we can bring one in is from today if it was approved and there 's a temporary and the in effect was to be moved into a permanent well the temporary stay in while the consultations taken for reference so you 'd start it before the six months so basically the aim here is to just start the temporary and make it permanent that 's right well the the aim here is to make it temporary and then to look at its effectiveness and and look at whether moving to a permanent ban is the right solution for the Spiteri be looking at the effects much earlier than that we 'll be tracking the effects with the policing with other stakeholders the whole way through so it 's not simply going to be a case of letting it sit and forget for six months and then see how it goes thank you thank you any further questions film thank you for the report um can I just ask you and but clearly you indicated in the report there this isn 't a silver silver bullet isn 't gonna fix all all the issues very remote a particularly refer to a long-standing issues in and basically then to use this word but it 's like a lot of poverty in this area so I 'm just wondering it but and the community board are asking for this temporary being so I 'm just wondering other resources perhaps that council that council could always that council could also support this in addition to the community board well the council is looking at a housing first project which will have links I would suspect to some of the issues being experienced in this consider approving an alcohol action plan and the partnerships established through that action plan are the types of partnerships that came form the basis of a more holistic and robust approach for the longer term so there are some areas of councils current capability that we can tune to this issue but it 's probably an issue that we need to think about long term in terms of what our response our capability should be thanks Ken thank you Jonnie and then Jimmy yeah and thanks for the information I see it on page 655 is quite a lot of discussion about community-based initiatives I just wondered given that we 've heard repeatedly that people feel forgotten about people don 't feel that they 're getting the liberal investment and what is effectively one of the poorest urban areas in New Zealand there 's is there any other things that we can do as a council to give that community a sense of we do care about what 's happening because everything seems today to have been so slow even the regeneration plan it 's just we don 't seem mean these issues we 're raised through the Central City plan so I think it 's important that we know the staff are here to talk about a proposed temporary alcohol ban and the issues that have been raised a far wider than that well I 'd like to keep questions to the matter of this in front of us so one of the deputations raised the concern that the ban can 't_''_271.19 be the only thing that with me that we do in this area so you don 't want to address that now when when should we address that well I don 't know that the staff that we 've got at the table have got the expertise to address the wider issues that you 're raising yes there may well be other issues we want to consider in that area but the staff that we 've got at the table are here to talk to a proposed temporary alcohol ban I mean I just I just can trust us with the report we 've got from the central city in terms of the developer for with a can we get a report back then on what we can do other than the temporary alcohol been in this area with timeframes requests community development staff to work with Jeff Arirang water another partner agencies only community development approaches to address wider social issues in the Lynwood area but but there 's no time frame on that there 's no commitment to resources and this has been we 've had so many resolutions like verse that they have gone through okay so if you wanted to put a time frame on that I 'm sure we could add something to that resolution we 've got a time frame of six months for the temporary alcohol ban it would be reasonable to expect that work to be done within the same six months so that at the same time as we 're considering whether we extend the alcohol ban there 's other work that we could or should be doing or that others could or should be doing right thank you can I suggest that the council also rights to New Zealand posts around the loss of the post shop we 're straying well outside of the issues around a temporary liquor ban have we got other questions at the table others are about the temporary liquor ban jimang and I think everybody acknowledges that there is a risk of displacement but those that have been through this process before believe that the displacement is unlikely to be the whole issue going from one place simply to another but there 's little effect to some extent because as was mentioned earlier a citywide alcohol ban would be ultra virus so we can 't consider that as an option and we have to focus on areas where there 's clearly an issue that we need to address and that this tool is the best way of addressing their issues thank you um this is great to be hearing this discussion is we 're going to be looking at the Christchurch alcoholism claim in a while so it 's very good and it 's great to see that the focus on collaboration and working in partnership with all the agencies that are involved and looking at the big picture as well as just wondering how you 're going to evaluate this after the six months what kind of things will you be looking for what will what will look like success for you and we 'll be talking again with the the groups that we 've hit the chance to talk with so far so the police Tafari Roy Mata the staff at the Linwood center of the collector for the homeless and it 'll be very much a mix of qualitative and quantitative assessment so the police will have data on how things are looking from their side but also a qualitative assessment of whether the issues have receded in the area and I think everybody else will have views and they will also inevitably be an element of how the alcohol ban is fitting with more community-based approaches so the idea is this sets a new normal if you like from which those other initiatives can start to build right thank you very much so now moving from questions into debate do I have a mover for this item deal seconded by an okay so yep yep so that 's its partner agencies but I just wanted to explicitly it like the police into their dispersed so you want to add wording to work with Safari Roy matter the police and other partner agencies if we complete add those words a noun as the seconder you 're happy with that fantastic okay good thank you okay so now moving into debate we 've got Dion Pauline Aaron Yanni and okay can we run a tennis as well I 'll be quick thank you I 'll support this motion to put a teen free alcohol ban and we will be working to also you know with the partner agencies to look at the impacts of us and actually understand what we can do if we need a permanent one or what not the issues in Lynnwood village Stanmore road are quite challenging there are a number of social issues around the whole area and drugs are a big issue but but drinking is an issue that 's been identified by a lot of people in the community and I was just writing down who I 've spoken to that of that supports that the local businesses supported the investors who are listed in the area are supporting it and want it for certainty around sort of the long term investment in the area many of the residents are bound by the area that I 've spoken to a support at the homeless have spoken in support of this I think it 's it 's a it 's a positive move forward that we can actually take today to actually start to look at addressing some of the other issues that are actually in Lynwood Village at the moment I want a seedling wood village succeed I think all of us want to see the Luna village succeed which is why we sort of put the regeneration strategy around and have funded TIF I did or motor to work with the partner agencies regenerate to actually make that happen and I think without doing this we 're sort of like it 's frightening people to actually say I want to be part of inward village and the the drug issue is something that I really want to tackle next year with whoever something we 've got to put a stuff our foot down it 's this is the tip of the iceberg that we 're seeing today we 'll see now there 's a whole lot of other stuff in the communities but today we 're looking at the liquor bin it is an issue there 's a lot of support for out there in our local community who want that and I hope that this goes through so that we can actually start working longer term to actually get those solutions through palling I agree with what Dionne saying they ended because it 's been originated from the community broad and it does seem to have a lot of community support I 'm prepared to to support it as a temporary measure I wouldn 't like it to see it become per se permanent I really would look forward to watching the results and I 'm more in favor of supporting the community development and community activation so that perhaps the problem resolves itself in that way or the community resolves that so today I will support the temporary Erin I that was raised earlier around the toilets the sooner that they 're open and open 24 hour and the bitter end the we also need to look at a couple of spots around the city where we supply showers next to the toilet blocks would just make sense it 's the humane thing to do give homeless people the opportunity to be clean and dignified as often as possible was often as they want to be on the liquor ban I will support this I generally support all the commands that go through because I don 't see drinking in public places as an overly great outcome for the city I 've never seen it work anywhere I hear about these picnics where you take a wine down to the beach or to a park and enjoy yourself burger or people do that to be honest mostly and people say that this you need to show problems to have a liquor ban I can find you problems in every single neighborhood in this city where there are problems with alcohol and drinking in public and then the so-called rich neighborhoods Narron lien parties in those neighborhoods can get out of control and you can have a ton of kids turn up off social media and start drinking Woodstock 's in your street and having an liquor ban would help across the entire city drinking in a public in the middle of the night never has a good outcome taking a box of Woody 's anywhere with your mates and then getting boost and intimidating people doesn 't have a good outcome and this isn 't just a homeless people problem tradesmen dot businessman dot rugby head start it 's a common problem across our entire city and we 've got us grass at some point and stop drinking in public drink at your own place drink at your club and drink in a bar where there 's a licensed manager who can tell you how to behave when you get out of control yawning thank you yeah I think councillor swags really showed the indication of support and I know councillors have raised concerns about the consultation but at our community board we actually heard from a wide range of there has been I think you know some consultation with people that are affected and this is just a temporary measure to work through and do the evaluation which I think the long-term solutions still need to be found for this area I think you know one of the tragedies is that the Lynwood Art Center was one of the first council buildings that we fixed after the earthquake so we saw the value of doing something in this area really quickly but unfortunately the magnitude of the problem which we were alerted to post earthquake that the poorest communities bear the biggest brunt of the cost and the effects and we really need to be mindful of have seemingly been I think neglected for at least five years and you know that 's been I think that 's a bit of a damning indictment on us in terms of the central city blueprint as a society which is really focused on protecting property values in the central city and an gentrification along the eastern frame at the expense of these communities who lost huge amounts of housing for people nothing being replaced over the last five years and you know let 's let 's hope today that this is the start of a change of a mindset as a city that we 're putting value and actually finding community solutions in this area which as I said was and as one of the poorest urban areas in New Zealand and yet has struggled to get anywhere near like the resources that we 've put under central city development that you know the tens of millions that we 've given away to developers and the for elves versus lack of investment in the serious so I look forward to number four coming back to us the board has asked previously for really clear timeframes and actions so that we can measure what 's happening and I would just encourage under four that we do take a wide approach we actually do talk to the new government who I think will be much more people focused around the loss of things like the work and income officers that used to be there like that the government-owned bank and the post shop solutions working west central government with the community and the council together so we just need to make sure that it 's a commitment and not lose sight of the fact that we 've got this temporary been in place and that 's the only thing we 're going to do we must be focused on those other things as well thank you and today come from the community board who are concerned around community safety and are recognizing the ongoing harm that has been caused by alcohol and this been is another tool that we can use and the fight against the harm that alcohol does in this community so it 's a six month trial and it will give us an opportunity to test and evaluate whether this is will achieve what we want to achieve in our strategy our proposed strategic framework states that we want to achieve to give us strong communities that have a strong sense of community that are safe and healthy and value the voices of our children and young people we heard that from Adrienne today so this is an example too the police and the community and it 's exciting to see what 's happening in this in this place it feeds beautifully into our discussion about the Christchurch alcohol action plan which will be just will be discussing and endorsing soon and it provides a strong ethic immunity we are saying loudly and clearly that we are wanting to stand up against the harm the alcohol is causing in our community so strongly endorse it that 's a for this thank you I 'm also happy to support this is a temporary measure clearly it allows us to deal with some some serious issues in this area soon rather than later it also provides a window of opportunity for us to do some more work with the community to work out what a permanent solution here might look like and I certainly note the comments made by Tafari Roy Mata regarding and community engagement and the approach to dealing with wider issues and I 'm pleased to see that picked up in item four of our resolutions today and with a time frame around that and also in fact with have got a strong view on this and I 'm certainly taking a strong steer from the local community led by the community board that this is what 's required at least on a temporary basis and I certainly look forward to the work in paragraph four been done of the community board having the opportunity to consider what the next steps might be both what council is able to do and what other age agencies are able to do and what the community is actually able to do to take ownership of what happens in their own area for themselves so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much thank you can I just say one more thing and we 've had to work pretty hard to get this to council prior to Christmas for consideration to cover the summer period the people we 've worked with so the collective of homeless impaired Ferry really matter the police have all given the time at very short notice and we 're very thankful for the assistance they 've given us so you as staff and thank you to the other agencies that have worked so hard to make this happen it 's been good that we 've been able to debate it today so thank you very much indeed for the effort and time that you put into it thank you absolutely absolutely all right so _"

    "text": "participation we 've got no public forum participants this morning but we do have three deputations by appointments all of which relate to item 40 on today 's agenda the proposed temporary alcohol ban in the Lynwood Village area so three deputations the first of which is four from Tafari Roy Mata the second of which is from the collective of the homeless and the third of which is from the New Zealand Police so if I could please invite representatives Jenny Smith and Jamie Stevenson from Tafari Roy Mata to the table please thank you for joining us to provide this ten-minute deputation we have set 10 minutes aside so if you wanted to allow time for any questions you would need to make sure that you did that within the ten minutes allocated thank you today it 's not to prevent and trust with the task of ensuring a diversity of community views and community solutions able to be brought to the fore is a consequence of your support for a community lead revitalization plan for the inner-city neighborhoods there is no denying that public safety at the been faced fear are complex long-standing and multifaceted our work with the inner city Eastland wood neighborhood means we are very familiar with the challenges faced we recognize there is a need to do something what needs to be done and how does this is done requires thoughtful consideration the complexity of the issue suggests there is not one quick fix solution what is of concern to us is that the process followed has allowed consideration to be given to one option a TV alcohol ban and without the whole community being able to discuss and explore what other options could be considered likewise consideration has been has not been able to be governed to the wider issues that are contributing to the situation the years of monetarist policies which has created inequality the punitive welfare state approach favoured by recent governments the impact of the quakes on the area and in particular the significance of the loss of almost all the bead certs which has housed a large number of single low-income people in the area the proliferation of alcohol outlets in the neighborhood in the loss of key the impact on the businesses of months of roadworks this year equally concerning is that the solution proposed has been imposed from outside such an approach is contrary to the community leader approach of the revitalization plan and what it seeks to model we fear that the solution proposed will only deal with part of the problem alcohol and not the more challenging issue of widespread drug taking especially the use of some t-shirts we note that the solution proposed is a fifth time that the street people have been moved on as part of the community 's effort to deal with the presenting issues at some point we as especially need to find a way to ensure that the needs and vulnerabilities of the street people are taken seriously and that instead of moving people on the series consideration has heard about what underlies the position they are in thought also needs to be governed to the historical significant role that the inner city East has played and the lives of the street people it is here that they find the fina WA in defano regardless of where they for these two important reasons and mention the N of the inner city Eastern Loma community have been able to explore and discuss the issues and possible options in such a way that recognized the rights of the residents to feel safe at the same time assuring the needs of the street people were in some way addressed maybe a when one solution for all may well have been achieved we know from the recent community survey that local residents welcomed being able to have positive interactions with the police and we 're in support of a community police strategy which saw the police provide a positive presence at the village if such an approach was combined with enlisting the support of Maori wardens and local commercial backed up by a street worker and people with loved experience sit alongside the act of and port of the street people while providing positive opportunities to enable them to be involved could it be that such a ban would not be needed credit must be governed to the leadership of the street people who in the last few weeks have come up should then attempt even be proved today we would urge that before making this permanent that as broader range of community viewers are able to be canvassed as well as giving consideration to a wider range of options over and above an alcohol ban and reviewing the effectiveness of the ban consideration has also governed to the impact of the loss of the beachside housing in this community as well as evaluating the effectiveness of the disbursement approach favoured by the police when dealing with public else alcohol use in a neighbourhood such as the inner city East as compared with the Central City or the containment of alcohol at public events we would also urge the police to work alongside the community in a proactive facilitative way should attempt Leben be imposed only using their police powers as a last resort while we recognize that the revitalization plan is still in its infancy we would hope that in future such as uses this can be brought to it for consideration by the whole inner city east landlord community thank you thank you very much indeed and that does leave 'm Erin yeah I 've just just around so just to clarify you 're not that supportive of an alcohol ban you 're okay with it at this point to see how it goes but not necessarily is it correct yeah we really not Satan we we sat on a baby we 're really saying we we 're commenting about the process and about recognizing that there are shoes and how could we get a solution that locked it being able to acknowledge the safety issues while also recognizing the needs of the people of this area of the of the street people so did you think of an abandoned one area we 'll just move them somewhere else so you neither need a ban for the whole city or would not really look at something totally different because this is the first time that people have been moved Cathedral Square letter masks we 're for a veneer ease to the landward village and we next of the question we 're asking like this at the same time is recognizing there is a safety concerns thank you okay let 's time so if we can keep questions concise so that we can keep to within the ten minutes Dion Pauline and then Phil so when I first got elected and this was late last year knowing she was it was late last year the conversation of an alcohol ban happened then went to the community board and you opposed it at that point in time what work happened between then and now yes so there was there was alcohol conversation around an alcohol ban at the community board for the area really early when I still got elected under staff and and they said that not part of the report was it that spoken to the community and got the views of everybody but I just wanted to know from back then that was bad and it stalls so it hasn 't changed I mean what is there any work that had has been done between now and or between then and now that you have done or that the community has done I think we can acknowledge being Deloitte Johnston for the week that she has done with the would say that it is not is is difficult is it his this time last year in the summer months it was really challenging it is karma and peaceful with Brenda 's help she has been able to talk with the people on the streets and there 's a lot more respect that we have seen not saying that fights occasionally don 't happen or other difficulties don 't happen but from where we sit we 're seeing a more calm a period at the moment this is completely contrary to how I do feel about when I okay let 's let 's just take questions we 've got limited time so Pauline and then Phil there 's a number able to and the other thing is do you feel that this probably should go and fill this will be the last question we 've got time for just that if there 's a tip say there 's the council greet a temporary alcohol being chilly but you indicated that in fact sort of police intervention might be a last resort but you also really seem to be saying look and in local commercial I assume you were saying what the place I 'm just not quite sure how that would work especially if we help how could it work especially if we do have temporary alcohol being a range of things so that if the ban was in place it was the last resort and obviously if this disorder we 're not saying it 's got to be dealt with and we 're saying that maybe there are some past year that the police either need already got that they can exist allowed to deal with the bigger problem is the drug issue don 't see a show for us that we see and we 're saying a combined approaches what 's required I guess yeah I guess know the answer the question um I guess yeah I guess there 's probably within the I mean we 've already just had conversations this morning and seen the resourcefulness of the community and approaching in these things and so I think everyone agrees that there 's there 's a range of issues that need to be dealt with but to who would affect and other people who live in the community to see what they think is the best way to handle it with comments about with multi Wardens with possibly police if that 's what people prefer but that that conversation hasn 't yet fully taken place it 's in the community all right thank you very much indeed for the deputation and thanks very much for providing full answers to those questions as well thanks for joining us this morning thank you so if I can now call our second deputation representatives of the collective of the homeless if you 'd like to come to the table place so Brenda Lee Johnson good to have you with us good to see you could you please introduce or have the others in your team introduce themselves hello my name 's and cue please great thank you very much so thanks for joining us to make your ten-minute deputation this morning you have ten minutes and if you wanted to allow time for any questions that would be within that ten minute period thank you it can be like a lived in the area I raised my children name and they went to the shops there was no big crowd of people drinking and argue so I don 't favor of keeping that place clear and the paths and as a homeless we could roam anywhere else leave Lynwood and stand with a stammer road alone well cook we 're gonna have a little pan there we want to be sure that no more I 'm looking Shops coming underneath us I promise no we leave by 30 sorry open 24 hours that 's a biggie to us and why you shops maybe a pet shop is they closed down the first paint in KiwiSaver another bank would be nicely as with the liquor ban we 've already implemented it and now very nice I 've told everybody it started last fighting my stone the same favor of it decoration thank you is there more presentation or do we move to questions now okay let 's uh move to questions from counselors attempt so open thank you very much so your idea would be a full I thought 24-hour seven-day-a-week that council could do also supplied good toilets or good facilities 24 hours is it right well it 'd be a shade of you know you look a bit we have at least for hygiene they look good morning 9 o 'clock all the public toilets even around in the morning because we do there because we have problems of vandalism but if we take the alcohol there 's a ban dia and you guys take responsibility that would be the ideal solution would not do think it 's I would rather be you guys bathe more money on paint to get rid of graffiti then locking the doors it picking out pcs in the back yeah cool thank you Yanni thank you thank you for coming in to all three of you I really appreciate it is it is there anything else we 've just heard from the previous deputation that alcohol been only really big one sort of thing that we consider is there anything else you 've talked about the toilets but as it any other ideas that you have about how we could be supportive for you guys do all get together and outlaw synthetic drugs make it illegal it 's it 's big problem on the streets now it 's big I wanna get rid of the synthetics bar or whatever and the shop state Senate there 's a couple of shops selling it stool instead and that 's a bigger problem I 'm Erin and then Glen yes so your point about the the liquor ban and you mentioned parks as well but the deputation before said that it will just move the problem elsewhere would it be more helpful to the homeless community if we had a liquor ban across all public spaces including parks throughout in the entire city or not my opinion would be not just packed in the strategic places close to the shopping centers that 's it 's the only places you really need rounded drinking around the shopping centers it 's all right for them to go down and tell pack okay well let everybody have a wine and listen to music in the pack packs are safer for the community if everyone 's drinking down it I okay and also with them with the toilet situation would it not be a good thing if the toilet block head a couple of showers attached to that would be fantastic handicap fun toy list because they cut up showers in it for you so we could easily hide use another big problem on the streets clean I think you took you talked about look around let 's so we 're dealing with something short to him today but I think you 're talking in the big picture about look at outlets did I hear you right yes you want those reduce them yes well why put a lookout outlet in a little bit nerium let 's see yeah we don 't want him those things to come back into the community if we want to tidy up dr.mini we need like good shops raised the wood shop fish shop oh and the police place being in fact the bank yeah that 's easy enough keep a thing it 's without walk all the way to limit and Cannell people appreciate it tick they just get to the place we so that could be something that we consider as location of and thank you so much for coming in and you 're very eloquent Adrienne thank you for sharing with us it 's great to have your perspective and you said that your children you brought your children up in the area and they were able to move safely around the community at that time have you thought about what else could help the community became to become your community the community we 're talking about to become safer for our children for our young people what else could be view I want a fun word but it did makes a big playground entertainment place every other cities got a fun room we got nothing really our kids do yeah market mazes that places we got but we can make things better Sandra Lee terrain Boise well we haven 't got anything in Christ it 's similar so at the moment do you feel that it 's it 's safe for kids to walk to the d-r-e to their shops and around the area it wasn 't before because they fight it just started true alcohol better they not there the kids would be safe great thank you very much thank you for bringing the deputation to us this morning thanks for sharing your thoughts with us and thanks for your detailed answers to those questions as well thank you very much indeed thank you so our third deputation is from New Zealand police inspector Richard Bruce area prevention manager Christchurch Metro and Colonel Ross from New Zealand police on this same item thank you very much indeed for joining us welcome to the table as with the other deputations you have ten minutes and that would include time for questions thank you thank you very much I 'm Richard Bruce on the inspector in charge of alcohol harm and the community constables for Christchurch metro area that 's my reason for being here and with me as Connell Ross was one of our constables on the community in South Central I 'm community team so he 's actively working in that area I 'm every day of the week I 'm thank you for hearing us at such priority work they 've put on and getting us to you so quickly and we are here to speak in support of an alcohol ban in the area because of the community concerns I wish for the community to be safe and feel safe and then what I know about the alcohol issues in the area from our community place team I 'm an alcohol been from a police perspective as a youthful early intervention tool for place to deal with potential offenders before another offence has to be committed before we can intervene it 's a prevention tool for us it also assists and reducing victimization by doing with alcohol related harm purely for four metres have to escalate and we support the wider approach of a community approach working with place as well to resolve issues we know that an alcohol ban is not the sole way to deal with issues within the community but as an effective tool for us to take action with in summary we fully support the been we 're prepared to enforce it if we have to and we see it as a way give connell a minute or so just to talk about his first 10 observations of having been there down there for at least a year I mean what he 's seen that relates to alcohol and the issues around community safety and what 's going on in the area then we 'll open for any questions thank you so about the last year I 've been patrolling through that area and what I 'm looking for the area without une asked me what what am i doing about the problems in relation to alcohol in the area so through that I sort of went went back to other police officers and talked about what 's been going on within the area and it 's brought to my attention this is a problem that 's been civil several years so they made it very clear to me that they feel let down by the police by by one they feel like they 're not being listened to and they feel like the problems in relation to particularly alcohol not being addressed now every day that I 'm down there will be not say that every day their mess groups drinking but there is always people one or two three along the street to the road that are drinking and when the warmer weather where things get particularly bad and in terms of the effects of the alcohol you 'll have ten to sixteen people normally males between 40 and 60 years old drinking and obviously they get to the point where criminal activity starts taking place now I guess for for for me it 'd be good to have the tall one place we could speak to them early on to prevent them from drinking and the area so that keeps that point where where they start victimizing people because at the end of the day that 's our rock we don 't receive people victimized thank you okay so we 'll then move to questions so I 've got Mike Pauline Dion Phil thanks I 'll just look at the met where the beds gonna be put in place and their borders on our Marsh Street just down the road obviously peevly Department Lake rad this is potentially having this hidden on the streets today part sure I 'm so previous work that I 've done on displacement indicates it doesn 't displace at the same rate so the reason we supported a wider been there was taught previously of having a limit had been more within numbers of some of the streets down there but we think that the way that a unbalanced that 's drilled out which is already a lack of any area we we think that the wider been that we 've put in place of armor and here are all sort and what actually deal with those issues we thought of efforts restricted to just the stem will Road or show and if when you do I think increase the chance of people just stepping outside of an area drinking and coming back and so we think that this is a sure there may be displacement but we don 't think it will displace at the same rate I guess my question is is it wide enough like should have forgot to have gone to the actual river to try capture their turn but that is got a playground and and I guess at the same liners actually do you think and look at man like this could work across the city as a whole instead of just an individual areas no nothing a look at being can work across the city from the previous work we 've done that because you 've got to show relation to alcohol harmed you can 't really my understanding is you can 't predict have been across a whole study to deal with the issue you 've got to have a targeted clear ISM and so what about pushing it out to have inside army Ryan I think that would could be an option for later on we we were happy to have this area as it was we thought that was wide enough to deal with the issues that we 've got under perhaps of it some granted today we looked at later on for a permanent ban there could be we considered potentially thank you Pauline yes we do um and I can say to you that we will enforce it but obviously we do show there 's a power of a wrist that does go with it for certain circumstances but we will have staff down there we 've had our team down there for a long time now and so we will be able to enforce it but obviously we work in a discretionary way and what we 're trying to do is solve the issue so that 's how we 'll deal with it so if you 've had a team down you 'll really why do you not have any tools to deal with issues we do have talk but what we 've got to wait for is an offense to be committed so this is an early intervention tool where the drinking of alcohol in the public place is the chance for us to get in there early and deal with it whereas if we don 't have that or what we have to wait for someone to be assaulted someone to be whatever offense has to happen before we can intervene and that 's too late and we would rather get in there early and stop the offending using a been Thank You Dion Phil and then an the first the fist deputation mentioned around the the the enforcement of police like coming out with a heavy stick and saying this is going to be the band area is there gonna be a bit like like kind of like what did they do in the Philips town sort of community area where it 's bit more sort of like working with the communities and stuff like that are you guys going to be working the Earl 's it just going to be enforcement they 're common at those community groups that was to work then we 'll whip with them certainly we would favor a joint approach to doing with us there will be staff in there doing this you know and there will be chances of we risk potentially so I can 't_''_1646.09 say that there won 't be but you know discretion is our the way we operate would hope we trust our staff to do the right thing when they do these jobs so everything will be honest circumstances but you know our main aim is to the associated issues that go with that and so I suppose we 'll just take an approach that 's appropriate all the more good Facebook 's and then the other question is we were told by the second imputation that that synthetics are a real problem is that on your radar and and I mean I spoke to you earlier and said it 's going to be next year I 'm gonna sort of work to try and sort of people together but is there any work ongoing or will this help having an alcohol ban to actually help some of those issues as well well I think the issue here is the alcohol beans I prefer just to talk about that at the moment but this we think that if this is we support the services granted today and were approved within this will give us a really good tool to deal with issues in the area thank you okay so I 've got Phil and and Tim and that 'll be all the questions that we 've got time for so Phil thank you Richard and Colonel can that 's about the sort of combined approach that we might have because think that some of us are interested in it so and it was reference made earlier in the deputation from Tafari of matter around that for example the Maori wardens in local kumara so this morning how might that work with you the police say working alongside the motor wardens is there a way is the potential to have good collaboration in this area certainly I think there was enough community groups was to come to us and and we work with Mary wardens we 're more than happy to UM have foot patrols in the area for example and with other agencies and to deal with this sort of issue so we understand that an alcohol ban by itself is not the way to deal with issues we want to a wider community approach and we would have please support a big huddle thank you and Anne in terms of just I believe that you have a a system where you have a kind of a graduated response system to the situation so just quickly talk is under the influence of alcohol what what how does it work in terms of how do you deal with them what 's the sort of process in terms of dealing with people so sometimes we people might have the impression that there 's a stick used a heavy-handed approach so can you just talk us through if you get called to a situation where someone is intoxicated how do you deal with them are you talking in terms like oh pain was interesting now fortunately it 's right yeah peacefully and I 'd like to take this to the same point police officers you you want to deescalate the situation right from the start expect that I have a son I 'm not sure if you 're we 're or not this is a look at Bay Area which means you can 't you can 't drink alcohol man here you give them the opportunity to so yeah fine oh you know I 'll get rid of the alcohol however well aware that there are certain how called members of the public that just like to be confrontational towards of affect approach to them and people potentially that person may well be I 've issued with ticket or effects not appropriate of the behavior escalates from there being potentially they could be arrested the other option is if they live nearby can be more than happy just say hey listen to this in alcohol area if you want to drink your help we 're more than happy to drop you around home if it 's just around the corner and you can track your home my understanding is that you 're wanting to build trust and confidence in the community and they a recent survey hit eighty percent trust and confidence from the people of Christchurch near wanting to get that up to 90 percent which is fantastic so it 's about that relationship isn 't it and sort of forming those trusting relationships region it 's about feeling safe community yep yeah thank you alright and Tim you 're happy yep great okay so thank you very much indeed for the deputation and again for the the detailed answers to questions that we input by councillors thank you staff on this paper I intend to move directly to this paper so that we can debate it while the people that have made the deputations are in the room other questions for staff yes okay so if we _"

    "text": "say okay I think the main the main issue was was whether or not you know the the cost savings that had been identified in bowels Creek or actual savings or whether we 're deferring anything as the bells Creek project affected in any way shape or form yes it 's all of those questions you know yeah so I 'll leave that to you okay thank you thank you very much well obviously this is disappointing to to have to come to you today to to say that the Dudley Creek project is forecast to run over budget at the same time I 've been very pleased that we have met our objectives in terms of reducing flood risk and a timely fashion the forecast now is 2.2 million dollars over and obviously to complete the project in regards in Albans Creek and Shirley stream we do require the additional funding in order to meet those obligations overall was this a this is a very large amount of money and in absolute terms it is less than five percent of the overall budget they overspend on this the the land drainage recovery program the project that we identified for those savings is Bell 's Creek Bell 's Creek if I can just be clear so they the project is well advanced and substantially completed at the moment however there is there was money set aside for a second phase as there 's a second flood risk area within that catchment they are what we 've identified is that that second area is largely well almost exclusively commercial and would require an all likelihood a pump station something at excessive six or seven million dollars the budget we have remaining in terms of saving for meeting out the lanterns recovery program objectives is in the order of two million so what we were what we 'd haven 't previously discussed this with the working group we suggested that we would in completing the citywide model we would identify when we 've done that all the commercial areas at flood risk across the city so that we could identify what would be required to how much that would cost and so that that could be presented to Council in terms of don 't have obligations to to meet those flood risks that falls on the commercial owners and operators so that would require change in councils policies and levels of service and if met from the laundry and recovery program would require prioritization against the schemes were putting forward with residential above floor flood risk so that would become a future decision for council to make so in in identifying this this serving and spells Creek this would have no impact upon that immediate proposal and as and when were able to come back to Council that would then give an opportunity if that 's decided by Council to proceed then we would probably budget for that at that time so why was it included in the in the residential drainage program when it was a commercial area and you knew that right from the get-go we didn 't fully appreciate that at that stage on the investigation was carried out and looked at the areas it did identify a second flood area and when when that was interrogated and analyzed and modeled down that 's when we identified that as so it was it 's um in terms of the scope it didn 't didn 't meet the initial scope and that 's why we separated into second phase in order to understand what other commercial at risk properties they are across the city so you knew it point that it didn 't meet the scope but it remained in the program throughout in your plan process yes we had anticipated by this stage we would have the citywide model in place and that we would have been able to identify all those properties across the city we 're not quite at that point just yet and so on that basis we don 't feel that we could expect to reasonably get agreement and commit to spend against that money next financial year and financial year 19 so in that sense if we if we continue as it is we would have budget next year against Bell 's Creek that we wouldn 't spend against so this would be an opportunity to use that unspent money to fund the silver spend on Dudley Creek and then as and when we report to Council for that secondary stage and yes I think you 're not getting my drift well sorry which is if you knew this months ago why didn 't you take it out of the budget for the annual plan that we 've just done well the annual plan only deals with the current year this is for next financial year to bring it back so the other plan couldn 't couldn 't change that so what exactly are you talking about the commercial where it 's around Fitzgerald opener around with Fitzgerald oven you Fitzgerald Avenue which which which part of its you 're telling you to have a look at that sorry I canceled your Hansen you so you might serve me look up you you 're familiar with this and the area that 's mentioned is which council paper are you looking at yeah this is the bells create information on the council website and it just makes reference to further investigations underway to identify options for reducing flood risk and more House of Ferry Road McKenzie Irvin turbot Street and that 's areas listed as gonna ask a clarification or the error as well because I know we 've had chills straight and Fitzgerald and Duke Street has been an issue I think chairman Fitzgerald us that was the area that the area where the most of the the above floor flooding is occurring and other commercial natural properties yeah and that 's when I think the mayor 's office was contacted about as well like two years ago and another us as local cancers were we 're contacted as well so that I mean the question I had was we 're as the where is that type of information around that commercial wasn 't actually we 're not protecting commercial I mean it 's the first I 've heard about it well I mean with prioritizing it because I mean they 're still ratepayers ya know but we don 't know that we 're doing the entire land drainage recovery program based on priorities this is residential is the priority so we 're happy to come back in in future with the report identifying all the commercial at-risk properties across the city once we a proposal and recommendations as to how you might consider that I 'm just really I just worry about taking money from Bell Street Stage two without getting a really good explanation about what the risks are and what works we could look at doing in the in the short term to address some of that stuff well whether we can make a call around the priority but at the moment I don 't understand how we can make a priority decision without that information but I 'd be very reluctant to take that money off said this is to protect residential the one that we 've got in front of us yes so the London 's recovery program is to protect residential and Dudley Creek that 's what it seeks to do but how many has an air exposed if we didn 't do this and this this proposal for tilde Creek so they we 've we 've started works in st. Albans Creek and Shirley stream so the the the commitment has already been made to to commence those works we have done that this this funding is stop work now then there would be we 'd have to close down shut down the sites and we 'd leave the works unfinished we know when did you know that it was going to be over budget by 2.2 million so it was very recently we understood that it went above budget they what we have is a very complex a large and complex budget where we 've been working in different work packages which have been running in parallel and overlapping with each other so they the work packages have been started and commenced within budget but the the work packages that already been advanced we 've had some variations and some cost increases with those so they 've come in as we 've been progressing other packages we 've been working on up to I think it 's six fronts at any one time at its maximum and so managing these together we 've been able to do that within the budget overall and within the contingency but it 's only very recently that we 've understood that our forecasters takes above I just point out we is still this is the forecasting for the remaining works that we have that take it to over budget Sarah Jimmy I 'm just wondering okay I know that there are some clearly some a few time pressures and stuff on us so I 'm wondering out why it hasn 't actually come through the ITA committee so they so we did report the overspend to the AC committee I think a meeting before last session Jimmy okay you mentioned earlier to the mayor 's 2.2 million dollars is a forecaster yes and moment is under spender but if this 2.2 million is not sufficient you played on how how to mitigate this effect so we 've been working very hard to to to find savings and the remaining works and to keep the keep the cost down the 2.2 million forecast overspend does include some contingency in itself so we expect that this we will be able to keep within this this new budget figure that they are um well I think there was partly what I was gonna ask is where was the contingent what was the contingency set was something in the order of about 10 percent that that was a little bit lower than it would normally be but at the time we 'd gone through several stages of council reports while we 're still developing the downstream options and the figure that we 'd we 'd originally anticipated we believe that we could work within that so we 've we 've we 've held to the original budget as a set and if we hadn 't had these these late changes and variances come through we were expecting that we would have kept within budget so the original budget without contingency would have been 45 million without contingency about that yes and so you 've already used up the entire budget and now you 're starting to go into contingents contingency already yes effectively yes and you 're asking for another 2.2 on top of the contingency particularly on on a project this size in this complexity because you 're going into a brownfield scenario you 're not a greenfield scenario we are living in areas where we 've got live streams we 've got a 15% contingency on a program like that would not be on a normal or unrealistic we were going through a lot of very big developed properties Sarah may be coming back to your questions about why I didn 't come to witty the main decision-making body who approved this contract was council so that 's why we 've brought the variation back to council because you approve this contract so we believe you 're the right body to do that we are trying obviously to fast-track you as fast as we can we 've got contractors on site we would rather try and see if we give this through rather than put a delay in proceedings and going through so one of the things when we draw down from the land drainage program or any program we try and keep as much contingency in the program bucket rather than in the project bucket because all of a sudden you get you could maybe by keeping the contingency centralized you may get another project that 's able to go ahead and so it helps you to give that delivery time and I don 't know how many land drainage projects I 've got running at the moment basically it would actually lock up quite a bit of funding and it would give us a lot less make us less nimble and so in programs try and hold that contingency back and we won 't get changes that will actually at the end of a project put some of those contingencies back in to the program that will be available for future programs but why was that not I mean but what my point is that I think the ratepayers deserve to know exactly how much these projects are going to cost within the contingency at the time that their scope down and I think it 's really difficult for people especially with the pressures that we 're under at the moment to sort of keep coming back and saying we 've got to get another 2.2 million dollars on top of the contingency that was already in the budget at the time that you made the budget you should have said that there was we need more contingency or something we could certainly do that but it would mean that we would do a full design and we 'll get that full design cost which would slow the whole process down and I could actually do we could do a traditional design and build but what we 're doing and most of our contracts is what we call early contract involvement so that we can look and actually try and bring in innovation into it and with innovation you are assuring some of that risk but I would say if I went and did that traditional thing I 'll probably come back to you with a figure which will be another five or ten million on top of what you do because we would have had to design the thing right to the nth degree then get a price and come back to you with a lump sum price and I don 't think that would be good for the ratepayers all good for um basically delivering this program as quickly as we possibly can and some people would be saying it 's not quick enough really I got one kind of on that David bullet point to under 5.8 it looks like it 's good scoped it out which I imagine included the contingency and we of course were part of skirt through the client governance group but in effect they were delegated this project along with hundreds so did the actual financial scoping it you know that was conducted by them so I think you said that 's how it reads this was delivered by skirt on behalf of Council but was fully funded by the daily preview there are a few projects that went through scoot because of they were working in the area and it made sense to instead of having two contractors working and and so there were some projects that we gave to skirt as part of our land drainage because they 're the best this was part of one of those projects obviously they have different structures of costings and overheads and so there was part of this program if you remember the way we did it we came to you and we let down us as a league contract but we did in little bits of stages as we develop the program so to get things going we started and I can 't remember what the first package was two million seven million or something like that and they were being given to try and accelerate the program in the meantime we also gave a little bit to scoot because they were doing they must have been doing a watermain or a sewer mate the big I remember what it was called down there and it was just logical for them to do that a lot of works down here so it was it was so I guess they 're continuously really rested with them at the time no they got a 16 of work to do okay that got charged a hundred percent back to us because the crown wouldn 't say it 's not part of they are saying the land drainage programs not part of earthquake I would argue that it really what we do it is because of the earthquake but they 've made it ineligible but it made sense for us to do the two together and extras that they did get added in so there was a component scant work on a base cost which was very transparent and then a limb one limb to limb three on top of that so the limb one is around over here swim toes around profit but it 's all very very transparent so yeah just going back to Belle 's Creek I 've got two questions about stage one and stage two the I 'll start with a more simple one which is the stage two which is there 's a huge residential area in that but you 've just talked about the commercial so that the residential area from Tibet street McKenzie back from the Heathcote which a number of Scott have seen the Facebook our comments when it when it flooded in the most recent you know flooding events is that area still being addressed through other projects or is that part of stage two because in the map that we 've got that 's part of stage two I 'd love to I 'd have to check on that I 'm afraid to check the have a number of catchment areas so all the city is covered in uncertain catchments this the second stage of Bell 's Creek particularly refers to the necessary pump station that would be required for around the chin street Fitzgerald Avenue area but we we are picking up other areas and within other projects that will work through laundries recovery program is a very large program that will you know respond several decades and it 's as we get the knowledge and understanding will be helping to you to prioritize in regards to stage two if some of us were concerned until we get further information in terms of allocating money from that to this project is there any other budget or program that we could take that money from so that Dudley Creek hasn 't stopped but actually continues there is but that would require taking money from from this year for projects such as the the line drains repairs and other other work such as that Dudley tributaries we have some some funding in that so there 's others that we can call upon but that 's potentially so we we do have this is now identified serving against next year we wouldn 't be expecting to spend against it next year I not your point about not wanting to lose its place and priority but it 's we need to see how it fits in with everything else and we 're happy to report back on that side I think I think I mean it probably would have been useful just to hear a little bit more detail about what was coming out rather than just what what it was just identifying it as savings because that 's what I 've struggled with in terms of the paper is understanding what 's what what the citizen receiving is it worthwhile noting that as part of stage two of the some of the resolutions don 't even indicate where it 's come from so that is part of stage two of the bells Creek work that all program debt a was at a pumping station we expected this stage would be a plumbing station in which case that would far exceed the available budget in any regard say it 's a sin against committed bells Creek works as we have it the the scope of the the brief we have is to return that bells Creek catchment to pre Creek lovers a third risk with the prioritized based upon a both floor residential flooding because that area now we 've investigated it doesn 't include it we 've we 've we 've shown it as a stage two but effectively with it doesn 't fit within the scope of the work which is why we 're identifying it as a serving in that regard I think that it almost needs to be put forward as a new project and so on right because of the the nature of it and that 's something in discussion with the working group we we said that we would look at all the commercial risk across the city in order to to consider those priorities yeah but all that ceases dot point the additional spend is to be met from savings that have been identified in the bells Creek project the money is currently budgeted for a spendin FY nineteen and will makes it sound as a there were savings to a an existing project but that 's not what we 're hearing what you 've identified is that within the further investigation week that you 've done into the project you 've discovered that a significant overspend would occur in an area that 's not authorized by the program it would be another spend of council decided to progress with that option you haven 't got the authority we haven 't got you for that because we have we have not included non-residential in us but I guess the Yanni 's question is is there any reason intial included on it and the charm Street intersection is the one that several people have emailed about well then you 've got a conflict of interest state stage one we are going to deliver for the 18 million and that 's all done it 's all well not all done but it 's all a contract and a long way right through delivery Stage two we weren 't going to be able to deliver for 2 million anyway and so we need to that whole stage once we 've scoped that whole thing out I agree look term streets um ever since I 've been here I 've probably every time it rains over about 5 mils I know there 's a big flat area that we need to do we need to address it equally as part of the the roadworks in that area and so we will have to come back to things about what part of stage 2 is legitimate under the land drainage program policies and what would make sense if we extend it because that chemistry is kind of it drains in four different directions my understanding it 's like a catchment it 's like a watershed catchment sort of area so it 's just got no natural outlet so it 's not a tree it 's a tricky one yeah but the thing for me is that I really like when I 'm reading back on a resolution to understand exactly what we decided and this resolution doesn 't indicate where the cost is being transferred from within the program all why so I really would just basically note that the I mean I don 't know the exact words myself but us that an amount was allocated to the budget for stage two bells Creek that this isn 't required for the residential protection and the area that that this that therefore the sum of money won 't be required that effort is required then it will require a new decision of counsel and to bring the money forward in the meantime and the budget and get on with us so I just rather that it was very explicit about what we are actually deciding because at the moment it 's completely briefed of context and you can 't see it in the paper Sarah Yasoda system stage one sells pulse Creek yes we have not leaves sufficient funding to complete their answering today it 's just contingent system yeah they 've got available yeah at the moment there 's this two million dollars more budget then will be required against bells Creek against both scope we 've we 've identified stage one and stage two for our own purposes and used to separate them but is effectively what we refer to as stage one stage two hasn 't had a council agreement to to progress at that point it was just bells Creek Council signed off on Bell 's Creek and the report that you 've you 've seen refers to you know the pump station and then the Los Feliz parks that 's what council have signed off on Sierra thanks I think um it 's interesting to say that like some of the stuffs come through the working group and staff have taken this steer from there from the 9th of October meeting us looking through the slides and then to counsel while I think IT were aware that there was an overspend there 's been no committee oversight of potentially where that might come from and we haven 't had a report as a committee from alan drainage working group i think since the beginning of the term and it says here that the working group reporting to the committee may work on land drainage matters more generally from time to time as directed by the committee to contribute to the committee see that before this council was established the decision was taken by council to spend money on striation it is dropped and it is that decision that 's coming back to us to increase the spend on ER no but I 'm saying that the the working group is giving the steer without any oversight of the committee and the the working group hasn 't reported to the committee at all in the term and it would be really good as it could start hitman so that we could have there it 's an in terms of reference that meets the committee 's responsibilities not respect the council and public and I just want us to focus on getting the language of the screed oh my point is that sorry I wasn 't very clear that it would have been really good if this had come through the ite committee as a recommendation to Council because then a lot of us would have been dealt with at that stage at the committee stage and you know in whichever format because the wording of things that we 've been discussing now group of people being able to go through where it might have come from in the whys and wherefores at that point well look I don 't want to have that argument right now so what I want to do is to get a focus on the language of the resolution that enables us to actually know what was decided by this council and I mean a foot I mean I 'm quite happy to defer it to next week but that would like yeah well I mean you know you 're gonna have you 're gonna have this exact same choice next week which will be about whether we run over into Thursday whether we run over into Friday and whether we run over into Saturday I 've got every single day and I 'm not leaving this until all of the papers are past by the end of the year yeah but with the next item is peak so we could go on to Peaks and come back and deal with it after Peaks because I think the main questions answered so you work on some wordings okay no I 'm not gonna put it without some words written down I 'm sorry but item three has got to be explicit I 'm not going to have us continue to pass resolutions which are then meaningless in the face of inquiry later on so I 'm going to move that we go into P X for all of the reasons set out on the agenda and Andrews going to second it and I

mean maybe it does the truck I don 't know but what we 're trying to do is to trying to get the community board to get on with the consultation and engagement and enable them to to talk to the local community the the trouble around making a decision now around delegating if the if they were you know if the site involves a you know sort of a park or reserve then that triggers another process and if the scope were to step outside the parameters of the aquatic facility strategy you know I mean there are issues in that on so in a way I was more leaning towards the idea of just delegating this and the initiation of a community consultation and initial scope and then you know start there but that doesn 't mean we have to wait till that 's done before it comes back to us in the new year for a decision about what it is that we 're going to delegate we are going to delegate some decision-making in this regard but we want to make sure that we 're delegating the right the right decisions messages that we get a report back in the early new year with the rest of the process on it yeah and it might entail for example you know once councils made a decision on the the scope then the community board can you know say how that 's done you know so the content designers you know yeah delegate that kind of thing yeah so that we make sure that the network impacts art so can we go change to go back to the original one and just put two requests staff to report back early that can be delegated to the Linwood central Heath cut Community Award yes hey yeah yeah no can I just sit clarification under number one that where it says recommendations reported back to council that that means at the end of the consultation and engagement process it doesn 't mean prior to us engaging and going out for community consultation that we have to come back to Council for know so I think maybe I could just but it said that categorization aside once we 've done the consultation I 'm in the scope know take out with recommendations reported back to Council take that out and just put noting that community consultation is based upon the parameters that our request staff to report back early in the new year on on element on the elements of the decision-making that can be delegated to them with central head cook music war is what we want to signal is we are going to delegate but we just need a little bit more work around specifically what we tell again so right cool so I 'm I 'm supportive of us I what 's decided are out from the consultation and effect it 's clear that that comes back to Council and taking it out or not so sure to see it well number two we may well delegate the decision-making around the site to the community board but I mean if the site involves a park or received and that 's going to require some advice because there 's a secondary process as we know very well from the Southwest leisure center that there is a secondary process that is triggered upon that decision so you know I 'm quite happy with Linwood central Heath kept making decision about the side it 's the question around the the scope and the and what happens what happens if the site triggers another process because there are some things we actually legally can 't delegate it 's also if you just clarify it if you just read number one it 's only delegating the initiation of the community process it 's not delegation the full appreciate me number number two number two when it goes maybe early next year will give you that get number two no yep um Erin 's yeah so there 's a lot of ducks that need to be lined up wait wait wait wait wait sorry not just they initiated and then have to report because actually you managed to contact a consultation of the change initiation to the management of the community consultation yeah oh yeah Ben yeah the initiation or do you need initiation a fee of managing at no the management of community consultation on a site inertial scope is that Alright delegate community consultation on a site yeah excellent right okay Yani moved seconded Sarah did you hear other questions yep oh sorry Erin I 've interrupted question but that 's alright so I have a really huge question around our pulse all our pulse going forward that the ones that we currently have them being built gives us because we only saw that the aquatic facilities plan two days ago and from that we haven 't had any community conversations with the entire city over that strategy and the costs because it 's mess of optics and capex costs involved and my question and if it 's mainly seen as a summer activity being do all our facilities need to be indoor ones because that has massive rates implications really really big ones and it 's a conversation with neither head with the public in the city and it 's a conversation we should be having plenty on do we have that conversation coming up the that the timing and nature and extent of council 's conversations with the community are our council decision not mine so I 'll dodge the answer to that perhaps what I can say is in the 1525 LTP as amended by the 1718 annual plan clearly says that this pool is on the schedule to be built and council made a decision to proceed with the process this is part of the process for planning and developing the pool so we are in effect following Council 's decision from the the annual plan if council make any subsequent decisions in the 2018 28 long term plan that might have an impact but right at the moment we 've got a clear instruction to proceed and this report the board take a you know a leading role within that might well that I think the question is is the council going to consult on the aquatics strategy I mean presumably it 's an I haven 't seen it so it 's in draft form at the moment so is there a consultation happening on that a consultation specific to that strategy isn 't planned the strategy informs the long-term plan and counsel our consults on the long long-term plan every single aquatic facilities plan has only ever informed a long-term plan and that 's the vehicle for the consultation no separate consultations provided for okay winds up being winds up being released publicly the they haven 't made that decision we 've had one counselor workshop we 're getting feedback from counselors and are those discussed with the deputy mayor the opportunity to represent it to the council and get some feedback on how we 're and wine and so will will have a formal process where it will come to Council will sign it off and it will go out for I mean it 'll be in council 's wish yes yeah yeah absolutely okay so I 'm really struggling with this and I 'm struggling to support any swimming pool decision ever being made if we do not have a an overall strategy for the city that the public agrees with it 's too much money these pools are twenty million dollars versus half that for outdoor pools and the operating costs are way higher we 're going to have a lot more square meter to pull with a higher operating cost and not as many users is what we 've had in the past it just does not make sense we can 't do it well there about this debate not questions has anyone got a question Sarah Dion Pauline okay Pauline thank you my question is about the the budget for this and I mean it 's great to see this kicking off and I 'm really supportive but there 's the any provision and he was the board to look at potential partnerships in a SUNY provision and here to look at cost savings and bring it under budget yet the the work of potential partnerships and are one being with a sports club rugby league sports club on on the location the so that subject has been covered and yeah it seems very probable that that will eventuate it too early to tell they one hates to promise these things I 'm disappointed a later date some funding came in through fire a partnership would they 'd end up increasing the scope or would or would we look at trying to bring cost savings again that 's a matter for the the council those are the board have considered needs the board have considered are an outline scope the board wish to talk with that community on that outline scope the extent to which that changes through community consultation I can 't really preamp that but I personally we do believe that the board are best place to lead those discussions with that community thank you sir thanks John um have you any idea I mean you 've been over things that are the the supposed offer many many years now how many times have we gone out and consulted with the since it was first mooted in 2003 any rough idea I mean every annual plan just about in the council 's made decisions over the last four years to put on budget we 've consulted its specifically on polls every time and every time the council is decided a it 's not a question of actually go to the debate and not included and in the consultation originally it was added to the LTP by amendment passed at this council without a report so just mentioning that so what since it was first mooted in 2003 okay well I don 't know whether you go back as far as 2003 John the aquatic facilities plan 2006 collated our number of instances of community consultation on a Lynwood pool that happened before that the the idea and proposal for Lynwood pool has been a consistent theme since 2006 dion is the objects already built into the existing budgets the most of it there is a there is a gap between councils current provision and the provision needed to operate the entire proposed network but the majority is and it 's in to go back again on the size and scope are there any limits to that or what are the limits rather there 's always limits I got the biggest limit is need what do you actually need an and limits are sight and affordability and particularly in this case compatibility with the rest of the network decision big one that is anything that can 't_''_867.379 be considered or which has to be ruled out they can 't extend the budget the all of the recommendations are predicated by in line with the LTP amended by the annual plan so that 's a rider over everything yeah okay thank you David the general thrust of what 's going on here but I 'd just like to ask you in response to a question from counsel Q and a few moments ago about whether you know swimming is a summer are in total or when winter oriented sport and I thought I heard you say briefing the other day that in fact on a hot summer 's day you spike yeah yeah the vast majority of swimming happens indoors for a whole a huge outdoor pool patronage in Christchurch but we haven 't focused on that provision one question specially with the help of to my question sir regarding to are the sites consultation I 'm not sure if those site is outside of the Reserve or Parker whether we need to have you know after the site consultation when a whether we need to do the hand of the review or change of the reserve the classification to me that 's why we 're asking for staff to report we 're not delegating their decision right now I just want already see that the if it 's if they choose a reserve or a part there 's another process that needs to happen another presume that the council tea after consultation we know it doesn 't presume anything they will report back to us in the new year before the consultation as finished yeah okay won 't_''_1001.45 you John yes thank you right so Pauline another question all I did Jonnie was first and then have you got a question right okay so Yanni Pauline Dion Mike Andrew Jamie I think been pointed out that there has been a long-standing desire and need for this facility and I suspect it may even go back prior to 2003 in fact I remember rod Donald actually advocating for this many many years ago so this goes back a long time and I think it 's timely just to reflect on the report that came out yesterday from the Salvation Army which basically said the local community has a very proud sense of community and resilience particularly since the 2011 earthquakes however the locals are concerned about crime and safety issues in the community and they feel that many of the local children and young people were disengaged and did not have enough activities so you know I think we can see in there that it reinforces the the submissions that have been made through aquatic facilities reviews and planned developments from 2005 onwards working parties is being set up by the community board and submissions to our annual and long term plans and I encourage you to consider their submissions we 've heard from that local core principles about the need for a that are in this in Lynnwood post-earthquake so to me there 's a real strong need for this it 's something that has been repeatedly raised and actually what we 're talking about today is just getting on and engaging with our community about what the site should be and what the scope should be and I can 't see any reason why we shouldn 't not delegate this to the community board to begin that process today many of the questions that have been asked are questions that can be addressed after this process has has sought the community views so I think that 's really important the other thing that I want to say is that although we 're hearing that there 's some negatives about this community there 's actually a lot of positives as well you 've got one of the most successful Rugby League clubs in the city if not the country in the Lynwood chaos they have openly said to us they are keen to work with us in partnership around the development of Linwood Park and their pavilion and their club rooms so can see a huge parallel around how you can actually create very successful complementary community facilities by working with groups we should also acknowledge that the Longwood EV school and and youth town have done a fantastic community poll okay it is only open during summer and it 's an outdoor poll but as an interim transitional process it 's been fantastic training up locally based young people to get lifeguard skills to contribute to something positive to society into that community it 's been a real success also the life festival so there are positive things happening here but this really I think the importance of this is if we can get on and engage over the summer period when we have the positive things happening that that poll is probably opening I think January 8th we 've got the life festival held in the early in the new year and a number of other community events if we can get on and engage and give hope to this community that desperately needs it that we are interested in what they think we are interested in investing in their an incredible powerful signal to a community that you know it 's feeling forgotten and ignored and it 's not to say that that 's the reality but that 's the perception and I think today is time we address that by moving forward with this process today thank you pulling great yeah honestly this is the wonderful project for Linwood it 's really going to galvanize and bring the community together anything like this just brings people out of the woodwork it gives them a purpose of an meaning to engage and a lot of benefits come out just from that engagement alone and as you all know I 'm pretty sure you know that I 'm highly supportive of community pools and then they 're very very different in purpose size and scope than our big aquatic facilities and they should be far far cheaper to operate so the Linwood Boston pool project began as a community pool now it 's known as an aquatic facility and now they seem to be a lot of edit extras such as a range of pools of facilities for performing for a 20 million dollar budget so my concern is that this facility does actually end up being a true community facility with appropriate operational costs for future ratepayers and I 'm sure it will if we do it right my other concern is equitable in nature and I can 't help but think of the each report project so here we have a commute don 't_''_1327.98 so it 's really facilities although anything to a point Pauline please this has also been in the planning for 11 years and the costing is probably going to come in under five million so my question is why are they not receiving some funding assistance for Lily 's work please order I don 't like bottling order but you are out of order please and I 'm supportive of the Linwood pool project but I do advise caution in relation to the twenty million dollar costs and I ask that there be some oversight of this budget with savings to be found wherever possible Thank You Dion I just want to go back to the state of the communities report that was released listen to the presentation and spoke to the team who did the report yesterday or afterwards that Lynwood community that they interviewed the top there they had a number of things the top thing and their future aspirations for Linwood was this poll is already community speaking about it we 've been talking about it since I 've been elected the poll was the top priority for the community from that and that wasn 't even led by the council the second actually the second top priority was them to increase the life festival which we just talked about so it 's really interesting so revitalized was there and the revitalization strategy for our Linwood village was their third top priority from from the research that they did and that was a lot of locals from Linwood so it was really really telling I do hold concerns around budgets for aquatic facilities and I share that through the concerns with a number of my colleagues but this particular one and through my thinking is different we spent some time in Auckland in March I think it was and looked at community pulled out there and how that has actually really brought together one of the lower socioeconomic areas of South Auckland and the success that set that has had with the partnership with the council 's via all sorry the local board there but also the community in terms of the help that they get from different agencies and actually it 's been really good this one here has has that partnership from the Linwood sorry the the football no sorry the League so the league but you know the person who 's in charge of that came to me yesterday sorry a couple of days ago and said we stand reaffirmed their support to actually work with the council and work with the board to actually make sure that there 's a facility that activates the entire Linwood village I 'll start the Linwood Park area and having esque out there it 's so it 's so close so I really see a lot of positives with this and I urge people to sort of lead us or let the board move forward with talking to the community about Mike thank you previously obviously I 've spoken quite often actually my concern around the amount of aquatic facilities we 've been building and the operational costs of these which obviously through the annual plan and previous long-term plans have been passed and I find it I just don 't think it 's appropriate at this for this item we 're trying to really litigate this pool you know this item is actually about delegated into the community board and I hunterson endorse delegate in the project that this council was actually approved at the last annual plan so I 'm not too sure where the conversation has been going I think it 's off topic I had endorsed as much delegation as we can to the local community board it is their community and they should be the ones responsible for leading the community and working with the community to get the right outcome Andrew I don 't think there 's any question about the social need for this project and I don 't think there 's any question about the community expectation which has been created over what of time I think it 's important to note that what we are looking at approving today is entirely consistent with the review of the aquatic facility strategy it 's entirely consistent with our annual planned budget that would him would that we put in place not even six months ago and there are things that we 've seen in the the draft review of the aquatic facilities strategy which actually have made me more comfortable rather than less comfortable with this project in terms of what 's being proposed to be delivered for this community which is unique to the needs of this particular community as well and there 's nothing in that strategy which makes me uncomfortable about the level of aquatic facilities we 're delivering as a network across the city particularly when you compare what we 're proposing with other major cities in New Zealand such as Wellington and Auckland so I 'm personally very comfortable with this I 'm pleased to see us get to a point where we 're able to progress it I 'm impressed with the energy that has been shown by spend their summer holidays engaging with the community and I think that can only land in a good place as well so yeah very pleased with what we 're looking at today and certainly look forward to their additional paper coming back in the new year so that we can look at further delegations to the community board who clearly know this particular community and its needs very well Jamie thanks you 'll recall that during the annual plan I voted against having this project go ahead in the immediate future we don 't need to rehash the the argument there but suffice to say this isn 't the debate we 're having today so all I really want to say around this is that do you do you not believe that the community has best place to determine what happens in their backyard and I think very much so like I said I think there 's a bigger conversation that needs to be we had around aquatic strategies in prioritization and you know what sometimes hard calls need to be made and that 's why at the time I yes so in this instance I 'll be supporting this because the Council on the home made a decision even though individually I didn 't agree with it at the time and going forward with that decision do you or do you not want to have the people that it directly affects involved at the heart of the decision making and I think absolutely so though I don 't agree with the substantive decision around it that 's fine ensure that the community has a voice and they get the facility that they deserve Erin I 'm great with the number of things that have been seed totally support the community board delegation that makes sense I agree that this community needs époque and deserves a pool and it deserves a unique pool that sits with the sits well with the community I grew up just down the road from here and since John Street Woolston and we used to bike past the Boston pub to go to Centennial pool we didn 't go to Kirito because you weren 't allowed to jump off the diving boards at Centennial you bite all the way to town to go to Centennial because that had something different about it was an outdoor pool and you 're allowed to jump off the diving boards including the 10-meter and it was a great way to spend your summers for me this is about I mean I support the community board delegation but I 'm struggling here a little today when a couple of days ago we finally got our aquatic facilities planned and earlier post-quake when there was the debate over where metro sport would go and qe2 getting its pull that 's currently half way through being built one of the counselors sitting at this table would not vote for it because we didn 't have an aquatic facilities plan but informed how we made our decisions so I find it a little rich to be back here at the table when we 're making decisions or had made them without having had that plan inform us and to be whipping out 20 million dollar pools all across the city I find is pretty loose spending when with having to put up rates really struggling every single community plant project we have across the city every single facility we should be looking to get as much value for money as we can and if that means that we only have six indoor pools across the city so--but but let 's make the outdoor ones really cool I think our our all our community facilities are lively sometimes thanks Sarah like some others I can 't believe that we 're having this debate again it is a simple report on delegation we 've already decided to build a pool we 've already set aside budget and this is the how we go about doing it not whether we should do it it 's really really clear that this community needs investment and that this community board has best placed to be able to engage with the community on how best to do that the council has been really clear about the budget the council will in all likelihood to sign off the scope so that the network isn 't affected but the community as the community boards are the ones who talk to the for a really long time the community been expecting it since 2006 the fact that this pool was being planned was the reason that the the Woolston outdoor pool was demolished and in fact outdoor pools don 't do all of the things that we need as a city they don 't provide year-round swimming lessons that our children can actually learn to swim and be safe in the water in our island nation they don 't provide a space over the colder seasons for the community to get together and connect for teenagers to hang out and communicate with their friends in outdoor pools don 't do that there are a few months over summer they are fun I enjoy them but they don 't have all the wider benefits that our community needs when it comes to operational expenditure we spend a lot and we 've talked about things like security cameras and things like that today on operational expenditure in the lower socioeconomic areas of our city you know picking up rubbish that stumped at the side of the roads those things because the communities don 't invest in the community we don 't look at the cost we look at the value in the wider benefits that 's the role of local government if we were a private business we probably wouldn 't do it but we 're not our purpose is different to that and that 's why we need to do this we need to get on with it now and we need to get the report early in the new year giving the full process and delegation so David thank you look a range of speakers have highlighted the fact that we are essentially just delegating a process of consultation and I fully support that notion we we 've had our aquatic strategy this pool obviously lines up well with it and look I can well remember in my early days on a community board in 1995 when Bob Todd was advocating for pools and a pool in this area he had been pushing pushing pushing for their pool for decades and and as other speakers have said you know we we have suffered a lot in our facilities post-earthquake we are slowly we have lost a number of generations who have missed out on learn to swim and I think we just need to focus on the fact that we are approving a consultation process here today which reinforces a decision by counsel that we will build this pool and for me it 's fulfilling a legacy that Bob Todd 's been advocating now for I can 't obviously sits a 1995 or earlier so I support this notion I think I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried _"

rates collection where do we stand with the uncollected rates these days so they 've affected them to that figure that we 've got we just happened to be ahead at this time of the year or is there still he writes budgets because of our evaluations but we always have a small amount of rates that still need to be clicked at it so it 's a relatively small amount I can 't tell you off the top of my head what that is what it is checked it unto it okay yeah and just the second thing I 'm just a point of procedure or suppose we 've got these things set up great and I note that there to the public he is up there they 're stored behind there and no one would even know that they 're there so it would probably help to have them that no problem you find them useful yeah yep anything that Aaron just the point is one they 're actually useless if you don 't use your microphone yes all right so just to follow up to that Dave when you take it off and set it on the desk near the microphone it 's feeding back for the rest of us just Sao Paulo each time Yanni thank you but to see on page 11 or sex of your report living after supplementary says that the urban regeneration team a central city housing program is currently under development do we do we know what that is I don 't can you just explain a little bit about what that is and is it gonna go through the housing subcommittee bring them corresponding what 's it looking to achieve yeah so it 's looking to achieve a number of things but primarily the aspirations they 're the city and the livable city chapter of the central city recovery plane which had between sixteen and twenty four thousand residents living in the central city along with the targets we 've seat around sorry that that commercial end social benefit targets we have around a vibrant city which is generally now considered is needing people to live in the central city in provider 7 economy yes I 'm just on the back of that just I 'm not sure when we 're gonna look at the strategy and work planning program but I 'm just mindful that there 's a number of other things that we want as priorities and this is a new piece of work that that yeah it 'll be quite good just to understand how this fits in with all the other priorities we have and also this is this is derived specifically out of the settlement patent review which we are legally required to do so instead of just factoring and you know that the the legal obligation that we have under the national policy statement we are looking at what specifically for Christchurch would enhance residential development in the CBD right so my understanding from the presentation from regenerate crusher to yesterday at the Finance Committee is they 're doing a review of the blueprint and that 's going to be presented to us in January so I would have thought until we 've done that which we shouldn 't be commencing new work programs until this is a legal obligation it 's called a national policy statement on urban development and we have to do it so I think it 's very sensible to report through the development forum on the nature of the work that needs to be done in Christchurch I mean we 're not in the same position as Auckland you know we 're not in the same position as other parts of the city that other parts of the country that are the the national policy statement was designed to fix problems and other centers we are still obliged to do it but I don 't know whether Jamie wants to comment on it because it came to the development forum the other day housing subcommittee so that we can get updated it was coming to council that that they are there reporting back so it will be coming to Council in the next I don 't know if it 'll had a presentation on the national policy statement on urban development capacity and central city residential development and there was a there was a number of comments that were made at the forum itself which will help us understand what it is that we could do in terms of identifying the barriers to residential development in the Central City accelerating the delivery of the council 's goal for Central City residential development improve the street maintenance and living environment at the Central City and coordinating marketing of the benefits of central city living so and with our staff for advice on the appropriate governance reporting and monitoring arrangements and that includes which committee it comes through so minutes all of these things are being done because they 're driven off a central government policy previous government policy which has a national policy statement that we must follow they are making comments yes sure okay sure I 'm just a positive outcome of joining a course a couple of committees as for instance yesterday at Phil 's committee was discussed the geospatial tool concept which I think speaks right into this pieces of work you do get you know added value I think so you could run it through your committee picks well it won 't make it as long well I would think the main thing is that the minutes of each of those committees this informations going to than fact we we pull those together and that they they should be available for council but it 's coming to Council so I 'm just saying to Colleen that perhaps what we could do is see if we could generate just the reference of this one to the next council meeting next week and then it 's in the system I mean it 's it 's as I say it 's the appropriate governance reporting and monitoring arrangements progressing the requirement for regenerate Christchurch to immediately review the Christchurch central recovery plan which is what they 're doing at the moment whether a regeneration plan could provide new mechanisms for increasing residential development opportunities in the central city land banking in the central city and the opportunity to work with central government on a coordinated approach so these are all a statutory obligation that we have to act on the MPs requirements so this is the people from the development yeah so I mean it would be quite good if we could get it on the agenda next week and then staff can start working on it smiled Queen right he was smiling he 's but he wasn 't smiling inside I was just outside and he was thinking no I won 't tell you what I thought he was thinking anyway are there any other questions for Colleen this I don 't like to move David seconded Aaron put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carriage _"

    "text": "the most essential haircut community board savvy and cheap I we think it fit a new name we have the name Y Cora board which is way easier to save and Lynwood central his capture we refer yourself to ourselves as the white board community board um decisions under navigation and the first one on the list is the parking restrictions that put in place we seem to get a lot of these and I 've just been thinking about why we have so many and it 's often because it 's because we cover a lot of the business areas of the city and they the businesses they have one business in there they want write a five minute parking area and then another business comes in and they want it a bit longer and have changed the type of business and so they come to us and they say Oh could we have a half-hour parking area or a two-hour parking area so we do get a lot of these under the through our board or the sink tools in and especially especially when Sydenham in those areas hall from the council 's three heritage buildings and this is a really good thing because it enables the work to be done in the community we make use of that facility which they do need and there 's a lot of organizations who work out of raising home and the third one on there is the funding from the descrition of response fund for several projects including a free house history school editing Neighborhood Association and the walk in the sunrise hits for the Edmonds Victory Gardens and then there 's one called Roth and school recycling project and this is an interesting one because it ended up with the Rossum school trying to do all this recycling and and they have they don 't have way too much stuff for the yellow burn and the green burn and they have heard the fruits and schools and they these all come and cartoons and they and they have all the waste from the fruits and so and the community will want to help there was a very little money and so we said yes we 'll help you we impossible because the council policy says no you can 't have more than one green boom so we will still help them but they 'll have to go to a private contractor to get that extra bonus to be taken away which does seem like we could actually do something in terms of especially organizations like schools we could change the policy to make sure that for those schools that are trying very hard to do the right zone and in the community world wants to fund it in I 'm sure we could do something for these people mmm so so we will still find out that they 'll we will have to get them to go to a private contractor under under our current policy so in maybe the ft committee could pick up our green bunny just have to pay for just your home they can 't we 've been right through that saying and it 's your pay well I thought you could pay for a bigger one and they 've got the bigger one I think we we I mean that as there is it pay for it the community board will take it out of their discretionary fund it 's not the money they 're filling a big grain bun every week yeah because they got frozen schools and they 've got a community garden in the egg okay school garden things like this so no not my mom costing at all right they 're getting all the outside rebuilt because it was quite repairs and there have been done so they 've they 've had to take the composting out of it all right so they used to compost so it wasn 't a problem so this is a temporary problem until the composting goes back yeah and it 's also it 's not just it 's not just a green bin to be honest you know open because they get the fruits in the Schools program and it comes in cartons and it 's just too much for either one your oven as well okay it 's not have a squat we have carry on I just want to bring that to your teacher yeah and the next point on it is chairperson I 'm sorry to the chairperson on the district licensing committee to appear for our chairperson to appear on behalf of the City Council for c75 Ferry Road and this is of course another off-license we 've got about 16 in the same area in in this relates very much to what I 'm going to talk about a bit so they 're on you know how our community really doesn 't want any more off licenses you know in this area so that we 'll probably won 't happen till next year now part a recommendations yes we have to serve all of these Wilson Park which is just a funny little area in front of the politic down on which dress the dress is fallacious yes and and you 've got a patio for there Lynwood village and I 'll talk further about that as well the liquor been and then some votes in my ways naming policy and it 's going to be delayed but that 's basically there because we asked that why we couldn 't have more Maori names on our roads when they Lynwood Woolston aquatic facility and they don 't be in your car today we were asking for delegation tooken for the boards to consult on the preferred site in the scope and the concept but they will come up later significant community issues the East Christchurch the first case in the city revitalization plan and we had a survey in recent community engagements and by Tafari Roy Mata and they 're now working with regenerate no yeah and you 've seen them out there haven 't you yeah yeah and the New Zealand Police have expressed to me new concerns that the public behavior and I Alaska Park and that it 's more to do with their liquor being as well it is also a proposal for a tiny shops micro village for Nick 's next to the supermarket and the Lynwood village area and it 108 stem more Road but we haven 't had much on that we 've just heard that it 's there 's a proposal so far and we 've got they want the ferry meet some conversion there for active workshop spaces in the health obtaining the vacant site at 8 Martindale Road as a site for community and that was one that won that year as it came up as lended it had to be that was going to the council want to get rid off so that was really that lame yeah never have significant matters of an interest and the Lynwood Phillips social and alcohol issues we had eight members of that she had a we eight members of the public address us but there 's a whole lot of members of the public in their own supporting them and two policemen spoke at our community board meeting on 6th of November and they were concerned with issues of intimidating behavior businesses suffering loss residents safety and drug use and you have all have seen the front page of this morning 's paper an article based on a report that across the nation both Salvation Army and listeners identified crime alcohol and drug use and homelessness and Vegas and gang intimidation as you as the problems in Lynwood area people that they told us that people are living in fear they can scared they 're gonna get abused if they walk along certain areas and if you even if you drive down there you 'll get people coming up to your car asking for money and I think this is the biggest issue for our board we really need the help here and we need Council to work with us and the other agencies to make a difference for our people who are living in this area we need you to get the look at Ben and place as soon as possible and we want you would really like you to make this when he was top priorities and I had a wee chat with in just before the meeting started and we 'd really like you to add to your to recommendation today something about safer christchurch committee having this as one of their top priorities and I think I 've got ends agreement on network in say that so it 's a for Christchurch community taking on board this particular issue because you know it 's no use having all these fancy facilities around town of people live in fear a few minutes to talk about yeah LTC priorities sure I wanted to thank the council for involving us in three workshops to date around the LTP it 's been really valuable yeah but I mean it 's been a really valuable exercise for us in terms of honing down what our what our priorities are thank you for those notes and it 's I mean it 's at the won 't come as a surprise to anyone here that obviously the inner city and East and all the projects that come off there as well as the the Lynwood aquatic community for CPS center area there are priorities you know obviously plays a drop-in center as well as a revitalization plan and greening that in the city east are pretty important to us and I just like to encourage council to continue working with community boards particularly as that first draft of the LTP has worked over because I think there 's a great opportunity for us to kind of digest into still a lot of the information particularly the financial implications to to our communities yeah I just came out yesterday I think just highlights the need that this wider Linwood area really needs some public investment but also just needs I think a greater sense of priority and urgency particularly post-earthquake so obviously we 're gonna as part of a separate decision today we 're talking about the Lynnwood Washington poll but you know I strongly endorse the comments that the community board has made and I think we really do need to make this a strong focus because clearly post-earthquake this has been an area that has not had the attention that perhaps it should have and we 've seen a real exacerbation of problems with a whole wide range of factors through to things like the school changes the the lack of housing and the impact of the loss of buildings and services in the inner city so I think it 's really important that we make this a real key priority for us and I 'm very you know grateful to to the people that came this morning and to councillor Dion swigs and Vicky back and also I know Brenda Leigh Johnson another but has been doing a lot of work with the homelessness as well so yeah really really important that we address this senator I just asked you about the issue of theorem II Heritage Park which is in the report and clearly you 've had some good contact with the new girl with the new group are involved and it 's just really a way of how in fact we might progress the really good work they 're doing at the park because clearly it 's a council responsibility too so would it be here would it be would it be pressed timely soon for that group to also talk to us as a council oh yes they have come to the community board and we have had a visit out there and they seem to have changed their their the board months at all there what do they call your board and that 's the trust you trust you they they seem to have some quite dynamic people sort of trying to do things there and get things done and use the venue way more so they they want functions for events and things like this so if the council is looking for you know a place to hold things that 's they 've got it all out there and they may need help to promote that as well so if you 'd like to hear from them it 's really good we 've just put through the second car park for them because they give it quite a lot of overflow parking and and would like to start a consultation project a consultation with the community on the use of the land that they 're cooling it was the former time I decided what do they call it CEO would oh yeah yeah the land because it 's a big space of land Ian we 'd like a conversation with them because I think that community out he 's been asking for a dog park in the area for long times think silly so I 'm not sure how the air agenda for the last meeting of the year will be but if there was time for that it might be useful for us to hear about the 'm yesterday I did go to the Salvation Army state of the communities thing and I asked the question about why they chose those communities that they chose and in Christchurch they chose the Linwood Ward so they actually broke it up and they talked about Linwood but it 's actually they 've chosen it by the geographic boundaries of the actual wards for the council and they 've just chosen them because it was the areas that they saw from their work that they were seeing issues and it was really sad actually it just sort of shared the story there briefly the manager of the Salvation Army she 's a JP she signed yesterday morning before we met they 're three bankruptcies and two Efford it 's for people who just do not have any money and can 't pay power bills so there 's serious problems in our communities with money and affordability of just living so I mean it is a real big problem and I just wanted to share that because it 's it 's exciting that 's just getting worse or whatever Linwood the from Tiffany Roy matter at all about what 's going on have you heard anything so could you maybe just give us an update about with what they 're doing you don 't_''_1041.329 [Music] because I just haven 't heard anything since we signed off on it yeah I 've been with with what 's going on in the media I would have thought we should have thought you know Jake was just saying that they were doing stuff so I just wanted to know what they were actually doing okay the board received an update in the last area report talking about what the process has been I don 't think the expectation was for temporary matter to report it was regenerate christchurch was asked to coordinate a response to the updates to the community board regularly so the board has received an update and another one will be given shortly but Jake is right they have been surveying like local residents on what it is they want to have in a revitalization plan and what it is and how it is they want to be engaged so that few days ago and talking to Tafari and and what that means that this is a model that addresses safety issues by mobilizing community members into action and encourages cooperation and collaboration so obviously this what you 're dealing with here is exactly that kind of situation and so just having chatting with Lisa earlier this there is a lot of stuff happening already behind the scenes as you 'll be aware of these are really big issues but I 'm just wondering if you want a few sort of quick ones and terms of just children being able to walk safely to school and so I 'm wondering effort would be good to meet with Bruce insha pyre and just sort of start the conversation about how we make that happen thank you all right well I shall issue is there anything that we want to actually resolve off the beckoned and make at the first one I just wonder whether just in terms of your comments that I mean it wasn 't clear from the report I was quite surprised what the report what your report said in recycling wasn 't doesn 't really indicate what it was about so I just wonder if we could invite maybe David 's committee to ask for a follow up on on the burns issue would that be appropriate yeah yeah yeah okay well is it if it 's already if it 's if you 've already done it well then we 'll just simply note that your committee is following up on that issue no it 's not it 's a waste management policy we know that but hey yes I know yes but if it shows it yeah at least we 'll get to the bottom of what 's what 's actually going on yeah that would be good I was just gonna put the motion as that no no no Aaron carry on okay it 's just a quick question around the the waist and the green waste especially that this is a very traditional ways taking it and a bent across the other side of the city I 'd feel more comfortable if we were inviting someone like cultivate to get out for a chat and see before we order the best suggesting that we order another burn avoid we 've already established that the issue is that they lost their compost and capacity because of the as a rebuild of their school or a new new development there so that they 're just lost and it 's only temporary it 's not forever so but I think that if Becky 's committee has got a reporter on the way it would be quite an elegant solution just to get a response to that now but you may not have heard me say that so right so I will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried and then we move to the _"

general acceptance from the community and unanimity on the board if you want to move that the end or should I leave it towards ya okay so tell me you 'd like to move it and sit in the bike belt do any discussion on it I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried well done thank you good work now to your report associated with that there is discussions around the link a link a back link Road be between Westmoreland and Craig off which both residents associations as we have heard so far not formally but informally both residents associations are opposed with my dog in the sprinkle of rain I thought about the litter that was in the paper the other day talking about the long grass around the rivers being allowed to grow and the benefits that were perceived by the staff ecologically for the river in terms of the health of the river and the life of the river preventing clothing and so on but this person also mentioned the fact that the long grass caught the rubbish going into the river which I had actually never thought of and this morning behind pioneer Stadium on centennial park where there are no fast-food outlets and not even a dairy within cuy I 'm walking with my dog looking pristine park that looked so there was no rubbish I picked up 68 individual bits of crap and 200 meters and and it was all trapped by the long grass and this so this didn 't end up in the river and I 'm not easy walking on the slope so there were some bits I actually couldn 't get to and that was in a pristine area with no fast safe from getting in through river and I discussed it with Leanne before and she said she 'd done the same thing about in another place and found the stuff that was not getting into the river so there 's a whole bunch of reasons for that long grass and we on our board very much in support of it I passed around the Eddington news Ida leaves which is right there it 's a wonderful newspaper and I don 't think Doreen will mind if I say roughly her age because no one actually knows but I think she 's mid to late 80s the editor of that and she 's exceptional she goes out and takes you takes a lot of the photographs itself she writes most of the notes and she is very interested in the history of the area and talks to the people about us and if you look at that news leeteuk it 's chock full of stuff absolutely full of stuff now I 'm one of the deliverers which means I walk around Addington delivering and just for example the back of the opened were just thought and opened they were sold within a week four units on a small section townhouses built above speak I met the developer because I complained to her about him not having a postbox and he gently pointed it out to me and he built them and he says he deliberately doesn 't speak and I interviewed someone who 'd just taken residents the day before and they 've been looking for a house they she worked at the hospital and he worked at Canterbury University and they were looking initially for a house for the section they were delighted to get a town house which I was above spec and especially in terms of insulation and this was a architectural II quickly does and boiled building where the back yeah they Garrity 's were built so that the residents had to talk to one another there was no backing in to children because they designed it that way small town houses that didn 't intrude on their neighbors because our area in particular has got the development in Bolton Street in the development and stud M the future horrible horrible buildings and so intensive health and can be done the NED in turn is proof of it and also on the adjacent Street as six workers cottages all of which have just finished being done up two or three of which have been sold the land one of them was Mike Peters a stalwart of our area and that has just been finished being done up as well and are we actually funder sorry the Eddington times we helped planned I also have got the CIM the communities board plan and the community board pamphlet which is about it talks to us about what we say I wish you could see this this is the invitation to a Christmas party which was held the other night and this is a Kia with a boutique hour in its mouth or it could be taken for a southern rata and that was done by one of our staff and it Wilson who 's created not the only creative run either she did this by a hand drawing and he 'd have printed off for our invitation and she could see there and we had a lovely occasion as we always do don 't look at the photographs that I bought known that there were three photographs we 're a slim staff men that was between the two why and I 'm always this is the fourth year of we wearing the sound output it 's got a serious intention we haven 't have we have a desk every year and they consult with the Eddington community and beyond about what they think of and at the moment we 've got a serious discussion going about Lincoln Road and you can see the paperwork there and that was that was Jay standing slim Jay standing between us two extremely well-built young women and this year 's aren 't God anyway I 'm not I 'm going to ban photographs like that for next year this is the Eddington fear which is always successful it 's outside st. Mary 's Church we have a strong presence there it 's a lovely it 's just the loveliest of occasions but one of the best things about it is it has the as a member of the Edmonton community organizes it with his old rocker mates most of whom are still playing in bands and doing terrific music and I am someone pointed out John hor grinnell sitting on the side eating an ice cream listening to his friends evolved playing terrific music but this is typical of the scenaries church whom I 'm going to discuss in a minute that they host these every year and put so much energy into it and it 's just it 's just the Beast it 's the most beautiful environment and significant issues our board unanimously has supported a memorial plaque to Christina Layton and some of you will know here she was a brave and stalwart member of our community who was much loved and in our community she fought very hard for buses she loved buses and she was a great woman and before that and as she fought and other she was always involved in community issues she got the raised pedestrian crossing outside community house and he referred street before the earthquakes she got bad but also she was a community for whom she had worked for 20 or 30 years before it was fashionable and she under underwent considerable discrimination in her life and she came out of it with kind only kindness and new heart and we have got a memorial plaque that we are putting on a bus stop and Alfa Ethel Stern Street and we will be opening it with the and with the note there that says in memory of Christina Loudon 19 August between 19 August 1938 to 31 December 2015 a brave and tireless worker for the good of others we the bank stabilization is now it 's just about to get underway and we 've we are meeting staff this afternoon to go in a van around the proposed it worst areas to discuss what they are doing in terms of stabilizing the bank while at the same time furthering ecological issues such as an owner so my pronunciation is terrible and the banks of the rivers and the flora and fauna of our area the drainage staff as usual have been exceptional and and always are terrific and we will we be some ecological issues that won 't be reconciled with the drainage team because we know that some members of the community are worried about the bank stabilization scheme and so we are looking to heads get some answers from the drainage team this afternoon as well as looking at the worst areas and our Ward who an athiest up the Hoover Fiesta was it as usual a great occasion and it ran parallel parallel with the Pacific gravity and ran parallel with the Pacific Rugby League competitions that ran over Saturday and Sunday and the who know Fiesta it was just fantastic these little these are there our preschool kids from and they they were just fantastic the way they the the way they saying in and played with the poison things like that though clear water judge adjudged a talent and a competition with that we 're the quit the talent was exceptional he was a bit I am greedy he also dodged judged the cake eating competition which I thought was a bit selfish because I would have liked to have judged the cake eating competition because other people don 't and I could have judged the finesse with which the dry cake was eaten compared to the lack of finesse by some other people but we had a great time in a great day and the Pacific Rugby League competition was excellent and it ran on Saturday and Sunday and there were people from all over Christchurch there to support their team 's heritage Eddington the scenaries church got a heritage ambassador award for their recognition of their heritage contributions to the community and they had an area Edington heritage evening which I wish I 'd actually gone to but I didn 't it just passed me by for some reason and that was talked about the construction and repairs of the Eddington water tower the reverent beam of Sint Mary 's Church who was married to the daughter of Prime Minister Richard John Sidon doesn 't get much more royalty than that and at the end and this is typical of this church they played a musical homage to the Beatles Sgt pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band now fifty years old and then the look forward to them thank you oh really oh we ever got the music for this and rally school came to our Christmas evening a Christmas Fair well it night before last and saying now I would challenge any one of you to tell me that they have a bunch of school kids in their wards that sing better than rally school because they don 't and this isn 't who Bruce I 'm telling you the truth there was no there 's no outstanding with these kids when they sing and there are and the kids also are the ones that play the guitar and they are exceptional it 's just a pity that they 're Darrell at school isn 't as pristine as they are thank you okay I think you 've just challenged everyone to sing off next year yeah that would be great it was in the council chambers it would be great just two brief comments by my alien Karen referred to Christina Lawton and Carolyn said this very eloquently but she was a wonderful example of the little people who do so much for also outlined the the bank 's type of laser stabilization program for the Heathcott River and along with the flood intervention policy that is something that we as a council will really have to focus their minds on when it comes to long term plan so that those parts as Carol under sentence is in the report are just going to be so important just wish to second Phil 's comments about Christina the Presbyterian Church recognizes her and that was a very difficult journey for her and there 's quite a piece and the whole registered ministers there you know recognizes her great work as a social justice advocate the TPA had a memorial service for year as well so she 's really what does community house really but it was great many huh yeah Pauline thanks great presentation I love the patient 's marrow that was mystic so just going back to the river banks being unmowed and I read that literature is very poignant and what you 've got there 's incredible now I 'm wondering if we could look at a piece of work where the just the banks going down to the water not after you walk but just be aware closes the rubbish in just mow the areas that we designate currently we do it the other way round we mow in all of it and we 've got to try we were not going and I think it would be environmentally more advantageous to us to actually do it the other way we we designate we we would like to move right down to the water and I 'm if it was there 's no reason why the land drainage Recaro program or your committee couldn 't generate that approach I mean parts of parts of it seem to be unknown completely and it 's not a good it 's not as good looking that 's what I get more complaints about than anything else so we need to just look at the whole program in it that trial well why don 't you raise that at you 'll commercially and come back to the council in the new year was something because something brought back and I saw a rather than resolve right at the interview that the museum and he 'd just been overseas and some of the riverbanks over there that actually then there unmown everywhere but they 've also been just boosting wildflower plantings and they look really nice all right I 'll follow it up yep thank you about the look yeah look I was gonna comment on the same subject and it 's been a subject of some wire for me for a number of years there the the way we mow riverbanks and great that you guys have collected so much rubbish in the short period but leaving that grass there it 's just a an invitation for those that can 't_''_1050.89 be bothered finding a rubbish turn to just chuck it in the long grass where it won 't be seen but you know I 've long held a view that it 's very it 's extremely unsightly and I actually put it down to our I 've tried to argue this for years when we are letting our contracts we let our contracts to various people and they head right on most and they the bank about if we insisted and I 've asked this for a number of years that our riverbanks unmown with a boom operated mower that 's able to reach out and and we don 't need to mow every little little I agree with Pauline there are parts of riverbanks that need to be protected for ecological reasons and I can think of one particular area close to the Avondale River Bridge where it sits in an a can 't think of a Mary no more white bait and a breeding ground but there are literally hundreds of other areas that do not get mone properly because I believe we are not insisting in our contracts that they use an appropriate piece of machinery that is able to mow the riverbanks properly and this has been ongoing for years now when we let our contracts we leave it to a bunch of guys who have a fleet of right on Mose and they get so far to the river bank and then the grass grows and it keeps coming out of it and they 're right on Mars won in air and our mowing contracts of riverbanks of an insistent that a particular piece of machinery is capable of mowing the bank properly and then look grass grows up this high and then we spend literally thousands on gangs of guys with weed eaters that take weeks and weeks and weeks to go down our river banks and clean them all up we 're looking for savings and the LTP there 's one that would probably save tens of thousands of dollars I disagree entirely with you and that wasn 't the message I intended I don 't really know to open up a debate you started it no yeah no I mean you raised at the beginning of yeah yeah it doesn 't enable councils but if councils could focus on short questions directed to the chair of the community board that would be really helpful yawning I was just going to suggest well welcome been picked up through Pauline 's committee I also think the local boards like our board is getting overwhelmed with complaints and actually there 's a huge fire risk that we have and want to start a debate about this whether individual community boards or whether it 's the the AG committee it doesn 't really matter somebody needs to be processing this but I don 't want it off the back of something that wasn 't written in the report to be the basis for asking council staff to do another report just before Christmas who 's making that decision about whether we cut the grass or not Yanni can you just take it offline I think Caroline was making a point in support of a letter to the either so the other day but perhaps this just to listen to be learned here in terms of what happens when we raise things that aren 't on the written part of the report it 's very much associated with banks template the stabilization the end I never waiver no all right so um now did we do we get a mover and a seconder for this I think yes Phil intim I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed okay we thought that Gary _"

    "text": "for the proposal Hornby Rekha 's on the community board thank you the ending capsules for the opportunity to present here report to you this morning we have one part a recommendation do you want me to start with that sure that is the the naming of in classifications of some reserves in there in our ward one of them 's been held over until the naming of the of a school and my close proximity to that is this is being sorted so other than that I 'm happy to to present run part a to you and then well why don 't we just deal with that first so does this fall onto Jimmy chin Jimmy chin move seconded any discussion around that put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no it 's carried three goes now onto your force the the the report is decisions under delegation of course we 've got quite a lot of from funding applications and also we had the the Denton Park changes in reserve classification management plan and which has been progressed with the addition of number six and that we extend the time to put the time consultation period out till after the festive season and the other is that Wireless approach process and consultation is underway that be more negotiation and consultation with the sports clubs and also the traffic engineering issues to be done at that similar time so that 's that 's what we 're asking for yep and then that 's the footprint as you can see it 's quite a substantial area moving on then to significant community issues we 've got the upper record war memorial library is thank you Gary there 's been none shut so that 's a bit of a hmm sort of came out of left field quite quickly so that 's something that 's a work in progress trying to sort out the the the loss of not only a a building that had quite a lot of community use but also a more a War Memorial that we 've got two of them in our areas that that are under threat there 's this one of course and the autist um or memorial Day and that 's I think it 's in its 10th or 11th year now isn 't it done Jimmy pretty sure of this so that 's that 's something that 's gone from strength to strength and very very well attended so and I had the pleasure of of judging the coloring in competition second year in a row so that was some and the other thing that was really really good there was that was the the petting zoo where they bring the animals along and you can actually young people and old people can actually go and pick them and talk to them and they had goats on leads being being led around the the event all that sort of thing was really really really really good and the local school band performing as well which was really good in the hall so and it 's something that we 're very very pleased to support and the Rickett and community street well well that was a really really big e that was a real biggie as you can see there and such a lot of work involved when you see all the ethnicities and the ages of people there and the the neighborliness of of all the people that live in around that area as well taken part in it is just just wonderful and the University and school students pitching your ideas this is funded by our community board so we 're just looking to see what sort of wonderful ideas we can get from a university and it 's a bit like the program that Donald Trump used to run didn 't he that 's a thank you for your wonderful idea that 's one so anyway changing the subject getting back to hear the Christmas carol events are underway now and so that 's probably not unique to our Ward but we do have some lovely venues for those some very enjoyable opportunities for people to go out and test the vocal cords and this month 's hyper hyper helpful random facts hmm is the is the the the record racecourse tea house and McConnell II back in the day some of you will remember the right honourable Nick Connolly who was the Member the Rickett and racecourse trustees on restoring the the very very derelict and tea house at record in our community would was asked to to help support that and we formed the the trust Charitable Trusts and I was fortunate enough to be a trustee of that and worked through the restoration of that very very fine and restored tea house and it was just absolutely wonderful and the history of that and of course is it was a haven for um for the woman back in the day who weren 't allowed to go to the bar and the stains but they could go in every cup of tea in the tea house so anyway that was that was really good but Leslie Cleese was on it as well absolutely Thank You Leslie and I were both on that trust and and she was and she was also became the first female member of the Rickett and race course of trust and Bob sharing some Eric 's City Council or is still still a member of the Rickett and Race Course trust but the tea house restoration trust was some very very very well utilized we are community board actually hold down some of our events in there community service awards community pride garden awards and things like that so it 's it 's a lovely lovely setting and of course it was used as it 's been used as a hospital and it was also used as the barracks for people departing to the World War two and then that became derelict unfortunately after that and and met Connelly thought he really could do something about it so inspired to community n air community board so it 's a project that we 're very very pleased to be involved in yes the record and Road corridor that 's right on five point two or five point two point one thanks Gary is the date of the report on on the Rickett and road corridor is not coming to recommend eboard on the 12th of December it is now going to be the 15th of February 2018 I 'm just on your hyper helpful random fact are you planning to having a hundred and fifteen anniversary and a ten celebration what a good idea Lee I have them from time to actually we can make that happen that we go we sure king I think I haven 't_''_571.86 I haven 't looked at what the third of December was and I don 't know what its original opening date was but do you 'll find something that links whether either or both as though it would be cool anyway I did he 's change Jimmy chin would like to move this and Sikandar by and Galloway we have two questions okay to question the one is on six pointer to pointer to party 's updated status because regarding to the UH predict and the memo real library they did have this community the kind of the meeting I just want to know for the future option I did have I did ever a quick update them and Jimmy last Monday morning that meeting took place on Saturday yeah and I wasn 't_''_634.73 at the meeting I would have loved to have been there but I wasn 't_''_638.82 but the outcome is that there 's more talk going on with in Rena Dale and and other community people were at that meeting so it 's an ongoing process Jimmy so there 's been no final decision made on that yet thank you some questions on us paragraph 6.04 I just want to know because in the house we 're home prediction the personal social Committee poll we have quite a few resident Association but what 's the duration Lu particularly emphasize these two resident association only is my question one of them Gary one of the reasons for the for the Stedman group is they 've been they 've been around for a while but they 're just they just sort of pop up know what that what they needed to do now with the development that 's happening the new residential development on the land it was formally wicket and wicket and racecourse lean-to wicket and racecourse trust lien is they feel that they want to reactivate their residents association and be more proactive in the process of the development of that area and surrounding their residents association and the other one was the oil um upper wicket and felt that they needed to put out some some feelers in the community and they got forty odd people at the at the meeting and they 've got a strong committee up and running again now so why those two were mentioned as one 's been in recess and as bounce back to be active and the other one was heading for decline and that 's now been reactivated and we 're very very grateful for there is all the residents associations in there any our area but just particularly name those two because of the situations that they 've been in and I 'll just take on board but what are the other reason that our community boards are doing and that 's having a meeting with the chairs of all our residents associations at least once a year I 'd like to think so that 's something that we 'll certainly look into Jimmy I think it 's important also to say Jimmy that without the the staff and put into the other one it was about to fold and Murray went out and and met with them of one meeting to put their hand up when we had nobody just showed all that great needed was someone to walk with them walk alongside them and Murray did great job so far back stronger and they 're really appreciative that we have a resolution in front of us I 've got the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried Merry Christmas Merry Christmas to you and everybody and just remember that it 's all about peace and love and goodwill and I think there 's a fair bit of that around but I 'm just a bit worried about how much goodwill we 've got around at some times and just we need to be really conscious conscious of that at this time of the year thank you I 'll be grateful that we 're not in America there we go _"

    "text": "and if we could deal with items 9 and 10 thank you it 's a little good morning run and Thank You Liam for that as is relatively short and sweet but it 's a good time to reflect on some of the stuff that we 've done this year I 'll take the paper as read there 's just one correction in 5.4 that we wanted to make which is around the Burnside barbeque it says Rickett and Lions Club it 's actually the Wigram lions who supported that so just that changing so in terms of what 's been happening in our area obviously you 'll see that the delegated authority we 've exercised the main things to highlight really are around the Christchurch documentary project which was launched in Bishop Dale last week that was quite a significant event and when we had a lot a lot of people along from the community for that the other one that is around actually celebrate Bishop Dale which Aaron Cohen officially opened the other weekend we had over 2,000 people there for that that was a stunning day and many people came up to me and see that was an opportunity for the kids to come along to an event and not have to pay entry so it made it a lot more terrible for a lot more kids which was really nice the other one was again around Burnside Park and you may recall earlier in the year we had a few issues around that so we 've got to a point where we 'd agreed with the Wigram Lions in terms of putting an even heat park staff we know and did some work and then it actually was decided from feedback from the community that that wasn 't the right place so it was great to be able to open that last week and its really being well used so it 's a really good s it fracking in diem and I think the important thing for us from that was that although at the time it created a bit more work and we actually got the right outcome and there 's sort of what what we 're all about him we have got or you so that 's on heat and Street and there 's a bit of work being done around there the board funded some work around that promotional video and we 'll show you that in a moment we 've got that here but there is just that part a yeah if you would like to just speak to that quickly yeah sure it 's relatively straightforward it 's on Breen 's Road outside the school it 's just one of the 40k zones so it was unanimously supported by the board and yes I look at and Evans F Aaron and ref would like to move and second the item ten then I will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we 'll go back to a video sorry can I please speak to that just briefly around the side we just threw two seconds did it okay that oh you can okay thank you very much so Christmas interview the so that for decades speed limit there a great in unanimously supported by the board but the irony is a major intersection that the children can 't possib guesses as a council we 're trying to encourage children to walk and bike to as many schools as possible and they are hamstrung in this neighborhood and my challenge goes out to run during the holidays to come and meet me at a particular intersection bring a ten-year-old that you 'd let them cross unassisted I 'll see you there I would never let a ten-year-old cross there great good until the lights are on no no it doesn 't mean that you have to put lights and to solve the problem and cross set lights there 's all sorts of other ways of solving that problem never leap to the conclusion anyway so that was really helpful same do you want to move back to the video here so that just before we start there for us the salad club and the funding we put towards it sort of represents in our view the community getting out and doing something so it 's not and taking from us it 's actually them getting out and doing it and working you looks like home [Music] listen [Music] very cold lava cake [Music] the onward Club is an umbrella organization made up of nine different sports clubs we average around 75,000 people through the doors each year and that number is growing the new facility is going to be a central hub of activity for our area of town it 's going to be a facility with the number of spaces from indoor sports through to coverings and community spaces it 's going to really support all the clubs in the wider community the design is really about making the best use of the site and creating partnerships between the school and the community and then the local resident it 's going to be a great opportunity not only for the community but also asked be able to utilize some of the training facilities in the retail and the cafe sort of things as well having more sporting clubs under one facility just makes a great atmosphere and it 's also good that the club can just run all year round whether it 's winter or summer sport sharing the facility the club will have they have pretty good success in playing with all the other clubs associated we 're looking at an intergenerational facility where you 'll have grandparents grandchildren and the parents in between all here enjoying the same space we are developing a community sports hub based on existing utilization in future modeling the demand is there but we 're creating the facility to now meet the demands the developments for the Allenwood class are just the way of the future for sporting clubs because then we can amalgamate some banks codes we can share the costs and training facilities and it just helps bring the community together as well the funding of the owner club it 's privately lit I think this is the key you know it 's a sustainable model that doesn 't become a burden on the local rate it makes a lot of sense economically it 's where future giving and public or donation it 's going to be a place for the community sports clubs to socialize to try new sports and activities but gives the opportunity for a sports club to of the sport clubs can come together they also have a louder voice in terms of decision makers will it be funders or councils to generate more revenue into community sport it gives people choice and access to a range of sports that they may not have had easy access to it will give a sense of belonging for members and even casual participants within the sporting community we wouldn 't be able to do some of the things that we are currently able to do if it wasn 't_''_450.559 for the support that we get from the Elma club we 're pioneering the future collaboration of sports clubs local education providers in the community the dreamers that we 're going to have a facility what your one thinks of it the food space behind their home and the work or education whatever else are involved in their default place where they go to have a good time with friends and family playing together and then socializing next time it 's and the board we just came to relay this was a seal for Christmas and we look forward to thank you well I mean this time I 'll get Jamie to move and breath to second the receipt of the report and thank you for your hard work I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

Christmas given the tight timeframes and we really have appreciated staffs advice and assistance with us the other parts of the school issues there is within our Ward we have lost six primary schools the board has written to the Ministry of Education regarding the status of these schools we believe there could be opportunities for the community where there our community needs for example ordinary require a building for purposes that 's just one example and we have also flagged with councils property unit that the community board just be kept in the loop which is great now the combined coastal board and pepra nui and those community boards took with a shorter name you 're well aware of this groups absolutely fantastic is a really great example of collaboration between the community staff in

all of you for your support this year and we look forward to 2018 being a fantastic ones I think [Music] I really like the idea of community boards pulling in all of their residents associations chairs for a conversation I also like this in ovens leadership day too because I 'm I mean the two could be easily correlated in terms of who the natural-born leaders are and communities for helping assist bright resilience plans for example war helping after a disaster they 're just the natural people to start with interesting yeah it 's so well done any David comments really just on the sticks River catchment I really just like to say well firstly how privileged I am to be able to lead that forum and and really to acknowledge the the manner in which that is coming together where we have a community group that meet with an independent guy first they come to the meeting and the just a general demeanor of the meeting and the things we achieve is as good and great progress coming out of out of work in there I 'd also like this in this area just publicly acknowledge the work and collaboration of their staff in the in this process we have senior managers and an arrange of staff come out to these meetings and at our last one some information just on river levels and its association with when we were cutting weed and our correlation with a whole lot of other data and it made such amazing since listening to this information from from Graham and it 's just put a whole whole new perspective on the way that that their group is meeting they 're just huge reps to Keith Davidson his team for the work that they 're doing in this area just covered by the waypoints you really fantastic the way the kids playground is coming along the whale was installed yesterday and coincidentally we had to build a new whale because we couldn 't move the old one would have so staff took a mold of the old world and made a new one the two are facing each other at the moment for the summer were actually going to have to well pools so a great little kiosk for the community there and so I think there 's some really positive things coming out of the community at the moment and and the board is sort of looking also looking forward to as well so every positive stuff coming over here at the moment is quite pleasing to be able to be working in that environment where we 're seeing some things starting to advance okay am i clean I think you perhaps just a quick couple of comments yes I think we had a good relationship with all our staff and the board we we 're functioning quite well and you know dealing with some pretty robust issues from time to time and the affirm day was very good great celebration of the community there and I don 't know a beautiful hot day but great to everyone out and celebrating our life together with the schools if we think back to the closure of our tiny school and how big that was pre quake where I used to live on the other side of town we consider that over and against the closure and measure of measure of six schools in the entire Ward area it 's quite significant so we are going to push quite strongly with the Ministry of Education to say right this has happened now we is just to delete you know you know that they 've been through a fair bit over the schools on top of the quakes so that 's what we 're going to do there but all in all I think there 's a lot of good self starting initiatives the community 's doing it for themselves there 's a lot of good capacity building going on that 's great yeah very good all right so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "or report Christine let me see you monster so you tog good morning everyone happy stuff as we 've done a bit of a report on track of exactly that was our 4-h hellas presentation so really just a bit about the significance of Tecopa nikkei as the it was a major trading post in 19th century and major trading fellow judges say and then in the eighteen thirties many of the night are who people were mister could yes so in response to the british government appointed an official resident discouraging you have a few that through their atrocities but this was the feast formal intervention by Britain and New Zealand and lead to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi which I think it 's really quite significant surviving nyah nyah Chow who considered taka panicky to be the tapo tapo area in resettled at all no coup in all nuking means at a distance at all no coup the memory of these are being kept alive creating a strong connection between the leaned in technique key in the Runanga so the National receive status because of Takapuna National receives status to be sought this is fully supported by Audino COO Runanga and they did a wonderful presentation to the board not so long ago their only other three of our national reserves in the community and sorry in the country a minute weren 't playing for tow company he is now out for consultation which as a prerequisite for the area to be considered as a national reserve an application to the Minister of Conservation will be made when the council adopts a management clean so don 't know if it satisfies that requests for more information on that mmm but that 's really see in each Titan was freed in king pain it 's good to see that the summer season started really early which was back in October but probably like was reporting that they 're seeing a lot of campaign illegally over mainly an Agora district in and the peninsula we are people can just hide and little weary as over the year so there that summers here there 's a growing concern in frustration building that the boy law hasn 't been enforced found asleep in a vehicle before 00 a.m. obviously this is very half the staff and that have to leave early to get over to that side of the peninsula and there 's all sorts of things criteria we 've had to deputations one of our board and when that board she is from Tracy Liston and really it was quite difficult to catch these people we 're so from what the residents are saying and what 's been enforced is a great Locker so there 's a growing frustration so the board strongly supports the LTP funding for additional compliance staff so the council can effectively and proactively and forced to by law the next is eco burial site what child was had the pleasure of being part of so there 's a photo out the year of Eric in Thornton and myself at the opening thus his 19 years in the making and it 's really just been really a real partnership between the diamond Harbor community in Council staff to make this happen there was a girl in consume from diamond have residents that there was enough buried so they looked at how they could go about creating an eco burial site as in a wonderful location in the whole well really you know there 's bet on news line that was put up on the 21st of November that Spain 's a lot about her but just the whole notion of the Seiko Bureau sort of thing that 's going to keep chill and I 've had lots of people asking me about it so just well done to their community and to your eggs in particular that really helped with the project in I believe councils now investigating how the possible eco burial sites in the study just the last excuse my voice autumn as just acknowledging and akaroa was awarded Kiwis choice for one of the favorite spots in New Zealand which they 're really thrilled about um in well wouldn 't it play at such a beautiful place with us so in what I said about the Freidman campaign there is some concerns from community board members from over the way that I 've got concerned because they 're buzzing near in that they are really concerned about resourcing over the year in you know we the staff are going to be saying to be monitoring the situations so I thought I 'll just state that but the dearest bit of concern so the visit has coupled with the cruise ships well I hate and ruinously was over the year looking at the pedestrian traffic and he reckons that one of the crossings here was busier than any crossing and study so it 's just growing all the time so there is a bit of concern and at the same time I don 't know when I take away from the fact that it was awarded cables choice so it was really great I think at one the destination choice for the passengers on the cruise liners as well so don 't very well yeah it 's a gorgeous place Andrew you 'd like to move this obviously yep and some would like to second it Aaron yep gum was just gonna get to this but was there anything that you wanted to kind of aid first thing go I would probably just we are at the beginning of the summer season the season which has probably started earlier than it sometimes does it 's great the people are wanting to visit the peninsula and akaroa and I 'm very aware of concerns in the community and I get a number of photos that land in my inbox almost on a daily basis of camping activity on the peninsula we had a presentation from staff to the board and one of the things that was apparent from that presentation was that once community members are concerned and whilst there are in a regular context with Busey board members and it comes up in conversation we 're not getting a lot of requests for enforcement actions through the council system and we 're not getting a lot of complaints about what community members are saying is elite um illegal freedom camping reported to us formally so whilst our enforcement team are doing what they can within current resources to make sure that this is is monitored and the enforcement action takes place it 's really helpful if community members are aware in any part is reported to Council by calling the call center on nine forty one eight nine nine nine so that that can first of all be recorded as a complaint and an incidence but secondly allows us to get an enforcement action in place as soon as possible and receiving a photo two days later really removes the opportunity for us to do anything about it getting a phone call at the time that the activity is taking place does allow us an opportunity to respond and allows accounting of that incident as we 're planning how we do enforcement across this summer and in future thank you Yani thank you very much for the more extensive information on Tucker Nikki I just wanted to check does your board have delegated authority for the reserve management plan okay and do you have it I know you 've put the timeframe for consultation do you have a kind of timeframe for a decision on that disease well if you go to the website that says consultation 11 October 15 December 2017 so that closes next week submitters notified of hearing January 2018 just saying and counsel decision April 2018 so is it gonna come reported through the community board to counsel for our decisions community board delegation but I think this is one that should come back to the council right I 'm just might all that when we did if you brief the website it sees a report on a hearings panel together with the revised Ruppert reserve management plans will be presented to Council to be adopted once the management plan has been adopted by council staff will work with or knuckle Runanga to start implementing their great outcomes of the management plan the reason I raise that is previously when we had the hearing into I think it was the registration the historic reserve under the reserves are we had a joint counsel community board hearings panel and I was just wondering if it is coming back to council whether there was any consideration to having you know a local or a city councilor on the hearings panel to give the submissions but it 's specifically designed to seek national reserve status and this is the first step towards that 's set up to hear the submissions is currently just consisting of several community board members we haven 't got the detail of it okay never seen it but presumably you 'll be on yeah yeah that 's so a drink do you think it would be okay and the second thing I was just wondering if maybe at some stage when we meet with the Minister of Conservation we might like to think about briefing around this yep okay but thank you for the work you 're doing on it okay great might be painful just want the freedom camping thing has there been any work done on having more campsites available for freedom campus style so basically dock sites with very basic facilities no not at this point and I mean that might solve the problem we 're gonna spend a lot of money on enforcing something which is very difficult to enforce but actually if we say hey there 's ten fantastic dock sites around the feed store which is basically five bucks a night have some either basic rubbish facilities or basic toilets you know moment they 'll just go to the south they 're all on the Campo what 's a cool place okay so they they they have all the dock sites recorder the trouble was that if we add to those then people just flop to them and drive which was their experience in crashes yeah but we 're all enjoying tomorrow 's is where we 've got the facilities some it 's a lot cheaper to manage I mean people are always gonna seek out places to go that are kind of off the beaten track yeah no I mean I totally get that but it 's a it 's a nationwide a show that really does need to be resolved nationally it 's ridiculous saying that there should be one set of rules in this area and then you cross an invisible boundary and all of a sudden you 're governed by another whole set of rules it 's not very friendly for visitors to understand what the rules are at any particular site but the challenges of enforcement are well they 're significant across because the country that 's not nationwide South Island wine you know I got I think we could do more without the demand side actually what are people looking for let 's find out you provide that melba hang well I don 't think that 's not that 's not the feedback Mike well the one tape but you know so like there 's no Pepe and five bucks yeah you had no idea is gonna say that some of the feedback that we hate that a lot of it as young people that are coming here from overseas opting to freedom came for legally so they 've got more funds to spend on activities I don 't know hey that 's why you have your carrying the stick you have a big fine or a small payment yes but yeah anyway there 's a lot of work to be going on in relation to freedom camping and thank you for alerting us to it no I think you 're welcome so I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "all righty thank you it 's been an extremely busy time and the wards of late I think with summer happening that that 's one of the reasons the Redwood Plunkett rooms project this is much awaited and anticipated in the ward what we 're finding around this area is that there is almost an organic growth as far as community involvement and interaction goes with the library and so forth so this is a really positive way of supporting that the small burns park and cinnamons packed the pavilion there has been demolished and the turf upgrade I think is currently out for tennis that 's getting underway and the new year we have asked for some big signage to go up on the fences around the area so that the public are aware of what 's going on and it kept informed that 's exciting and what 's been really important here is that communication so that the board has been pretty insistent that letter box drops happen around the area to residents because of course there will be there was vibration and noise from the demolition and 's great news that that started this is one of the events that occurred and occurs annually now in the wards this is sort of an alternative to Halloween if you like and that was well attended surely shown again and is a very popular event at McFarland Park so you can see the space there that the community center will be supporting and that again is very well attended I think the weather was good this year too choice makes makes a difference the gala day and this was down at the Beulah Church on Springfield Road very strong links with the community and again council staff involved and there if you just want to say that a lot of these activities do take place at the weekend and so again council staff are very involved and we appreciate that the leadership day was probably one of the best if not the best this is our how many years we had it now four five five core for we must one because that 's right so again this was really lovely and the ward staff were just fantastic at came from the ward staff as well and we use that to all of the promotional material the some of the board and counselors attended during the day we had some fantastic feedback this one here from Tony from community development services and really the other feedback we had echoed the same thanks we gave all of the participants those involved a plant and a card sign from all of the board members and that card had the leadership day and it 's good on the hood repeated as well the main North Road proposed changes and these some big changes proposed for me north road to take away a whole lot of street parking to create more bus lanes down towards he would Road and it 's been out for consultation and I think it 's coming to us the beginning of next year there were 200 submissions so it 's a beginning people were concerned about it so we 'll see what happens there yeah that will be a big issue in our ward with a number of businesses the road issues and pavement issues continue to be you before I took these walking around the block and I took about nine and total and they are absolutely indicative of what we 're seeing with the deep channel damaged pavement cracks and these this is all age and earthquakes so not tree damage as we do see in our water fair but one of the problems is that we are finding when snaps insoles or other complaints are sent through with regards to the roads we 've had one back this week I did saying that the damage on the road was too great for the contractor to repair and that actually it required more serious work they have managed to put some and fill there to temporarily bulb the hole but the holes are just getting bigger and they 're getting worse and there are more of them so we would actually reiterate our request for we believe a citywide audit as needed very similar to almost the Google van driving around to be honest we need to see where this damages and see how bad the damages to prioritize instead of just working off spreadsheets it has increased I think and we are using social media far more and very effectively our Facebook page is putting work notices online we 're getting response from there people are showing us Road problems they 're showing us positive photographs of events as well so the Facebook page is very very effective and I know other wards are somewhat nervous either elected members or staff or both of getting into that social media area and I think it 's something we need to be very positive and strategic about and get on with across the whole city for the community boards thank you that 's an excellent report thank you very much thank you Kazu might would like to move that it be received and Pauline would like to second it and put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "I just wanted to acknowledge as well the huge amount of work that council staff have put on in on this and particularly at knowledge trevor Cattermole who 's sitting at the back here and looking elsewhere so you don 't look at him but he has put in a huge amount of work time not only in an administrative way but more importantly in a an engagement wave with the community so thank you to her amazing I think can we give McLaren close to curses a lot of yeah all right so this is from our report and we as you have as well have thanked the Lions International Foundation for their offer this building was excuse me much needed in the center burns area and has done a great job but as must '_''_60.75 proceeded as a transitional building and it is time for it to move on as we look forward to the building of the permanent community center there so that is the request from the community board or the recommendation from the community board our first and preferred outcome as you 'll see there an area that to be frankerz and dire need of a building like this as you also heard from the Schulich Community Trust who I must acknowledge as well for their work but there is also a plan to build more housing and they 're both housing new zealand housing and other housing so high-density and as we so often hear these buildings and these facilities for communities are often forgotten about when these plans are put in place so this is actually really important to support that community as well I have nothing further to say I think you 've Kevin I presume that Pauling would like to move it and Mike would like to second it so Pauline you look good also just reiterate what do you and for the great woods from the Lions to in for a global international organization to put their eye on Christchurch and our crisis we 're really really grateful for their not only for some almonds for allowing activation here but now to move through to surely but I would also like to acknowledge the work that Digby 's done the and this thing a new way to work and that 's the way this council wants to work and we are working like this improving the success of it and dug this thing right at the coalface here we 've had the meetings that are no monthly sometimes more often sitting around a table talking about how we 're going to overcome these little obstacles that do seem to appear here and they 're whips through really well in Digby 's actually got to know that community group very well and I think that that 's a powerful message to take back from the success of this um so we can 't really understand what this will mean to this community it 's just it 's a fantastic benefit though now the shooty trust is actually now able to expand their programs which it 's a very timely arrival because they 're suddenly seeing this incredible expansion happening organically so I think that the timing is perfect so you know just the gratitude for this that 's an incredible chance for surely Trust to grow even further and reach out as well and I reiterate Elias weeds for Trevor he 's being remarkably so we 're so an excellent process and I 'm looking forward to the opening so I once again thank you thank you Mike did you want to say a few words pretty much everything 's been been said but you once again ignoring what Pauline said thank you very much for this this offer and gift it 's been wonderfully used in st. Albans you know that was a community of Mabon after the earthquakes once one when there are communities in towards demolished and so to have that transitional center there for for such a long period of time that 's been wonderful and in the community rallied around and I 've been doing some great things in the air we 're looking forward to the rebuild of a new center there but in there surely area you know the Shirley Community Trust have done some amazing things with that community and it 's just growing and growing and and strength and it is time for them to have a much better facility that they 're doing so this gift is actually going to help us help that community so much so thank you and thank you alright I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried unanimously _"

    "text": "patient and I 'd like to invite I carry Longinus up from straw free crash ditch to come forward thank you Carrie my presentation is just coming up with excellent okay thank you first of all for inviting me to join you today it 's really nice to be here to talk about your friends at Christ Church and hope those accounts like Ian and counts this makes no showing interest in the work that we 're doing first of all I just want to take a brief moment to talk about the scale of the problem plastic drawers and other disposable plastic items entering landfill at a scary rate around the world and eight million tons of plastic waste enters the world 's oceans every year that 's actually more plastic than fish by 2050 according to scientific projections plus this draws among the top five plastic items that are found in beach cleanups and over 500 million straws in the US alone e-news pay per day which is billions per year so plastic ish is not great for for the planet for the world for the ocean if removed from its nostril and very traumatizing to watch and that 's actually become quite a campaign feature for a lot of strawberry groups around the world in Christchurch what we started to do was to survey local bars and restaurants to find out thank you very much the situation is of how Astral 's being used in local businesses and we found that a lot of businesses are already extraor free plastic tional free saris that are using paper steel and biodegradable alternatives there 's also a lot of interest in switching to an alternative to single-use plastic straws I think local businesses seem to want is more guidance and support from council and so it 's led by local government and also they have concerns around cost and customer perception or maybe that people expect to have a straw in their drink but that can be remedied with using alternatives so am stryve additional buying from businesses continued local government support be welcome and also a community back campaign to show customer support would really encourage businesses to follow suit and ditch the plastic straw so what about read that Wellington Council have just announced measures to reduce straw use including offering free trials of plastic straws to local bars and sit in the center there are local campaigns plastic straw free rain kyoro do some really great work and there 's a plastic bag free Christchurch group operating on Facebook as global campaigns a lonely Wales draw us ocean plastic pollution coalition Seattle will be the first draw free city in the world by next July which is really amazing and it 's become a really timely global issue and a localized issue because of the influence we can have locally Blue Planet series has highlighted some really alarming problems of ocean plastic and how it affects marine wildlife and the UN has just declared ocean clusters to be a planetary crisis next it 's the Christchurch and how Christchurch can help it 'd be really great if you could lead by example or phase out single-use plastic drawers at council locations and events I know that you 've already doing some really great work with compostable packaging events so I imagine this fits very well with ensure they have the support and the resources that they need to minimize plastic straw use and encourage local businesses to go completely straw free which is perhaps slightly more of a longer-term goal and longer-term beyond that point is to look at becoming a disposable plastic free City this is something that can be done and the Seattle shown and and why not us and to influence by example other communities in New Zealand to take action and this reflects where we stands the nation committed to preserving the natural world I 've provided some additional information on my presentation which I won 't go through now but if you want to look at that then they link through to local groups and websites around the world and also some articles that are local and globally relevant to this cause as well as our contact details so if you would like to get in touch or ask me any questions and obviously I 'll take questions now if anyone has any you know I 'd love to have a meeting thank you any questions thank you very much you I should say Seattle is our sister city so maybe that 's an opportunity for us to think about following suit got thirty four seconds ago so anyone Oh Aaron I 'd like to ask you met Emir and CA Carlene if we could consider becoming place to create all our venues with smoke free in our packs and it 's just a sign it 's a start that just says that work place to train we encourage people not to use plastic in those places but certainly on all the premises we have and we 've got some large catering ones I own a premise myself and it was pretty easy to switch to paper straws I just bought a box of paper straws and stopped using place that one it was so it 's easier than giving up smoking or cocaine and it 's just placed it and neither of the two evils I mentioned ruin the ocean either well smoking does a little it 's a cigarette butts end up there but plastic is a shocker so we don 't need it yeah okay well perhaps you the innovation and sustainability committee and ask them to report back to Council with some recommendations absolutely and Sikandar by Dion swags I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that was carried thank you very much thank you great stuff Duggal homes here 's a presentation on the brand for short development this is real oh and Eric banks as well as back thank you hey is adjacent residence we 'd like to make some comments about the new bike and fork sorry that look the sound system something 's wrong with it today and they 're so low that I can 't hear okay if we 'd like to route as I can go make some comments about the new battle for Shore Faisal I 'll try and be as small as possible to happen to believe it to get through once network all right so as you 're probably familiar with the proposal the pulls on the right the playground on the right hand side followed by proposal for what pulls the possible relocation of a surf club and orange space using part of the existing car park and a new area where the current surf lifesaving Club is and this is an aerial shot of the area superimposed on that is what roughly would look like in general terms with the pools and the blues surf club in yellow and the both area is the car park the residence is three groups of residents here today their homes are circled there it 's not a view looking in from the sea you know views currently there 's a general view of the area and as a coach it 's a couple of quick shots here or views all three houses share similar views of the surf it 's a slightly more wide angle view is the proposal winner head basically go from that to that with surf club on the right and that would mean that the carpark wouldn 't have to be elevated by about one of the quarter meters to match the existing level of the surf club area so that was a cantankerous car park potentially there could be further commercial development in the future according current views that we all have quite a broad view from the pier around further to the north what what our issues are is that we believe that the the developments were bright and including the apples excuse me and playground are a good thing and we believe loss of mmm excuse me loss of views is we 're okay with losing some of their views for the greater good of you Brighton but we believe that in that scenario that I 've just Illustrated agree we lose all of our views it 's a bit unreasonable given that we 're all interested in the surf and various ways our kids surf they like to look at the view and be a loss of amenity value all of those things associated with having a perceived view packing what this proposal will do is to remove parking with the yellow and the blue areas are and replace that with the area with the surf club is on the left hand side excuse me so there 's a net reduction and capacity that at the same time there would be a increase 's going to flow down into traffic issues the idea is that the greater car parking of car parking the greater new body area will cope but in reality we all know that people like to park close to the facility that they 're visiting so it 's not a good recipe we don 't believe in the very few places where people can park and look at the sea particularly of concern to elderly or infirm people this is going to reduce their capacity it 's also going to reduce the capacity for events and beans are very popular to hold on the car park area there this is a shot taken last weekend just to show typical summers visitation the car parts completely fooled that the street parking is already adult so on top of that if you have increased demand beautiful facilities they 're going to be issues okay so now hand over to do we 'll talk about the surfaces we see them just thanks very much just I 've focused fairly quickly I realize for a bit short of time I raised the concerns of around this round the super Club in relation to the relocation of sift lifesaving Club these four points are like to make there 's a lack of consultation with residents and commercial entities around the use of and moving that moving the club it was off from made by Christchurch City Council to New Brighton Civic club to help with the relocation the ability of New Brighton surf lifesaving Club to actually patrol this area effectively and the water safety risks involved with building a public areas so close to a water hazard one of the biggest water hazards in Christchurch lack of consultation between the group up there the New Brighton board riders put a hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars to the rebuild of the new pier they were made the patrons of the pier at the time these other groups that use that water Erin no one was consulted about the moving of the surf lifesaving Club Pier of foreshore Society raised with the locals raised half with so with the New Brighton longboarders raised half of money for the rebuild of the new pier which is now that still been no consultation with those groups that you 've got soup club were told there 'd be a million from the council to a system to relocate to the hot water pulse on beachside playground this has burnt lead to a whole lot of controversy and confusion within local groups and surf club itself and with no sort of real resolution from that I question the ability to having come from our surf lifesaving background myself I question the ability for New Brighton soup club to patrol that area if they were to move into that high hazard area there I guess their version is to prevent drowning and injury at the Brighton Beach and to move a super Club closer to that risk there 's just looking for disaster basically I 've got some pictures here if PA you can 't really see to blue well with those lights but there 's a faction of rips that run either side of the pier and towards the pier for a header point I can 't point them out but there 's a series of rips one running rotten in this if you look to the bottom to the left-hand side of the pier there 's another rep and then another rep another aerial view there if you look at the Surf Club the Surf Club down let 's just down there in there there bottom left-hand corner the wave formation in front of the club is the safest place to swim at the moment if you look up towards the top of the picture and these turbulent water currents and that can lead to all kinds of problems the risks itself the pier the reps on either side over created area this area 's traditionally been surfing area and sig for no more surfing bodies have been consulted to put the public sooth club whole lot of people and that area there 's just going to be a disaster for for injury just very briefly the we believe that the consultation been very limited plans are very general what we 'd like to see is a fuller consultation process so that when the the next stage of the design the developed design if you like is produced that a better idea of the overall impact we already had the construction of the playground started before consultation on the pools in the surrounds so we 'd like to see public process consultation process on the developed design ideally with hearings and also we 'd like to ensure that it 's made very clear to the club and publicly that the financial assistance to the tribe is not contingent on then moving well look I 'm thinking I 've let you go substantially over time I felt that this was a presentation that wasn 't appropriate for a five-minute you know that the last one was a five-minute presentation can I just encourage you to perhaps go to the present to the community board because anything that comes to council for the recommendation is going to come through them anyway I don 't recall the million dollars ever being contingent on moving so but we 'll check that out and let you know and and there will be obviously processes that will be gone through but DC our due to report to the council next week that reported to finance them in terms of the intention with regard to consultation but I don 't think that they want to do anything other than engage with the community over the intention sphere CF life-saving club as I understood wasn 't keen on moving so I just yeah I just think there 's a lot more to be done with them this wasn 't a very good place to be raising it so thanks very much for the time that you put into the presentation we 'll follow up on some of those issues and come back to you but I really do recommend that you go through the community board thank you thank you right the next one is through scanning right good morning my name is Bruce King I live in the Bromley and the wind shadow of the Christchurch City Council owned composting plant which is operated under contract by living earth a division of waste management New Zealand Limited which is owned by Beijing Capital China I 'm here to talk about the community liaison group meetings with regard to the operation of this plant who in the from to meet community group meetings and ELISA I received from John Mackay of the CCC see I was being from the community meeting because he stated I did not follow the terms of reference for the meetings in particular that I did not focus on the previous quarter reporting period of all the minutes of the previous meeting however the statement I made was related to the minutes in his readout and and was really out in general business section of the meeting and with prior approval of the chair the statement I read out relates an incident that occurred at the beginning of the November 2016 community liaison group meeting I stand by the statement as the true observation of what happened at the start and following the November meeting I have attended most of the CLG meetings from the beginning and the same concerns about the plant operations at the start which are the offensive odors and dust from the property still exists almost nine years later and it is now been 48 days of offensive odor the composting plant continually breaks its consent of operation with be detected over the property boundary I received a letter of reprimand from John Mackey in April 2017 in which he stated I consider this as a knee into the matters raised six months later later and with no co G meetings organized as required by their consent I have now received a second litter banning me from future meeting the leader also states quote any request sent directly to our staff or the contractors staff on the issue of the operation of the living youth facility or associated community group meetings will not be responded to this amounts to dip evasion of most civil rights to have any right of reply to the false allegations made and mr. macey octobe mr. Matthews October letter by operating the living earth plant and it 's on its present site and in its current form the CCC is also infringing on my human rights to be able to enjoy any outdoor living on my property in an adjacent recreational areas health and safety concerns are also an issue with the dust emissions from the site regarding respiratory problems thank you I 'm forum to have questions you 've made your presentation I think we should just take that on board and respond to you in writing well I would like to discuss the leaders that have been sent to me in regard Ansari but I I don 't have additional knowledge others no I think discussing what you 've just stated with respect to named staff members I don 't think having a discussion and the open forum public participation section of the council as appropriate but I 'm very willing to facilitate a response thank you well as Lena gave me no other other place I couldn 't go and correspond with anyone in the council because I had no right to according to the leader well I will personally understate respond to it thank you thank you all right the next is and call Bonita Jesse Rachael NJB who would like to

from the earthquake you know I was healing the price of cakes and I 'm still here and job yeah there isn 't a single person around this table that doesn 't you know feel for your situation counselor buck has a very close association with the the housing trust and she is going to go with you now to see if we can solve one part of the problem because for me and the whole council we 're we 're in a process at the moment we 've got an application and with other agencies because this is not a city problem on its own it 's not a MSD problem on its own it 's not a employment problem on its own that everything starts with the home and if we can get people into homes that 's why the policies called housing first then you can start to look at all of the other issues you know is that okay if you go with counselor but you back now she 'll start that process I 'm hoping that it will be a successful outcome but nobody can make promises when they don 't know whether they can be kept but you know there is there want to offer you our support and hope that we can assist in some way to get you on that journey home first and then the other issues that you 've talked about could I invite Digby Prosser at the Lions Club International and the team to come forward they 're going to be speaking regarding item 12 acceptance of gift of building and we will move straight on to the item acceptance of gifts a building after we 've heard from Lions Club International and look thank you for being here and thank you for the reason why you 're here and thank you for what you continue to do for our city and have really stepped up to deliver beyond what you normally deliver since the earthquakes and it 's greatly appreciated so over to you Digby thank you madam me and thank you to the council for having the opportunity to speak which comes as a little bit of a surprise but it represents the outcomes of lots of speaking in different forums over a period of time one my left is our district governor from Lyons across to the west coast and which Christchurch is a constituent part and I 'd like to introduce lion Peter gamble who wants to say one or two words thank you very much Toby and nearly an and councillors I 'm very pleased to be here this morning I 'd just like to make a couple of comments the commitment and partnerships that grew out of our devastating earthquakes meant that a model of engagement involved it has attracted interest in many areas one in particular is my organization 's humanitarian arm who Lions Club International Foundation as long as we represented in over two hundred and ten countries around will 't when it disaster happens the foundation is there with advice resources and funds almost immediately the partnership they 've evolved between the Christchurch City Council and local lines has been looked at by this organization very closely and is now used as a template in other countries and other disasters locally this only came about because of the willingness of the council and local lines to work together in a time of great need I thank you for framework for more work we can do together in the future the people of Christchurch benefited from this so let 's do it again hopefully in different circumstances I want to just add one or two words to what Lyon Peter has shared with you this project is the culmination of several projects it is the legacy in a sense of the very first Partnership Program we set up in the early phases post-earthquake when we purchased a building and made it available to the council to occupy the site in sand albans on Colombo Street and the time has come because that facility was always transitional to move it somewhere else and thanks to the goodwill of counsel and council staff we have been able to work together with the community board and the Shirley Community Trust to establish the need and identify ways that need can be met by relocating a building from Sullivan 's to McFarland Park and you will no doubt have read all the briefing papers so I won 't go into the details except to say this has been a particularly fruitful and harmonious under the chairmanship of a council a staff member but with the attendance of members of the community trust and there has been a great deal of interaction between the two groups and I want to acknowledge their participation I believe that Graham will speak just briefly after I have finished in this particular case we are gifting the building which we purchased four or five years ago in addition we are making a grant to help the relocation and we have been able to take advantage of a partnership with the original transport company that located the building for us in the first place and give us an advantage as a Lions organization to do that why do we choose to do these things well one of the primary objects of lines is to X actually try and improve opportunities in the community and create self-sufficiency in those groups that work within the community and we believe by allowing this building to be repositioned it would allow another community group to get on with the business of building their community and that for us is the primary outcome we but we 're not going to try and do the community 's job for them but we want them to have the facility in which to do it and we believe that McFarland Park presents a huge opportunity in an area which has an infrastructure that will need this injection which one more enthusiasm and positivity for the whole of their community thank you very much thank you and just on that note could on bike Grande much for the chair of the sherry Community Trust just to come forward for a couple of minutes and then I 'll swap you out for the chair of the community board good morning my name 's Graham Mitchell the achievement of the Shirley Community Trust since our inception 18 years ago from that time eighteen years ago the trust today in the really the state houses in the area of Shirley in this last year a hundred and eighty six volunteers from this little community gave over twenty thousand hours of their time to engage twenty seven thousand attendances into their projects and special events just in this community McFarland Parkin itself it 's a fitting place that the center is going to be placed on this I would say historic piece of special and land what has been important to us is there 's their little shoe leakage Trust building up there next to the kids first building it was a disused Plunket rooms and that 's all we 've used it had available to us for the last 15 15 years it 's and for all the other community buildings in the air it disappeared from the earthquakes we are so indebted to the Lions Clubs International Foundation for their accepting us as a place that they would like to gift this building to let me just tell you one quick story two years ago the McFarland Park during the week isn 't used much after school for any activities two years ago that was last year we worked with a touch rugby cantebury touch rugby to start a touch rugby program we now have a primary school program after school they 're planning about 80 80 children in the afternoon and in the evening we started our first ever a year later yesterday there were eight teams doubled in one year to see families sitting around that around the park eating fish and chips talking to each other as a start of their community development that goes on year after year like other groups around the area are doing so it 's it 's little by little you change a society for the better of our overall community and we 're very thankful for their Portland is a pollen quad a Salesman finish of a Christmas joke so well just to keep me going 40 see I quit quite a stupid joke so I said so I thought were the esteemed counselors there I should really ask a very serious one about that you probably do know that you 'd be able to pass on dessert why did the turkey cross the road don 't know why did the tibia cross the right well I don 't think it should because it 's Christmas time it should run a mile very good thank you thank you very much and if ya just gratitude are all round and very very behind me who 's arrived from work is Phil Lynch filled us captive lines and has been chairman of the lines earthquake committee for the duration since it was established 6000 years ago I 'm just a gofer he 's the leader it 's nice that he 's here to see this well it 's like let 's acknowledge him thank you very much and pips I could have I Kelly Jones and your governance right if you cheer in an arse and we will go straight to item _"

    "text": "the last item on the agenda is the complete astute potential sources of funding item 29 you 're happy to and seconded by and yeah do and possibly move an amendment it is on the the amount there are two things suggested here at this week 's in the heritage grant committee and the heritage staff did not like the approach despite the fact that had been approved by Heritage New Zealand so had it got a heritage grant this will have been a great deal more than 100,000 for such a significant building and Murchison or in church corner this is basically the foundation stone of the church corner and fulfills not just a major heritage function but as we discovered when we and as we knew when we went to visit them a major Community Development function in the church corner area I 'd like to see us give more than a hundred thousand dollars that the loan won 't be helpful for the group they can 't afford to take up a loan this is a huge redevelopment project and probably the most significant heritage and community role in terms of providing for the community in that area it does a huge amount of work I don 't think a hundred thousand as adequate I would much prefer to take it out of the Heritage Grant and basically have a fight with the urge of people because I don 't agree with what they 're doing but given that we 're not going down that path and we 're going down kept on down and that 's totally fine but it needs to be at least 150 or 200 thousand a hundred thousand goes nowhere in terms of getting this project up and running you 're expecting a very hardworking group of community people who are really focused on helping that community which is very diverse community to actually go out and raise millions which we 're not expecting in other areas I mean if her heritage people had a different view this would have probably got three or four hundred thousand from heritage so sorry we 're in the report does that say that here Jenna Zealand support thus Amino it within the report the reports with other agencies they 've had heritage support for the work that they 've done to date not from our staff and they 've had a heritage grant from the previous Canterbury Earthquake whatever it was you so know but you said that here 's a New Zealand 's supported thus as I understand mange to the buildings as I understand it there was support from Heritage Museum but I may be wrong on it and it doesn 't set in the report because that was the one that came to that heritage people but there is there are two views of heritage one group is saying this is fine our staff is saying no it 's not my major concern is not that my major concern is that this needs to be done and the hundred thousand is an adequate from community viewpoint in order to make it happen so I 'm not really good wanting to get into the heritage debate right questions yep Sarah and then reef either because it 's I 'd quite like to foreshadow a a motion that would be going back to the Grant rather than capital endowment well we had we were already losing food resolution it was to food for reconsideration as part of this one so it wasn 't declined it was the food where is it where 's the who is the actual wording of the okay right all right for in it but if it fails working on down munch which are they speaking to they don 't like a divided heritage I I would rather that like I understand that they 're a debate divided views on heritage yeah Rafe yeah okay so when I look to this the first question was why is this not going through the Heritage process because this is a heritage grant because I see that the council given the significance of some Peter 's Church defer consideration of the Heritage incentive funding application read one point three para one point three on page eight four five yes so that 's my look here this was something for the endowment fund but I had a question we give any money to st. Barnabas church we give done in the past three you relief fund and Andrew I might question that Raths asked in a slightly different way what was the reason for the recommendation from staff in the original report that this item not be funded by way of a heritage incentive grant I don 't want to go back to bed we debated that for hours and we ended up with the fearing her suggestion it 's a monastic heritage an intensive grant yes then the original reasons why that wasn 't acceptable need to be made known to for example raff who wasn 't in the original meeting yeah but I mean I 'm I 'm happy for the question not to be can I make a point of order of it it 's been flagged by Sarah that in fact that we go back to that original recommendation I think it 's really important that the whole council understand the staffs recommendation and the committee 's decision at a time and so I think counselor to nism requited excuse me the council made the decision to defer it it 's right and they requested that the committee report back this reporters so and this is the alternative that they come up with and what I 'm hearing is that some people are okay with that and other people are not and if this is not accepted then we we go back to consider the the Heritage incentive funding application because there was a view from staff that it was a modern addition it didn 't meet the requirements of the Heritage but what we 're hearing now is that here it is New Zealand possibly took a different view and I haven 't seen that written down anywhere so yeah that 's the seal there might be a few things I can help clarify there so this report has followed their earlier resolution which was to defer the decision on the document there you 'll see in attachment C which is the full report that was that previously that has all of that discussion and the advice that was provided by heritage staff at that time one of the points that you 're coming across there in terms of where the support has differed or the opinions have differed one is that you 've got the strengthening repair and additions consented through a resource consent process and then you 've got a process which is considering the works against the operational guidelines of the Heritage Center for grants policy so in relation to that policy there 's a number of criteria that are not met and that 's what that report covers so of those there 's three criteria as a whole that are not met and another two and part that 's of a total of seven criteria so that was really the basis of that earlier advice which is that attachment C so I think that 's important to just understand where those differences can arise hint staff came back with a number of options for you to consider today which are the alternative sources of funding that have been considered and could now be looked at and beyond those that some Peters themselves have also applied for what you 'll see in the report can I just give notice of an amendment to move the capital endowment from 100 to say 150 right yeah I mean to cut front yep I 'm happy to yeah but if the mover and seconder were happy with 150 then they could just accept that and tonight there is one ocean of D it 's very heavy to support okay so um question so who was I mean I 've got Pauline but who else a Yanni had his hand up before Yanni so I appreciate this is a different situation because we want action on this but I 'm really concerned that we 've asked for a process around the capital endowment fund and we still don 't have one and I 've got other groups who have been keen to come and put in applications or get consideration and we don 't seem to have any process when is the process for the capital endowment fund coming back to us so we can where all the different requests with external funding in a way that we can see what the needs are on our own soon though so the the grant here as as has changed in terms of the at being moved and seconded so it was and and that as increased to 150,000 yeah right so just so I 'm clear so for the remaining 300,000 before 1st of July next year we 're going to have a process in April well they see the first quarter of next year that 's before the in demand around how we allocate the remaining yeah yeah cool and if groups have more urgent things and we just get them to come to council well know that this has come through because of the challenges around the around the Heritage incentive grant but look yeah I mean look it is coming back to us it we 've got their whole all of our grants of subject to a funding working group review at the moment so we 're just you know we 're a bit behind schedule as far as that 's concerned that I 'll just tell the gripstic I 'm director Carter so I just know don 't go telling Bruce to come to council if if you can please just hold off until the new year but it might be too late for some of them I had with staff is we 've made it I think was a bit like refs point we 've made other grants to churches I think for example P I see and I just think you wanted to get a sense of the quantum because I 'm just concerned around the kind of consistency of the grants that we 're giving out and and with similar I mean my reading of that grant was it was a summer sort of aspect and I can 't I can 't quite remember how the quantum that we gave but can you just give us some idea of the Quantum 's that we 've previously given out to churches that I 've got earthquake repairs that are needed so we did look at a number of examples because obviously comparable applications as one of those aspects we 'd consider some of the organizations community organizations and churches have been able to apply to funds that are no longer available and so for example one that we looked at was some palms Trinity Presbyterian they we had a hundred thousand grant from the Christchurch events facility and I guess it was a comparable one but from another funding source a source that is exhausted by the way I mean there 's nothing left so you know it 's not it 's not something that we can go back to for this one we didn 't find why one listed for Knox it 's a really good compare of another it 's really good comparison thank you so who else was it who else had questions and Pauline say that recommending 100 from the capital endowment and then perhaps a 500,000 loan but do they have the means to make any loan repayments that would need so the recommendation is that there 's an application to apply for that loan which would assist that so that 's part of that process so and the total that they 're now seeking would be 500 so the hundred would be less that plus any fundraising was was what we imagined so the information would taken to account revised fundraising yeah we know that so would therefore would would our contribution via the capital endowment money not be the the other which is we have four hundred I 'm not sure how the conditions are met and normally set up be able to clarify no there would be up to you to put those notions of well it says subject to the total required funding being confirmed and in place and the confirmation of all necessary consents being in place before any funds are released to simply destitute I think that 's that 's clear enough it 's in the resolution yep Sarah I 'm just really quickly with the Heritage grant while it didn 't meet criteria councils actually allowed to make decisions that don 't meet policy as long as it gives reasons for it doesn 't it right yes and you would need to be clear on what the inconsistency is and the reasons for the consistency so yeah that relates to the criteria that I mentioned before yeah but also remember that in the Hareton did seem to grant fund there isn 't much funds remaining this year there 's approximately 135,000 and there 's a grant currently lined up for the committee on heritage buildings come for their grant and there was none left this is it likely that the committee I don 't know you might not fail to speak to the committee clearly but you know there are the potential for those other ones then because there 's no funding list there to try and excess cable endowment as well as this president seating in that way not in my understanding I think most of those types of applicants would be encouraged to get ready for applications and the new financial you should be funding should there be fund in the early on sending hearings I 'm Glen and then Phil 428 you know just sit around the that Meritage New Zealand litre so we have a problem because we have disparate information so we have heritage New Zealand are supporting we 've had this asked and answered it was crystal clear from staff there are two separate processes you say okay you know asked an answer to that question okay all right my question is what to do with yeah different information on a different meter was around the resource explained was the I 'm not going to go into the details because I wasn 't the author of that report but I think it was clear and reviewing that report that you 've got two different processes one being the resource consent process and it has received resource consent and there is letters of support related to that and then you 've also got other funding heritage funding that 's been provided by other organizations and then you 've got this assessment process which is against our heritage incentive grant fund so you 've got lots of different processes that go on here and there are different views yeah so one of the counselors made a comment in relation to if we increase the amount to 150,000 from the cap on diamond was approximately 300,000 would remain in the capital reelin phone I just want to check that there is Creek paragraph 5.5 that outlines the funding and the capital endowment fund so the total current lease that 1718 financial year would be four hundred and forty six so that 's the figure that we were given to work resolution in front of us we 've got a foreshadowed motion the resolution has been moved and seconded so I will put that motion oh yes Jimmy chin he will review that for base result compared to the sixth of September reporter this one 's more positive because we recall the sixth of September report during the social and community by my committee I was only one against that original staff report because wider the because the application was not compliant with the Heritage either stood the standard in the criteria but I thought why in their time I against I saw this to eat Panda or passive being active as a council we should of working together closely as a partnership with the commune so today I saw this the report I 'm very happy even is not perfect but is up Aptus Nick that is optimistic because whether we final resolution we found the solution know we have engagement listen to the community there was is there concern especially if we review that they reported heo delicious and Peter 's Church Hall the faceting not only the provider for the wider the community groups and individuals we can see here even a year per year small in the twenty thousand people engage with name and also I remember some of our kinda committee members we was in there we listened to layer voices it 's quite a significant we I assume you know maybe Yanni order filled clean in week will be impressed and accredited by the excellent services so even in here but we kinda found in today country and the 50,000 per still have a cape for 350,000 but we can encourage net to make a application for a counselor a community long message for you know still can further cable so this whiner I happy to movies well encourage all all the Federal Council to fully support is my thank you thank you Sarah I will keep this really brief I 'm in complete support of some Peters getting funding from counsel I just don 't believe that this is the place for it it should be here to funding it 's a huge just of building while our staff have one view there are a different view and I 'm of the fate I 'm of the view that we should be making a decision outside of policy to give heritage grant funding and capable endowment I worry this it 's a precedent for other buildings that don 't qualify for one grant to come to Council for capital and down on each time Mike Jonnie anyone else and don 't Dion everyone people I would like it 's not that are here yeah but I 'll be I 'll be quick to because I I won 't be supporting this one I 'll support the Sarah 's foreshadowed motion because a long lines were seriously actually I don 't think it should be coming out of this fund it should be coming out of Heritage Fund and I 'm and time again we have seen heritage grants come through the council that we have approved even though they have not been consistent with policies time and time again sometimes they actually go against three policies so we 've done it before and this is clearly a heritage building the strengthen of this work the fabric so we shouldn 't be doing it from here we should be going back to the Heritage incentive fund and doing it from here sorry who was next day Yanni and then in I 'll be really quick I actually support it coming out of the capital endowment fund I remember when the capital endowment fund was set up there was a big discussion about how it should be spent options at the time considered where to give everyone in the city a little piece of money or actually to retain it and put it towards Community and Economic Development type projects and sadly most of that funding went to economic development but here today we 've got actually at what I think is a really good example of community development I think it 's important to recognize that this is not rate payer funding this is funding that was set up from a sale of one of our company 's subsidiaries and it was put into a pot to be able to do what I think we 're being asked to do today which is support those of the city so I 'm really happy that the capital endowment fund is used in this way it 's consistent with what we did after the earthquake when we took the interest offer and put it back through the community boards with a process to help those communities that had really suffered from the earthquake and you that 's why I 've asked about getting that process on track again so that we know that there 's more needs out there and it would be good to have a process where others can also access that funding but you know this is exactly what I think the capital endowment fund should be used for it will have a big impact in a local area of the city which is important and I totally agree with what yeah it 's just seed and I think we need to just he said as a heritage building but more importantly is a community building in this community needs this space to strengthen and enhance what it does so more than happy to give them approve 150,000 very good so I 'll put opposed say no so Sara and Mike that 's carried thank you very much Oh an abstention from roof man G thank you _"

    "text": "thank you for all your hard work at the end of the table there the next item is item 27 hearings channel report on the proposed traffic and parking bylaw 2017 I 'll be here all right this was the one David would you oh no no not David Andrew would you introduce this one thank you and this is the one of these bylaws where the hearings panel was not of one mind so it it wasn 't a unanimous recommendation and I imagine that 's why I canceled the Livingstone has indicated that this is an issue for him so the hearings panel was generally in supported the proposed bylaw most of the recommended changes that you see to provide clarification or explanation rather than being substantive in nature and the main focus of the hearings panel was was on two things I guess really focus on the issue of parking on berms was was one part of that and there really we spent some time in discussion balancing the appropriateness of this particular method of parking and damage two berms with inconvenience to residents particularly in areas of the hearings panel on this actually upholds the proposal which is not to allow parking on berms but as I say that part of our recommendation was not unanimous we also considered matters relating to what was termed storage of vehicles on roads so parking of trailers boats camper vans caravans and so on for periods exceeding seven days and there were some submissions that we dealt with on this particularly relating to and discussion around where there were problems caused by such parking but also where because of the the nature of development and the nature of the roads off street parking of often wasn 't available and that was the only option for residents to park such trailers and vehicles close to their properties and again on balance after some discussion and considering matters raised in the submissions we decided to recommend as per the proposal which was was not to allow those vehicles to be parked on roads for longer than seven days so I understand that there 's some further information come in from Orion which is supplementary to the submission that we heard from I might hand over to to staff to provide any further information from Orion which has been supplied by web clarifications since the hearings providers information and they were not particularly happy with their suggested notes that we put in the Bible or to address their concerns but staff do have a remaining concern about granting blanket exemptions to companies even if it as for the parking provisions because we still have underlying concerns about safety hazards so they advise to Council is the same as the advice that you provided to the panel yes it 's right it 's our preferred position yep so having heard that I think it 's fair to say that I can be confident in recommending our original recommendations to counsel but noting that the parking on berms aspect wasn 't a unanimous recommendation everything else was okay so so your your your a show us the beams so if somebody moves that are you moving that and seconded by David you 're gonna move that the Clause where is it beams what 's the beam cause I can 't see them oh I just one minute wait where is it sorry which is it one of the bullet points or no I all right I just in there the actual bar itself so what what page is the boom change no no no I 'm looking for the book that we are going to say no to if we agree with you so I 'm sorry I 'm trying to find an easy way of achieve that because as a subject of concern would be cause 11 of the Bible which has no parking on certain parts of the road okay so what what parts of it have changed we haven 't_''_374.37 changed any we haven 't recommended to the hearing spend or any changes to that so that is the current law oh sorry I see what you saying and no that is not the current law at the current provision in our traffic and parking by law it present is that there 's no parking on grass booms or grass verges where there are signs prohibiting that parking so what we move into is a different version because the law was been case law that now supports the position that parking on booms in fujas of this the case can be prohibited without the use of signage yes I know but the not everyone around the table agrees with that position so I want to make sure that there is a worded amendment that is capable of being debated so so am I able to say that that there 's an amendment move by Glen Livingston that the so right there 's an amendment moved by Glenn Livingston that the the previous provisions relating to parking on suit or relating to no parking on certain parts of the road because presumably that 's what it that 's what that section was called before no the cause before it was called parking on grass booms and verges something okay so why don 't we why don 't we just simply say that to to not not accept the amendment is to remove Clause 11 and reinstate the previous clause does that does it as they 're effectively giving effect to what councillor Livingston raised just just wings in it it just makes keep the status quo yes yeah yep okay so all right now and you get an issue that you wanted to raise questions I just wanted to commend you on the clause 19 in terms of controlling the type of vehicles that can go on with the d2 roads and I guess my question is I do have a lodestar in Wigram we have a retirement religion on one side and it 's going to have a hospital on the other side at the moment it 's been used is a Thruway for heavy vehicles from construction sites and it is causing issues around health and safety which is one of the reasons we have a bylaw so in that situation this new bylaw would be applicable to that situation each situation in case would have to be assist on on its own merits there is enough operational policy which will need to be developed to support it should it be passed but it 's a it would have to take into account that even and local roads there is an acceptable level of heavy vehicles that do need to traffic around 4 percent would be the upper limit so for each case it would need to be assessed against that we would look to work with NZTA force and further guidance on those as well and it would be as I understand a decision of council Aaron term 30 yeah I mean and at the same position with the parking on the bins that I didn 't support that and I wondered if this was a chance for us to I know we 're talking about expanding delegated authority to community boards that on an issue-by-issue basis community boards had the power to but to protect a particular Street or next to a particular reserve is there a way for I 'm not gonna do that in terms of the context of thus by law but certainly we can raise that and the delegations discussions will be Tim thank you with the burn being our property and you 've got a company or whether it 's Orion or anyone else take your parking up and taking space to do work in that area and they under an obligation to can put cones etc out and if they 're not doing that shouldn 't we be enforcing it it 's the same as any work program on any Street in the city are you talking about the bus yeah it does count the property and it is technically the roadway because the roadway is legal illegal Road isn 't it from from property to property yes so therefore they are undertaking work on a road space and as they are a company taking work should they not been under the health and safety irrelevant of what the company is be required to take steps to ensure safety extra safety in that area it 's not like a private homeowner or a private person their company 's irrelevant what they are so would that not mitigate some of the concerns over our company vehicles undertaking works on these places are therefore should we not be enforcing it yes absolutely under the cars corridor access request process the companies are required to have at Reformation plan and they are required to reinstate the legal route to the condition that I found it 's concern was us bending them doing that because of one of the issues being health and safety or the safety because there seems to be a hell of a lot of organizations and companies you know just pack up and there 's no time to be seen or not nothing to be seen enable would be a perfect example of that at the moment so what steps can we take to mitigate to ease the concern around the table with regards to health and say goom 's so the conscious around the health and safety with regards to Iranian submission was really around the access to some of their substations and other plant that they require to exist down in the legal route do you consider our concern safety we make Park up as much yes there are two different things yes so with regard to the safety at the traffic management plan manages the traffic including pedestrians and all that around the site so that is part of the safety plan and then that 's located for that the concern around the berms is really around the damage the health and safety food vehicles on boobs if they need to be the buns Jennifer yes Seto yeah Vicki and then injury it 's a question that doesn 't relate to boons so okay yeah right just in relation to 27 the speed limit does that mean and then apologize for moments right does that mean that it 's a error of time for example sites that they would like to be a 30k in our area that they can do so now under the spa we can help facilitate it there 's no change to this would mean there 'll be no change to the current situation so this is as I said an enabling clause that can 't_``_876.26 happen you should they should the situation meet the appropriate criteria and any NZTA approval won 't be resolved by counsel so in gta ' criteria are almost impossible to reduce speed limits and areas that are rapidly changing but but if it 's our road and two things one we want to lower the speed limit to save 50 can we do that easily through this or is NCTA NZTA have provided I guess more recent guidance and process with this city with speed limits rule 2017 so there is certainly the ability to have some flexibility around what speed limits a seat NZTA still provide that overall guidance as to what is considered appropriate in what situations okay I 'm just aware hugely of their issues sorry to go on but there 's huge issues and the Southwest where areas have become previously rural and and they 've been 70 or 80 but they 're now residential and need to be 50 and the process through in CTA is revolting it 's not helpful so is it now easier for us to determine that that 's a residential area kids are diving out onto the road but and bikes dogs everything for you and it shouldn 't be a 70k well or should we be looking at doing something in a spoiler that makes it easier for that one and then I want to talk about the foodie thing so the final provision in itself doesn 't change anything about our actual decision making process because the up with the speed limits role so they 've just redone the speed limits yeah roll I 'm not dealing with that on a day-to-day basis so I can 't answer so if she doesn 't hate on it and there 's nothing that we could do in here that would make it easier for us to get those down to 50 not through the Bible or not okay second question then if an area decides that it would be safer for this area which might have a high concentration of young kids or whatever to be a 30k in our area and all the residents say yes can we make that happen under the section 27 this this Clause does enable those decisions to be made but they wouldn 't well it would be subject to staff a staff recommendation which were taken to account the advice community ta in the situation so we could ignore the NZTA advice if we chose to well no we don 't need to follow what the speed limits rule says now the speed limit role sees how we make these decisions in giving you the answer you want yeah but so the bylaw was not the right bottom it 's not the right tool just yet thank you Andrew Clause 8.5 in the report has got some figures around the cost to counsel of repairing damage to existing voters well another consideration I think is is the purpose of the burb so when a roadway is designed or when it 's repaired and redesigned what sort of considerations are there around whether you would or wouldn 't include burdens and what are the purpose of the berms particularly focusing on a safety elements okay primary purpose of the burns are amenity value if other burns are damaged then and frequently damaged there will be other designs considered for the particular piece of legal Road and so therefore like you know we cannot may not be able to call yourself the currency if we in place I think the other consideration of humanity other than other than immunity safety as well as a refuge and visibility for the driver okay so Oh yawn ID on Yanni Vicki I mean it is 355 p.m. are staying here until the agenda is finished I 'm going Vicki and aim to join if it 's miles an hour yeah actually not obviously Yanni just wanted to check over the the whole issue of contractors and the damage because I 'm still not can convinced that we 've got the right processes in place we 've heard that we 've got another process underway around things like charging bonds but in terms of the bylaw is there anything that we can do to strengthen the requirement to do the assessment of the road before the contractor works there where it 's construction or utilities and then afterwards so that we 've got a good record because often if this is not relevant to the bile or please just say so because I 'm not going to waste time on questions that are not relevant to what we do so yes just so Klaus part story interference with road traffic or pedestrians recent experience with central city rebuild Chozen is to be stricter regulations protect footpaths and road surfaces from damage during constructions so which which section of really codifies our process in requires you know people are going to interfere with the normal operating conditions of a road they need to get a permit so we need to know what people are doing in the inlets we have James 's team kicks in and here 's the corridor access request the temporary management plans etc that 's backed up by ultimately people don 't comply with it they 'll be breaching the bylaw in there they can be prosecuted we also have backup in Section three five seven of the local government net which creates an offence for doing damage to the road and we 've also added and clause 28 the permissions clause we have strengthened that as well to make it a bit more understandable point and people that don 't need to go through and Commission process to make sure they 're covered up over time a so are you confident that this will see an improved level of oversight and monitoring and a reduction on the expense to council or you know yeah and improve the outcome for the city so we we is the damage to burbs from vehicles their parking illegally and not applying for corridor access or asking for permission from the council that we are not able to follow just costing significant cost yeah and I just wanted to check in terms of the parking on the birds versus the virgins so you 're still saying that we shouldn 't restrict hacking on verges it 's only berms and so it 's just it 's quite hard I think for the community to understand the difference sometimes and if people are doing damage to a verge have you got any powers under the spire laws actually take actions it 's a regardless of whether they can party or not if they 're causing damage is there any power to take action I just know a lot of I 've had a lot of complaints along the river for example which is why I ask which is why which is why I asked for an indication from councillors before because I felt exactly that that we would just accept the panel 's so this is not [Music] I know what you did on Kure to do that for Curie it wasn 't the option that was put to me I mean we had I mean the question was whether this you know had to be passed now or whether we could you know take the time to send it back to the hearings panel are my notes the hearings panel were very comfortable with what 's proposed I know with the exception of the two issues that I raised in the introduction the only one of those that was contentious was this one about parking on berms and it was one member of the hearings panel who didn 't share the view of the other two members at that point I mean to me that 's the only which is why I can 't attack and have we 've worded an amendment that it makes it capable of being resolved but it 's not that these these I mean you know I mean that shouldn 't be debating enforcement I think of its capable of being debated we can debate it yes I know but I 'm just looking for to the questions but I can 't stop accounts of our asking questions if they are in order I can only stop questions that are not an order being passed with the exception of one particular aspect that was referred back to the committee you know but this is not the question we 're not Yanni 's focusing on a different aspect of birth of the bylaw which actually doesn 't sound us of the questions any different from what the previous vial was but I don 't you know I don 't have the insight onto the previous bylaws so that has there been any change made to the definition of a verge and a boom and the implications of them other than the signage where there 's no carbon channel yeah okay so under the previous Bible the council would have to pass the resolution to prohibits the parking on the beach and then we would have to put the sign up under the new provision council does not need to pass such resolution to prohibit parking on a beer and we don 't have to sign up covers those little build-out areas where there 's paving and things that are not designed to be parked on so but Yanni 's question was about the theatres wasn 't up okay so injury we did have some considerable discussion around the The Verge versus boom scenario the main problem with the definition of verge as it takes in a wide range of situations from a grass road shoulder grass the area that runs into a swale beachfront area up on the peninsula for Shore land in in rural roads shoulder situations meaning of which are not a problem at all to park on it 's very preferred to leave it as per the existing regulation so that 's crystal clear but if you hit another question no right so you 've got the amendment and your name gleam do I have a seconder for that Dion all right so so I 'll put the amendment first so we 'll open it up like with the Bayesian people have to debate it so Andrew Glenn I 'm gonna be extremely brief the reason as we just heard from staff that safety it 's to be grasped and it 's not a carpark if we intended creating a carpark we would create a carpark we 've got the figures in eight point five of the damage to burns and that doesn 't include as I understand it the damage to curbs and footpaths berm is a berm for amenity and safety and to create corridors for visibility if we wanted a carpark then that 's what we would create you know Sarah was it quick gianni I 'm just coming at this along planning and pragmatic lines so we have provisions with planning for greater density of housing and I think there 's a sense of which work programs are working against each other so we have our subdivisions now and which they 're you know as and with more dense housing there 's more there are more vehicles now we 're asking people potentially through this we 're restricting the spaces in which they can park and I think that will give rise to some some safety issues in many cases the berm is also the lawn you might want for a year in fairway Park is actually no boon so I think we 've got a few issues and some of our new subdivisions there someone wants to park on their lawn what 's the lawn what 's the boom there isn 't either how do we police smaller streets so we we can all see in our new subdivisions the houses or the planning kind of complies but to the eye the size of their house looks out of proportion to the size of the section it 's quite big in relation to the section the roading the vehicles go with it just on a few more points a lot of damage is actually caused by people driving over so if even if we put this provision in place the you know you still have your heavy guests right vehicles driving on your booms they 're going to tear that up you don 't have to be part they 've damaged the boom in terms of safety we have yellow lines which community boards have the delegation to put in place in relation to line-of-sight issues so this actually need to prohibit parking on booms due to line-of-sight I think for most of us it 's actually vehicles parked on roads which you know cause the line of sight issues which is why we have those delegations all the board 's it 's also a principle there the council on the one hand is saying potentially here don 't park on the booms or you can 't but it 's also not mowing the booms and many circumstances now to me it seems that a sense of stewardship goes with ownership so if we 're really saying we these are our booms thou shalt not park on them we 're actually not tending them either i I can you can to think of many residents who would like more green boons to you know take up the the clippings from the booms that they 're mowing on the council 's behalf they don 't have to do that so I think the whole thing is quite problematic it 's got a pragmatic issue how will council staff know about this does it serve to faucitt foster dopping in either there 's a lot we 're doing at the moment this is council coming out and saying no do we really want to do that so I leave that with you thank you who else did I hear and Sierra Dion Yanni I was gonna keep this brief and just say the Android covered everything but I want to address a couple of points that capital livings doings made one of them is about the plan pragmatism that he was talking about what we want to do was encourage developers who are building in high density areas and making properties more dense to actually provide the parking on site and this will do that if we 're saying to everyone you cannot park on the boom then the planning needs to cater for better design for the sites that they are doing it might also encourage people out of their cars they 're looking at more dense areas if there 's no boom parking if they have to park on the street or if there 's no none provided on site then they 're going to be looking to want in the denser areas and I 've always been taught that two wrongs don 't make a right just because some people don 't tend their booms just because gas trucks might drive over them and damage them doesn 't mean that we should let more people damage them Council pays enough for remediation already we need to put this to rest say to everyone that you can 't do it and just let there be Dion Yanni yeah the reason I won 't support the the put in the boom yeah the booms is especially the Central City the district plan I 'll start I actually think that the policy at this as it 's written is actually ill formed and it could be done better I I know that there are issues around people parking on booms and on the side of the street and the damage and stuff like that but the the the policy as it 's written I think is ill form to actually address some of the issues especially in the central city and in some of the suburbs and I think it in situations that are unintended that are actually gonna sort of Lou you know make them potentially in trouble which is not a good thing but in the central city especially the district plan review I mean the district plan has actually changed the way it has made it possible for developers to develop and actually not really have any on street car parking and that 's what 's happened that 's what the council or whoever did the district plan has actually said we want that to be the way and that 's what 's going to happen intensify housing and all that sort of stuff so that 's what they 're doing and you 've got a lot of more people sort of living in more denser areas but anyway I think it 's just an uninformed policy and I think there 's unintended consequences and I also don 't like the defense as part of the of this bylaw because I think that could have unintended consequences for actually making people you know causing trouble for people that it 's actually unintended Danny just just say very you recall that we were actually giving people tickets previously and then had to go back and actually apologize and so you know this has been a long-standing issue there has been huge damage to our parks in particular particularly around Hagley Park in the past so I welcome this I my concern is that we 're not being strict enough on the verges and I just invite cancers to reflect on the brief movie screenings that we saw this morning and think about the damage going into our waterways from the brake pads of cars and if you drive along the hit get river just have a look at the number of verges that have been decimated by people parking clear cars with their brake pads right close to the riverbank and look at what that 's doing to our environment so you know I think we should be mindful of the fact that there is an environmental negative to the way in which people treat our city in terms of parking in some spaces which are not firms but our verges so we do need to think about it 's not just yellow lines it 's actually if you park up on the on the boom or the verge and there 's yellow lines you 're probably not going to be going to be parking illegally and there 's almost nothing council can do to take action and so I 've seen places that we spend a lot of money trying to improve the immunity just turn to mud because of the parking practices so you know I think council has been fairly pragmatic in the way in which it 's enforced parking post-earthquake I don 't see this as being something to be worried that council is going to go out there and you know just use this as a revenue gathering exercise but I do think that it you know I 'd like it to go further but I appreciate that there 's a debate about whether we 've even gone whether we 're going too far so I 'll support what what 's being proposed and I think the key thing is to monitor it and see what happens but you know I would just been done with the way in which people are parking in the city around some of our spots that we want to tidy up and prove thank you I 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no hands up for I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 hands up for no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 right that 's some lost I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye

    "text": "Stane and accessible cities and s of street proposed road layout options yes please okay so just a brief this week me on the 30th October the issue committee hood the Jews of about thirty seven people who gave up their time to present to us their feedback on the current situation in sedessa street and this arise because after the new design to the street was implemented noting too that this design here to being FeliCa I 've consulted on and I may add was compromised from the streets in spaces designed guideline recommendations but after that was implemented there was dissatisfaction and concern expressed by greeted local business and property owners so in sympathy with them and recognizing their concerns we put the call out for people to come and talk to us or write to us with the view so it was not a consultation for say that we invited feedback we actually had three hundred and twenty responses and a majority of those by far up to 265 actually supported the staff recommendation to the committee as option one with some added safety implementation features concurrently one of the main criticisms from the business group so after listening to the respondents the it e committee reconvened to make this recommendation to full council today and you can see the recommendations up there and the committee has recommended option one plus some additions the addition one additions is including to request consultation on a 30 kilometers speed zone and the which came through loud and clear from the many voices that talk to us when Mike got a note to that staff had many meetings I think I 've heard it 's about 16 meetings with the business group and spent many hours investigating your ideas infuse the issue committees think I think was five hours listening to the views of a broader speak of interested residents and I 'd like to add that after lengthy deliberations including the five our feedback hearing and a 320 submissions the committee reached a unanimous decision which is before you today ensured of starting a whole project again we feel that option one is the prudent fiscally responsible and most appropriate action to support if we were to go back be a huge creature to remove all the parking from the Southside and we got that little Fiat on the beat back and and that was also the preferred original option droplet which was from the streets and spaces design guidelines so I reiterate that 's an SSP today represents a compromise design to accommodate those who are not ready to surrender all the parking our staff will implement recommendations from the safety order there 's part of option one and sedessa Street is also currently doesn 't deemed safe from the safety audits that we have received option one will add improvements to the current Street but there is still more work to do to enhance the immunity further among which is that is tree planting to give verticality which will also slow down the speed so once the Gaiety committee was unanimous and recommending option 1 and I 'd like to invite Mike Davidson to add any comments and see chaired this meeting I 'll do that thank you I 'd like to write you 've got nothing to eat no okay good thank you alright so do help me just confirm in terms of the emergency services vehicles can you just confirm that we 've got confirmation from the fire service that the any safety issues or aspects is being sorted with this corridor yes and we 've worked with the main three emergency sue the fire service still have some issues around mainly if there 's an event on some Ezzor Street itself and they have to stop and there are some issues with safety of their staff when that taking equipment from the appliance as they service a particular site they haven 't been as concerned of around the movement down the corridor during an emergency but it 's more around safety of their staff while they 're attending to a fire so we 're still working with them on how they can manage that but and we 've got a good working relationship with the fire service and we 're talking to them regularly and we don 't think that it 's something that we can 't work through with them have they put those concerns in writing to us only in emails between there was at the meeting or at the you know hearings or whatever it was there was a lot of support for taking the parking off the southern side but substituting the parking that was on the southern side for off Street sites and there were a number that were identified that were either owned by the crown or the council that could be used for that purpose even as a trial have you investigated that all those options yep so we 're currently working with the property team to look at the available land along the necessary and nearby and we 're constantly monitoring the occupancy as well because with Litchfield Street opening up you know that 's also added another 800 car parks within a couple of blocks of so nesaf street and that 's having an impact but we are still working on the possibility of getting some other off street parking nearby while while the city adjusts and I mean has they also been any thought to and and then that same breath there was also the suggestion around maybe temperate to temporarily Tim whatever that the southern side load painting some lines or something like that just and then offsetting that worth of streetcar parking has that being looked into I 'm not at this stage and just on that the work that you said you 're doing looking at the sights why have we not possibly put that as a recommendation today what had that as an option or something well I think we were asked to go away and look at what the possibilities were so we probably couldn 't give anything very much in terms of something that was conclusive or that was a real possibility and we we have had a number of sites that we 've looked at but they just haven 't_''_442.82 been known I think there 's a bit more work that we need to do first before we can actually perhaps propose something to you that we know we could make heaven right and the other you can continue to review the street and others in terms of an accessible City so can I ask one more question yes um something that was brought to my attention the northern side they obviously are getting towards the end of their life from the person that told me that they were getting there has there been any discussion from my work that you know the future work potentially about what that would mean if they needed to underground those power lines and what that would mean for the traffic on that street also that the corridor yeah I don 't think it 'll have an effect on traffic flows it is a consideration for the future how it will actually affect the use of the street I don 't think it 's going to have much of an impact on it underground those overhead cables you 're looking at something in the order of a million dollars the area that that need to go in is very very full of services water stormwater all along that northern side of the footpath beam so it 's not not an easy job today then you just you just you alluded to the fact that the opening of the Litchfield Street King building his hidden defeat and then Pete yeah so it was still monitoring the effects of on street parking but anecdotally the staff and our parking enforcement team are telling us that they 've noticed a reduction in the amount of cars parked on the street but we haven 't actually measured it Phil you know at the committee I guess we had some discussion around the impact of of if the business people 's the err option if we were adopting their an especially in relation to another 53 car parks and I 'm just wondering could you just remind us of the impact of their especia say regarding design and safety if in fact their option had been agreed with by the committee yes so when the the business groups option was put to us we had that independently safety audited and one of the things that came out of that safety audit were concerns around sight lines for cyclists when you add vehicles in between a cycleway and a road lane at traffic lane and you cut down on the visibility of motorists who wish to make a left-hand turn and to one of the the driveways that cuts down on the cyclist visibility of the murderer 's tuning and also the motorist visibility of the cyclist and so that was quite a serious concern raised by the safety auditors and that also came through quite strongly and the feedback that we received from various members of the public and clean since the report was written Erin I imagined the situation around the Metro sports facilities become more fluid that 's noted as a factor on page 280 you know with the paying vehicle movements if you 've got some seats of how that might alter the dynamic yeah well I think there 's a lot of uncertainty around there and until we know what might happen at the end of senescence Street we can 't really say too much about it but I think that area is one one impact and isolation as well but you have to look at the whole area the development of the south frame lane ways and you 've got Lara at the other end and the school of discovery so you know the Metro Sports is one consideration or that a whole lot of other activities that will impact Carson Esav Street functions I have a question on number two which says request I have to undertake public public consultation on reducing a speed limit along senesce of Street to 30 K per hour I seem to recall that when the government passed the bylaw that created the anomaly on on senescence street but created the 30 K zone inside the inside the senesce of street and there and that block the central city block that they inadvertently change the speed limits on the casual mall and through another place that has a lower speed limit than the 30 K do you need to consult on reducing that and if that 's the case could be included in here and just wrap it all up in one fell swoop I don 't think we can include the reduction from 50k to 30k in this report I do believe that we have to go out and you know it says request after to undertake public consultation what I 'm asking is do we need to do public consultation to reduce the can we can look at that yeah I think there 's a wider piece of work about the changes that were brought into the traffic and parking boil or via the sir act and we need to look at where that 's all sitting at the moment right doing that now because we can 't_''_775.99 do that console test if there 's a public consultation it seems to me to hang a few additional elements to might speed things up yeah when you 're trying to slow things down just saying sorry did somebody here have a question right yeah I guess for those of us not involved in the committee stuff in how does this answer the issues around the road narrowness and issues around when people are parking getting out of the car because it doesn 't seem like that 's changed that much yeah and so the the reduction in speed that a potential reduction in speed limit will have an effect on there as will some of the other traffic calming effects like planting out the tree pits you know I guess alpha would perhaps be to give you more wood that is a wood issue neither of the options in that report really gains more gains additional width and you know people just need to be careful getting out of their cars you 've got to wait until you 've got a look and wait until it 's more you open your door yeah and the safety orders haven 't noted that as a particularly concerning point and the design and and haven 't_''_861.34 said that there 's something that we need to to you know rush ahead and make improvements on all right so Pauline you 'd like to move that Mike would like to see conduct no oh sorry Sarah would like to see conduct is there any discussion Dion sorry Jamie why plan on voting against and foreshadowing the motion so I 'm not sure if maybe someone who 's moved it and wants to speak in favor of it first my my shadow motion would just simply be to remove option 2 what my my for shaded motion would be instead of moving option 1 in stated in the report that I don 't think there will be majority support for that so I don 't want to take up too much time I 'm happy to speak to why I 'll be voting against the recommendations there but the for shadow motion would be that if it were to fail I 'd move option 2 right okay all right so Sarah and it was really interesting listening to the verbal feedback that we had in that really long session after recess and it was really clear that the many members of the community the current design doesn 't work although for the most part they wanted option 1 the road corridor itself is narrow for cars it 's all within the guidelines but it feels narrow and passengers aren 't used to getting out into traffic they 're used to getting out onto a footpath and so that causes some concerns for cyclists thus like ways a little bit narrow for overtaking sometimes and in the way to solve that it was put forward to the committee really strongly by many members of the community was to remove the parking enable for all of those things to be altered however I 'm in favor of evidence-based decision-making and there is no clear evidence that we have at the moment from the safety report that we need to make those changes and in times of financial stress when we have lots of other things on our plate when this layout has only been in for a year I think we need to let it be done I think that with more changes on the street in the way in the offing there 's seeing this through for now adding their safety improvements that we 've encouraged through the resolutions will make a big difference 30 kilometers an hour if that goes through make a big difference and I can see in the future that we will need to make a change again but I don 't think that that time is now we will need to remove the parking on the south side widen the cycle lanes to account for the extra cyclists coming up through the major cycle routes that are yet to be installed in that area and potentially adding additional parking would definitely make at least safe for cyclists and we know that there 's schools going in in the area the near misses that are people email me about or ones with his parked car and the visibility is missing so one of the safety things that that we 'd like them to look at is the potential to remove one or two car parks with a setbacks and enough adding additional parking is not evidence based currently there 's only 75 percent occupancy of those car parks and we 've just heard that it 's likely to be lowered at the moment and so spending an additional million dollars of rate payers money putting in car parks that aren 't even needed that 's a complete waste so I 'll be voting for option one and option because I 'm actually gonna talk against it and I also want to I guess get in line and Sutan or my intention to foreshadow a motion if this one does fail and in jammies does which will be to remove all parking will consult to remove all parking what we do know about the street is it doesn 't work it was initially a compromised design that went out for consultation that was compromised even further and as a result of that you know we hear all this talk about these near misses but we also see evidence actually of not near misses for actual accidents where where vehicles are actually heading cyclists where wing mirrors are getting clipped that the road car it does not work for anyone down there it is too narrow and the solution to fix that is to remove the car parking on the south side the lanes don 't actually need to be bigger but there needs to be a buffer zone between the car lanes and where the cars park and that can be done pretty simply by removing the cars parks I know this was based on actually trying to install more car parks but if we have a look at the data that we 've been showing actually there 's a staggering amount of car off street car parking and the very close vicinity of senescent street and it it houses over 800 cars it is not acceptable I think if you 're a cyclist to be biking down there and actually have the risk of being run over by a car because they cannot see you because the visibility is not clear we heard from many many people who are concerned with this issue and it 's time for us actually to do what is right we didn 't get it right the first time it 's not a reason to not make it right so I will not be supporting this you know hopefully other people will not support this who can actually get something in place that is right and will future-proof this area so I will follow on from what mike has said and actually agree with what he said but which is a polar opposite to where I probably started actually on this debate and the reason that I actually initially supported putting you know more car parks back in there and whatnot but actually this street does not work for anybody as Mike just said the safety element the safety review that we actually looking at it from a practicality in the user point of view people aren 't perfect so if everybody was perfect on autonomous vehicles were here maybe it would be right but actually when you put imperfect people that you have cars that are different sizes you have buses which is the street is the main transport corridor that links up the eastern suburbs of Christchurch that 's the reality that 's how it 's designed so you can 't you know the rest of the city would need to be changed in in terms of its priority routes to actually push people down more house ever which is what which what people have tried to do but I 'm really concerned about the safety on the street really really concerned I 'll live on just on say neso Street at the other end near Fitzgerald eV and I drove down and walk down and every single day I see people nearly have an accident driving up the curbs hitting those big build outs on the right hand side they are just they are awful the options that we address that they mine early address it but they don 't actually take the step change that the street needs this is a this is a street that 's heavily used by people in our city and it doesn 't work for anybody it doesn 't work for cyclists it 's not working for cars it 's not working for the many of the businesses who need loading zones down there so I do think that we need to take all the parking lots off the south side but I won 't be supporting taking all the parking off the south side unless we look at the options of actually substituting those parks and I think in the future we need to if we 'd taking parking away from the streets we need to look at substituting to off street parking and that was the whole point of the accessible city plan that actually says that in the parking chapter take on street car parks away and substitute it for off street that was the whole purpose of it but we actually haven 't done that we haven 't done on many other streets as well so that 's why we 're having these problems the cycle lane should have actually been in the south frame now if we actually did that we wouldn 't have all this problem and don 't roll your eyes at me please but it 's a reality we should are you agree it should have been and that was the original plan but why was it not done you know we 're actually facing the problems of what was done by the government and we 're really facing it and I think people need to realize it that was the plan and now we 've got something that actually is a substitute and it was substituted on there and it 's just not working so I really want to take a big change here there 's one point 1 million dollars actually that 's a spear budget from the hero food street they were could put towards us it was come in under budget there 's 1.1 million dollars it 's just floating around but they want to use it for other stuff we really don 't want to just do these minor changes so I won 't be bad Jannik yeah thank you I think we need to really take a step back look at the big picture and that is that you know there has been no common I think agreement around a common vision for the city what we know is that when the blueprint was announced the south frame was supposed to be the cycleway connecting the west east east-west link from Hagley Park to the Polytech and to those eastern suburbs and you know there 's a great there 's a great map on the press website that shows what was promised in the blueprint and what we actually got so what we got was a series of language that doesn 't provide a nice beautiful green corridor as was indicated in the blueprint and that 's led to I think the points that have been raised today is that we end up with streets that aren 't good for anyone we 've got Chum Street and so nesaf Street carrying all sorts of traffic heavy vehicles buses pedestrians know it just it frustrates me that we are basically picking up the cost of part of the blueprint that was not done and you know we should be looking for I think a much better solution if we 're concerned about safety and so I totally endorse the comments that have been made I raised these concerns at the time that these were designs were coming through Council that if you look for example up in Auckland and Wellington and London key and you can see what happens when you over design streets to try and accommodate different things then sometimes you end up with a more dangerous situation and I believe that 's what we 've got insane Esav Street at the moment I won 't support minor tweaks to improve it what we actually need to do is have a good relook at the central city blueprint and the central city in accessible plan because at the moment it 's not working for a wide range of people and it 's time that we took a big picture look to see how we can actually change it Jamie look I 'm voting against the recommendations there because fundamentally I support option two I would be prepared just in light of what you know Mike said and debate to incorporate consulting on the removal of the parking on the Southside to widen the streets so so like I said I 'll be voting against the recommendations up there in favor of option two but would have a caveat that I 'd be very happy to consult on the removal of the parking of on of the south parking because I think that fundamentally addresses the issue with it you know this is the accessible city plan and I think we all sort of snigger about this because it is you know as Yanni alluded to it 's the most ironically title document you 've ever heard of so dark humor aside senesce of street is completely inaccessible and and why it 's an accessible contrary to what an independent audit has actually told us that 's all well and good that they say that that has come back and said that it 's not broken but with most stuffed it 's incredibly dangerous in in my view I 'm a fearless 32 year old driver and I feel like 92 year old driving down there because you almost refuse to drive in parallel to another car you 're petrified that a bus might come down at the same time as you and someone might open a door so I don 't need an audit to tell me that it doesn 't work because I have eyes and I 've driven down there I don 't think the option presented in front of us fixes that it doesn 't fix the narrowness which is the real issue with it I think there 's an unfair assertion that often gets brought up where it sounds like it 's an us-versus-them mentality it sounds like the Central City business group is the wicked businesses trying to ram their views down the rest of our throats and I don 't think that 's the case because ultimately the business community is the community businesses exists because they provide what the general population need and want and what they demand it that 's the Western world works so yes I believe that it 's important to plan for the future I think that it 's absolutely essential that we plan for the future but you can 't_''_1690.85 do that at the expense of today and I think that option two that the central city business group has put forward doesn 't necessarily as remove the ability to plan for the future but it does accept the fact that businesses still need to be able to function today and I genuinely fear that if things remain the same or even option one as presented in the recommendations in front of us go ahead there 's a good chance that those businesses won 't exist in the future so we can take our futuristic transport you know all we like but you 'd be taking a bus autonomous vehicle to nowhere because I just can 't see those businesses existing long term so talking about meeting the needs of today the fact of the matter is 80% of people travel by car and Christchurch so if you make it inaccessible you 've got 80% of which just doesn 't suit their needs option 2 I don 't see is necessarily carvers bike I think that that 's also an argument that 's been articulated and I think that 's unfair because no one 's questioning the merits of bike transport and no one 's suggesting that the cycle lanes go option one is cheaper yes I accept that but I 'd also argue that one dollar spent on something that doesn 't fix a problem is one dollar wasted so if you 've got slight just over 1 million dollars spent on on a solution that will fix a very real problem then I think that that 's a million dollars incredibly well spent and is Dion argued in quite correctly so there are understand overs throughout the accessible city project and east here if it 's Street is a prime example of that you 've got a million dollars under budget that 's floating around and you 've got an option that can be remedied for just over a million dollars so the funding is sitting right there so I most certainly favor option quite happily should this fail would incorporate Mike 's suggestion of consulting on the removal of the car parks on the Southside because I think that addresses the fundamental issue which is the fact that it 's too bloody narrow yeah Phil and then Vicki so look I 'm going I 'm certain going to support the recommendations as they 're there it 's not too often we hear counselor your Hansen and counselor Goff kind of like having a similar argument in terms of the almost agreeing with each other and and with kind of like contradictory outcomes I think that I think that it was quite clear when we listen to the staff just before that if we adopt option option tone with an additional 53 car parks as major safety concerns so it is just wrong to actually proceed with something you get very clear safety advice that we shouldn 't do it and we shouldn 't really even be considering that I think in terms of the of that of their businesses there were 20 businesses who are involved with that the other businesses actually did just want us as a council to get along and do it and get this is part of accessible City we need to get an accessible City furnished the concept that it 's unaccessible basically is not true I think most of us go Deion 's an asset at some stage okay it 's quite there 's there 's a learning curve for everybody and the staff are making some quite significant changes really by way of changing the the treat the treatment designs and also the park having additional parking bays for delivery trucks and in that kind of accessibility the future steps for example of including 30 K per hour will make this very very workable so I see that the recommendations that are up there today is a major step towards sorting this if we find that in fact it is seen to be too unsafe of and that there 's a need to remove the the parking on the Southside I 'm sure it 's account so we could sensibly consider there but I think we have to go have to go with in fact what some some changes are being made but I think we have to be very careful that we don 't either by throw the baby out with the bathwater and I think also that the idea of looking back to the self frame actually that 's what hindsight there are these other lane lane ways are and now that is too late would it might have would have been ideal and we didn 't ever say then but we have a say now on our urge counselors to vote sensibly now Vicki I would be happy to take the to support Mike 's amendment I wouldn 't be happy to support Jamie 's that it came through very clearly that putting those extra car parks jeopardized the cyclist safety totally like the difficulty that you have is that it 's not that they 're not visible so there are very many near misses as they go down there so to put more car parks and increase the decrease the visibility of cyclists is actually incredibly dangerous and I think there was a lot of recognition of that in the submissions Alistair powerfully about that being a major route for the hospital staff and the risks that they take and what happens when any of them are hurt and the number of operations that need to be rescheduled and all of those flow-on effects from that the you set definitely needs to be thirty case now we may we did that wrong I wanted at thirty case earlier it should have been thirty case it can only operate at thirty case already the speed limit down there is thirty seven case in terms of the actual speed that people travel it and and if you 're putting a school down there with seven hundred kids yes it absolutely has to be thirty case and the idea that eight nine fourteen fifteen sixteen year old kids are going to bike down there and we haven 't made that area safe enough scares me I think our responsibility is for safety I agree with Jamie that the the feel of the road is that that 's insufficiently wide and I would happily remove the car parks in order to get a bit of flow traveling down the road in parking on the road so those who are parking are actually impeding the flow of cars it 's not the cyclists who impede the flow of cars so we we looked at the possibility and Aaron and others are looking with property units looking at possibility of using their blends owned car park near weekend so that there was parking nearby yes there is a huge amount of parking around but there is still a tradition that people want to park very near the shops that they 're going into and also for disabled car parking so we wanted to look at that but this design was a compromise on what was originally recommended so the car parks were added as a compromise to at the time and it wasn 't what was being recommended so what we 're now doing is compromising on a compromise I would they 're part five that says a review of the functionality and safety of the corridor talks about the possibility of going out for a consultation on actually removing the car parts and effect that 's what very happy to do if you want to bring that forward twenty four months I 'd be very happy to support that what what I won 't be supporting is the proposal that came to add car parks and as we got told over and over again from cyclists and from everybody else and in fact from some property owners that that compromise the safety of people using that Street I 'm not okay with compromising safety I am okay if we want to increase the flow of cars along the eight thirty case to reduce the car parking or to eliminate the cap hacking on the south side so I would happily support that but the proposal that came to us and in terms of the one that came about the fifty three extra car park was completely unworkable and completely unsafe if I don 't know what to say here I mean I think you know the initial plan has been flawed mean it 's a massive street used to work perfectly it was very accessible very great road parking around those shops was easy and I think frame was a real problem we had this conversation was with the Litchfield cycling when it 's on the wrong side of the road okay chew em straight yeah and now we 've got the school the cycle lanes on the wrong side of the road for the school so you can have all those kids trying to cross the road so what we 're trying to do is retrofit cycle lanes into roads which used to work well and so we just we 're tinkering with this stuff because it 's not working properly I 'm sorry I don 't know what the answer is to this but this option to me seems to be a bit of a tinkerer I don 't think it 's gonna solve the issues that we 've got I cycle up and I cycled on that road on the road and it 's yet it 's very unsafe so I don 't know what we do about this but I think at some point we 're gonna have to have a conversation about the car parking on the road and and look for be behind the shops or somewhere close by because I see if you take it I mean they 're talking 50 hundred car parks max I mean that 's not even one floor of a car parking building so if we actually look for where can we put those car parks that can serve those shops you take that out of the road then actually we may have something that can work and so in terms of voting on this you know I don 't have a strong opinion on this either way but I think we do need to go back and consult on a bigger picture solution for this and so we have a situation we 've got this tension between today 's needs and tomorrow 's needs and as we saw with fury road we can find a way through I believe option 1 is a compromise but we have to think of the whole community and I believe that this option provides a win-win I mean I I wasn 't Arijit away what you said Jamie in terms of the thing that you need to slow I mean that 's gotta be a good a good thing we 're aware of other people we want the traffic to slow down so I will be supporting this I know a huge amount of work that staff have put into trying to make this to bring this to us today and I think that we out of you know we need to respect that but I think also what Sarah said in terms of and beading and just giving it some time so I think it answers your question roof in terms of what we do we just give it some time we let it we get it started and we give it time yeah Erin and Pauline 's gonna wrap up the debate so is it just Erin and then Pauline through anyone else it 's great thank you this is all becoming so clear the in I agree Ann 's point that she just finished on that about leaving it a bit longer to see it happen it was some of the deputations that was their choice they weren 't either all for removing all the people that come in that said you know what it 's not as bad as people are saying it needs to be given longer to for people to get used to the change I know in situations overseas where something 's dangerous like in a work zone which we in this country make 30 K an hour and the states they double the fines because it makes people think more about speeding or breaking the law as far as the road codes the code goes and a work zone because people can get injured or killed and maybe there 's certain parts of the city if we felt things were really dangerous that could be an application for this country as well given the current road toll I don 't think it 's necessarily the physical design of the place that 's the problem and I really believe in this part of the city it 's the attitude of almost everyone the drivers attitudes towards cyclists cyclists attitudes towards drivers and pedestrians chapter in the middle as road users New Zealanders don 't forget on well and that 's our users as human beings as someone 's thought or someone 's son and that 's where our biggest change needs to come I did support this at Committee level and I 've supported again today mainly because of number four and that is that the staff look at the installation of mobility car parking there 's not one disability or mobility car park on the entire of senesce of street which is a clear message to anyone with a disability in this city that you 're not welcome in that part of the city and they aren 't and if we take all the parking off the street and then don 't even have any disability car parking either then that 's that is a clear message and to expect someone with a disability to walk a couple of blocks from an off street car park I think is unrealistic and in fact a former prejudice and so I wouldn 't support doing that I will support especially number four that we do look to bring in those disability car parks I look forward to being 30k now the median forced to slow down it 's pretty obvious and it won 't be hard to do soon because you 'll be encouraged to with some fines and if anyone feels this part of the rating system and Christchurch is really dangerous let me introduce you to an intersection on before I call on Pauline can I just make it make it clear that we are talking only about when people are sort of talking about substituting other other items that it is just item one a b c and d that we 're talking about so that we 've got we 're good with item two three four and five although I 'm just I 'm actually suspecting that there 's a bit of an amendment item five that actually might meet some of the concerns that have been raised and but it 's why I wanted to kind of interject now where it says requests to have to undertake a review of the functionality and safety of the corridor including the cycleway and 24 months I 'm actually wondering whether I 'm getting a sense that we would like on the functionality of the corridor and 24 months because they went in there as well hey it 's the functionality of the road corridor it 's not could that be explicit because I don 't hear another and open order that nothing 's broken so I just want to say would because if I had to pick one word that 's broken with it it 's the wind yeah the width of the lanes you know it 's not having any wiggle room around sort of yeah just so I 'm gonna go so it doesn 't mate with a quicker look at the parking on the south side so could we just say functionality including width in safety of the corridor well it 's the functionality of the Road corridor so we 're not reviewing the cycleway we 're reviewing the width of the that the functionality and the functionality of the road corridor to take out safety functionality of the road corridor including the width of the lanes the staff had some explanation around why they I mean they originally went through this months and they also doing ongoing monitoring anyway yeah yeah I 'm just I 'm just recognizing that it 's in a balance at the moment and I don 't want to kind of throw the baby out with the bathwater and there is a sense around the table I 'm hearing that people would like to look at the functionality of the road corridor and not wait for 24 months they don 't want to wait for 24 months so including the cycleway so just including the what terrain and then just and then take out that is I 'm going to let Paul in close the debate I 'm trying not to enter into the debate because but I 'm just trying to see if we can get these clarified so there yes yeah but would you would you put party in there as well and including the width of the lanes parking does that that 's functional yeah well the road corridor and and in car parking yeah it I mean I 'd like to put the kind of in the provision of car parking because I mean at the point for on street with off street you know there 's the the employer space behind a lot of the bills yes history including the width of the lanes of car park in the provision of carpet I think since you 're not cycling down there and just just take out the rest of it because you get you that they 're gonna they 're gonna report back to I see anyway so I mean it yeah good edition so I 'm comfortable with proving 5 I 'm still voting yeah it may well be that one is lost but I don 't want to lose what the yeah okay all right sorry Pauline no it 's fine um yeah and I do actually agree with everything that Aaron said today I think you spoke very well Aaron and but yeah I mean you can see what we 're up against even around this table we 've got such diverse views and including whether or not it 's working some people think it 's working okay and recently I attended the cycling Congress that we held here in Christchurch in look the attendees who had cycled sedessa Street and lots of them did they were really positive about it loved it and see but we are getting this right we 're getting our city right and it 's hard for us to see that I think because it 's not finished and many comments from the feedback session also said that people actually like sand s of Street the treatment that its head is working and despite what some people around this table say you can drive down it and Jamie you are getting that message slow down and drive carefully that 's what it 's all about and a staff alluded to there 's now a lot of off street parking including the Litchfield Street building of 800 parks which was opened on the 10th by the deputy mayor 's got his name on the plaque and so it 's about getting used to that change of how we how we actually access our city and how we use it so there are more immunity improvements as well such as the tree plantings to be implemented so I hope that was requested repeatedly by submitters as well and supported I think by the business group too and I must reinforce that the AAC is a total project and SF Street is just one part and the benefits of our new look new behavior city will not be fully appreciated until it 's finished and what that 's going to require is new behavior and I think that 's what people are struggling with as well new behaviours slowing down our driving actually enjoying the journeys through our central city and actually parking just a little bit further away or even taking the bus or walking so we are designing a city that will operate differently from the old one will be a slower more attractive environment in an inner core which encourages walking and cycling and sedessa Street will link with the south frame by various lane ways and a pedestrian-friendly treatment will facilitate and encourage access to the lanes and also from the lanes back to the street I want to take this opportunity to think the business group for all the time and effort that they 've put case and a very professional presentation and to assure them that we believe we have conducted a really fair process we have had untold meetings we 've put hours and hours into this and so his staff and we have listened and considered their views and have included wider users as well and their views the business group conducted themselves well and engaged with us well and we thank them for that there was also many complimentary comments from the feedback and meaning who actually support removing all the Southside car parks as I 've said before but the committee is of the view that option 1 is the best way forward for now as it addresses issues from the safety audit and retains the amenity treatments planned to be introduced and once the trees are and they 'll edge huge benefit and I also help slow traffic down because they add what they call verticality which as a psychological effect on slowing down your speed so they 'll be really good for Jamie and the 24 months review of functionality and safety will be welcomed and ensures that we of the additional face safety measures including the blower speed zone and don 't forget that the tree cut treatments will also enable easier access into the car park so you 'll also be able to drive in forwards and part of the criticism was that people found it difficult to reverse back into the parks and I think that 'll help immensely we 've also addressed the problem of people getting stuck in the pits already so that works been done and I also support the comments that various councillors have made let 's give this time to embed this give people time to adjust their behavior time to get used to our new city and time to start enjoying the journey so I 'll be supporting the recommendations of the et committee I 'll put item one first I 'm a B C and D I 'll then put items two three four and five and as a as a block and then if necessary take care any of the foreshadow of motions which was first Jamie the second of Mike okay right so I 'll put option in favor say aye those opposed say no no okay just put up your hands for No so that 's Davidson Gulf East swags and Johansson so that 's carried and I 'll put items two two five I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "Muenster theatres September 2017 and I think Carol you 're gonna come to the end of the table yeah I mean there 's one item of note in here and that 's six million dollars of unbudgeted rates a charge that we did not charge ourselves last year so that 's coming through into 1718 but carol can explain Carol over ta thank you so as discussed at the finance and performance committee the main contributor to the objects being higher than budget arose from recent ethic valuations or the council 's own utilities infrastructure this is part of the citywide generates revaluation process the council itself pays rates in relation to these in the same way as all the other city ratepayers do across the city the council recently completed the three yearly evaluation process and our council assets rose and value to a much greater extent than we had anticipated for example both the water supply and the surged it works almost trebled and value as a result accounts his own rates payments have increased so the rating process was followed correctly and the billing process is correct addressed the extra council costs so it was a budgeting error as a result there 's an additional 6.1 million dollars of additional rates payable by council which is now been fully recognized and the first quarters results it 's also been included in our year-end forecast position at this stage however that staff are working to identify offsetting savings to mitigate this issue and some of these savings have actually already been identified we 're also adjusting our budgeting processes to ensure that a similar event does not occur again so does that I mean can you explain the sentence that says the resulting impact should have been addressed as part of finalizing the budget for the 2017 18 annual plan because I mean I don 't know the timing what was the time the asset revaluation should have been in last check yeah that 's what I 'm saying if they had but I want to understand why it didn 't happen yeah I mean I was an exponent something you might have dealt with all of us but no please please be a worth because I wasn we we should have become aware of it between the draft and the final and which point we should have looked to find further savings to offset the six million because if I 'm not doing that by not finding savings I mean the alternative would have been that rates would have gone up and that 's not how the rating process works the rating process as you know is set by the elected members are looking for a rate increase of a certain percentage as a result of which the dollars are fixed and then it 's up to staff to find savings within the cost to offset that so because we didn 't know it was there we didn 't look to find offsetting costs yeah but but you 're looking for offsetting costs I mean you 're looking for costs all the time yes we are yeah yeah so if you take out that six point one we 're tracking well we 're just you know under budget for the coming year so in a way the six million we would have had to have found last you 're gonna make sure that there that doesn 't happen again so that the process around revaluation is going to trigger a review instantly of our position in that financial year yes we will I have to say the circumstances were quite unusual and that you wouldn 't already have your assets revalued and go up several hundred percent and that was a result of the assets coming you know the I 'm coming back though repaired assets coming back from school and I 've already valued in one year would yes in preparation of trying to get clean audit opinion yeah but when was the last time they were valued or some had anything down to 60 yes that well that 's I guess that 's my point should we have been a little bit more alert yes yeah yes well we 've which is what you 're saying here we 've taken ourselves outside and given ourselves a flogging I don 't mean to flagellate you in the sandbar but so and then are you right but just say Carol 's pointed out to me in 2015 values only wound up by effect that went down and so we just hadn 't expected them to go up by as much as like this that some of these particular assets hadn 't been valued for a long time before their and and I guess that we might have anticipated this like oh there 's no excuse poor I 'm just give you some context yep go back to the ordered wrist stuff I mean some of these assets have gone up by a billion dollars yeah as a valley so the balance sheet is increased yeah clearly the internal mechanism for our own rating to ourselves didn 't catch up with that yeah so so you 're working on a mechanism to ensure that we are alert to this in the future no it 's already exists we 've got a replace awesome thank you they always do you on yes thank you we 're we 're obviously that 's add it to ourselves does it come as an income as well well rates are set as a result of of the percentage so that determines the council rating Authority but in our capacity as a rate payer we then have to pay rates and so yes we get but it doesn 't go off I mean the rates are fixed in the sense that you asked us to set rates or whatever level five percent and then it goes around and as a rate payer we pay costs so that would be an income but it 's over now I can 't find it got it I 'm so sorry I 'm a bit slow the other thing that the crown doesn 't pay rates on the arrests do they yeah that 's an interesting one their own rights to the crowd on the ground don 't even play rights to us Tex and lyricists okay let 's change that all right note the I 've got one more question it was actually around the laterals so there 's obviously this is two million more mainly due to lateral repairs is that what are the letter appears do you know the sewer network that go off the main pipe up to that up to the persons boundary pay yourself yeah because I think there 's a big problem there isn 't there with how many people private properties I still got lateral damages be better with why we were doing ours they could do this and someplace we 've been successful but generally we have them so we 're fixing laterals from the the road to the boundary of a house but the house has still got broken literals blockage occurs in the lateral and the road it 's our responsibility so we 've got to fix it when we fix that we normally repair all of the collateral so we don 't get another blockage because I 've quite expensive to to do so that 's really and we 've got more damage than what we thought and it 's quite hard to predict exactly what is the damage lift Annette we 're trolls so that 's been moved by rift mingy seconded by Andrew Turner I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much the next item is the _"

we 've got a video there and some of the community might not know here I would actually at this point like to request a letter from the council to go to my little grandson who 's three called Moses who I couldn 't pick up at 30 cuz we 're running late so one of the consequences of being on the community point so he 'll be very disappointed also thank you to those net a fill in for us last month there was a few people that couldn 't make it to be filling in worried away I believe Lister was one of them thinks Lister but you 're actually fired your powerpoint presentation skills wound up to Joe here we go angry thanks very much so decisions under delegation I 'll just talk to a couple of them and up because I 'm going to mention some of them others afterwards I unfortunately don 't have neighbourhood week applications and the funding that we had absolutely fantastic I attended our own Street breakfasts just to have this available to a community as fantastic I know that councillor David East he also had one in his area and he even got out and mowed the lawns and his little park and her street before it commenced so a good job can cerise there but a really great initiative that the council you know gets out there for our community to engage more and connect more so thank you and the extended time frame to was also well received by the community the next slide we have this the Rafferty school Paul this has been really successful we granted some money towards this and last year they had eight thousand visitors which was amazing and looks like we 're gonna have a great summer so it will be the same again apart a that we have for council today as the 902 one Rothfuss a road application for formed access and the coastal road commute or it means that the council decline the application to form an access no to oversee Road some difficult projects and initiatives eonni you 'll be pleased about this one that 's the qe2 master plan we 're talking with staff with begun discussions about this and we 'll have an update for you in the next report significant matters community issues here we have regarding the South new price in history edged out to one of our last previous council monthly meetings I was recommended I think by Yoo Lian that we connect and find the views of the Aven Heathcott history who do I trust which we have done and we received this letter and I just like to read it to you it was to the mayor into our community board as the future of the eastery edge and South New Brighton has currently been considered by the council and the coastal bird community board the Aven Heathcott ste who tie trust has also discussed this matter and at its meeting on the 11th of October 17 resolved as follows that in light of the Christchurch council discussion about flood protection and the South Brighton area the eastery trust states Brighton GT there are significant wetlands that should be protected and enhanced and the trust believes a combination of wetland protection and flood protection as easily compatible be for the area from the GT to the Jellico marsh recreational and access values are significant and that erosion protection is necessary to safeguard those values for your information the Jellico marsh is the area enclosed by the boardwalk at the south end of South New Brighton Park so we 're only talking a very small part but if this doesn 't it doesn 't go ahead they 'll be made too damaged so this correspondence supports and confirms the community boards approach to this area and area commendations of the council on the short term options report and the board like to see work start prior to the finalized every generation plan and before we lose any more land trees or scenic walkway and we do have a meeting with regenerate Christchurch on Friday to discuss this in the rafferty land swap what shall be talking about short legs not the part flying fox next one you see up the air has started on this as we speak the Board 's decision was made and recognition of the district plan nighttime noise level thresholds community board significant measures of interest it was really good Thank You Lian to ask Ivan a couple of questions when he came from Regent regenerate Christchurch there it was but to hear that he 's going to connect with the two community boards adjacent to the Haven o Ducato Network the red zone but I do do want to actually say this on behalf of their community the issues that have been for them around the ten possible combinations of land uses and activities the the consultation period was as you probably know for four weeks however the informational gathering was for a year so region were able to gather for a year but the community were only given the four week period and when staff and the community board members were hearing quite clearly from the community that this was too tight a time frame was and sufficient time and for people and the community groups to fully appreciate and understand what they were submitting board we wrote to regenerate Christchurch and asked them if they would extend the consultation period but that was not granted other community groups had also requested the same thing up because of those five options of the team five of those options included land swap with ruff the Rafferty Golf Course this was news to our community board when we were told on the 17th of September and so we wrote another lizard to regenerate we needed to ask the questions on how did this come about and where did the idea come from because the extension with the we 're going to go as you heard today from ten options to three so this is a very critical time of the consultation period for the community really understand because they 're going to lose seven of those options the other thing I wanted to mention too was the community were very strongly opposed to a land swap they organized their own public meeting last week and regeneration regenerate Christchurch was going to very clear and strong message that the community do not want anything built on this golf ago they fought to actually retain the golf course so it 's actually a very unfortunate position that we 're in because it has taken the focus of the other exciting aspects that are happening through this process and what they have been doing but a community feel that they have lost enough green space and lost enough and have enough things taken from them so this was just one thing they wanted to get across to regenerate crushes and over knows all these things so we will be discussing these again on Friday another thing was I think I 've talked about the breeze walking festival other people have so there was two and a half thousand preschoolers and the appearance at end of The Gruffalo extra walking by the lake first and that 's absolutely fantastic these preschoolers getting on them I don 't know how they didn 't get lost but it was well done to all the staff and you buddy to organize that so up here we have firm something very excited that Green gets excited about you know that you 'll be aware that Park and so that I don 't knowi Eagles Rugby League club were able to welcome the Scottish rugby league World Cup team so that was a really great thing so it was awesome to see how the impact of the surface is actually being received in the community and they 're really getting enemy have to you know invite people of such high standard here will cost in it on to these improved sights a fantastic being was all over a twenty Lin so also here we had fireworks night on the weekend just to quickly go through a few things we had thousands of people counters absolutely spectacular Thank You Christchurch City Council for putting that on and to the other sponsors we had a fantastic weekend the night was beautiful as a howling day but the night the one just all calm down as it was and the council staff spread the event across the foreshore so we had speakers at South Brighton and we had speakers up north so that was fantastic and people were really well-received that thank you very much also on that weekend was back to the beach and we had bikes we had noise we had leather and it was all happening on the beach that weekend which was amazing we also had across the road they had a v-dub so so just an outstanding weekend the weather was amazing and there was also golf look at golf disc golf display and Rafferty domain and this weekend we 've got the rockabilly and then you brought Martic gotten a hip in Rafferty domain as well but we have some information on that at another time so that 's the end of my report but I do want to just bring up something regarding the coastal hazards in this assessment document so the community board would just like to respectfully request that this be updated to reflect some further accurate information that leaves no room for misinterpretation early enough to cinch of our key points we 're really trying to project and build a community of hope and a future and so we just like to be able to have the opportunity to sit down and just have a bit of a discussion have to go to my next thing as well but I 'm more than happy to to go through that I 've had a quick look at it and I think that it 's a matter of emphasis and you 're trying to emphasize one side of things which is certainly included in the context of the report so I think with a little bit of toing and froing we should be able to get that around doing a great position so that 's appreciate it thank you yep so now David and Glen would like to move and second the receipt of the report so are there any questions for come very comprehensive I 've got a positive comment off of it yep yep you can always I propose simply with this whole kind of climate change space for the board that litter from and I stood aside because I 'm the liaison person but that leader from the trust has really opened things up and it 's really brought the board and the trust together kind of on the same page and I think that will also be you kind of seeing a meeting of minds to some degree there we 've also included climate change in our community board plan and so we 've made that explicit so it mirrors the council part of the plan and that that was a good move in there went through unanimously as well so we 're getting there you know I think it 's good to see some progress rather than a kind of log it 's sorry I didn 't mean to start our board to included the climate change in the plan and I think that 's commendable because clearly no be the board working with the community as we discussed earlier this morning great all right well I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Kerry and I 'll leave Andrew and the chair for the next few items Sam _"

    "text": "so if we now move to the chief executives report item 17 understanding of when lunch will be today I 'm hoping that we can get through reasonably quickly the rest of the open agenda move into public excluded take a half hour lunch break then come back and do the public excluded so that 's that 's my intention I don 't know whether Leanne had raised any expectation that was different than that before the meeting great alright so the chief executive his report the recommendation is to receive the report but are there any questions for Carlene before we move to that yawning does anybody else have a question while we 're waiting for Jonnie temp did you enjoy the World Cup rugby the other way it 's a slightly scientific question sorry Carlene but it 's around with us looking to kind of carbon emissions before we get it run completely signed on has anyone done any work around if the climate keeps changing will lose the easterly because if it does I 'm like Bahama I 'm just saying okay Jonnie how are we going around the Cranford straight mm-hmm right road widening and I was just I 've had a response back but it doesn 't make much sense there was a media article about their loss of on street parking along the northern extension corridor extension along Cranford Street so I was just trying to understand where that 's come from I 'd asked for a copy of the plan for the from the Environment Court designation and a copy that was being proposed by staff and so that 's not specifically in my report except to say that staff went in a kinder than information system but the responsive God has that staff are doing a report and an update to your teen elected members in the next couple of weeks so following that as then why are the people on the newspaper saying that they 're losing on street parking and they 're gonna challenge it well perhaps we can understand that when staff provide that report so we don 't know how they got it well it 's what didn 't come from us as far as I know okay a report coming in the next couple of weeks that 'll give us an opportunity to ask any further questions with that report in front of us at that time Phil yani yep which was around the Bromley I think the community board made some comment but that I don 't know whether to who 's in you 've just wants to give a bit more of an outline or an update on that progress because they had some of the stuff that community board referred it wasn 't quite accurate so so and we continue to work with a keen to get a program a joint program around monitoring and program around it 's not proven in how we respond to it like this some of that issues are we have different responsibilities in terms of that work and so just sorting through that so what I 've said is that we 're still working towards a commitment from a team to have a joint program so the key part if I might the community liaison group has been re-established it 's 21st of November so and it meets on track it was delayed or deferred for a few instances so I think it 's important to create that but have you got any sense of when the report is coming but throw that the joint monitoring is beginning because what I don 't understand is you know we passed that resolution or over a year ago he can I mean we 've been advised that we 're waiting for a cone to confirm a start date but I don 't understand why it 's taking so long and do we I guess the question for you is do we need to elevator at the to the chair of the regional Ansel well I think we didn 't go to previously I think there was a topic of conversation that when they when again and the council meet I sitting recall there it is about working through the different responsibilities and you know who contributes to the funding of that monitoring program as well so it 's just really at that point continues at that point of working through those issues well I can 't think the commitment wins 't have a bit of a timeline of what 's happened up to date to you later right is there anything from councils in that 's holding up thing is the delay solely focused on weekend at the moment there 's nothing wrong that I ended on a wheel thank you thank you film in drew Colleen thank you for your report and the yesterday and the FT committee I comment about the asia-pacific cycling Congress tone and think the staff for the a huge involvement and just how successful it really was and in the feedback to where the organizers was just fantastic people really impressed and of course with air cycle ways and the experience and having that having that conference come over from Brisbane to us I think was a major one well next time it 'll be in Australia I 'm sure it could come back to Christchurch in the future the other thing I didn 't mention yesterday was also the about the Bike Expo which is edit Wigram over the weekend and just again I think we had a full complement of staff in one negative bit on the and the press which is unfortunate because people there you know that that steam had really good attendants and it 's an example though of the commitment actually in the week Ian 's to the dare start here and and I just want to mention there I didn 't want to just meet you in something else new report Colleen and Carolyn Potter referred to the hue hot oops that happened and how well it was but just that the background to that too is it 's in my view a wonderful community development project it 's been there caught the court that the sales were started about 20 years ago and these young people now are developing again there 's just wonderful having them on board and so it 's I think around the whole area of of community development I think as a council we need to have a good look at how we do that there are some wonderful examples I think in all the boards and we 've heard some from being launched other too so just again for that one people who are involved thank you and thanks for your comments on the Asia Pacific cycling conference as well I attended the the very final session in fact spoke at the very final session of that conference and it was clear from talking to delegates after the conference formally closed that people had not only really enjoyed the conference but it also really enjoyed their time in Christchurch and that 's um you know two very important observations and really show the benefit of us hosting that event here and just thinking about the my council initiatives in that forum was fantastic in terms of highlighting the things that they 're doing and I 'm sure they many of the councillors who couldn 't get be able to appreciate some kind of update we talked about did talk about whether we should have a another one for elected members and community boards the community boards raised it this morning but it 's just at the very beginning of a three-year program and it really is about how do we interact with residents and stakeholders in a different way that meets own self service you know 24 hours a day real-time information on things so whereas at the moment because a lot of our systems are complex and manual if there 's a request for something like you know the land drainage ments and things like that and it takes several days or weeks being able to get there almost straightaway you know a better connection with our in terms of complaints and a request for service and how that flows out being able to provide better information to people more information on our website that people can access just directly a whole range of things and also simplifying some of our systems to make it easier both for staff but also to make more efficient but also in terms of again when people interact with us and obviously there 's been some interest from the media around it as well and so starting to get some information out more publicly about what it is and what benefits that we have all be really good Thank You those counselors who came along great thank you so we 've got a resolution 'm happy to move Tim skander it was second all those in favor against that 's carried and _"

've got to to community boards to go so I 'm just wondering that Alan Morden coastal beer what are you are you okay if I do the zone committees first or yep okay all right so could I invite the zone committees to come forward for their quarterly report broadly update she 's just gonna whisper in my okay thank you very much I 'll just leave it to you in terms of what whatever order you want to presume you gotta tato cut the ribbon lingua cheered Christchurch Wiest melting water zone committee thank you very much for allowing us to come here today and just give a brief report back on events over the last three months I understand what November December agendas are like so I 'll keep this very brief as per the report one of the key things that we 've managed participating in on the April Taku law it was initiated by even Smith and his group it was very well attended it was approximately 2,000 people participated and probably half as many again of dogs and cats that was really from all councils a great community today and a good opportunity for the community to actually meet the zone committee and one of the one of the feedback from Susanne committee was that very few people realize that there wasn 't sewing committee in the area so it kind of made us realise if we actually need to get our profile up and just really put it out into people what 's actually being achieved through design committee Shelley wants to stand up but we 've got working on a superhero stormwater concept so all the zone committee members we 're wearing these t-shirts yeah there was a request for me to wear mine today but the sizing wasn 't quite win in the wash but but yeah so taking on board one of the key things that we 've identified is how do we engage with communities work with individuals how in Christchurch and also how do we to create these connected communities so we we 've jumped on the storm water superhero concept my eight-year-old he took that t-shirt off me put it on and he started deducted and diving on the sofa and I see him well you actually got to get your own you actually have to get up there and do some work on waterways so and he says when we do I go oh so that 's the kind of thing we 're looking at building on also you know working in partnership with all the different stakeholders we as a subcommittee of ekayon and question City Council we can 't do it alone we 're very much only make recommendations to the committee and plus we lack true resources to be able to do a lot with in the zone committee so yes I was around how do we get all these other stakeholders Fish and Game Department of Conservation the various councils around the table and look at pulling all our resources together so we can do a lot more a lot quicker we table one of the other things so we talked about engagement we had our refresher course two weeks ago we had 15 applications for three positions that 's the most we 've ever had and six years we 've been running skills there was a very big range of skills there was a lot of technical experience on that the tense but also we had a lot of that we 're engaging with the communities and others were strength through around communication so we 've selected three names and we 're hoping that it makes you a December agenda but fingers crossed but also like to thank crushers City Council for the work that they did in realigning the roads down Martin 's road when they discovered the Connor Connor my only concern was that we went public in the press and there a lot of Maltese no really are so and this and it kind of ties in with one of the other issues that we 've had over the recent years on the zone committee was the amount of work that all the resources that we have contributed project but we still allow people to whitebait there 's a critically endangered species or an endangered species at risk we 're looking we 're pouring resources and so growing their habitat growing the numbers but people are still allowed to fish them it kind of doesn 't make sense so we 're looking at ways of putting in protection measures to enhance their population much quicker and just one last thing I noted on the Ettie committee papers the other day around rainwater collection and repurposing grey water I think that 's a really brave step and I 'm really really excited looking forward to some of the outcomes from that workshop I did have thoughts about inviting was inviting the chair of the zone committee along but I 'll leave that fears I know there was community boards in the 60s remember yeah I 'm just wondering later at what time will you bring other stakeholders and industries that sort of stuff yeah so yeah that 's that 's not for me from now we 're gonna hear from all of them or do want to just go regards to the white bone yeah there are real issues now with people flying down from Auckland early 20s and people the coast buying directed and taking it back out because there are no restrictions do you think is and if we combined together to look at some kind of licensing because at the moment it 's technically it 's tipped well it not to knit it as ticks free there are no limits so it 's a really you 're saying it with that question it as a resource that 's being exhausted and people are going to turn around one day and it 's gonna be gone yeah so what what are your thoughts on it because you know you you can because so the zone committee don 't have a stand on a licensing personally I think it 's very much like your water takes it doesn 't need to be a license you had how we create that that 's something you need to talk with MPI getting them around the table others are these other options isn 't a couple other options Department conservation can on it for four or five years you know there 's there 's various options but we just need to get around the table and have those discussions thank you just sorry that 's right I 'm Aaron tendon Yanni it Minds obviously what mate as well the so would what would you guys look for us as a council to potentially be looking to work with other councils across Canterbury to maybe even have a moratorium on whitebait taking for either one two three whatever the number of the years are that we need while the works been done and they rebuild their population something along those lines I on my past experiences when you start bringing others in you got other idea yeah I find it easier working as just as one council you 've got a shared but if you got shared vision around the table then your vinegar look at others with that same for you summer may not they may have different different coping down here yeah but it it could be something that we worked on amongst others wide market et you might have mere raising in the mirror forum or something around thanked I don 't know I don 't want to see us lose the white mate that 's all yeah nor do I but I also know that we 've got more rivers and in the kinder berry area than the ones that unpacked on our I don 't_''_538.459 I don 't know what the issues are with the other rivers actual foreign joint isn 't there a joint and aren 't you part of a group that here the regional one so would it be appropriate to raise it there yeah on the regional committees yeah yeah yeah because I noticed I 've got that long-form toner on you which is just as a risk as yeah and you won 't be yeah yeah okay Yanni thank you I just wanted to know what informational work you 've been doing around the sediment coming down post the fires because of just when you look at the heath care it just seems full of sediment and it seems even worse since the fires so there 's anything you can just let is happening in that space so yeah so the Kashmere stream working group and the community groups have been out there doing clarity testing they just had a workshop last Saturday actually inviting more community members training them up in how to do their clarity it 's hard to measure whether whether we 've improved or not because of the fire the forest has added a whole new mix to the waterways we knew what was happening before it we 'd done all these trials with EOS on port hills around sediment controlling the modeling showed that it would make a difference but with the loss of the landscape up in there the ground cover it 's just exasperated yeah the issues around the hips get Kashmir I 'm not really a technical person I read it I hear it but yeah I leave it to them yeah I understand the council has a lot of long-term plans in place remember that we 're only a subcommittee of the council we 've made recommendations in the past I 've had been acted on the cementation process policy and processes around of measures have been identified I haven 't had an update from council staff yet on the images not with the recent floods again it just throws out every call those matrices metrics as we 've received over the last two years different parts of that if could have different issues not all the same and not all the same levels there 's this parts I hit that are in reasonable condition and then this other set of a lot worse refer individual ones yep he 'll think you 're just another question so that in relation particularly Heathkit but the Aven as well just what besides the support that we can provide zone committees you 'll be aware we counsel of a community water partnership and which has some funding and a wide range of community groups so is that perhaps a way that we as a council could support for example rejuvenation of a some other river banks and particularly parts of the port hills so we support the range of groups who are already involved in doing them okay it 's actually quite interesting these questions that those meetings that use were having between the two councils late last year are still happening we 've seen your staff in there and management they salute me because I 'm now wondering why he 's are asking chair of the zone committee it what tells me that he 's haven 't_''_767.529 been talking to one another like my fiction was really would you support or would I split the contact concept and support us we supported it yeah I think it was actually Erin conversations that I bought the two councils together okay very good all right Eleanor Paula next thanks Ellen good afternoon lien and customers so I 've just got three things to cut off today I 'll just that quickly and wanna sit I guess at the start of the year you probably know that there 's someone a coach for been dry and but now there 's a complete opposite you know that there 's been so much water going three beers not funny in the cell one has actually joined up as well in the middle which it doesn 't do very often there flowing on stop since July because of the winter we we through there just a couple days ago you know on the field trip and I think it 's starting they dry up again it have a way and so it 'll probably it 'll probably stop flowing again and not maybe not a coast forward that it 'll break into two rivers again so this one the second one is that you know I think last time there was a report on the the seminar series that we did to try to connect with the people in the community and so that went really really well we hit that probably about a hundred or about seventy two hundred thirty people and per session so we hit two sessions each day and the seven sessions or all or seven days or forgiveness so fourteen seasons or and we also have a couple of thousand people can look at the seminars on YouTube so all or City a quite successful but it hasn 't reached as many people risk we 'd like and so the next thing that we can cut to engage with people they don 't normally are not normally interested in water management and so we came up with a giant pumpkin growing competition just to kind of lure people into into doing something and they will have an opportunity to engage with them and we also invited a few people who are reasonably high profile people that try to get them to come to the table to discuss all these things to say this is their supply one from whatever part I was saying before I bet you mean community engagement we see that it 's been quite important and that 's the common theme that says you come through from the seminar series and also from from others our committees so it 's that 's it really I think good is that anyone have any questions for Ellen oh just he had one more thing that the idea behind it there the pumpkin competitions tours day this year we 're just doing a trial run next year we could actually extend it out and get a bit bigger that also hasn 't a the possibility of what we 've been talking about as well we just don 't have the resources to make things happen and we rely on omni-king backing the projects that we are yeah that we are decide on in design did I note that you 've got honor you 've done you 've done that public you better why horror horror trust are holding us likes imposing on the Tampa Navy yeah yeah so they 're living night seminars it 's this Friday actually the Thursday finding yeah yeah so if you could because somebody could go to that yeah yeah anyway um right so questions right okay on to Paula you 're welcome yep cool so there 's three paragraphs on page 191 that I 'm speaking to and I 'll just to start it at the at the end in a way responding to a couple things that come up on previous briefings on previous presentations first was and you 'll see in paragraph 3 about Toyota or whatever and what we did discuss at a previous meeting about whether there was a need for a kind of a joint with you and Cromwell and I think I think there 's a reluctance to do that at this stage we already have a plan about what to do about what I weigh and that is the addendum which is the big chapter at the end of the zip that was produced later and in there is set out the the plan for improving the ward quality in the knee and until we 've got some way down the track beard there 's no point in getting into discussions about late interventions so that 's following up on that the other thing is about the monitoring at ohina tarhe on the following the fire I think that was something you raised Yanni we made an inquiry there as far as we know there is no monitoring going on in on this in this catchment and I could I 'll vote we 've had advice from one of the landowners there because it 's been a couple of big slips up there and we were a bit concerned she 's saying that even now after rain the crease that running clear so that there were key key well which is what we are to call freshwater crayfish locally anyway the worthier before the fire and they 're still there so that 's a good sign because we kind of take that as as being a sort of indicator species of good ecological health so those are just two things that the zone committee is also meeting with the community board and having a seminar very soon and brief briefing because I don 't think there 's been a conversation between his own committee and the community board since the last election so we 're doing that on the 27th and then finally item number one is the long term plan and but a couple of things I 'd like to highlight there and we will present this information to the community board too but a couple of things I 'd like to highlight there is it 's about septic tanks on Banks Peninsula we there are a lot of small settlements on exponential and rural communities where the main water treatment wastewater treatment system as our septic tanks but we don 't we don 't know whether they 're working generally okay and we really have no idea whether they are having any adverse effect on our water bodies and so this this is a proposal for a project to do some investigation work and maybe come up with some well find out what 's going on basically in the first instance and so that would be one that we would want to support and then the other thing is just one of those little one of those little small things that has a significance way beyond its its its relevance but that is about turned over now on the back of page one where it talks about under where I was chapter 6 it talks about a little bit of Esplanade Reserve and the akuti Valley know he recently had an application for immediate steps funding from a community group and Leo cootchie Valley who are taking on that that particular stream which is a biodiversity hotspot and they are looking at having a kind of community monitoring and enhancement thing they every time we go to akuti they raise it in that Valley office at the community center and the cattle from the neighboring property can get to the water there and there 's no fence on these that are reserved to stop that happening so the council is the landlord there and so I was just wondering whether there was any chance that some money could be found to complete that little fence so any questions thanks Christiane 's serie Phil thank you in it 's really useful and and I the first time I went through a long-term plan with the regional committee do those own committees put in a wish list with a cane or do the throwing committees just have the pot of money we have made a wish list for the regional committee for the Regional Council I mean as well yeah we don 't_''_1337.779 those own committee doesn 't get any funding at all but we do have the immediate steps fund to allocate so we make the decisions on that and it 's been clear from each of the presentations today that the zone committees would like to do more than they 're asking for the immediate steps funds to be increased and is there something that you 're able to do through the process and would it be helpful if I was to raise that at the regional committee meeting at our last meeting we had the first occasion where we we had we were oversubscribed for that fund and we 've already spent our whole year 's budget to only about a third of the year and because we had so many fantastic projects and what that what that means is yes we probably could use on banks peninsula up until now we haven 't had enough applications almost to allocate the funding but clearly people have got on board and now it looks like it 's going to become quite competitive so yeah it would be good to have some more money yeah yeah and does that is that the ekayon budget it 's comes out of I suppose as soon as the immediate skip stuff yeah yeah Phil thanks Paula I 'm walking over the peninsula was the other day was an eye-opener for me but I just wondered 's been the issue of slumping and some of the Alley 's okay yeah well known Satan the zone committee is able to inform Council of some silver agency where there 's an urgent one or some recommendations around prioritization of fixing any of those because that area that you can have some contribution to they might like to talk to us too but we recently had a situation at or Kruti know where there 's a whole catchment that is fully forested upstream from maravilla and there was a big slip in there even though it was fully forested and I think we got except to a certain extent some land mass movement as is normal on these steep hills with a soil type but certainly so on I took the area that the council could take the most have the most impact is in how its own Road corridor is managed I think in some cases the the work that the council maintenance people do or the the way the roads are managed actually contributes to the problem and I don 't know whether you want to speak think that this shows the importance of actually closely working with the community board and I am you know I 'm an alum the community board and I 'm on the zone committee so ever a bit of a better networking or liaison relationship between what 's going on so we had a seminar recently we looked at the slips on banks furniture some of those large ones there 's quite a number of them and the some that are being still done under emergency work they 're going to cost considerable amount of money and part of it was that we did actually ask for that we actually looked at the the upper side of that road and what contributed to that huge slip and weather is something that we as a landowner could help perhaps help with resolving that yes it 's um there are things that will always have not happen what 's at the top does come down to the bottom and and yes there needs to be we need to continue ongoing conversations with our communities to encourage them to do things and to look with us to do it and the council doing its bit too and so I think that information coming back from the to for example the Atika Medina police not here but I think having that link sounds to me to be important were you thinking of a particular slip well that you 've seen there were there was one neither right neither Takuma to a beach which I wasn 't deserving right have you seen the one at Church Bay where the roads just falling away and taking the garage with it I don 't see there one mm-hmm there 's two that are Bergeon see ones that are being done under emergency funding before Christmas and then there 's about 16 others I think it was that honor on the list that need to repair down the track a number of them need need quite significant work to resolve them every time we have one of these weather events the council you know ends up spending over a million dollars repairing the roads or banks clinching and and they hit and they keep doing it again and again been two that have been three and two million dollars worth of damage and I think you get some funding from NZTA to do it but it does raise the question about how you can make the network more resilient and I think we 've got to really address it now yep thank you all right so Yanni I just wanted to check on the akuti did you say that the person 's got stock on council when that 's not fenced off to the water-wise it 's just the adjacent landowner and there 's there 's little bits of Esplanade reserve all over banks peninsula on most of the rivers and the counts I mean there 's never been fenced and they just incorporated with the adjacent management of the adjacent Lane but I just think four accounts for the council that 's actually a bad look well we 're great well and this is about I think this is about the second or third time that we 've been told this and I thought previously we had actually asked for work to be done around that so I know don 't want to have one of these conversations please we 've we 've taken on board then the we 've received these recommendations but we have had this one and the other one on the other side both specifically highlighted I know that Mary Richardson came over and took the sheet away and has noted that so we 'll be coming back with a weather with a report on how we progress this but we need to wait till the long term plan right yep good you know can we just get a report on stock on Council and not being fenced because I would feel really bad if we were doing that on council land and blasting farmers who are doing it and polluting rivers it doesn 't pass the pump row pset1 does it desert so I waited to see that report but I think it maybe should narrow it down if you don 't want to generalize one and yet talk about the eastern odd reserves in particular because those reserves are set aside specifically to protect them sure so the esplanade reserves and it over the place too I wonder I report something that 's not my turn it 's just leasing so who was who will who would do that well why don 't we just have you move there and so we 've got a resolution in front of us that that we request a report on those areas of unfenced Esplanade reserve desh are being used for stuff that I 've been well that that where the adjacent land has been used to gray stock that might be just better to say right period area because they won 't be all Esplanade reserves no they won 't but I 'm just thinking that Gordon something out it might be what to start with why don 't we start with using that and then we 'll move on to the others if we find even they 're at a stage and have been broaden it out and and integrates all good yep yep no race dog I think we should raise stuff um okay so so we 've got a recommendation here where we received the information the zone committees update reports it 's been a Esplanade reserved with adjacent land has been used to no graze it was graze I was just joking all right means burned to the ground you know anyway it was anyway so but someone like to move that Andrew seeking dudes Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carries then _"

    "text": "great and then we 'll move to item 14 and we 've got the mayor back who can take a chair for item 14 okay so Pauline do you want to introduce this item okay so the flood plains menace administered options for the so as we all know how challenging the issues of flooding around the Heathkit that 's because it 's a it 's a linear issue in the river channel has narrowed in some places due to the earthquakes causing slumping of the bank 's lip perfection silt to build ups but also land has risen at the history which reduces the flow so the upper Heathkit storage basins are part of a solution and it 's it was part of a solution as counselors Kendra Luda earlier which was originally recommended by the drainage board in 1985 and it 's just one of them to date the land drainage recovery program has fast-tracked these four storage basins and are now working on implementing a stronger timeframe so the time has been required to arrive at these recommended treatments but they 'll bring benefits from the combination cure-all and if you look at the table on page 236 you 'll see the myriad of options either have been investigated and it shows that many have being considered and discounted or recommended for either implementation or for more work via a feasibility study but because these are the big and time-consuming projects we 're also recommending the implementation and thudding intervention policy be applied in order to give people more chance of insurance and peace of mind so once again this was supported by the and their recommendations will be up on the screen shortly thank you thank you would you like to present the yes thank you the presentation um so as we all know the Heath Curt Flood flooding is a historic issue it 's one that the city has wrestled with for decades and was a problem for the drainage board the drainage board did do a lot of work but they also had a lot of work that wasn 't implemented things got hard they go into the too hard basket since the earthquakes things have got worse there 's no denying that we for time since the earthquakes and I think this morning we 're seeing being thought of three times so this has always been a problem but it 's that much more real now it 's that much worse and of course things will get worse in the future with climate change but the problem at the moment is real the risk is significant over 200 homes were 200 families are at risk of an extreme event I just want to clarify what we mean by extreme because if we look back at the flooding we had this year that was not an extreme event that was a frequent flooding event if we look back to 2014 that still wasn 't an extreme event that was more of a medium event but still within the frequent flooding category and this was alluded to earlier these these things are only going to become that much more common so the solutions are complex they 're difficult and they are expensive but they 're not going to get any easier or cheaper if we wait there is no silver bullet there 's no single been difficult to progress in the past but what we have is that you work very hard in building out a package of measures that work together to give something that can return at the Heathkit at least a pre quick flood risk levels and in many cases that this is an opportunity for a step change that this recommendation one that sits in front of you we do have a short presentation it 's a it 's a complex issue but I think Peter has a short presentation that brings out the key facts and hopefully keeps it keeps it simple thank you okay well I 'll go through this very quickly because I think many of these points have already been made we 're talking here about the earthquake effects of flooding frequent flooding upstream of Radley Street and the reason why we 're looking at upstream Radley Street is the area downstream is primarily impacted by sea level rise and there 's being looked at by the multi hazard study of which has been presented here before as Keith said some houses have been plateau pool times in vulnerability to both frequent and extreme flooding in terms of the numbers as you 've heard this morning there 's a story behind each number it 's very easy to put up on the screen number like 7 or 24 but that represents obviously 7 or 24 unique stories of what 's happened than someone 's lives and their livelihoods in them I must say that 's what really drives and motivates our team that it 's actually about delivering these outcomes to the community that are affected there 's been a severe increase the levels of houses numbers of houses at risk of frequent flooding and the likes of which we saw in July this year and from 7 to 24 but we know from the actual flooding and there is actually a number greater than 24 the model flooding shows an a certain amount that we also corroborate there against actual flooding and sure we use that data as well so these floods are not extreme and these are the flights which could occur several times in any one decade but as Keith said there 's also bus post earthquake we now have over 200 houses at risk of flooding above the floor in an extreme beam and this is the like some of the mean of which probably none of us on this room have ever seen and would likely make national if not international media and so we need to be mindful of both addressing this frequent flooding but also this extreme flooding and the number there has shown that the number is increased by about 47 houses but within that 222 there 's actually 101 new houses at risk that weren 't at risk prior to the earthquakes there 's been a real significant increase and the numbers affected as a result of the earthquakes so our objective is to restore to at least pre earthquake flood risk and but to do that with a complex problem like death clip we want to break it down into manageable bill with building blocks so we 're looking at storage and there 's a significant amount of storage being added it 's over 800,000 cubic meters of additional and storage being added and that 's over 're playing pre earthquake and just referring back to one of the first public items about the water quality and the power cohesion and these storage schemes not only will provide significant bidding benefit to flooding and also provides significant benefit to water quality as well and so I seem to the using that same space to provide for water quality treatment at the same time there 's very little additional cost and we 're working to ensure that we 're meeting two objectives there so that 's so I think there 'll be a real really significant change in water quality in the heath care as a result of this as well 3 Ching is you heard through the position petition this morning and is also very important essentially we have a river with very high sediment loads meeting the tide which becomes slack and a lot of the sediment drops out and in a natural system that 's that 's fine and the river will then find a new channel and with the houses the roads beside there comes a point at which you need to make a remove some of that material and we 've reached the point now where we 're unclear that this is the right decision to be made that it does need to happen to ensure we increase the river capacity again of course we need to be incredibly mindful of the ecological impacts of that and we 're working very hard with our ecologists and people like the para river network and to Annie can to ensure that we can do this with the minimal effect possible Thanks stabilization I 'm including he of completeness this is actually word approved in funded by Council in the first stage of this as consultation closing on this Friday but this work is to will have them some benefit on flood risk by tapering the banks back and but it 's primarily about fixing demonstra Larry Kert as a result of the earthquakes and also stabilizing those big banks to protect assets as well as doing that we 're going to add a lot more planting to provide some shading of the river whilst not also compromising capacity and the livestock banks and this is creaking and flood intervention policy ones that we 're recommending to proceed this has a recommendation to keep investigating this to assist further the technical feasibility but also to consult with the community and the public meetings I 've had discussions with people from very different sides you heard this morning from cucina that this is something they would like to see to address that frequent flooding of both underfloor in the roads and whereas other people are coming from a perspective of the impact might be on the enjoyment of walking along the river and their enjoyment of the river so we need to be mindful of both of those things and that 's why we want to have the opportunity to take it out for consultation to understand we as council in a community we set on this issue and but there 's primarily targeting and a frequent underfloor flooding infrequent and flooding of access to people 's properties and and we have heard of instances of people who have lost insurance due to frequent underfloor flooding not even above for flooding so that 's why we 've is the flooding to mention policy which don 't think I need to speak to is we 've just been talking about that so together together these really work together and to provide a significant impact and I can show you on the slide was the frequent flooding one with storage or dredging alone we can have the number of the walls which were at risk post earthquake and but with all options working together and these work to bring that down to none at risk in the current climate people have alluded to earlier the fact that you know in the future the one in 50 you might become the one in ten years so it 's not initially that we can deal with once and it will go away forever we need to keep focusing on our future plans so what we 're focusing on here is to ensure that what we 're doing now can be built upon and will not compromise any options in the future and on the flood intervention policy we are making a recommendation that is implemented ahead or in conjunction with the to be completed and that relates to the question of timeliness some of these properties of households of flood of multiple times since the earthquakes and the full benefits of a scheme won 't be in place won 't be realized until we 've got all of those elements in place and because we dependent on funding through the long term plan for those we can 't really give any certainty as to how long that will take and even if these schemes we 're in place these houses would be the first to store flood and the next event which is slightly larger than maybe a 10 year event and so they will still be the first to flood and those with the most severe damage and we referred to occur so for those reasons that we 're recommending is implemented now in terms of the extreme flooding I think what we have here is a really good story in terms of pre earthquake there 175 and we know that we 're not with the the earthquakes we can drop that back quite definitely with the flooding with the together we can actually bring that the number that we used to make down to approximately 37 which is getting to 4 or 5 of the pre-earthquake level so we think that 's a really significant achievement and sets up the Heathkit really well to give a buffer to be able to look at the future flooding with sea level rise and climate change and so on but as Keith said it is really a step change in the risk to flooding along the heath care and so we 're excited to be able to and present this as this package of options as what they can achieve so that 's the hit kit and floodplain management options in a nutshell thank you very much so is this something that you want to move Pauline and seconded by um so are there any questions for staff Phil yarny thank you for that explanation in the PowerPoint Peter can I just ask you to just coming through pets from the submission today was that 's an indication that dredging may alone and may kind of like be one of the silver but you 've also I think referred in the report that in fact it might be some time like several years before in fact this combined program achieves the objectives that we set out so just wondering if you could perhaps give us an indication of other timing for I guess completion of some of those options so it 's it 's difficult to talk to the timeframe at the moment because it is funding dependent the report refers to the previous LTP funding regime and on that basis it was suggesting three to four years depending on whether or not law stop banks become part of the option as well so obviously with the LTP discussions the questions are going to be you know what 's the affordability you know could it take longer could it take go take this so that 's a that 's obviously a separate debate for a different forum but we 've given an indication on based on previous funding so besides there 's been no one solution there 's Kili this isn 't there isn 't going to be even a combined quick 's it 's an incremental fix the dredging obviously benefits from storage lowers the levels makes dredging more effective so that 's why these things work together and give a better outcome but even with the the storage basins as they come online the one and pod online that 's that 's reducing the risk slightly each time but we don 't get a full benefit until it 's all completed yanny just yeah a number of questions I mean thank you for that just to say thank you I know you 've been working hard on this and it 's taken longer than I think any of us would have liked but I know that it 's complex so I just want to enlarge that I just had some quick questions around Jackson 's Creek is there a program around of work around that we 're currently discussing today is around the main river steam so not the likes of Dixon 's Creek and those creeks came earlier of course Jackson 's creaked yes we 've got an investigation underway there there have been some repairs done in a some of those immediate fixes but within looking at it in terms of the wider context of flooding in that area as well so that is so we just stick to the paper that we 've got in front of us today if it 's all right yeah system that goes off the river but it was yes I know yes so the just rise Lord Terrace as it proposed for the lowest stop banks along there do you mean River Lord terrible troll or Terrace and so yes there is a proposal for low stopping some some parts of it came with the low stop banks would only target those areas that we consider only the worst areas and can provide some benefit there okay um in terms of the eastery obviously has been concerned that the ester is risen and it traps the water have you got any comment that you can make in regards to what problems the history is causing post-earthquake and what any process are unlocking at alleviating that as other than the options that you 've you 've already put forward in so these us new equilibrium post-earthquake and we have looked at the modeling for and the area that we 're talking back to the upstream Radley Street and we don 't believe the history is having any significant effect on the flooding in those areas essentially what 's causing the flooding there is the channel constriction which is what the dredging is aiming to look at as well as the bank stabilization upstream but the eastery is not driving the bid levels in history and not driving the flooding in this area just in terms of the time frame the similar to Phil 's question obviously it 'll take some time to get the chart that you 've shown us around the people who will realize the benefit with the flood intervention policy for the iskut catchment is there consideration to the fact that although someone might qualify at the end of all these improvement works actually these improvement works makes it may take five years or you know six years or ten years and therefore they would be considered eligible based on the time frame in terms of The Associated works 35 that is based on intervening now and not waiting for any of the schemes to benefit them so that issue is taken care of well our recommendation and say issue is taken care of for the very reason that some of the benefits might take a number of years to realize I 'm sure the 25 to 35 includes those who may benefit at the very end of these schemes being implemented thank you thank you for clarifying that and just start sorry just one final question just in regards to one of the other community concerns that 's been raised through the public meetings and we 've heard again from the deputation today is the raw sewage overflows into the into the streets and to the houses into the river can you just give us a snapshot of well obviously this is focused on reducing the flooding but what work is going on around reducing those overflows in terms of and mitigating those those um surge discharge issues do we want this place to us all and drainage start yeah wastewater but we are doing a lot of 't got the details with me at this point it is a key issue so I think it might be worthwhile we have a report back home they maybe put a resolution to that effect I guess I was just trying to understand I don 't need a resolution that come and we can do Pauline can you deal with it in that context of the land drainage recovery program I just I mean I just really like to to get a report back through your committee either through Eddie or through the land drainage recovery program about the impact of the raw search because I assure the council 's concerned in relation to that matter it as something that challenged us over in the east after the earthquakes and it 's pretty pretty challenging on lots of levels so I 'd really like to have that report bit but I don 't want to hold up the meeting today we 've got the meeting either I just wanted to ensure that if there was opportunities through the works that you 're proposing to address some of that recognizing it we 'll get a report back through that as you can achieve Davos I think you firstly Keith can I just congratulate you and your team for the amount of work you 've put in on these catchments and and you know you 're not only doing work here it 's the sticks and the history edges well South Shore look I 'm curious about the dredging aspect and in cheering a community group that sticks we heard last night an extremely well presented report from Graham Harrington over flows river levels and dredging and the impacts of wheat capping and the whole whole scenario and it sort of seemed to me that you know like with here today there 's not there 's no silver bullet that you can go out there and do it but I 'm wondering really with the data on the heath kit and like we heard last night on the sticks whether in fact dredging will provide the sort of relief that you 're looking for or does it there 's a really synonymous with the storage capacity upstream because what I heard from made a minimal difference to to river levels and the sticks so is there any synergies between the two catchments and and and that sort of stuff we were hearing last night and I can I can talk to that issue and the benefits of the dredging relate a lot to the grade of the river so different rivers in the proximity to the high tide levels and so on so different rivers will just respond differently to dredging and looking at some of Graham 's data for the the Heathcott River we can see sometimes with weed turning a dropping water level of up to half a meter once that weed is taken out so that gives you a bit of an indication of what we might also see with some of the the the slumping the banks liquefaction beard deposits being taken out from the river as well to test this we 've actually run a model run with them an artificially low boundary downstream to see whether what the dredging what effect the tide will have and but we 're still noticing a positive impact so I good data to demonstrate that it 's going to have an effect one thing we do say though is that will be a diminishing repeat effect over time with sea-level rise as to see there were risers that will then reduce some of their impact but we don 't know how long that will take and we believe that we will be getting benefits for a good period of time before we need to reconsider that but it is quite a different situation from the sticks in terms of both the heath gets quite constrained and also its relationship and interaction with their tide great thanks and just a comment I suppose one of the the drawbacks I suppose with the sticks was a Weaver the lack of d 'Arthur and some of the tributaries in and some of some sections of the river and I think priced well during these works I would encourage to keep as much data on an ongoing basis so that we can not only use this and this information to keep there that he 's get up to scratch but it will be useful I had was in relation to the petition which recommended the installation of one way check valves and I 've no idea what one way of check valves are and have you got some comment and response to there yes I mean I 've actually meet with Bruce at his home and seeing that the ponding which occurs outside of the house what we do ask for resonances there are a number of tick bells already in place we believe we do have a sufficient number of the year but some of these do malfunction over time and we rely on resonance Plus also Contractors site visits to actually let us know when they aren 't working and so that we can then either look at where we need to replace those or and still do some maintenance on it so I passed the issues and highlighted on to the operations team to address and that it is an ongoing thing and that some of them need replacement with a more robust system other ones just need and some maintenance because something 's stuck on me you might ask us that could let you know yeah I mean maybe observing where there 's water coming out through the and the galleries into the street so yeah so so we are working with a contractor to improve the inspections and the quality of those inspections so that we can have them dealt with quicker and could non-return valves that they let the walk they open to let the water out then high tide they 're close to stop the port coming back through again there are also some chick valves are suitable in some conditions and some not and others and I salute the South Brighton ones or South Shore ones although they 're non return they really require a head of water to make them work effectively and they 're not getting it worth different situation required to year so we need to be very cognizant of the fact whether the right sort of Bell and the right circumstance so I 've just added a couple of walk Oh have you got another question you because this one that 's been raised a lot by the public and it 's is in our River Management there 's been flooding in that River forever and then that 's Wolfson Cup winner to fix that but and then people say that it just hasn 't been dug out enough and the bank management has just not been enough and will this just because the Woolston cut gave us a bit of catch-up and now we 're behind the all again like and then of course there 's been the suggestion of the gates at the head of the eastery I think as that 's even a remote possibility or not because singable right sorry I I kind of really want to focus on the recommendations that are in front of us rather than suggesting that we open up an another entire line of enquiry which we actually ruled out last tomb table on page 236 that I referred to that 's yeah yeah I 'm sorry I I don 't_''_1725.58 I don 't mean to be you know but you know it 's some team 2-1 on the afternoon and I would like to deal with a paper that 's in front recommendations picking up on Yanni 's point and bite the as a committee to report back on intervention to prevent surge overflows affecting roads and properties during flood events and and then referred the petition received and the deputation by Bruce cane and Sean Daly to staff to investigate and provide feedback to the petitioners because I think your comments about what 's happening in relation to the one way check valves is actually quite a positive reinforcement of the role that local residents can play and terms of highlighting where things aren 't working but also to say that we 're also instructed our contractors to do a slightly better job of alerting to you know keeping an eye on them making sure that they 're functioning in certainly double-checking them at a time that a storm event was known to be coming is pretty important all right so so that that resolutions been moved and seconded so Jonnie Phil I just wanted to move an additional resolution as well a number four is that we an in response to the deputation that we heard around their concern around asked the organization for a formal review of the flooding response and July it may already be happening but that was one of the concerns that was raised this morning because we 've also heard around concerns around cleaning up as well and I just thought it would be really good like we 've done with the tsunami warning system to get an actuary to address that I 'm sorry I thought there was one under way so do we want to note that there is a that there isn 't remember off my head I just wish you 'd kind of you know sort of indicate these things well we haven 't had any time came up this morning and the dictation and I just the thing is that I don 't know whether we 're doing what I assume that we are so why don 't we invite the infrastructure transport an environment committee to report back on the review of the the last flood event that affected the Heathcott catchment and the Heathcott River catchment sorry and and on interventions to prevent so that way it 's and could you just add verses to prove in also slash cleanup because that was the other thing that was referred that would be really cool oh isn 't that something that 'll come out of the review I mean it 's just that different things that we 're we 're talking about the interventions to prevent serious delays affecting roads during flood events and and and clean up where they occur yeah it was just intervention slash cleanups to prevent Sir John was affecting roads and properties just thought it was pretty simple right so um Phil and then Tim and I just wanted to speak to it so look I think we 're really pleased that we 've reached this point I think today with this report it 's quite a major milestone for us when we look back say at the time of the major flooding in 2014 and we had the mural taskforce and this is another another extension of that and I think it 's really great actually that these solutions which are being put to us that not just Hardy engineering they 've clearly the flooding has had on it on their people and I guess it 's fair to say today that we often hear people from the east part of the city concerned about sea level rise and they come to us and tell us and today I think we 've heard really clearly that in fact that there 's a huge impact on the people in the healthcare River but but also just in terms of the effect the ongoing effects of climate change and sea level rise they 're not just impacting on the coasts they 're also impacting on the people who live in the suburbs you know right along that not just the Heathkit River but also the Aven so I think the options that are put forward are really great I think they 're a great combination there 's been a huge amount of work and science gone into this and I think we 're really lucky that we 're actually in this position to be able to hopefully afford through the long term plan a whole whole plan of action to make sure this recovery happens low levels Binx I think that 's really good it 's something that clearly individual communities will want to have a very clear say on before we arrive at a solution for that part so I certainly commend all of these recommendations to Council Jim thank you a lot first of all I 'd like to think the staff for the work they 've done it 's been epsy outstanding and when some of my colleagues talked about going to the government and Richard speech for funding and when we work with their colleagues that he can 't gain resource consents to dredge or bank stabilization we need fix to be based on to gain those as quickly and as efficiently as possible so I want to thank you very much for the work you 've done but also like to think the structure transferred Environment Committee for pushing this in the support for this and Pauline especially you and also Mike Davison as Dibley chair for allowing me to attend and speak to the committee so thank you very much but to both of you a number of things to flat-out to our funding and time frames the fixed mirror are we around this table the ones that dictate and decide the funding and the long-term plan no one else does that we have the total control of that to it to I guess a degree with priorities I just want to remind you that this is not a nice-to-have for these communities it 's a muster do this has been hanging around since 1985 where it was identified by the drainage board we have had a major event which has changed the playing field for the worse for these communities so it is now time to give them security so those questions asked with regards to the new government coming in and supporting and funding etc they are a lot more open it seems than than the previous one but with the factual information given by our staff and the work they 've done let 's look at that and retrospect our communities these communities on the Heathkit need confidence and security that we are going to move forward today so I want to think and a hope that I would like to think most today though as Shana for coming in and sharing her family 's story and I 'll stop there that thank you thank you Jonnie thanks just to follow on from Tim and Phil you know I I have been nagging staff for a number of years now to get these issues addressed and you know I I know that it 's been frustrating for you as much as some of us as elected members as the local residents I think what we learnt in July is just how complex this River River catchment is with the tidal influence so you know we have not done things as quick as I would have liked but I understand that it 's better that we actually do the investigation to come up with things that will work rather than put at risk a lot of funding for things that don 't make much difference at all so you know following the floods in 2014 the government made a number of comments I think critical of us as a city saying that they were waiting for us provided a steady stream of solutions and there 's more that are being offered today and I think that 's good because it puts us in a strong position to go to government and say that this is definitely a post earthquake situation that we 're dealing with and we expect you as my colleague cancel Livingston has said you declared a national emergency in Christchurch earthquake you assumed a large number of decision making that normally would result reside locally and you should have a commitment to help us address some of the issues that have been done there was an irony around the huge amount of money that was spent on the tidal barrage investigation and which amounted to very little real action on the ground to help those communities that needed the help but today is about us actually doing something called giving a commitment to a community that we take their concerns and their issues seriously that we are making a commitment to do something to alleviate the situation as best we can as a city and I look forward to the results of this I step of what will be a very personal personal and probably at times a difficult conversation with individual residents around the flooding and of engine policy but I too like my colleague counselor Cotter reflect on what was done in the flop turn area and the professionalism with what she did that so you know I have no doubt that you will you will check this in the same way and that you will work through some solutions for individuals who have been incredibly stressed and frustrated at what 's been going on so I 'm very happy to support this work the final point I would make is that we should always be looking at how we can improve and that 's why I think reviews of these events are so critical we 've we 've done reviews into the tsunamis we 've done reviews into the fire fires I think it 's really important that we constantly learn as these events happen how we can be better prepared and better respond and we 'll never be perfect but we should have a system of continuous improvement which will thank you no I won 't_''_2407.539 i won 't_''_2408.14 i 'll tinted but i won 't_''_2410.119 Pauline could you close the debate please yes thank you um look as I said before earlier we forget the flooding effects and distress and accompanying trauma and costs when it 's not raining so now is the time to implement these recommendations to mitigate the next event it 's not if but when and it 's not that it will be big but its havoc and as Peter alluded to we just don 't know we can expect anything and also it 's Peter said behind every statistic and inside every graph our people though staff have shown us today how are we 're and how sensitive they are to the fact that people 's lives are incredibly adversely affected by the availability and I think them for that we 've heard of an additional benefit that will see an improvement in the water quality of the Heath good as a result of these works of approved today I just want to talk about DeForest and I 'd like to emphasize that as information is provided to us with regard to operational costs over time their stop banks can be costly to maintain we know too that none of these options will will impact that will have an impact or prevent any future mitigation works should any arise in the future or any future funding be available so these routes have approved will reduce the number of homes that will flood inside to around 37 and these may be sorted through the intervention policy that we 've just approved I 'd like to recognize also along with my other colleagues of stated already the high level of expertise and sensitivity we have on our staff on the land drainage recovery team we 're very fortunate and so are the Christchurch residents the engineers with feelings engineers with empathy this is a highly disciplined and diligent team who are incredibly good at presenting us with very technical complex engineering information and a form that we lay people can understand this report represents a massive massive amount of work months and months and I want to recognize that and thank you on behalf of the people of Christchurch who will enjoy the improved water quality of the river thank you thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you it 's unanimously and thank you very much to all of the staff that have been involved right okay now it 's um it 's just after 1 o 'clock what what I 'm going to propose and I just would like people to concentrate just for one _"

    "text": "a another letter in item 23 with regard to support for alternative fuels and this would be delegated to myself and the chair of the infrastructure transport an environment committee again Pauline without introducing this came via a deputation from green fuels who are local biofuel manufacturing business and Christchurch year and subsequently the et committee made a site visit and this was incredibly interesting and way more interesting than you 'd think so some facts say that they wanted to stress to us that the white there biodiesel is made from used cooking oil they some of them are criticized for using unsustainable products this is used cooking oil source from I think around Canterbury possibly the South Island and to this they add potassium hydroxide and methanol and the nice spinach and this creates glycerine which catches the contaminants which sink to the bottom and then it 's filtered out using a heat process blah blah blah so um then 100% for biodiesel you get 90 percent less emissions and they can do a mix from 100 percent down so in each percentage of biodiesel lowered also lowers into any diesel motor instead of mineral diesel or it can be mixed in and different ratios and there 's no engine modifications required however the problem is that biofuel is more expensive than mineral diesel by approximately two to thirty cents per litre depending on the purity so related to our emissions reduction target which directly reduces our carbon footprint he has previously been a government subsidy for alternative fuels and rationally books are no increase for time in the itty committee would like the minister to consider reinstatement to encourage the use of a low emission fuel and this will help lower our carbon emissions considerably which is one of our council 's goals and just done from our conversations this morning I wondered if it should go to two ministers the Minister for climate change inputs the Transport Minister as well so the UT Committee is supporting Alita going to one or two ministers about this yeah because if they reintroduced a subsidy a new parish you ready that more is after minister so just Minister breaker yes yeah in the council we do support biofuels when with inserting it into our statement of intent in some areas where if it 's possible to actually use biofuels in some big machinery okay so that 's been moved is there a seconder for that again Erin I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried I 've got one more _"

    "text": "all right so moving to item 13 if we can call the meeting back to order please thank you moving to item 13 Pauline I 'll get you to introduce this item but then I 'm going to get mic just to make a couple of remarks if he wants to as he was the the chair of this meeting so Pauline if we can have your introduction please with the agency after the mess of 2014 floods and the fingers and feets often reminds me about this how we tend to quickly forget about flooding when it 's not raining but we heard from people this morning like senior in this other two gentlemen the vulnerable group people they don 't and so the flood intervention policy was developed in parallel with the land drainage recovery program following Sibley the flood events that resulted inevitable for flooding of residential properties that 's above the floor and also impacting on the health and well-being of residents so this is to intervene we habitable floor levels are at risk of frequent flooding under one and 10 year event and as also earthquakes so it applies to properties that will not benefit from the mess of engineering works that are being implemented so this was an amendment to the existing policy which was applied to the flopped in basin and it 's intended to be applied in a catchment by catchment basis so now we 're rolling onto the Heathkit it 's also a voluntary basis there 's no obligation to uplift it as I say that must do is quite related and noting too that this flood intervention policy is just one of many tools if you like that need to be used in combination to address the serious problems that our increased frequency and intensity of our rain events is causing and it was the scent of each and policy amendment was supported by the SE committee thank you Mike do you have anything to add as the chair of the meeting all right thank you so is there anything that staff wanted to UM tell us my way of introduction good overview thank you very much and we 're happy to answer questions all right great so now let 't have any with regards to that the main report because we 've been through everything through it and we know it very well and but what came up today and we 've talked about with other areas they um the pre and post maintenance from storms and also the maintenance included in that with regards to our cheek valves and flips etc so we it 's not part of this but I think it 's something to to raise and find out where we pursued it because it is definitely a concern not specification or maintenance issues they 're ones which we 're working on constantly and we 're looking to to improve on the maintenance issues that referred to do not cause the major flooding the above floor flooding that we 've seen so we need to keep that in context but it is something which were working hard to improve on I guess it 's more an emotional kind of connection with regards to that the public can see the residents can see that there are as attention being paid to it paid to the area and flooding when we have dust of contaminated soils etc and you know as we heard from Sheena with regards to nappies and other things so I guess that 's just the Heba kid a view on debt so that 's not lost thank you Jonnie thank you I put there a few questions I know yesterday so just wanted to chase up on on those um just one is just can you just talk us through the time frame if we agree to this amended policy today or the people too who are impacted on by it will possibly impacted by it to get some certainty over a whether they they are included in the analysis and then a timeframe for what 's of it action can can occur I 'm just mindful of the stress that people have been under and just you know I think it would be good if we could just get a little bit of understanding around at the timeframe obviously this is the policy amendment report or not that 's covered under the next report but must be clear this is just for my there needs to be some work done and then there needs to be individual discussions that 's this report isn 't that or is that the next report so there 's two there 's two things so the flooding intervention policy itself is in this report the rollout in the heat cut catchment is in the next report so it depends what you 're asking about all right so we can deal with in the next one if you want but it just I can 't_''_331.289 so no if you prefer I just thought it was relevant because of his experience had flopped and that you might be able just to go as a kind of understanding around the timeframe for rolling out the policy yeah so if the policy amendment is agreed and the recommendation on the next report is agreed then we would be in a position to contact potentially eligible residents within the next within the next few days we would expect to be in a position to meet with them over the next couple of weeks at their convenience and obviously would find ways to to from flop turn was that every every negotiation is different and can take various lengths of time but the initial contact we made very quickly RFI I think that 's been it 's been said that this policies already existed and you know 2014 when we did I think the flop turn 2015 what I just wanted to clarify in terms of future areas do we need a resolution of council to get a catchment included under this policy or is it something that you 've got sufficient delegation to do if there 's other areas that that we have an identified yet that are at risk and you know if we get a whole lot of more flooding do you need to come back to us and get specific catchments and approved or is the policy sufficient enough that you could actually go and do it all right no so what we would do is we would come back to Council with proposals of our investigations so that if there is defense options that were proposing then that is what we were put forward to Council and the flood consider when we 've done the catchment study so we look to see options for defense first rather than you know thinking about that intervention policies a first option so they would come back to Council just mindful of how long it 's taken for these residents who have you know had the impacts that we 've heard today so yes but they couldn 't have been addressed until you 've done the catchment workers what you 're saying under the existing policy absolutely yes thank you with any further questions Jimmy Kushina Eva we thought these new amendment fraud the new policy but one of the key disadvantage in your particular machine is kind of the the cost we 're high cost individual of popular they were increased from the current 600 K to the 750 K and you need to were increased from the 4000 K to the 500 K whether those that additional cost on the long term play so the the cost increase is just to bring it in line with the as part of an update yes the properties if it 's agreed would be not an offer of an increase of 750 it 's a market value rate what it allows for is for any properties that that would be in excess of 600 thousand that otherwise would be just just fall outside of that so I think that 750 was was felt to be an appropriate threshold for a contribution okay thank you Thank You Glen thank you I noticed in both this report and also over all power Hall hip gets sprinkled throughout is that to me the obvious and probably to any reader and the objective reader the obvious is kind of causal link between the earthquake and the increased flooding so that suggests to me that has any thought been given to you know possibly pushing for inclusion and the tombs of reference of Vernie QC inquiry proceeds you know obligations to the council over over funding so because obviously that the inference or it 's more than that but throughout both reports as the ratepayers will pay rather that 's being spread across the taxpayer base and you know my viewers it was first to clear a Christchurch er seeing the burden falling on the ratepayers so I 'm just wondering now I know it 's complex and complicated as far as EQC Lander Citra goes but is it he thought being given to them so when we initially put the policy together we did have talks with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority about the crown joining with Council and addressing these issues the position from the crown was that EQC had already made its contribution through the increased flooding vulnerability payments that were made to residence where they had increased flooding vulnerability due to the earthquakes and so in that sense we 're we 're properties have lost value because they they are now more vulnerable the costs to counsel of purchasing those as consequently lease so on that basis the crown felt that the the taxpayer had already done they 're done their part film thank you just I 'm not sure if it 's in the policy or the the later report for their power who is get River but I think that the number of homes and will be affected in the in that River so do we need more do we need more work to actually ascertain the number that would qualify under this policy so beckon and 2014-2015 when we did the work across the whole city we came up with an estimate of between 100 and 150 properties citywide that could qualify now that included some 70 odd properties and flocked on most of which were addressed through the engineering and the catchment so those fairly out immediately it also included an estimate of around 30 to 40 in the hiss kit and some of those properties will drop out because of the works being done in that number of 25 to 3 five stays so that that leaves you with your 50 up to 50 across the rest of the city so we have since done some modeling across South Shore and New Brighton in terms of the number of properties that may be at risk out there that 's that 's not modeling with actual floor levels it 's still just an estimate and there are up to twelve out in that area that could also be included in this really sure so it 's very small numbers once you go past flopped inand Heathkit where where the biggest risk was very small numbers and other parts of the city and so the funding for all of those properties it would still lie with the long-term plan with the Cameron yes so it all sits within the land drainage program so it would be funded from the ldrp program budgets obviously with the LTP considerations that 's that 's something that needs to confirm review and confirm budgets as part of that separate process so just to clarify if existing budgets are confirmed through the LTP process there 's no requirement further funding for what we 're considering today okay well hold that question for the next person that 's point yeah yeah no we 'll hope that questions the next report I 'll come to Dave anything that gives me a little bit of a question is six point eight we about sixteen point five million with the cost certainty of plus or minus thirty percent it 's quite a variation and your budget there 30 percent quite a leaving ourselves open to quite a budget surge there the sixteen point five million is based on the best information we have at this time of both the capital value of the properties Plus also the the cost Amin works on those properties to remove houses and things like that and we 've packed that relates to the range we 've given of twenty five to thirty five houses and we 're aware of the number that we think are eligible and we 're also conscious that there may be properties that very later identified as eligible we 're not currently aware of and some of the numbers we have come from people self reporting flooding during the task force and for various reasons people may not have reported at the flooding their property so the reason we give a lower range there is that to avoid needing to come back to council if it was if we had sixteen point five million in in for instance it was seventeen point five million just to avoid coming back at sixteen point five is their best estimate at this moment variation within our overall program budget it seems of priorities approach projects okay thank you are there any further questions for staff at this stage okay so in that case do I have a mover for this very short resolution that 's in front of us Pauline seconded by Sarah yep and now moving to debate film but I 'm obviously very happy to support this I think it 's timely and I think the staff for all the work you 've done on developing the previous policy and also just referring back to the earlier submission brought by Sheena that the individual conversations that you 've all really had with a lot of the reasons and end the engagement you 've already undertaken it 's just so important it 's clear in the report and it 's being alluded to that the after the earthquakes as well as the other hazards in fact the frequency of the flooding has only increased and doesn 't look to get any better unless we follow interventions like these including this is in conjunction with all the other interventions which are listed in the today too is how it 's important that the health and well-being of our residents is also addressed and this policy will certainly start to do there and it 's it was it 's absolutely clear that for this group of residents along the river that in fact the levels of stress and anxiety are really high and this is the snare was none too soon and I know that my colleague Tim in in myself when we 've talked to residents it 's actually it 's actually incredibly hard I guess coping with other people 's stress at times and I think Tim toe for the work he has done actually and and talking with the resonance and working with them it 's all of the I guess the the the stress and illness that Sheena referred to today actually comes to pass a lot of a lot of families so this is really timely and I am expecting that all of Council will support this policy Tim thank you look this was a identified way back in 1985 by the drainage board there was another study combined with 1998 which then confirmed what they said in 1985 since then we 've had the earthquake it 's got worse so through loss of channel capacity they fix the high tides one thing that really I hadn 't thought which came into play a wee while ago was the load pressure combined with a storm combined with high tides its combined with the loss of channel capacity so all those makes a perfect storm which is the last thing that we want for these residents so I really would like you my colleagues around this table to follow what the infrastructure transport Environment Committee didn 't support this unanimously thank you Thank You Glen thank you no doubt I support this no question there but you will have picked up in my question before around what I see is government obligations here so we were first to clear the national emergency which required a National Response the crown that contribute through the EQC but if I heard correctly it also has used the argument that it will cost the ratepayers less due to lower values was that I find that for a better word than that but can 't_''_1207.269 I argue actually that we go back to government because this report on the next is putting the the financial obligation entirely on the rate payer and and I think it extends much wider than that we will know some of the behaviors that we 've seen with the EQC over over land over buildings of hurt the pre-existing arguments time and time again they 're not even convinced over lidar data I mean that puts it beyond the pale in terms of what 's happened to our area so I support this but also would support revisiting it because I think there is scope to hit to open again a conversation with the crown over what I think is some application see thank you yonni thank you I strongly support the sub policy being amended the probably the next report is the debate about putting in their head get River catchment so I 'm happy just to leave my debate until that that report but I just think that it 's really good that we do review and update these years ago and even more recently following July but I appreciate that staff have said that they need to do work around the catchment to help inform some of the decisions that we need to make today so they 're doing it both together but the stretch that people have been under since 2014 and even you know before that post-earthquake is very real and i think you know it is important that we act I appreciate the comments that have been made by councillor Livingston and I concur and it 's only a shame that you know the government were very quick to attack us in those really bad floods in 2014 and they offered support at the time and yet we haven 't seen that to date so I think we need to get on and provide solutions in the interim I 'm hopeful and optimistic that the new government given that some of those new ministers and and new parties who are in power have made comments on this previously that they will also take this seriously and collaborate with us around dealing with what is a needs to be addressed but I don 't think we should delay it today and waiting for that settlement with the crown I think we need to get on and do it and we 're retrospectively with them to pick up their share of the costs that were faced with Thank You Jimmy and fully support this man because I can see the truth point the palace actually the consider implementable no particle that 's very important but the face on the information who looks like you know is not neither implementable no do under have a son of the Cape to implement this way or difficult to the fulfilled is the policy so you need to consider amendment is where we could also the if a new the amendment of the other intervention a policy can provided the courage particularly here but unfocused applicability as a pirate and the intervention is what this vehicle so I admire the start you know first this we act and have a proper the amendment regarding to this policy Thank You Pauline thank you not yeah when I support Phil 's comments about so stressed out about this too and I 'm sure that Syria and Yanni term and fill of Warner brunt of of that and we saw a lot of evidence of it at the two public meetings that were held recently down there so it 's it 's a biggie so we 've also heard the distress and fear and financial loss from to the people who came to speak to us today every time it rains even if a flood does not eventuate and we 've heard too today how they hope they 'll into a good process for any agreements and I have personally assured them that a good protest was followed in the flopped and buyouts people were treated with respect and staff proved sensitive to their needs I 'm time consuming because of the individual nature of every property in reiterating this is the last recourse after interventions in other works yes it takes time now has taken a long time but anyone criticizing their shows a lack of understanding of the complex nature of the Heathkit issues in the varied options which require investigation in policy as as the duty committee has recommended and for the amendment of the for the youth cut and it 's another step forward to restoring our flood levels to pre quake in another milestone and wrecking our recovery program and yes it 's expensive and yes it 's carried by the ratepayer currently but it 's the right thing to do and I also appreciate the comments of council Livingston thank you thank you yeah I 'm also very supportive of this and I thank the it committee and staff and the local council is in fact for the work that they 've done in the Heathcott area where we 're about to consider item 14 which is the one that specifically relates to the heath care well here we 've got an amendment to a policy which has worked well in flop town that 's tied perfectly to the work that the this going through the land through the the working group and through the land drainage recovery plan strongly supportive of this and it allows us to move on and have a proper consideration of the next heath care so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried yep if we can record that that was unanimous that 's great and then _"

    "text": "minji to 3 30 so I 'm going to recommend that we go to the item on the agenda items number 18 which has crush it city holdings that I said development crush it 's almost a progress report and yeah so yes excuse me excuse me he 's conflicted on this matter so I asked him if it would be all right if we dealt with it as an item after lunch so that was the reason for it but I think it 's inappropriate to ask why a council has given an apology the fact that they 've given an apology is acceptable and I also think that I did indicate that there was a conflict of interest on him and thus meta so I actually asked him not to be available for this part of the meeting so so would would someone like to what I 'd like to move the staff recommendation because I 'm very happy with it and it 's thickened up by Paul but I have also spoken to council Turner and he came to move an amendment and I 'm happy for clear water so I 'll just wish we deal we deal with the amendment because then that just gets that cleared out of the way so i 'll put that amendment into the CC actual directors should we also stand back from this um I 'm not sure it 's entirely up two up two directors if would you prefer to sit back from it better than just the advice it is just a progress report but it 's no it 's up to counselors whether they feel and I know that in Thompson 's advices always off and out set it out so yeah but it but it is providing advice to CCA HL so I mean look yeah it 's probably better just sit back from the table and we 'll put the resolution yep just briefly yeah just very briefly we received advice when we 're talking about some the DEA development Christchurch that for good governance reasons and to avoid political interference we shouldn 't have a counselor on the the board or as a director of development Christchurch so it seems inconsistent to me that I think it 's important we have that consistency for exactly the same reasons as the advice that we received around the the final board so that 's the the reason for the amendment I think you know if there 's a if there 's an issue around political interference with the board then there 's potentially that same issue with the establishment board so that 's that 's my reasoning for the amendment that 's fine so i 'll put that motion of the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so that 's sort of that and in a way i just wanted to kind of clear the air with that one and that one 's fixed and yep yep well up there was no nobody asked to have it recorded against so it 's it 's pretty pretty clear that it 's unanimous so the because i really want to talk about how excited i am about the actual resolution so i didn 't want a kind of side track on that and that 's now dealt with and so 'll kick off the debate on that on the development christchurch i think that this progress report represents real progress and i am really excited about the potential that it brings to the capacity of the Christchurch City Council to once again play a leadership role in terms of the development of the inner city when I 've actually reflected on what was happening in Christchurch and in particular in relation to the Christchurch City Council prior to the 2010 earthquakes what did I discover the Christchurch City Council was deeply concerned about the inability to excite and ignite the central city and so a lot of work had been undertaken to try and develop a plan about how to actually reinvigorate the central city I mean we 've heard a lot of debate over recent times about New Brighton but actually that was exactly the same debate that was going on about Christchurch central city and and I know that I can see by seconder lonsdale nodding his head because as the local business association they were moving to a point where they were going to seek from council the change that the central city required and and and that will come again there will be a time when the business association will combine with the local communities that are living in the central city to actually really really and so Christchurch development Christchurch limited gives us the opportunity to step into or step up very quickly so we start at a at this establishment establishment phase to get good processes in place to bring back to the council table a statement of intent proposed set of Directors and we can hit the ground running we start small but it 's scalable very quickly and if you think about the transition that we 're at the moment and the fact that we 're getting closer and closer to April next year and we look at the anchor projects that the Crown has an interest only look at the anchor projects that we have an interest in it 's actually the gaps in between that excite me and make me feel like there is so much more that a development authority like development christchurch limit limited can do in order again i also know that you know a lot of people have experienced expressed concern about the state of New Brighton and again with a with a professional development company in place the capacity to engage not only with local businesses but with the community and the private sector I just can you know and I really want to repeat the words that that I think it was Jason mill used at the end of his contribution to the discussion on the LTP last Saturday which was instead of thinking about a legacy project for Brighton think about brighton as the legacy project for christchurch so and there 'll be more than one legacy that will come from these earthquakes that we 've experienced and I think development Christchurch limited will be the driving force of much of that work so I 'm really excited to receive this report we 're cooking on gas at as moving as fast as it possibly can and I 'm really pleased that we are going to be able to establish this and very near future it 's the only one else that would they actually I totally support everything you just said I think it 's a great vehicle being able to interact with the private sector and actually being more a part of actually how the city grows and how we can part of those other other private sector organisations have gone to invest and making sure they can this and a way that but on the finished doing whatever project it is they go wow that was really really great and really enjoyed that experience because it was fast was nimble and we did at a timely fashion and I want to do more and I think that 's the key part Jimmy I also go with your point of view because why this kind of weather will crucial a break oh you know for the kind of the reputed city and also learn in the future from now on we can see the new day legacy the project of the new law council owner may be some of the look you know the communal facilities public cancel is the very corner to establish so I so I think that 's learn so public area citywide so this when we push it so I call this one thank you very much clean thank you yes I think it 's good give this the green light get up and running councils already shown a lot of good lead it know that when we go well the city does go well there 's already some existing fear by way of the the dc 's and I think we could look to to build on it I 've had to talk for a while there I think it was a bit of a structural problem putting the main focus just on the CBD so we need to retain that but also remember that it is hub and spokes model in a sense it only has meaning and makes sense when you 've got your suburbs can help as well this will send out a good signal today that we 've prepared to be innovative and i think that the city will respond i felt i 'm very supportive over to i think you mean particularly just focuses us on what sort of really the we ensure so that we ensure our best accountability and I note in the report to that and clearly there 's an intention that they will revise council about the financials involved in back on though on there yeah Andrew you know I welcome to speed that this is progressing at a question about that i mean the comments I 've made in the past about the need for this entity to be involved in suburban work as well as central is also well well noted I note in the report that there are two different groups have been engaged or ready two assists ECHL to do this work and whilst that would appear to potentially be outside of 12.2 in our own resolution it obviously indicates that things are happening at pace when we get the statement of intent based on the business plan back I 'll obviously be keen to have a look at the the budgets and the the way that this is going to play out one other thing I am mindful of is that we 've got a six to eight-week lifespan for the establishment perhaps would like to be talking about placing with development Christchurch as soon as possible yeah I think it 's important that we get on with this as quickly as we possibly can so that we can move through the establishment phase get some work underway so that we can actually start delivering some results great whereas i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you now we 'll go back to item _"

    "text": "and Ian Thompson as well so Richard and Ian that 's great thank you very much indeed now I 'll kick off with a question the paragraphs in the report that probably cause me greatest concern those five point one two five point one three five point one four and really is around the the level of confidence that we 've got in this section of the bridge if it were to be loaned in this way been returned to us in the state that it 's currently in intact and able to be reassembled in whatever way that we might decide with the community is appropriate for its final resting place in the future can we realistically ensure that that 's the case by way of conditions in an agreement and you know obviously there have been some conversations with gap-filler is there the level of confidence that this item will be respected and be returned in its current state that would give the original community the the confidence as well that it can be used as an reinstated as originally expected back out in the east in such sections of the bridge and I haven 't heard anything to say that that 's not achievable so 5.14 the small tidying job gap-filler refers to in its proposal to deal with a health and safety issue that 's obviously some sort of intervention with this part of the bridge some physical intervention with this part of the bridge is that something that would need to be put back to the way it is at the moment in order for the three sections to be joined together if that was what was desired I 'm not sure exactly what is required but any parts that if there were to be any parts removed for health and safety reasons we have enforcers that those be kept so that assuming the bridge is to be reinstated that those to be reutilized when that occurs all right Thank You Sara engineer or anything but my my first thoughts would be beach if the bridges to be reinstated sort of structurally for people to use for example or even it 's a structure that we 're sort of sitting in in place twisted still structurally anyway so it would have to be done to get them to get the bridge sort of more structurally sound if it was going to be rejoined anyway so a small section probably wouldn 't make a difference I wouldn 't think it 's beautiful it 's been keeper door yeah I 'm not an engineer no no I just look I think we want my viewers that we don 't want to prejudge the outcome of the investigation so the reason for the resolution been reasonably open and its nature is that we don 't know what the investigation will tell us either from an engineering perspective or from a community engagement perspective so once we 've done the investigation then we 'll know what we can do because there might be significant costs associated with the site I simply don 't know and that 's the whole purpose of going through a process that will tell us the answers at the end what do the community want and what does the council want how much will it cost in what can feasibly be done great thank you like we the first we 've seen these new resolutions but is there any way to bring forward that may 2018 I mean it still seems quite far away and is there anything we can do in the meantime to actually bring that forward and obviously hearing the deputation this morning the significance of the site particularly for you know earthquake commemorations so is there any way that we could look at doing something before February 22nd there wouldn 't be my recommendation to bring forward I I genuinely don 't know how long this investigation will take and I think there 'd be some difficulty and put in an earlier time frame to that because there may be some further engagement that we need to undertake with other members of the community that and itself as time consuming we will definitely need some engineering or technical advice to that there might be time consuming or costly so I think if we were to put an earlier date in we would struggle to meet it and at that stage the resolution is it currently reads its what it says is by the end of May so we don 't know what the outcome of that all the recommendations of that report will be yet but I 'd be concerned about bringing afford any earlier in terms of working out what we need to do and the achievability of that and what I was a bit puzzled by the fifth one is that external funding for the golf course or is that external funding for the transitional project and what 's the rationale behind behind that in terms of are we is it because we don 't have money on budget or is it because we think other people likely to contribute we don 't have money on budget there my understandings that relates to resolution proposed resolution four which is the about the investigation but there is another agency who may have funding available for us to give a fit to resolution four so should we not just specify that agency is and request them well there again this is this has all come very late yeah so if we were to specify who the agency worth there might be motions this morning it was agreed amongst the parties that 'd be best to keep it reasonably open I think even does have an agency in mind but but I can 't speak for him on there okay I mean it 's just hard for some of us counselors who know the history of this who haven 't had any involvement to date and now we 've got resolutions has been put in front of us and we 've heard their concern from the community but I just wonder whether we should be considering making some sort of budget commitment to this project today in light of what we 've heard so that we give some certainty that there is a commitment to do it no I don 't think you should do that today and I think the purpose of the additional resolution is to provide us with time to work through all those sort of issues and it would be inappropriate for you to decide that now well the there 's nothing about considering this report today that prevents us raising something to be considered for inclusion in so in order to include something in the draft LTP we don 't need to pass a resolution today but if we don 't have the information back until May we we don 't have the information to inform what we would need to put in the draft yep I 'd suggest we pick that point up as part of the development of the draft LTP just a process question um it looks like the sequence up there continues after number three but they actually point for us the new motion isn 't it so it 's the new number one when we come to a mover and I 've got one question from Dionne and then Sarah as indicated that she 'd like to move this so when we come to Sarah being the mover I 'll obviously be checking with her what it is she wants to move so what we 've got on the on the screen in front of us is a proposed resolution once we have a mover then the move will be moving whatever of that Sarah is wanting Damon proposed being number four tell me if I 'm wrong is that what will be what we 're expecting to be moved in terms of the discussions that have been happening recently would be one to five and then the additional motion Ben six so that the original proposal goes ahead but then there are further investigative works happen and then obviously this further investigation now into other artifacts or items that may well be of the same importance to other communities or similar importance as this bridge has proven to be to the community that we 've heard from today Sarah can I just check that that 's what you were intending doing all right great thank you all right so I 'll take the final question from Dionne and then we 'll come to move in this so deal actually nah that 's fine I won 't take the final question from deal that 's great so Sarah you 're happy to move on what you 're moving is resolutions one to six great do I have a seconder for this deal now we 'll move to debate is there any debate its touchstones large was small and obviously this is one of them for the Haven site and Richmond communities and we all know being representatives of our communities that they 're never to be underestimated in terms of the significance and the meaning for those who live and have lived around them and the experiences which they 've gone through here in Canterbury being the the quakes of 2010 and 11 I think it 's imperative we work with stakeholders and our leaders over there they have continued to they were a key voice and are a key voice at the time of the quakes but they haven 't stopped there they 've continued in their work the vocational voluntary work in the community and we need to listen to them so in my view it 's imperative we do that and that we speak I 'm actually not happier with one two three I 'm happy with four through to six but one two three along with four to six looks like we try to have a a bit both ways and I think four is a better approach one side which i think is what four is same because I 'd rather a bit was done well in its own time and that we had ownership of whatever is going to go ahead by the community bike get fill up by all concerned I think we 've got to do it well and I you know really ask you to take this on board okay so I would point out that one to six is what 's been moved if you want me to put one two three separately I 'm happy to do that yep I 'll do that no problem Alan well this is a really really clear indication of post-quake all of Christchurch isn 't on the same page because when I first saw this proposal in there and that minigolf and to know that it 's going to have a Heritage theme that sounds fantastic but what it forgot was that some of the items that were to appear in that in some of the stories that were to be told can really really hurt some people and those people hadn 't been involved I think is a timely one I absolutely thank them for coming in and doing it and it makes me feel a bit soaking my stomach right now to be voting on this knowing that that bridge was cut into three ruins it anyway it 's still there but it 's in three pieces so whatever happens with it in the future it won 't be what it was because you 're going to have to join it back together somehow I wish that for was even written the other way around that it was led by the community stakeholders and regenerate Christchurch just starting the end that was there and I and it 's the line I remember from even for four years goes back years back in its was the ground-up approach starting with the knowledge of the community that number four there the words should be the other way round which should start there because it 's their bridge it 's it 's no longer ours it 's no longer I work with and poorly the caretakers of it because we 've stuck it in in a shouldn 't do that with something that some people how so so dear to other people on the other side of the city that never walked across it it 's just a twisted bridge on the other side of town and and a photo opportunity it 's something for rubber knickers to go have a look at and that 's what it was but to a community that lived it and used it and jumped off it I love that story that 's my childhood the except we use the Heathcott and that may account for some of my health issues but that aside I am a little concerned with this and maybe the solution was an exact model of the whole bridge to fill that gap in the mini-golf course and I 'm sure there 's plenty of artisans that could make that out of needle and make it look pretty much exactly the same and so you played across that rather than the bridge itself so boy I 'm struggling with this one and I 'll be interested to hear the views of one fellow councillors but I I 'm happy with the the one to six there and and firstly I just like to think the community leaders from that area here at the time who have come to us and actually told us the stories in a little bit more of the history which I didn 't even know about which actually adds a little bit more sort of essence to that to this argument of discussion I should say won 2-6 I think is what the community block it is what the community leaders have come to us today have agreed on and are okay with and it does set the framework for them to start working to ensure that the bridge does get the permanent sort of location that it needs and in the east and also sort of gives that trend the respect to the transitional use I do want to caution though that the areas that may need to be chopped or something like that I 'd love to see some alternatives to actually rather than chopping bits to sort of that safety bit to actually maybe add some structure there to but I suppose there the engineers that need to do that but yeah I 'm supportive of one to six on the advice and end of the conversation that has had this morning from the from the community leaders who have come to us they 're happy with it so from that perspective um just to sort of go with this and actually just make sure it happens okay and and then I 'll come to Pauline and fill an opportunity here to put some sort of acknowledgement of the mistakes that were made in terms of this process by the organization and obviously nobody said about to to create hurt or upset but I think we need to acknowledge that that has happened and the process perhaps wasn 't as robust as it should have been so I mean I 'd like to apologize to Ryan because I know that he has put a huge amount of effort and time into building communities I 'd also like to apologize to the residents for our lack of valuing experience so I don 't know if we can do that but organization to acknowledge and I would see that it 's being addressed and the process is going forward but I think there 's also got to be some degree of acknowledgement of fault theism here thank you Pauline he 's just quickly look like I support what ain 't it I think we could put a note at the bottom neither the council appreciates the processes being flawed and will endeavor to improve on it and indeed it has but I think we 've come to a good solution here in some ways it 's a good thing that the bridge has been brought to light from from being as Aaron see shoved into an old paddock and covered with who knows what and it 's brought it up to the surface now again so and it 's a good solution that some of it is going to be reinstated as a memorial beacon where it came from and the rest of it will be loaned temporarily and will be given life at that site to you know there 'll be children all around it and all sorts of things will released so I think we 've got to look at the bright side of all this and go forward and understand that there has been agreement reached here if there was an agreement I wouldn 't be supporting it but we have so I will thank you Phil well I 'm concerned about one two three as some of my colleagues are too I think I feel that it 's kind of like a reluctant compromise in terms of the suit you know the seriousness of the lack of a previous lack of acknowledgement of of people of the history and legacy of this in the pain that happened at the time and and I just think it in terms of that it hasn 't been a clear or good process obviously and and I think that if in supporting four to six that in fact we can get it right but I 'm very reluctant in it and won 't support one two three thank you Yani yeah I apologize to Evan Lee Ann and Tom and also to I know behind you there 's also a number on this and I don 't think this process has been good at all and we do need to learn from it and maybe put in place some protocols to improve I 'm really concerned about one through three because it seems to me that how can you have a proper report around a transitional structure which I think should be also considering the permanent structure with just two parts of approach in one part already being used it seems to me you know that it would actually be good to look at this and its entirety rather than just a transitional project so yeah I can 't support one in one two three today it 's not to say that after that works being done that comes back to us that you know it may be that there 's a different approach or or the same approach is continued but it seems to me that we really should spend the time talking to people we 've we 've heard you know deputations they 're very short notice to council today raising I think concern and so yeah I can important that we do make a commitment around the budget at some stage so you know hopefully as part of the draft LTP or within our existing budgets I can 't imagine that we don 't have money that we could put towards us so I think we should be giving that undertaking at some stage in the near future Thank You Vicki and then Dave and then Mike I will support one two three and four five and six I think it 's important that we actually tell these stories and I think it 's been interesting to hear the stories told today but I don 't if the choice now is between this chunk of the heritage bridge sitting at fira need and kempt and unloved and actually telling the story in a transitional way in a heritage gothic mini-golf course in the central city where people will see it know it and and understand some of the story of the city then I 'm definitely in favor of it being bringing it to life and bringing it into the city so that people can know about it city and the four five and six steals worth the local issue of what needs to happen longer term so by voting against one two and three all we 're doing in the meantime is condemning this chunk of a piece of heritage which has an interesting story to tell which everybody wants to share actually two sitting out at very meat that doesn 't seem to me to be the most interesting lively sort of vibrant way of telling the heritage of the city at all so I will definitely be supporting the fact that an agreement has been reached and that both parties can live with a solution that has never arrived it thank you I will support one two six also and I agree entirely with Vicki it 's another surprise II that the story behind the thing is this being showcased in the city and I do particularly also support the item six that you know there are so many things in our city that have been lost to us and some are being stored and this is important I think that we establish a register interested in some of the stories that were being told around the bridge and one of particular significance that there was a we 're underneath the bridge hood and I 've seen some considerable time working with people in the sticks catchment over catchment issues there and these are we 're intrigued me and I would like to sort of learn a little bit more about why we 're was there and what significance of had to catchment management because certainly last night we had some exceedingly excellent presentations on catchment management and which I like to discuss more when we come to the heath care later on thank you Mike thank you I also will be supporting our 1 to 6 and you know it does surprise me a little bit when I hear just a few councillors obviously concerned with one two three and obviously they talk about the the process we have actually listened to all the deputation xand and a lot of work was done glad to get to this point which is actually quite agreeable by a lot of people and obviously communities have been has happened out of this process is actually progress and we 've been so slow over the last six years because of all all the procedural motions and stuff we have to go through to actually create progress so what we have done is actually created progress today quickly and these resolutions ensure that actually the community that was affected when they were removed when the bridge was obviously removed and wants something back and plays which we all accept needs to heaven is actually going to have an outcome from this if we had not had this come today who knows what might have happened to that that bridge so I would urge all counselors actually to support listen to the people have spoken and actually support all these items Thank You Sara thank you and I 'd like to thank everyone for all they work on this too now I know that the process leading up to last week was not good but I think that I guess especially the last 16 hours or so have been much more fruitful it 's really disappointing for for both parties agencies have let you both down so I 'm really sorry for that I can understand the concerns of Jana green Phil and Erin over one two three but I 'd also like to acknowledge that they 've heard from both deputations today and actually the the residents from the area do support one two three and they 're going to be able to have the chance to tell the story of the bridge in this new in this new way if we don 't pass numbers one two three today not only do a third party who have invested heavily and thus have to go back to the drawing board through no fault of their own at all it 's been our processors that are bleep them down but also the communities surrounding that bridge don 't get to tell their story to the wider community in a transitional way and I think that 's a really valuable thing to come out of this process I 'm really pleased that we were able to move forward with water six as well and that we will be able to start 'm really looking forward to a discussion in the community about a final use eventually but I understand that some time off the the minigolf while the words mini-golf might sound flippant it 's not it 's a respectful treatment it 's done professionally it 's designed to last for a while and we 've heard that there 's been involvement from the agencies like here it is New Zealand and that 's going to ensure that this has done well I 'd like to urge all councillors to vote for all of these today and allow this this touchstone is council leaving Livingston quarter earlier to actually be in a place where the community can reconnect with us as conversations occur that allow a larger section to be used back in its community thank you the comments made in the report that this matter appearing on the public agenda was likely to generate some interest and I think it 's fair to say that that 's exactly what has happened and this has been probably longer than expected debate but I think it 's been a useful debate to account of and respected in the amended resolution and I think it 's important that they are but the thing for me and this is where I am particularly value the addition of the final resolution number six this this is a conversation on the face of it about a bridge and and how that bridge should be respected and treated and and how a community that this bridge has input importance to should also be respected and engaged with in order to get the best outcome both short term and long term for this particular bridge or what really has become almost an artifact but this isn 't just a conversation about a bridge it 's a conversation about the effect that the earthquake had on communities and continues to have on communities and it 's a conversation about how there are certain symbols in the city some of which are more obvious than others of the effect that the earthquakes had on communities and the value of those would have now become at effects of as symbols of the earthquake and what physically happened but also the effect has been a a good discussion to have because I think it probably changes the way that we look other examples that I 'm sure we 'll find as we go through the work this detailed in item six of today 's resolution and that there are other artifacts symbols that also represent the earthquake the physical strength of the earthquake but also the effect on people the effect on communities and in some cases communities that even though they 're no longer physically there as there were the connection the strength of those connections and the mental connection with the land and the water and other physical features remains and and one of the messages coming through loud and clear from the deputation is that we need to acknowledge that we need to respect that and in future engagement not only from Council but from other agencies we need to be absolutely taking that into account and the mayor 's comments earlier I think make it clear that that particular point has been heard loud and clear I will be supporting the whole resolution one two three and four to be told here we 've got a bridge which has got a significance to a particular community and I also think it 's there 's a story that can be told alongside that which has got value and there 's certainly value in that been told and in terms of leaving something sitting in storage or finding a further transitional use for it before its final resting place and appropriate permanent display or uses is worked out is entirely appropriate and is the most positive way we can look at this so I 'll put first of all motions one two three all those in favor say aye against do you want those recorded yep so recording knows from councillors Livingstone and Johansson and an abstention from Phil Clearwater and I 'll now put resolutions four to six all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you very much indeed and just echoing again the thanks or the level of involvement and participation from the people that we 've heard from this morning and the willingness to to work together to come to what has been everybody involved _"

    "text": "so I 'd invite Cheryl dog from grow whiter her to the table Cheryl good morning good to have you with us you have five minutes for this public participation item and for counselors there is a document which has been uploaded to the hub to support this presentation so over to you thank you I 'm here with a strategic how many of you have heard of Gro Waitaha fabulous by the end you 'll all be completely ok with it so there 's a sheet that Joe 's just handing around that 's the infographic of Gro Waitaha and essentially grow Waitaha was a program started by the ministry of education and partnership with in for strategic partners and the it 's connected with the rebuild of Christchurch schools so that was the impetus but of course you can rebuild buildings but that doesn 't mean things change inside them so grow Waitaha is a program supporting schools through the change process and there 's a whole lot of different arms to that and what you 'll find on that infographic I 've provided but I just want because this is a profound thing in the city it 's exciting in as it 's increasingly got national and international interest so grow by Taher has different arms to it and you 'll see that on one page there 's navigate grow curate and evaluate it all sounds very important but when schools are starting a rebuild process that 's the Ministry of Education property are however alongside of their schools have the opportunity to have a navigator which is from our grow Waitaha project and a navigator is a person that sits alongside that works with the school to think about what they want for their school in terms of of learning for the next 50 years because that 's what they 're going to be built for in it so a navigator can be appointed to a school to help them through their education brief and the master planning but also to set side them and help them explore the the vision or to consult with community they don 't do the work they support them to do the work themselves and as you will know from different from each other in principals are very different from each other and so it 's not a one-size-fits-all there 's nothing about this program that is done it 's done with in partnership and it 's directed by the schools as to how much they want to be involved a lot so they 're navigate part is connected with I guess the physical rebuild but the rest of the program is not so there 's a lot of there are a lot of programs in the city and that the grow space with we 're teachers principals students etc can increasingly become engaged in things like meetups workshops things that are customized for a particular school that are related to changes in the education and where they might want to hear so that there are tools around some of the schools that other schools can go and learn from each other so it 's very interactive and just to give you an example secondary community of practice so secondary schools and the Christchurch started by not doing much talking to each other they are increasingly talking to each other that has got 33 secondary schools and area schools and the great Christchurch Region three to four people from each school working together talking about a wellness and what that looks like in that the new changes in education it 's a huge shift in our city as well as that the curate space really we 've got a website you can look at all the resources that are available for schools to learn and share ideas and celebrate actually success but also to make our mark nationally and internationally so resources are used very widely and increasingly so so the websites on the infographic but there are also some new resources where we 've looked at what 's happening in the city there 's some resources coming out on adaptive governance and also leading for change that take the stories of the city help to share those so we can all learn together and I guess the evaluate on their on the front side you 'll see that there 's there 's nine things in the evaluate value at a framework this is a joint project this procurement model telling us what to do and I think that 's a model and that we could all grow from I 'd just like to finish as we if I was shearing that I was going to be talking with you today I had a response from one of the principals in the city Robinson whose principal at horn behind and he says this grow wait aha perhaps the most powerful force for change in secondary education in New Zealand since Beebe when I first started the job I couldn 't figure out what grow why Tahoe was all about even said to Christensen why would I invest my time in this then the penny dropped the dynamism of collaboration the opportunity to share practice without judgment as that its outstanding I 've leveraged more change at Hornby and six tombs with the influence of grow way to her then I 'd thought possible so with that note you know about grow by Taha please share it widely with your constituents but also if there 's any leverage and links the grow Waitaha is about the city not just about a for providing that information thanks very much for joining us this morning thank you so now moving to item 3.12 i 'd invite mark english mark Inglis from the hora new heartland cycle ride coordination hurinui trails trust and council a Jason Jason Fletcher from the hurinui district council to the table to talk to us about the hurinui heartland cycle ride thank you very much mr. chair Thank You counselors thank you very much for your time it 's marking on the ride coordinator I 've had the contract to create the her a new heart and cycle ride and Jason feature here the chair of the hearing aid Charles trust as well what I would like to do is for a status perhaps indicate what the her new trails trusters is around he renews child trust was created in 2009 as governance and umbrella structure for the walking and cycling strategies in North Canterbury to that end it 's also been endorsed by the hurinui district council as the champion group for implementing the walking and cycling and other trails strategies in that area the trails Trust has done initially under the umbrella of creating the her new heartland ride from the Eretz that coordinator as you can see interacts with a very large number of groups the her new heartland cycle ride has just been approved by NCTA as part of the new zealand national cycling network just in the previous few weeks currently at the signage and the the route runs from regular all the way through the quiet backcountry roads all the way to kaikoura the concept of a heartland ride is to utilize the infrastructure that 's already in place so the cycle ways but predominantly the quiet country roads and it 's to enable us to get cyclists to have the experience of that incredible vistas that we have especially in North Canterbury but also to connect with the rural communities as well the concept was originally Amberleigh to Kaikoura but one of the things that I discovered and taking over this role is actually we need to be looking for the South as well as North and the concept really is from Cathedral Square here all the way to kaikoura and what that you have created that will intersect and be a great benefit this isn 't about building cycle ways this is about utilizing what you have and we 're very pleased to see that they 're NZTA have recognized it as well as that is the preferred route to get to cocora so that end where are we at now we have that approval now the next stage of approval was actually to become under the umbrella of the New Zealand cycle trails and think the the company that MB has set up to look after the cycle trails as one of the heartland rides as I mentioned before these rides are the rides that sit underneath the great cycle rides their rights to get cyclists around will be looking at getting registration with our NZ DCT over the coming months but just having the in CDA registration as a huge boon for this area to that end we go through five regional authorities so from over district council through kakora hurinui Waimakariri and here at the christchurch but we 've developed at some a simple MoU really just to and give some empowerment to the council officers in each area to work in the best possible way as we put it in a no surprises collaborative way to try and make this work there are many other opportunities that we have the hurinui coastal cycle ride which will take you from way carry up through greta valley through modern our beach all the way up to Gor Bay back into Cheviot over into culverton we have of course the white Perl Vineyard trails we have the proposed Cathedral Square to White Pro wine trail that is being proposed as well there 's a whole raft of opportunities out there and what we would like to do is just to have everyone on the same page and open and put all of these opportunities on the table what I 'd like to do just to finish off is to acknowledge the support of the her new trails trust especially for the governance and of the the concept and also the the wider walking and cycling opportunities and North Canterbury so this isn 't just within the hearin area its extends you have a huge pool of potential people that will be using it part of the marketing for the her new heartland cycle ride will be the development of itineraries to effectively to sell to young people it 's nodding himself yep it talks it 's really hard to shut me up so but um thank you very much as also I 'd like to acknowledge the planning department at the here Anu District Council and Stephanie Chen for the work involved in getting this over the line thank you thank you very much indeed for the presentation I mean this is certainly a very interesting project and and you 'll almost certainly be aware of the the joined-up approach that we 're wanting to take as a council to working with our neighbors this certainly touches on that the importance of active transporters as one of our objectives as a council and our focus on our own major cycleways program and the fact that we recently hosted the Asia Pacific and cycling Congress here in Christchurch so the fact that this council is is well aligned with the project presentation is of some interest to us now clearly the request is to move to the signing of an MOU which obviously something that you 're talking across a number of councils about probably the best way to deal with that would be to we 'll clearly need some staff advice on what our involvement could be and how that might best be made to happen my suggestion would be that we refer the matters that you 've raised to staff so that they can provide advice to the appropriate committing so that we can get those discussions underway so we 've got a resolution here that the council refer the matters raised in the present to staff to provide advice to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee I 'm certainly happy to move that do I have a second mic Davidson all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much for bringing this to us this morning so that we can start that conversation about how we can be involved thank you very much thank you thank you thank you so now moving to item 3.13 table to talk to us about rivers walking higher in my ear I 'm also a farmer and an organic farm out there and I 'm also a trustee of mark food Commons where we 're investing in the regenerative plant here on Western River the Austin low and ready part and we 're planting an edible forest theater so um but a river was our film was received really well and I 'm just going to start by showing you an excerpt from the start of the film just to [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] if they want to go swimming they use throwing poles [Music] [Music] yeah so what we discovered during the air walks was that the rivers are in crisis their biodiversity is suffering and people really care about the river and this Poteau KO is carrying the wishes and the hopes of the community we spoke to hundreds of people all around Christchurch and Canterbury and it 's invested in this photo Co that which they walked with and we walked all of the rivers with this and we 've filmed it with made a in New Zealand International Film Festival this year so that 's something we 're very proud of and I think there 's contemporary ins we can be very proud of that as well it 's a very local film it 's also done really well nationally yeah and there 's another there 's another weak clip we just show you at the top yeah you 've cut so you might be aware of what 's happening here right and and now [Music] [Music] so that 's um that last that 's not on the phone so it 's an exit but it 's available on the DVD yeah so it 's available on the DVD so we 're just we 're launching the DVD on Saturday night at the South Springsteen hall with some of the people that are in the film and the DVD will be available and we would like to work with Pauline and the water groups for the people 's awareness to grow about our rivers so at the moment will be selling DVDs but we 're also making available like fundraising screenings and we 're answer questions if you can all if you organize groups of people to do you know screenings so we somehow would like to work with the council especially about our to our here which in especially they here cut up our whole which is seriously in danger and we I think the last even easy and we would like to and we would like to preserve this for use during least four weeks takes place and we ask you to display in a safe place because this takes the hopes and dreams of the people kyouda thank you so now moving to item 3.14 in our agenda I 'd invite John McKenzie from urology associates to the table and John you 're going to be talking to us about the urology associates capper and cannonball and we 've got more visuals it 's some very

talk about the car park cannonball which your ollie Associates car back cannonball and I 'm going to finish with some highly passionate thoughts around cycling and Christchurch and active transport city a great place to live a great place to work and a great place to visit when you bring your bike so thanks for your time this morning first up about the event it is a new global carpark cycling New Zealand it is the only southern hemisphere event and it 's massive in Europe and had two successful vince near the next one is here it 's mountain bikes rode bikes all sorts of bikes riding up an eight story compact building in the central city where the finish line and a party on the roof it is a Men 's Health Movember fundraiser and God bless you for noticing my mo this morning donations are accepted by the I have my credit card facility available so what we 've got is you can enjoy an ice-cold beer on the roof of an inner city building watching the sunset over Christchurch a New Zealand first there are bubbles there 's also some gourmet burgers there 's a DJ there 's a band on the roof yes that is you ladies and gentlemen announced one of the u2 are not playing at the event but them you are so negotiations with them didn 't quite work out so it is from the 8th floor and a central city car park everybody is welcome you are invited to a party on the innovation car park building and I have to point out this point the City Council have been outstanding and their support for this event they 've bought into the vision broken the team from the events team have been amazing been very very good so an opportunity for Christchurch in active transport city an active city worth my background experience and cycling the media and events there is a huge opportunity for the city that we are sitting on right now that I 'm extremely passionate about to sell this destination not only as an events destination but as a cycling destination it 's about visitation it 's about using great events now this event I want this event to be the first of many years and I want this event to be the catalyst of other cycling related and fitness orientated events that are basically about getting bums on seats making it active putting the city on the international map this is a huge opportunity Christchurch is open you can bring your bike and have a bloody good time here I 've been fortunate enough through my experiences the world all right without name-dropping I 've ridden with some likes of Phil Keoghan I 've ridden with the likes of Greg LeMond Tour de France winners and lots of recreational psychics around the world this place rocks to ride your bike it has got the flats it 's got the hills it 's got the scenery and it is just crying to be sold as a destination to ride your bike there is also a massive opportunity for the infrastructure as a fantastic place to live and breathe and ride to work on your bikes I 've recently been a tent attended a conference in Perth with this cycleways that 's in Adelaide with this cycleways and I I mean hundred fifty million dollars investment air cycle ways here is absolutely fantastic but we need community engagement we need that people to be using them and I haven 't got enough time to talk about that now but I 'm really looking forward to more time to talk about that to be fit look fully enough just as I sort of wrap things up I am I wasn _''_1706.88 to help them with their some destination messaging around cycling I have worked with South Australia tourism to help sell Adelaide in South Australia tourism as a destination I spent nine years attending their biggest event and it is all about using bikes to sell the destination the Tour Down Under invests almost 50 million dollars into the local economy and one week in Adelaide we can do there in Christchurch and this is a very short clip that I just want to show you just as an example of some work I 've done with Napier about bums on bikes and selling the destination yeah so look to be fear and they obviously paid me they make me is a great place but we kick their ass okay let 's just be brutal about that I mean Napier 's offend lovely wineries all the rest of it but we have so much more to offer all right just to finish up I just want to point out also run another couple of large events with international reach I ran the legends of cycling dinner in Auckland that was huge I continued Zeeland for the first time I want to run events like that here in Christchurch you know that was huge feedback from that event one who was better than the hell boobs they bought and taught I bought in Tour de France when a greg Lomond had Phil look at the voice of cycling joined by QE Julian Dean Napier hey make me an offer I couldn 't refuse to take it to Napier this year okay which so Ren met with Robbie McEwen that 's just our wee example of event and I 've got to say in thanks the question City Council the events team has seen the vision this event is going to be huge on we 've already got both TV networks looking at running something tomorrow night huge media this week I 've just come from doing some stuff on radio this morning got Chris Lynch tomorrow morning it 's had international reach the biggest cycling show in the world online it 's called the gcn show our event was on that show the two events in Europe didn 't get mentioned air over a million people and it 's just the tip of the iceberg so look thank you very much for your time I am about this being an active City a great place to live and work in but also a great place to visit so my name 's John McKenzie from enthuse and I enjoy riding my bike thank you thank you it was an incredibly enthusiastic presentation and a great I thought I 'd just leap on board you know so thank you very much for that and the last item of public forum presentation as Rogers I 'm here to have a discussion about the rates increases that we 've been carrying over the last year 's my concern is of the ongoing increases that we 're having so the rates are now at a level where some people are struggling to pay their rates this is ruining some people 's livelihoods people are working hard for years to set themselves up in some air fluent areas but that 's those people have been here for some 20 years raised a family and now they 're struggling 't just keep asking for increases and and their wages or what their expenses are on that the right the council as has got to seriously take a look at how much they 're increasing their rates I mean there 's been some articles written and some of the local magazines and papers since why have you and we 've had an increase of over 24% and in the past three years I I don 't know anywhere else that that 's a good in christchurch rates are some of the highest in the country we pay a base fee as nearly three cents based on the value of your property and some areas that 's as low as point eight of a seat so we 've got to seriously take a look at how we 're expecting our ratepayers to front up and fund us City it 's really the people are struggling is people not paying their pair there 's people not paying their doing without food there was an article that was run in a talked about hair somewhat the rights there 's over a thousand people increased so we 're looking at another 5.4 percent increase for this financial year and it 's just it 's way above inflation I can 't see air you can keep expecting people to to front with that sort of money [Music] yes sir there 's 24,000 people that are struggling christchurch i mean that 's that 's just terrible I mean oh I 'm sorry I 'm not a very good public speaker people I 'm not as good as the person before me but I 'm quite passionate about not be now they can not be able to afford their rates I mean I 've spoken to the mayor about this she she wrote me a letter some two years ago saying that she was going to make some concerted efforts to keep it under 5% well once again we 're over 5% of that we 've dealt with Jamie Gough he 's done his best but it just seems to fall on deaf ears and it 's the only reason I 've come here to sit down and face up and so what can we do about city but we were expensive before there and the government made us in assurance that we wouldn 't be worse off from this earthquake we are sorry that 's all I 've got to say thank you very much I mean obviously we 're getting ourselves prepared for the long term plan process and you know you don 't have to be a powerful public speaker to present a powerful message you know I don 't think there 's anyone sitting around this table that doesn 't have sympathy for the level of rates increases that have been applied I promise that nobody would be worse off you know it might have been made after the September earthquake it was completely undeliverable after the February thwe canned somebody should have fronted up and said so we have still got a number of challenges facing us as a city because of the cost of rebuilding the infrastructure not just the horizontal infrastructure our lean drainage in a number of items that we 've got on the agenda today you 'll see the extent of the contribution that the city is being relief from the flooding that 's been caused by the by the earthquake so look that we are doing our level best we have got a long term plan process that again we 'll invite the public to submit on it I do want to see us over time reduce our rates commitment and I don 't think that there 's any one round the table that disagrees with that but it is going to be challenging and we are going to have to be pretty tough in terms of the decisions that we make but also the community expectations the expectation that nobody would be worse off is not one that can be delivered not by any government and not by the city so thank you very much can I invite you to come back as part of the long term plan process and and submit again yes thank you if I was paying based on my value of my property I know I 've got an expensive profits it 's nine thousand a year now yes I know but you wouldn 't have the capital value of your here because your property would be valued much higher and Auckland because of property prices in Auckland so it 's not comparing apples with apples in terms of how the distribution curve works Auckland has way more expensive properties than Christchurch does I 've struggled to find out I know there 's a percentage basis yeah about 2.9 percent we think as a council that continuing to expect people to pay for local services based on the rateable value of their properties as a lose that 's a no sum game there is no good outcome from it we need additional sources of revenue for the city oh you know I don 't have the exact number in front of me but after 24 thousand a significant number of those properties yeah so six thousand seven hundred was settled because they were the government 's rates obligation out of the residential read zone so that vector that they weren 't all individual property owners their work there was about a about a quarter of them or third of them yeah sorry I don 't know the number I wasn 't significant number of those properties but it 's less than half it was it was only about a third or a quarter of the properties maybe a third of the properties we 're in fact the government 's the government had a bit of a dispute as to paying the the rates component of the residential red zone so then they weren 't homeowners they were the government and they 've since settled the bill so it 's still a signal yes I know but the article included the total number not the next number without the government know that there 's still a significant number in your point as utterly valid I was just asked to point that out thank you very much and I look forward to you coming back as part of a long-term plan process but thank you right now we move on to deputations by appointment and we have two deputations on item 14 well I can I can do that oh well okay well we 've got a second supplementary we 've got a supplementary report for the second deputations that we need to that we bring item 47 Midway Street footbridge onto the agenda seconded by Sarah Templeton I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and Cano invited scheana sheriffs to come to the table thank you good Emir to attack you to make it in my life manaphy no up or tear Dina lucky wife Kathy ma ma who I care to make a cookie kita I 'm Connie hitter or auto tally key tear donut eater or take Connie cookie who I call Shane this year took going on cote mama or Hamish Slovak or but I took all Isabelle Caldwell called Kentucky tani Coartem a guy or a nutter Keaton or hokey to tell how old the Opera I 'm Shana Jarrett I am just a resident I 've just come today to talk ever is a newbie for our personal experience of living next to the heath get to the all-powerful and which has been flooded about the flu or three times the earthquakes I 'm gonna find this a reasonably challenging experience I hope you 'll forgive the opportunity to come and I wanted to thank all your staff for the hard work they have done putting it into energy and effort and I know that that being frustrated by the time that it 's taken as well is it his for us I also wanted to say that was really heartening to hear on the 16th of October that this was an earthquake affected situation and I really think you for acknowledging that we were loved by the Heathkit for about 15 years now which probably makes us about quarter of the way to becoming a local and thank you for laughing my 15 year old told me that I might be funny or I might not and we love Leah because we like the people who walk the dogs and their children and themselves and we like the Riverview we know the names of our neighbors and we know some stuff about them too in the names of the dogs since the earthquake has been a different experience after what the earthquake we realized that of 20 mils of rain fell in a short period around out of the driveway around the corner to hide we also have some other vaguely and optimistic calculations but I 'm not an engineer or though Peter tells me that I 'm pretty good at in 2004 to be raining and we went to be eaten we took one appeared through the curtains one last time to see how the river I 'd shifted the car but I was advised by my expert in the living room that I was definitely overreacting and there was no way the other one needed shifting more on their car lighter in the early hours of the morning it was dark and I went to a strange kind of sound and I thought what it is and I looked over and I could see the multi-ball wood sparking and I went oh my lord my fifteen twelve thirteen year old sandwich what and I heard him step out into the water and I thought please God don 't let this be life it wasn 't Aaron has got a slightly split-level visit were a small step up to a living space so we to that space and we put them on the steps and we waited for light because we looked outside and we could see that people 's fences mud floating past and our big log rings were also floating down our driveway we waited until it was safe to see so that we could walk out the children that seven year old and the nine year old they thought that was awesome fun and it was really good fun being carried out the 13 year old not so much the water smelt it stung in our legs and we had to dodge as I say large blocks of wood coming down the cat got floated out on the kayak it was all pretty sort of surreal experience after that it was a combination of needing to face our reality as well as a kind of combined disbelief that our house house have been flooded combined with the level of embarrassment and being ashamed that somehow we 've created this situation for ourselves it 's about it was about dealing with the reality of the moment attorney of the urgent the insurance and we didn 't know how long we 'd be out and I was amazed that Lysa Justice said we might be out for six weeks but I realize now he was just being kind because we didn 't absorb the magnitude of what we 're talking out just the logistics of explaining and negotiating our way through rental differences we hadn 't treated since we were students and cleaning out of the mess we remember the kindness of our friends and their neighbors who brought us who didn 't know us but brought us biscuits as we were cleaning out the street I remember getting cross at small things probably it was the sheer size of what was in front of us and the uncertainty of the future I remember getting frustrated when the insurance claim hingle it was questioning me about if it was truly necessary to throwing my children 's and water soaked pajamas out my response to her unkindly was to offer to beg up some of those pajamas with the sura g water and seeing them up to her to see if perhaps you 'd 't kind but it was sheer frustration most people in Christchurch know that insurance helps take the edge off but doesn 't cover the full cost and while some things get covered the mortgage continues you have to set up another house and paying for the other and it becomes an issue different people will have different advice different loss adjusters different claim handlers and it 's always hard to appreciate when yours isn 't as straightforward as theirs it certainly gave me an appreciation for what it must have been like for the foes and the September and February wakes who had to evacuate straightaway and the median aftermath it was the outside mists of duty nappies and toilet paper mixed with leaves and there under for insulation drive it lying around all over the garden in the driveway there 's no cover for the assistance for that you just have to do it yourself and we can 't_''_2837.099 be sure how long it 's going to take to sanitize because the Sun is the solution for killing the banks it was tiring but you needed to we wanted want to remove that memory the thing is it 's not just a one-off for us post flood the rest of the neighborhood have taken off the gummies once the floods receded and the novelty was over and it did for us too but the energy and stress levels required for everyday life to carry on at much higher our kids routines carry on as normal except for every time you get to a change of sports season that requires a two to three hour hunt for the tennis racket or the cricket box or the football boots one particular morning I realized just prior to the game that I actually throwing the boots out so that required a quick trip to rebel sport to buy brand new pier it 's an ongoing reminder and I we try not to feel reach Roma ties but mostly the children are saying that their mother was very grumpy as I tried to remember exactly those things we 're I remember at the time that I considered getting a t-shirt printed saying no we are not back in our house yet gosh it the water was contaminated no the insurance company won 't pay Teresa and nobody can 't afford the 180 K to do it ourselves yes I don 't know how we cope either once was supposed to be funny once we did shift back home five months later after all the usual repairs and challenges that they can 't face I don 't_''_2917.98 we developed a different set of behaviors some that we share with our Heathkit neighbors the deep underlying worry that 's brought on by forecast rain and what that might mean for us we assured the children would be fine just as they were starting to get anxious and told ourselves that wouldn 't happen again even though it had already flooded two times and the second time after the first while everybody else is getting out their umbrella or will be a raincoat we 're looking at nervously at the horizon Riverside dwellers and the Heath get they don 't have just one meet service bookmark they have to one for the two hourly rain forecast in the sick of run for the little turn tides the decision before we go to be it about if we 're going to shift the car or not and in the morning if the worst hasn 't happened we meet all our other neighbors kept bringing their cars back for around the corner '_''_2963.4 also we wake up through the night and we peer out the window to see if the water 's draining away and how high it is on the river we same time to take a dressing gown tripping gum boots and a torch to inspect the riverbank sometimes we do a midnight drive around to see how a level or River law Terrace mates are going just as an indicator of what might be coming away but the July floods mean that we 've had a rinse and repeat experiences that we ran out of a house again and this time ground thankfully it wasn 't dark but this time all the kids had to walk themselves out the youngest one boost into tears so the July flood confirmed what we suspected that we 'll keep on hitting nothing is done and we 're trapped to escape there 's a constant threesome nagging worry about what will happen next time what will happen with the insurance CFCs will they reinsure us that doesn 't go away that 's always the year we love came to bring just live here [Music] that the Heathkit experience is a hard inside we can only describe it for us but I know that other people are seriously affected even if they didn 't have a blood or flooding like us the pet issues with access to the driveway not being able to go to school to work not being able to give the Kazi and guaranted when the toilet toilet won 't flush or worse when it does flush and houses further overflows inside with hindsight I 've realized that our kids who are very very healthy were often more sick probably because of the contaminated underfloor insulation didn 't get deemed necessary to be replaced by the first repair the sewage a water it dries to a sandy film at best and as the cars drive past blow zone around us we 're really grateful for your time we really support the comprehensive review particularly to stop links as well and understand that it 's a jigsaw puzzle we 're worried about the time frame that these Texas fixers will take for us and I want you to come today to give you actually I drew the short straw to be for you and I want to the can I give you a lived experience of what it is the links to the all pie hole now Mohini we cannot write a cure thank you very much and from our perspective it 's not the short straw there is nothing more compelling than the lived experience so thank you very much for bringing that to the table and that will assist us in our deliberations thank you could I also invite Bruce cane and Sean Daly to come forward on the same subject good morning good morning my name is Bruce cane I 'm 91 found in tears I 'll obviously here also to speak about the hit Scott River I 'm speaking on behalf of 300 residents in that area who have signed the petition unfortunately we your meeting except I can 't present it but we will present it along with all the comments that people are made where we want the council to initiate a comprehensive maintenance and repair program in the lower hiss code for that there 's long term residents we have seen the effects of lack of a thorough wit program over the years ie like a river bank growth control this weed cutting sediment build-up from drains flowing the river to journal the latter of which has been greatly exacerbated by the buildup of liquefaction after nineteen twenty thousand ten and eleven earthquakes following the flooding in 2014 a number of houses along the river experienced over four flooding as the mayor as well or is you actually came to the house this is combined with contaminated water caused a huge problem for a number of residents since the time of that flooding a number of residents have attended Council initiated meetings and have been repeatedly given every reason Under the Sun as to what is causing these problems one in the hundred year storm particularly high tide spring tides heavy that dredging was not the answer however we 're delighted to see that dredging is now our preferred option but that alone won 't solve the problem especially as now the residents along the history are having a similar problems along terilyn Terrace there are a number of gutter drains which overflow really do two backflips not doing the job they were designed to through lack of maintenance maybe but when the question one way check fellows raised no one seemed to know too much about them despite the council having them fitted in South Brighton on outlets that flow into the eastery following the latest flooding in July this year it became very obvious that the holding ponds in the sparked Henderson Road area were completely inadequate for the purpose of which they were designed we experienced over the knee flooding through our property while the river was well below breaching its banks then river the water came from the obviously from things then through the rail bridge down the footpath up on the river side over the knee through it inside a cow I 've lost two cows estream factory she was not able to deal with the water flowing this course completely is complete new problems something that I never experienced while living on the edge of the eastery for a number of years again building stop banks does not stop the flooding but accept that there 's a genuine need we appreciate that the councillors talking about buying out or raising affected has us this will not stop flooding most residents living on the river industry have done so for a lifestyle the stress of not knowing when the next episode will occur has taken the glossary of our lifestyle and taken much of the pleasure of living on the water way away from many of us and this this on both sides of the river all the way down we 've been told by it we 've had every excuse under the Sun why it can 't_''_3337.67 be done but now it was I said we are grateful that you are going to the lease we approve you at least start on a dredging program because it 's not it doesn 't take very it bridge and have a look at the river when it 's at low tide what 's causing your problems thanks yeah I 'd like to start by thanking you for allowing us to speak today and July when the hit that River flooded I rang the council three times and one day for concerns about the river flooding into my property each time I was told that 's being monitored and we don 't believe it will flood after giving my address no one did no one visited the proper the flooding result of me having to go into a temporary accommodation and my pets being put into boarding kennels for four months this plus the storage costs for my contents means I have no contents insurance left to cover the 7,000 worth of contents that I 've lost my insurance covers not the fault of the council but it adds to the stress and anxiety and an exact things I see that many of the other residents live with on a day-to-day basis every time it rains for a few days I have to set my alarm for high and check that the road isn 't flooding people make jokes about needing a boat to get out but it 's stressed like this after all the earthquakes and previous Lovings that we don 't need when the interior walls were pulled off in my property and there appears there was nothing but mold and rotten wood behind the job which I 've been living in for years which to me means repairs are not being done correctly after talking to a few other residents that is apparent that people are after different outcomes when it comes to the option of lifting or buying houses if the answer is to buy houses I ask how will the council decide a property 's worth as a real estate agent that does a lot of work in this area this year I 've sold two houses in Clarendon Terrace one before the floods which reached 35,000 above Givi and one after the recent floods which was thirty thousand thirty five thousand dollars below Givi both properties were presented really beautifully and this is just confusing people that want to buy into the ask is that you communicate with those of us that are affected either one on one or in a smaller meeting environment so we can all be heard thank you thank you do you have your petition with you usually because I 'm I 'm quite happy to move that we suspend that particular standing order so that we can receive the petition what people didn 't generally quite happy with that you 've got to second that motion so can you get you 've got the wording there hem and show that the council suspends standing order 13.1 and agree to receive the petition so that 's moved by me seconded by Sarah of what that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carry so said the petition is able to be received so would you like to read the prayer of the petition and and and present those as well the background preamble residents and businesses on the route and Heathcoat River should not have to feel fear and anxiety they will lose their homes and property or that they will not be able the short and safe with the recent increase in risk of flooding due to earthquake damage and ongoing for River and drainage maintenance along the intense long with intensive residential development and the lower port Hills residents and businesses have now reached the crisis point is imperative that the Scotia City Council takes immediate steps to remove the salt build-up from the river and start an effective River maintenance and dredging program including fixing and maintaining stop banks and the stalling one way check valves the petition text says we the undersigned request or any City Council to take action with the recent increased risk of flooding around the earth there 's imperative they exactly what I said before take them to reduce Newser appears there 's 300 signatures on the this is from local people there 's a copy of there they all knew it we also have a a list of people 's comments which unfortunately we only got one off but but it 's it 's only add we have the support of our local MP Spota Williams Ruth Dyson Megan woods they will sign we are much alright we 'll look I 'm this door a couple of minutes there wood has anyone got any questions that they 'd like to and Pauline but when you mentioned it Nestle plugin to make some policy price to Heathkit you will be very much one-on-one discussions is we didn 't flopped and that 's a very personal matter and the staff are very sensitive to that in the way they conducted it and flopped and then was very good so I think you can rest assure that will be the case yeah one of the follow-up sort of things to that is that when the decision was made by the council to purchase some of the flopped on properties the idea was was that when the additional works were completed that the land itself because it would be cleared these were below the finished floor levels required for the new district plan and the flood vulnerability that existed that we were able to sell that land an order that people could build it the higher furnished floor levels so I mean we 're never going to fail to what worries me is that the one on 100 is going to become the one on 50 the one and ten potentially with sea level rise over over the next well long time after I 'm gone so but you know so that that there are a variety of challenges there will confront the city for a long time hints but the issue is that we were able to put some of that land back on the market which is the answer to the question about if the if the houses are below the finished floor levels and I think we 've Webb 's and I certainly saw examples when I came out in 2014 of where the floor levels actually were reduced in order to rebalance the house which was a crazy thing to do next to a rubber I understand that yeah yeah well appreciate appreciate that point that we 're trying to make so one of the points I 'm trying to make is the even the new houses are being built on parenting tears at the moment with a higher foundation yeah still doesn 't stop I know and that 's that 's that issue about what what we can do in terms of the river itself yeah thank you very much thank you very much and and appreciate you bringing the petition as well okay right now we move on to the Midway Street footbridge deputations and I 'd like to invite even smoke Leanne Curtis and torment really this is an item 47 which is on the supplementary agenda [Music] [Music] yeah look there I thinking on my next accurate Oh toto my name is Evan Smiths and Heather my Tamagotchi and me and Curtis on my left we 're not just as we 're being portrayed in the media a couple of former residents with precious development of twisted metal we 're here is former community leaders of the Aben side and Richmond Riverside earthquake recovery community groups we became founding members of ten soon and we 're here because we are concerned and we continue to work in earthquake recovery work you 'll be aware where the Midway Street Bridge at the end of is where it was located in the Midway connected the two communities together September to the 4th 2010 the very first earthquake that bridge got entirely what was called munted became the iconic graphic portrayal of the power and impact of the earthquakes and immediately disconnected the two sides of the river Haven side with Richmond Riverside it became a constant reminder in our face to those of us living along that Riverside on both sides of the river and in those communities it had an immediate impact on the communities kids can no longer get to school and there 's many kids many schools in their area intermediate primary and high schools access to shops was prevented because we went across the river across that footbridge it 's where we meet each other it 's where we went across to see our friends on the other side it was also the amenity that we used to the the bridge we used to to appreciate the immunity in the area I used just to keep fit by cycling to brighten them back across that bridge and on the pass every day that doesn 't happen anymore we use further damaged in Brittany 2011 to the extent you see there portrayed in June 2011 the read zoning decisions took place the bridge became a rallying point it 's the point where we alerted the city to the iniquities of the redzone offer that offers enter the insurance and st. EQC processes the mayor herself was party to those rallies and spoke from those platforms and 2012 we in the communities not Council not Stuart engaged with those communities to see what they fear views were on the bridge in the future use of that bridge we had 150 respondents to an online survey that we conducted simply two percent wanted the bridge put in storage until it could be reinstated the same location as a commemorative structure in the future nine percent wanted it retained in suits you as a commemorative structure right here and then the other 19 percent were still dealing with the raw image of it in their face and they were still dealing with rubberneckers they were still dealing with the threat to the depreciation on their property values when they thought they 're still that engagement happened with us council and skirt have never engaged on the bridge to date and at least to be clear that that engagement that 's referred to in the report is actually our engagement community 's engagement in freebie 2013 Stewart uplifted it and cut it into three and transported it to ferry meet at our request and kept it in storage we didn 't have any choice about it being transported and uplifted we didn 't have any choice about it being curtain three we were told that 's what it was was to be in those days were spirit there was somewhere expediency and health and safety and this was a take it or leave it but at least for us it was put in storage and it was saved for in the future premature 22nd from 2011 onwards it became a memorial site a place for the river of flowers commemorate we 're the community 's regathered that had dissolved and distributed throughout Christchurch Greater Christchurch and New Zealand 's people came together people Trent travelled from now so in the places like that to important to many many people and it 's not something that gets taken lightly we heard recently that it was going to be scrapped and only the intervention of get Fuller has stopped that from happening it should never have been going down that path the real consensus then from the locals is that the bridge should be kept in storage and uses a commemorative structure in the future at that location and we want that recognized so there is you know there is this idea that I 'm part of it can be because has been cut into three part of it can be used in the city forget fuller we 're not I 'm opposed to transitional use for it but the cut the the thing that stressed us out is that the first time it would come out would be in the city and it actually belongs in the East and belongs in the East because it 's not just a photographic structure it 's not just a piece of metal that shows the power of the earthquake for us it was the connector it 's one the East that we wanted to hold on to and we 're able to save the assets have been stripped have been demolished everything comes into the city we get the idea as to pull people in the city and we 're good but there but the East was our place and we 've all had to leave it so for us the bridge is huge I can go back in in there and one day go back and wave inside and the bridge that connected my house my neighbor 's houses to even 's place to Tom 's place will be back there in some form yet to be decided by the community so anything that looks to put that secondary to chucking it in there and the CBD is is is the thing that 's got our crore so you know we 've been living with we 've been working hard over the last couple of days because there is as much notice by chance as we have got that this was going transitional youths in the city we 've worked hard we look for solutions our background about sitting at the table so there 's a couple of things in there we need you to know that if it is to go in the city it also needs to go back in the East so what we are going to be asking for is an absolute commitment to facilitating it in a transitional way in the beginning to go back where it should be part of it eventually with a mind for it being a final structure all three parts pulled back together because and that needs to be where it is and the community needs to be the deciders of how and what that looks like because we need to be able to reconnect with that place even though we live scattered across Canterbury so that 's that 's one of the things there the other thing and this is really shooting something across the bow it is a reminder that everybody here has utterly failed again in the community consultation space there are so many of you that are sitting around here that knew our numbers you knew that we lived there you knew that trauma if you want to call it that that it has been to move away and yet it doesn 't occur to anybody that when it came up that the structure could be used that you might say hang on there were whole communities of people there that cared maybe we should ask the question has anybody gone back and talked to those people it 's not the new communities that are important but just because we 're disbanded communities doesn 't mean that we weren 't important so it is shooting across the bow you have an ongoing commitment to ask the question who should we be talking to who should you be talking to before you bring this to us and it didn 't happen it 's not just you it 's regenerate it 's all of the recovery agencies that I hear don 't assume that because the community is not still there it doesn 't care it cares we are the holders of the knowledge at that time we 've got the knowledge we 've got the knowledge that the council and skirt didn 't at and I actually want you to feel slightly frustrated at that that you assumed that you could make this decision and it would be a positive for the city because doesn 't everybody want to see this piece come back but you didn 't think what are the sensitivities around there are the things that we should think of that are not going to be right now hid so don 't let that happen don 't let it happen again when you are making decisions around moving forward you have to look back who do we look back to I mean it 's kind of lucky that we 're still here there are lots of other people that were involved at the time did you mind if to work a little harder to track down but take the effort to trick them jump yeah if I may Thank You Mia the bridge for me was when I was well the 19 percent that assumes a bridge should go and disappear because it really hurt to see it like it was and see what it had done to our community I decisions and said that the bridge should go I don 't think I 've had so many vitriolic emails from my family and my life telling me that I was wrong when the bridge needed to be remembered and stayed in some shape or form it 's a place the bridge would may have been just the connector but underneath that bridges a number of you now know that was a weir that was the year and that we are a young child Trent and that 's why that bridge ended up been there so it 's far more than just a bridge it 's a memory of what happened in the past the ERISA funny things which I think we should at allude to I have three sons one of them came home absolutely dropping head to foot I said to him what did you do and he said ah I jumped off the bridge why I just want to see what was like so he and he was at school at the time but that 's what they kept this what kid stood on that bridge and it was a place to go to it 's been now drawn up by one of my other sons there 's a picture on the wall at home to remind us where we used to live so it 's a very emotional thing but at the same time it 's also from my business pragmatic point of view and a mess of piece of engineering learning that could be used at some stage in the future where people can look at that and say wolf the river moves that much and it was the banks on each side so whatever comes out of this I think we 've got to remember that the bridge at the moment is in three pieces we have the opportunity to divide two of those pieces into temporary memorials but use the middle piece as the heart to pull the whole bridge together hopefully back as close as possible to the location that used to be in thank you you know I think the the pointers as well made you know that in terms of process I think that there has been a bit of a right community 's been engaged in the process I 'm hoping that we can find a way forward and there could you just go to the new resolutions that we 've been working on I 'm going to invite Ryan Reynolds to come forward I 'm afraid I have to go so I 'm gonna allow Andrew to take over the chair but the idea is to add a couple of resolutions to the existing one which would enable the temporary proposal to go ahead plus investigate with urgency and in collaboration with regenerate crush that she needs to save regenerate christchurch sorry i just was writing my own shorthand and community stakeholders a transitional structure utilizing another element of the Midway bridgett its original vocation and provide a report to the relevant end of May 2013 that 's sort of putting a six month time frame on it so it 's quick and Amir provide a letter of support for any application to external funding bodies to enable the transitional project to proceed so and it 's that 's an indication of our willingness to work collaboratively with the as accepted as the legend on both the transitional facility in the city and this one truly reflects the views of the community so thank you I know that it was brought to you at short notice it was brought to us at short notice as well because I don 't think anyone had really thought through what the ownership was and then who the responsibility lay with in terms of the engagement so thank you very much for working so hard so fast and enabling us to potentially find a solution here today could I invite Ryan to come forward and I 'm sorry but I 'm going to have to Ryan good morning and welcome to the table thanks for joining us I see you know Carter um I think probably most of you have heard a little bit at least about the work that we 're doing in relation to the east frame and so just a quick background about 18 months ago now we were gap filler was engaged by Fletcher living to do some work putting together a strategy sort of program for how they 's awaiting development at that time we did a lot of engagement with all of the inner city residents associations and one of the biggest concerns we heard was that the new neighborhood is not going to acknowledge the history or indeed the present of of the place that there 's actually still a neighborhood there and there has been a neighborhood there for a long time and so we 've been looking for ways through the work that we 're doing to integrate some of the existing community and those stories so we 've got too far a Roy motto the inner city East residents Association were actually paying them to take on a role in the East frame actually his parking attendants Etobicoke sued Oxford Terrace Baptist Church taking on custodial roles in the area and actually resourcing them to do so out of out of our program just to actually integrate what we 're doing with the existing community so at that time 18 months ago it was clear to us that um telling stories from the area was just really vital so we engaged with the looked for any way possible to and to bring stories to light through this through the work that we 've been doing at that time Brendan head of the council heritage team made an unexpected offer he said council had a warehouse out in ferry mead of recovered bits of buildings from the area that we could incorporate into some of our projects we talked to him specifically about a mini-golf course so to be clear this was a pre-existing agreement between a mini-golf company and I believe the crown that they could use some of the east rain land to put a mini golf course in there purely purely a commercial operation and it was our feeling that we could get a better outcome out of this and so we were in a strange position where we could actually require them to have a heritage themed mini-golf course and to take the advice of counsel heritage team and heritage New Zealand on what objects to include in the mini golf course what stories to bring to light through that so every hole in the mini golf course is telling historical significance so that he played mini golf but somehow you learn a bit about the the past and present of that neighborhood and heritage New Zealand have curated all the stories and made the recommendations there so fast forward to this year and six months ago in June we visited the ferry Mead facility along with council heritage team and heritage New Zealand to receive their advice on what objects were potentially available what would be suitable what would be unsuitable for our purposes and outside the storage facility we saw the three pieces of the midway street footbridge sitting covered in feces and growing weeds around it and so on and inquired what was going on there so the Heritage team said it actually wasn 't their business but they looked into it discovered that it was a transport team we engaged with the transport team actually have written correspondence that they were they were working through plans to dispose of the asset so we put in a request to make temporary use of one section that was as far as we were concerned approved in late September golf course to accommodate that so the ramps already been built the footings for the bridge have been there for about six or eight weeks also in September we had contact with regenerate christchurch the residential red zone team they indicated to us that there were two comments in their community consultation regarding the importance of the midway street footbridge to community identity that there were possible plans for a permanent memorial incorporating the bridge but that was several years away and they advised that our proposal quote sounds like a really really positive way of reusing the damaged structure while its long-term future is uncertain cece didn 't several others in the organization on that advice and we never heard anything further so assumed that we 'd kind of don 't know dude due diligence there and so just to be clear that the course is under construction and actually almost complete the the bridge is meant to be kind of the centerpiece of the course the footings and everything for it were constructed six or eight weeks ago the hope was to get it open in time for 'll we 'll see how rico the first I heard that there were genuine community concerns was when the council agenda was made public and I discovered that it was a public thing in a full council forum it makes me feel awful I think that we 've in some way hurt some of these people who are indeed you know some of my city heroes post-quake and that 's certainly you know people whose opinions I really value on all sorts of matters not just in this particular one and you know I 've been beating myself up about that a little bit that we haven 't engaged better with them but in the same voice I think I have to share what Leanne Curtis said that actually this is what the public agencies and advisers are for I don 't think we can possibly be expected to engage with every former Central City resident or worker whether anyone might object to us using a piece of golf house in this way that 's why we engage with the Heritage team we received their advice on what pieces were things that weren 't suitable because the previous building owner wouldn 't be happy with it etc and and so too with the Midway Street bridge I mean I I feel like we we kind of did did our due diligence there and it has been a bit of a failure of the the public so I think that 's enough for me all right Thank You Ryan for the for the background I guess yeah questions on the mini golf project itself would be best directed to Ryan but then I would invite our own staff to the table so that we can ask questions on the paper and then we 'll proceed to debate so I mean really the questions for Ryan will be just on the project and the proposed use of the bridge within the project so Deon Glen Sarah yeah I mean the first I knew of the mini-golf thing was actually a week ago did see it being built but what 's the is it gonna be pay to use yes did so it 's actually going to be a pay to use so interact with it all we have to pay for it that 's right and that was a pre-existing agreement between the mini-golf providers in the crown and what we 've managed to arrange is that there 's this heritage component and that a percentage of the site license fee that they 're paying goes directly into more community activities in the area and they 're paying the crown to use the land they have a license agreement with the crown and there 's a fee associated with that yeah Glen thank you I think morning Ryan I think in some ways you know Christmas is used as an artificial deadline right or ahem you know around the community so what is the rush 5.6 of the report talks about due to open before Christmas I mean everyone wants everything done by Christmas so it would be any need that are really you know whatever happens needs to be done by the um from my personal perspective no to be clear this is a third party that 's actually building and operating the course they 've already spent I 'm not cost to actually construct the course is eighty to a hundred thousand dollars they only have a temporary use of the site so if the numbers to stack up for them to invest that much to put a community amenity in that area I mean they were expecting to be open already and certainly that I mean you know from their perspective yeah they 're banking on the school holiday trade etc so um that 's the rush from from their perspective yeah Thank You Sara Thanks I think that you 're right that they 're telling the stories thing is really important you mentioned that each of the holes would have sort of a different story what sort of signage and going around the the bridge if you 've got any idea of what the so the interpretation signage or the story around the bridge is going to be yet so we 've got something like a 12 or 15 page document from heritage New Zealand where they made recommendations for all the different stories that we should bring to light and and bits of Heritage material that we the idea is and and when the Medway Street footbridge and was was offered they curated a story around that so we do have you know material prepared by the experts and that 's gonna go on signage so every hole will tell a story there subsequently we 've talked to Evan in Liana and others and they said actually they would like to write the story themselves or have that community write the story and we 're entirely happy with that in fact happier with that than the current situation great bearing in mind that Ryan 's was a deputation I 'll just allow two more questions one from Pauline one from Yanni and then we 'll bring staff to the table of proceeding kind of a question but it 's also recognizing that you virtually apologize for something that really wasn 't in fault but I think actually more the point out of this is that if we should thank you because if you hadn 't gone out there it sounds like that bridge was at risk of being disposed of and it just brings to my mind that there 's no risk to anything else out there this needs to be some kind of transparency if something is going to be disposed or perhaps we should know about that 's my conceit yeah I mean overstepping my bounds a little bit it 's been my experience that a lot of the Heritage material that 's been recovered in its in that facility is down to one staff member who went in his own time and just picked up bits of buildings off the ground as they were being demolished and threw them in the back of his ute so the team is not resourced well enough to actually do that particular job on wondering whether there 's something we could add to this resolution that asks for when we come to consider it that asks for maybe a list of or catalogue of heritage items which have been recovered and stored so that we can then work out how we might want to deal with those one of the things that 's come out of this set of conversations that we 've had this morning already is previously lived beside it and around it there may well be other items that have got equal importance to other communities that we need to be and should be aware of so yeah it 's a good point maybe have a think about some wording that we could add to this resolution to ask for an additional piece of work to be done and finally Yanni okay thank you Ron for coming just if we choose not to use part of the bridge then what does that do to you to the project and the second question is have you discussed the amended resolutions with the communities that have come and talked to us today around their agreement with a way forward yeah so I I it took a took a bit of doing but I found out who was who else was making a deputation in advance and rang Devon yesterday and we 've been working since yesterday and frantically this morning to come to an agreement that would be happy for both of us so yeah we worked through that and along with the mayor early this morning we were of a mind not to grant permission to use it then what what would that mean for your project I actually can 't quite answer that because there 's this third-party operator who 's actually constructing I mean I would say we 'd have to get some more earthworks happening on the site undo the footings that have already been built and redesigned some aspects of the course and it may or may not open a couple months from now for me to answer that sorry thank you very much and thanks very much iron indeed for the deputation friend for your answers to those questions as well it 's been very useful thank you very much so now if I could invite staff to the table Lynette and Richard I think you 're here for this item _"

  {
    "text": "final item to deal with on the open agenda which is item 28 the proposed Red Cliff school relocation council response on proposal to use section 71 of the greater Christchurch regeneration act so we 've already had a briefing on this matter Richard was there anything that you wanted to tell us by way of opening comments and no further matters than which list at the briefing mr. chair other than what you have in front of you as a draft response on a draft proposal by a regenerate Christchurch on behalf of the Ministry of Education essentially to use a section of the great Christchurch regeneration act to really I guess give effect to the land swap proposal that council early agreed to relocate the width of school from the existing site to the reakless park and to rezone the existing group of school to open space so that can be used for a park itself the key issues are well traversed both in the report and in the draft feedback and we 've briefed you on those and they really to our minds relate to the flooding management area which sits over the site transport and I guess what could be broadly turned is the amenity concerns around light spill and noise so when does this letter need to be on when does this response need to be lodged with regenerate Christchurch so the response needs to be lodged by the 21st of November and this was the last council meeting prior to that date okay that 's great let 's move into questions then Sara thank you yeah for the 71 privacy so in terms of section 71 we provide our comments to regenerate christchurch they will then either modify the proposal as well the other strategic partners they will then modify the proposal as they see fit based on the feedback that they received they will then provide that to the minister the revised section 71 the minister will then decide whether to proceed within 30 working days in terms of notification having particular regard to the views of the strategic partners such as ourselves and if the minister does decide to proceed with the proposal then she must publish a public notice that would then once that public comment has been received and the minister has another 30 working days within which to make her decision so I think the broad time frame would probably kick in to around the middle of next year it 'll be notified this year because of the the hazards in the year and while the ministry of education were very clear through the lancelot process that they had done their due diligence and that they put the site was eminently suitable for a school should the section 71 proposal go through its process and then actually people decide it 's not a suitable site for a school that leads the school itself in a very precarious position and the ministry really clear early on that they wouldn 't dispose of the old school until things have been finalized and you don 't know that they 're planning demolition instead of early in next year so what I 'd really like us for us to do is actually as part of this request that the demolition on site doesn 't proceed until we have final confirmation that indeed a they will then leave the community with more Susan should things you know more options for things not go as planned so if we phrased that as a question the questions Richard would be if that was what we wanted to achieve how would we go about doing that is that something that 's appropriate to put in this response or would we deal with it in a different way not in the response to regenerate that I think is an additional we could request the Ministry of Education well the response does seek to both designate the existing reakless Park site for educational purposes as well as change the zoning of the existing reclip school site to open space purposes so if there is concerns to my mind if there is concerns about remove rule buildings on that site on the existing reclip school site prior to this process having been finalized it would be something that we could raise in our feedback to regenerate clusters member regenerate christchurch are only doing this on behalf of the Ministry of Education because they have the ability to do so under put an addition and the which refers to that issue and to the draft submission yeah and I think I can in my view certainly is that that would be reasonable and helpful okay yani yeah question and prior to the meeting I 'm not sure we got a response but there 's a number of Appendix that 's that that are referred to that we haven 't seen so I 'm just wondering whether staff have seen those and without seeing then how can we put a submission if so we did get that request yesterday and we put a request through to regenerate Christ returned to the Ministry of Education for us to circulate those we had a response back from region that they were comfortable with it but they want to check with the ministry we 're yet to receive something from the ministry so hence the reason why we didn 't circulate them but we 've we 've saved them we 've received them we 've reviewed them this stage of it that 's a bit awkward for us isn 't it like you know I to be a sort of independent body and I 'm a bit worried about Ministry of Education having sort of undue influence over what can be seen and what can 't what 's behind that I I just think it was just a timing issue as far as I 'm concerned it was just light and the pace and they probably haven 't had an opportunity to respond yet only came through yesterday afternoon I think the request and we immediately went through to them very soon after they just want to check with the ministry that it was okay and thus far we haven 't received there 's no more donation it 's a lot of information for us to digest even if we had it when we only got the agenda two days ago and and look I think that 's the nature of the regeneration nectar does sit very tight timeframes we 've had six weeks and within which to respond to what is quite a complex proposal given particularly given that the transport and hazard issues associated with the site so we first received this about meeting next week we 've had to turn around our response pretty quickly so the nature of the timeframes set out in the act and gives us no choice but to really provide counsel with late reports otherwise we 've missed that for six weeks with them which we have to respond just the final question for mayors around we got initial advice and you 've just said it 's complex and the the decision about whether it 's a regen plan whether it 's a section 71 change to the district plan mm-hmm what who makes that decision and have you given given that is complex and there 's lots of information and there 's a number of things that people may wish to see like the community might actually wish to see some of the information behind the proposal how how have we come to this in terms of this process rather than those than the region plan which would give more information so that that 's the decision of the proponent so the proponent decided to progress with a section 71 proposal as opposed to a region council staff perspective that that was the appropriate way forward that its suits a section 71 so we 're comfortable with the way they 've proceeded Thank You Phil and I might ask this question last time we looked at this and so forgive me if I did but I 'm just around the high hazard area in terms of annandale risk of inundation so I presume that we just saw the first copy of the Tonkin Taylor report earlier this week but I presume that during this process you 've had this stuff we 've seen the drafts of that report or that in fact what I wanted to make sure this has all the information around this part of the Sumner has that all been taking into account the Newton container information so we 've had a variety that as you 'd be aware if I just stick back at a while that there was a land swap process which which council made a decision on and that wasn 't the appropriate place to raise planning issues then the the Greater Christchurch regeneration eck process was was the meetings with both regenerate and the Ministry of Education on this matter for some time we certainly made them aware of our concerns and relation to the a flood management area and the high flood hazard management area there was a meeting last week with their representatives and Water Resources engineers and I think the outcome of that was that they are they are certainly going to go away and do some through the work on this issue and I don 't think that the information and draft feedback will come as a surprise to them given that we 've raised this for some time so given our role as a strategic partner as to provide them with feedback on their proposal to us it 's incumbent upon them both regenerate and the Ministry of Education to go away and do the work on the risks associated with the high flood hazard management area and flood management area overlay so that 's it within our district plan yeah that 's what the the the draft feedback really ceases we don 't think you 've canvassed this thoroughly enough and you know I 'm aware do we know the approximate difference in height between the lower part of the field and the upper part we in fact the school would be built do we know the approximate difference in height I don 't the terraces is reasonably narrow but but it certainly does dip down some way to the lower area but but I can 't tell you what the difference in height is okay would you just sing what one one pad is sort of in a few safe and another part unsafe well I I think the lower part of the site is very low and as a catchment for I guess rainfall ponding and the area and back in 2014 when we had the event there was certainly a large amount of water on the site which came from rainfall runoff but the site is also subject to tidal flooding as well as we have climate change and sea level rise so there 's there 's two potential contributors to the flooding issue there like at one stage Minister vide their whole policy in terms of clatter of so as school rolls change they shift to different parts you know they were pretty temporary type of arrangements you could almost wonder in fact if when they go if the proceeds if in fact that might be a solution and in fact you you don 't put a permanent brick structure and then we would they go to so just thinking of where we 're at in this process village there 's something that you would want added into this response which isn 't there to reflect the concerns that you 've expressed through the questions probably just don 't know I just wonder if we should also note those concerns which staff have raised or is it is it already included in what we 're saying this is another recommendation well the staff have been I 'm sure but I just wondered if what I just want to check the recommendations if we are including that we know so well in page five of the letter to regenerate Christchurch there are a number of comments about the the flooding and the distance from the mean high water springs that you 've raised to say well it 's just a matter of litigation was that with the staff to happy that that is included and the later or within fact we also noted in our recommendations as absolutely crystal care clear rather than being you know further down on a report well we 're part of a process at the moment which is to provide a response to regenerate Christchurch on the proposal so anything that we want regenerate Christchurch to know should be in that response there are some comments in the response about flooding the question really is how we come for with the way that the concerns about flooding have been expressed in the response or do we want to strengthen this us passing what 's essentially an internal resolution without changing the contents of the letter isn 't going to an of itself change what we are communicating to regenerate Christchurch if there are things that we want noted that aren 't already in the response then we should be adding them if we 're happy with what 's in the response then we 've reading it my impression was that the staff had written it very clearly and I guess though as as laypeople if you like and not sort of part of the organisation I would have worded it more strongly but it 's just perhaps a matter of I don 't want to become a matter of semantics I mean this is just our initial feedback as well it 's not our formal feedback as a council on the actual proposal this is just a feedback on the draft so if it 's not strong enough when it comes with me at your proposal maybe it 's the point that we make it so if we frame this as a question to staff given Richard what you 've heard from film is there the potential to strengthen our response or do you believe that the response covers those items that fellows raised and are they covered in the response there 's always the potential to strengthen it but I 'd suggest the place to do that would be in the draft feedback itself so if you 're uncomfortable with the wording we recommend to you that an additional resolution that 's placed in the report yeah indeed you 're comfortable with that inserted all right great are there any further questions all right so could I have a mover for the recommendations that are in France it was Sarah seconded Mike and is there any debate all right so I 'll put the motion all those in favor aye against that 's carried _"

    "text": "thank you very much it 's very worthwhile all right now we move on to Linwood central deathcap Community Board reports le welcome thank you very much beyond cancerous we 've got a whole list of things up here probably just read them all fairy meat as up there we have to ask to see the Fermi development plan and as a board would like to see part of the taliking village site become a dog park and we 'd like to see how we could incorporate that and to the use of that land their reckless meter of school we had a visit of the community board to the site with staff and some residents to see what buildings could be or should be retained and the board has asked how big cliffs residents Association can be involved in this process staff are saying is that we need quite a lot of land here for the plane feels to be reinstated from the other site over to year yeah some buildings here which would be really good as community buildings will stern playground and yeah the consultation was finished board and the report back to the board soon some of the meeting rooms so got some names now and we 've also been very involved and a con rotation and meetings over the flooding and his cat as was brought up with one of the other boards as we have all of the lower has kept in our area and we 'd like to know more about the dredging in this area as well as you know a most significant project as the Linwood Woolston Aquatic Center and as you can see from the slide we are really committed to a 2019 opening of this facility except with what was put out to the public in the 2015 2025 LTP we see this facility as the biggest thing that could boost our Linwood the power walleston Phillips town iskut Sumner community as well as parts of the other neighboring communities of Hillsborough and some Martin 's we don 't see it as competing with the Metro SportsCenter as it 's a completely different type of facility and aimed at a different audience we think that comparing this facility to playground to a little neighborhood park of us swings insights in so we just feel that this is not an competition with the Metro sport center we are seeking to get delegation from the council for the consultation site selection and the initial concept design as we feel that we in the other groups that we will consult are very good ideas on this and given that we 've had presentations and briefs briefings on the concept design in the site selection we feel that we need to start the consultation as soon as possible so we can use the events in our area over the summer to the salt the community we really want the council to expedite this and get staff to bring it back to the November council meeting we just feel that we 've been fogged off for all your time with this facility and it 's the biggest thing with kick going in our area to make a big difference in a very poor area so this coming up after this and regarding that issue we 've got here the people without homes and of always a big issue and hopefully this draft cut Community Partnership proposal all make a big difference the bombing processing plant odor issues and this includes also cholita they 're planted talita these are ongoing problems in our area and we are waiting to hear back from again as to the revised conditions that they 're supposed to be putting in place at the Julito factory we 've asked staff to write to the parent company in Europe as jalisa of now had years to reduce their odors the bromley processing plant living earth there 's supposed to be a group coordinator but II can that 's supposed to meet and it 's got council representation I think it 's staff only I 'm not sure elected members on that and they 're supposed to meet once a month but they now have not met for several months and we get regular emails and calls very odors from living earth so would really like some follow up on this and find out why this meeting hasn 't happened but this will probably come to the next it will come to did talk about on Monday the alcohol ban in a new Maryland would know this is an audio agenda this is a heads-up for what 's coming we had a whole lot of people come to our open forum on Monday because the police had just a bit a letter the residents saying they want to look a bit in the Lynwood Village area the residents are really fearful because there 's all the shouting and fighting and abusive behavior and rubbish and threats and things going on and then a man alone with village area around or Alaska Park the residents are very supportive of a liquor being and the we as a board are very supportive of a liquor ban because we tried to get it before and now we have the police support the find us it is not just about liquor but it 's also about synthetic drugs and the recommendations to get this in place will come through to the next council meeting it would really push it if you can expedite this so we could have this in place as soon as possible we to try and get it in place quicker in the end this is only just one tool for the police and we need the other tools before the places will the regenerate Christchurch in sorry Roy matter they come up also with ways of dealing with the problems here yeah and we had a visit from Kyle talking about the tiny house movement and we are very supportive of this in the redzone north central city as well and we 'd like to ask council how they can progresses given that they seem to have to go through the whole process of being looked at as a permanent build which they 're not so I 'm just wondering here and you know how helpful we are bend towards that type of situation where it 's actually a mobile home in actual fact this one last thing where as a boarder very concerned about even another license off license application and fury road there are 16 other off licenses in this very area so we will be supporting that residents and their submission as we can do as a board against got more than any other area of the city in one small area thank you and we 've got to come to her we 've got air all one to come up big lien wants to ask about the tiny houses because I suspect that your subcommittee could have a look at that oh so Kyle 's coming to door presentation okay so Carl 's going to do a presentation to Glenn 's subcommittee tomorrow so that 's an opportunity to get the the kind of report and and and you 'll be able to see what comes out of that yeah I think I should take note too about how hard it is to get anything but it may well be that the consenting side of it can be resolved at the same time Dave and then just a couple of questions one one around your community board decisions under delegation where you made a contribution to fixing leaks and the pool is that the pool on the on the foreshore terrible something different and secondly just to make a comment about the tiny houses that it is quite I recall an issue that I think it did actually horizon in your ward a year or so ago where a tiny house was installed and it was put to close to the boundary and on the basis that it was a temporary house they did that and then they got caught up and and some of the building can sense things so they simply put wheels on it to avoid some of the building consent issues it became a mobile home so while sir I 'm supportive of the concept of the tiny homes there is this gray area in what is a mobile home and what is actually a tiny home so we need to be quite clear crystal clear in their consenting sort of things as to how these things are to be set up because some people have been using the mobile nature of mobile of tiny homes to circumvent some of the building regulations and that one was a point in case where they plot that virtually right on the boundary so I think you know a great concept these tiny homes and there is the consenting and building requirements properly to get these things the style of housing approved in a proper manner that is it 's just not going to be simply a case I will just check a couple of wheels on it and then we can circumvent quite a lot of the building regulations so that 's the point that I 'd like to make that we we need to get I think it might be mainly grain water and the kitchen rule just gotta suss those yeah this happen yeah I 'm not over it completely but I do recall wasn 't Peter sparrows time when he was here that there was quite a discussion around around this particular tiny home and Herrick complied so I 'm not sure and I think it would probably be good to get the only ray to just clarify where we 're at with those sort of well you 're the chair of the committee so so it came to your committee about a year and a bit ago yeah so I 'm intrigued that no workers yet happened and so that when because I 'm sure there has been clarifications and in the building consenting unit about how this how these tiny homes should establish thanks please can we make sure that the building consenting people are at the housing subcommittee tomorrow and then can we have a timeline from Riggs and consents about when the council will be clear about the rules for tiny houses because we have asked with us a good year and a better go and we are taking a really long time if it can 't_''_777.24 be done it can 't_''_777.99 be done but just tell us that it can 't_''_779.58 be done well it 's never been a piece of work that 's been asked there maybe have been asked of staff that I 'm certainly haven 't_''_787.56 happy to Buster the I think he 's he 's thinking maybe they aren 't too many issues but there is a meeting happening tomorrow and you know I don 't know that you have to have the consenting people there as long as you as long as you follow up and have a and connectin with what those that there 's the proper channel for the for the work to be done yeah yeah okay so to that I mean this is an issue that 's come up repeatedly around the organization 's capacity to do things so this should be a strategy in planning work program that would include these sorts of things in a prioritization so that we as elected members know what we 've asked for and what 's being done win so I mean is it possible to get some information on that for tomorrow so that we 're not just chucking more things on that delay other things that have already been asked for that we actually know they say that again the strategy and planning work program that we are you talking about tiny houses if we 're gonna pass a resolution to get stuff done tomorrow all right I 'm not passing a resolution I just said we don 't need a resolution about anything that is already on the agenda tomorrow and if it comes over to the appropriate committee then that is Dave 's committee David David estrogen planning so there have been any any work program on regulatory perform no it hasn 't been referred to your committee that 's the thing and and if if it is a regulatory issue then it should go to your committee but I think you should do that in collaboration with the chair of the housing subcommittee we know each other yeah though think silly just you referred to besides of liquor being aspect and synthetic drugs he referred to reason some making a number of objections to off licenses and and that kind of thing the same as there 's two different items here that was super oil yeah yeah this to look at Ben that we want yep it was an East Lynwood Village area and in inferi Road there 's another off license application just gone in for yet another off license down in that area so you have two completely different issues I appreciate that what I 'm wondering is because that 's the off-licence issue is happening in a number of awards in a number of places so i wondering what it would it assists your up the decision might or the the process for the the labs work alcohol policy there 's an in a few moment it would it would really help us okay I just okay yeah thanks Ellie I don 't know where the appeals and things October thank you um we 've got a resolution in front of us here which I appreciate we on asking a question of the board chair on the resolutions we 're going to pass in relation to the board report but are we only debating are we only questioning on resolution one at the moment yeah okay thank you because I 'm just working on the wording of the resolution what what the chief executive has um is that one of the sites that is obviously a significantly prominent site as far as the community boards concerned in relation to the site selection process would require a decision of council because of the nature of the underlying the only underlying category of the land is that right yeah so so I don 't_''_1041.22 I don 't know that we want the the proposal to come we do want you get on with the process of community consultation not only around the site selection but around the initial scope for the for the aquatic facility so that we can then come back in the new year with a with an absolute you know crystal clear position of where the community board is going having done a proper community consultation on the subjects so so are we are we able to get some wording this a little bit confused because the sites there was one or two that really had you know things around them that you would make it difficult and things like this but they were there was one in particularly you know was I didn 't have any underlying things on it and it was you know much better yeah but you can 't you can 't go out with one option no so yeah show you all the options yeah yeah so so I mean there are some decisions that we can 't legally delegate as the point that I 'm making so but if the if the proposal comes back better you have reminded me that in order to get an item on the agenda there has to be and the system over a week before that goes onto the agenda or in fact it week and next week 's are short week because it 's can every day so so the suggestion is the 7th of December which gives us the time for it to come back and it will actually then match and with a with a community board but I really want you to be able to start this before before Christmas so that people can get that sense of momentum so if staff would come back whether with a report that regarding the proposal to to enable the than with central head cups community board I don 't know why it 's got an extra central on it not only its staff just don 't have the capacity the long-term pain and the work underway but also I 'm sorry don 't don 't do that yeah and it 's not about solving off the community board it 's a short week next week so they wouldn 't you know it was me this isn 't just a paper that says delegate that are the decisions there are a number of issues that we need to work through to enable to initiate community consultation on the site selection and initial scope for the Lund would bolster an aquatic facility and report back to Council on these matters and that that just that 's a relatively simple report in my view I think you need to put initiate after would community board to you just take out delegate decisions on site selection so you just put to initiate community consultation on the site selection and initial scope so you just leave it a site selection no you don 't need to write an twice yep call for the and then take out to the Lynwood central Heath community board take that and the board 's report back to Council on these matters and then that that that enables the process to get on with and and then yeah and then we see what you come back with it just it means that you don 't have to come back do that it selves at the community board that you get on with it okay okay right now you had a question on that you don 't want to ask it anyway no just joking so Yanni well Pro CEA 's question area is it 's in like it 's in conjunction with with item two the year and it 's just how that 's going to fit with the fact that we as a council of ask for the Kotik facilities review its coming next month curry and I just want to make sure than fact that this here will actually be workable and aligned to that to that review that 's coming so you have a workshop on it on the 28th of November yep so that 's so these times were led to be to paint it into a considered together yeah yeah Yanni just want to check we had a report that was requested on the 21st of June 2016 I don 't want a history lesson Jonnie Jonnie Jonnie I don 't want to go back over the whole history of it it 's not resource event on the 23rd of November and I want to understand why given we 've had resolutions passed previously the board passed a resolution on the 2nd of October and the staff have already done the work we got the thing presented to us in September that was had been done in April so what is that what is the information that is holding it up it means it needs to go this earth I don 't know but I don 't want to hold out the meeting so request the report to the council meeting on the 7th of does mber that i mean that 's that 's when they have to report by if they can report it that earlier meeting then i 'm sure the chief executive will enable them to do so but they 're not necessarily set up in a position to produce a report because it has to be and with the chief executives office i think by next Monday morning and as the same next week is a short week so it may not be possible but I don 't want to produce a report by a particular date and I know that start got under considerable pressure at the moment everything going on including the long term plan and the other reports that have been requested that I have D risk this one because I 've taken out the actual delegation which would have mean that they would have had to have gone through every piece of legislation that could possibly have meant that we weren 't in a position to delegate so to actually initiate the community consultation on the site selection I don 't think that will take very long and if I can get an undertaking from the chief executive that if it 's available yeah for next week for the to go into the system I 'm perfectly happy to accept it as a late paper yes so if we could have by 7th of December to make it clear that it 's that it we 're not saying that that 's the date they report if they can report earlier then we 'll get them to report earlier but I 'm happy to accept it as 've deep risk the actual wording of it so that the staff concerns about the nature of the report would be written you know minimized hopefully no Jimmy I was going fishing yeah the guy getting to that no you can 't have this for this whole sort of particular nation consists of the kind of the community to initiate a community consultation on the size selection and initial scope do I just want to know but eventually council make decision saturation or is from the carnival we may decide to delegate it to the community board yeah but you 've we make these so we 're not making that decision today or obviously then yeah when the Sehwan of december make DC no no no okay yeah yeah I just want to know because I 'm still concerned while I have a tude even the kind of policy very very wary about what to do a concert yes yeah I 'm not gonna answer that quickly I think everyone around the table knows what my answer would be Yanni just to clarify the end of that resolution it says is that following consultations yes sir yeah it 'll be good just to clarify that and to report back to council once what with the recommendations with recommendations once the consultation is concluded and it just it just gives you the the wherewithal is a cat command as a community board to get on with version that 's all right thank you cool all right do we have a mover and a seconder yarny seconded by Sara I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you we thank you very much our coastal board _"

make that happen but anyway there we are and the new home for the South Hornby school which is now the Bredesen and immediate site so it 's they haven 't moved far beyond the road but we 've had to put in new traffic and safety issues to get the young people to and from school because the roads are a lot busier and then the previous site and council at Clearwater riding his bike down there through from somebody 's bike wasn 't some patrick 's day either it the regional thing got the regional rip from NZTA riding alongside you i think they 're busy council area water regional manager regional manager and that 's passed that 's a unicycle linked through record and Bushell pada ricky moto remoter and here 's their arm hyper helpful random facts that we are as you can see and with the events that we have a very very multicultural ward in fact 30 percent of Christchurch 's Asian Middle East and African communities live in the halls will be terrific an area their number of communities run high regular classes to keep their language and culture alive and just really pleased that we 've got the the chair of our multicultural and Committee of the council in our ward and not only we got thirty percent of the cultures we 've got thirty percent of the workforce of New Zealand craft Christchurch at least in our ward that was in the last last month 's and helpful him help helpful random holiday effects whatever anyway so other than that Liana councils their part a he was to approve the proposed school a great with great pleasure that their community board supported totally unamended it was the staff recommendation so we 'd like near to hand that recommendation over to this council to actually give it the final tick of approval is there any questions at all thank you scuse me Fitz this my role Jimmy you 'd like to move the recessive jewelry the report depends and would like to second the receipt of the report so we 'll just deal with that first term in England thanks Mike I 'm just let 's gas the six point one the widening of Lincoln Road it 's just Monday night is going to be a very interesting night because there are a number and in our community is the Eddington community are that are concerned yet because as you know that frights row to white the air because four lanes already yes and partly north of those as for the shortfall Laney but well Lincoln Road is quite wide but you know when you 've got four lanes going into the start of Eddington by Whitely ed there are a number of by stealth '_''_572.77 that 'll be the next step so I 'm just giving you and your border heads-up that there is actually a lot of angst in that community a lot of instances with people course and living further south that really really need to rely on the ability to move it in there to ten absolutely but we know and I think we 've been we 've posted in ways of course we probably was the opportunity to exceed well with all due respect Mike you know brown streets ordering killed welcome yeah and it 's so you know it 's just goes on and on the stomping ground adorn court well there 's a lot of history here and for lining will kill Eddington so and I don 't think there 's support for it round the table I 'm clean and oh thank you just a question for the stark over the sides I don 't think Ryan 's here at the moment are you one of them can I ask you a question just over that the cost to electronic signs sorry which is this we doing it in the field yes you 're killing yourself worms oh no internet sorry my always junk so yeah I thought I was going to get you guys to vote on it but this is the next one and receiving the report first so so Mike I 'm just making sure that your board members are aware that in addition to the community 's concern around what widening were took it in four lines that in fact some hell in terms of having public transport going through lifts from Lincoln Road and that in fact we 're going to have to ideally foot a bus priority nine in the ATO 's now these are where they one Jimmy chin regarding to an eight pointer to the events of taste my understanding in October is not only the dick and

raising the issue of disability care packs along some depa SF our board has raised four years literally years the idea of having a disability box and all projects proposed I can 't believe that someday Cerf would have gone there from the politic through to the central city without a disabled care pack if they had been a box in the report which said is this going to assist or be contrary to disability accessibility and people who try and come into the town do need to know that there 's going to be a disabled disabled pack our Park available to them and not an errand raised this and it was in the paper this morning I 'd like to thank him for that and endorse what he has said can I also mention that Vicki I 'd love to know when that meeting is going to be held on the lighting can in lighting in the inner city is not at the expense of people or the bees on on the roof of error because that constant flashing of lights etc is contrary to any to local fauna and flora okay and we 've got two parties one is Vista place and Weston way which we 've discussed before at this council meeting and the other one there sprayed in schools key across and which is slightly in Congress because the flashing light that sprayed in schools going on to Manning the site of Manning intermediate and the flashing light for the 40k limit has turned on at half past 00 every morning since Manning left four years ago turned off at nine turned on at three and turned off at 30 so the locals don 't they have to be retrained they get 40 K actually means 40 K now that there 's going to be a school on the site but so those are our two part eggs let 's regard to events and issues of we had a we had two large public meetings on the land drainage recovery the East quite rightly that we do tend to think that we are forgotten along his gut River and the numbers of houses as you all know that are in vulnerable to our River are increasing it almost seems like on a daily basis the floods this last winter would have been terrifying for our residents lying in their beds at night listening to the rainfall would have been unbearable for them and many of them who are around this area in the river the two meetings were held as we now hold them with a broad introduction at the beginning and small group meetings afterwards it has to be said that there 's always a little bit of anger that people can 't_''_231.83 put the appoints before the larger meeting and the staff do address this really well but it remains a point of contention amongst some people that they can 't talk about some of the issues they want to discuss in front of the larger meeting but these meetings were very well attended and the staff as as usual in the drainage and water area on the talking about what the five waters the Honan hey moon high hopes these guys have come and seen us at the community board four times a whole five times and every time they come that their confidence is increasing about public speaking and every time they come they 've been better organized and and been through seminars with our staff Emma kV and Solomon Smith talking about how to move a project on how to run a project how to get the results that they want in terms of the community this is the same group that they 're going for lighting in Hoonah Park this is a pack that 's so well used by local young people the bloke in the center and the back row Michael is the leader he 's becoming enormous ly skilled at presenting to the community board and then understanding the needs of an event organization all of these people spoke on the microphones and ran the event and they did it successfully it 's always great to see them when they come to the community board just occasionally I think sometimes in the just introduced this this year and this is the pamphlet that the staff had produced city council notwithstanding the paper ban which I loathe Lian the publications are always brilliant from the council staff and but we 're hoping to change the title slightly next year to make it sprayed in Kashmir sustainable and edible garden awards but we have got a sustainable category this year and it 's not competitive we 're going to give awards to all those people who have got a lovely vegetable garden or fruit garden and or any kind of not lovely not necessarily lovely at all and who have got sustainable features in their garden and to add that to very popular beautiful garden awards and the whole pamphlets here and we pinched the idea of pepperiness I have to say that and and we pinched the expertise as well this is the best to place restrictions that you 'll be voting on that 's from 00 p.m. to 00 a.m. we weren 't helped by the media saying it was going to be five days a week I had an irate phone a week if it 's accepted by the council and I acted that another thing I want to add to this often when we stop traffic in a particular area we 're shifting the problem on but I 've driven app from Vista place Vista place used to come be at the top of Hunt 's Barry Hill and big falling down the hill it 's a popular walkway to walk up hunts burn and go down visit the place go down the steps go down Walker tea respect of some tourist road that was a popular walkway we now have the sort of mini suburb of bub Vista place on the hill but I 've been up there and there is no place like mister place where we will be moving the cars to up the hill as tiny little roads narrow was no particular spot that would be separated from housing or that where people could park up and look at the view and perhaps cause a nuisance I have to say that I 've also commented in the past that it is a shame because my daughter used to do Park up out the back of broadchurch development broad Oaks development sorry and and and do what late teens early 20s do and not be a nuisance to their neighbors and so it 's a shame that this the activity has been terribly unbearable for the people who live in proximity to this to place because if they were if they had been doing the same things in an isolated area on the summit road then they probably would still be doing it because they wouldn 't have been causing any problem to any neighbors so the increase in growth of christchurch is pushing young people out into other areas where they can do what young people do and then there 's the heavy or say on the tree and urban forest survey i have a long-standing objection to the title of this I think the exclusion of the word bush shifts people 's thinking not to our native trees and dizziness Fleur flora but into exotics because that is the nature of New Zealanders thinking about what the word forest means and I think we 've New Zealanders to think that forests also incorporates New Zealand bush and I wish it the title was tree and urban bush and forest survey and but I 've said it repeatedly and I haven 't got anywhere on that and I think this title reflects northern hemisphere values and not our values but there you go the survey is open from 1 November to 1 December and we hope we get a good response of consultations and oh maybe we did I forgot about that we had cut we 've had two consultations on this in our own Ward and the first one through and this is the first ever that we 've tried this we had a consultations for minority communities in our Ward and it was well attended but we have not hugely well attended but we had a dozen people come to talk to us about forests and their areas and we got points of view for instance a couple from a couple of people from India said to us that they really love trees but they hoped for the sake of the warmth that the can understand that and but that was that was really interesting in the commune and that food for the minorities Missa T 's seminar was miles better than the food for the and all the other participants that claim to the second meter I did well maybe we should advertise the link to again the Christchurch City Council website for the clash search tree and even for a survey because in that it makes it clear Christchurch and banks financial I have a mix of native and exotic exotic trees that support biodiversity and reinforce our identity and then what trees give us so it does do it does talk about both in that context well I know about titles above I 'll talk to the chief executive about way that we can throw in an extra word yeah well do it do it I can 't escape it Tim and Phil you 're happy to move in second right just pepperiness on edible and sustainable gardens could you give it to Gary who 's sitting behind it so behind you so we could also steal it I also forgot ward for the first time we 've got something to give to the people in our ward which tell us what the community board does and watch who the people have been Yanni I don 't think yours you didn 't mention much about page 51 the district plan zoning provisions oh god I think easily reached up a hill on E we 've made this request as well and I just wondered what coordination is happening around Council and the community board because it won 't just be unique to your board I know there has been some quite highly publicized cases which there 's other areas to that we 're people struggling to understand so have you got any sense of how we 're working as a council with your community board around this issue I do plan to host a seminar but but I guess that what you 've raised here is is that that there may be other other parts of the of the city fit equally confused about the changes that have been made to the district plan and this may in fact be a well we 've asked what we 've asked the staff for two seminars went on alcohol licensing and how to present on alcohol licensing but also facts on the impact of increased numbers of outlets in our wards so we 've asked for a seminar on it and and we 've also asked for a seminar on the district plan yeah assist our people to be able to represent on the issues of the changes in the district League but we also asked this council for a public information campaign around the district plan which we haven 't sorry I don 't_''_845.8 I don 't have that resolution in front of me so but but but listening to Titan to take that offline because I personally think that this is something that each of the community boards would actually get some value out of in terms of understanding themselves what the implications of the plan changes are for their own areas and also to have a shared learning experience with their own residents who are equally concerned aunt um can I just add on that before Tim speaks that I I don 't think it 's used enough in these situations because we 've got instances of intensive housing and eddington which is just great and I 've taken photographs of it and sent it around to our board members and we 've got instances in two streets in our ward of absolutely appalling a dancing house intensive house which should never be allowed and looks like bloody Russian yeah some of those you know some of them were actually approved under the previous place I must mention this just saying that they 're not going away yeah it 's for sure so and I gives the two points because I 've worked with the community around stannum Street the two things are that they are they will be asking as one as can we and when can we change and look at this because it isn 't for that area and some of those areas isn 't what those communities should have been have to put up with the other thing is our learning for our side of things is when we go out and look at district changes but no one in that community refer to themselves as Barrington because Barrington is a mall we 've got summer field what sprayed and we 've got hoon hey we 've got all these areas so when the plan came out none of the locals really thought it was them now I think didn 't so it 's owed it 's a real learning and we 've got to as a council we 've got to take those on board so hopefully through this or not hopefully they kept that we have to take on board all of those things when we are looking at there and we 're as we should do as one team and another example of that is and the proposals for Cray craft and in terms of the Adventure Park etc on the counts of course at between hey belly which is ridiculous alright alright so I 've got that moved and seconded so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried and we 've also got _"

BIA is organizing a meeting I think in the next couple of weeks with council staff and with regenerate christchurch and we 've signaled that we 're happy to be an active participant in the work great because that 's the ideal because it works and brilliantly with the you know the new funding model that we have for a partnership model that we have for under the community well-being and resilience fund which Tafari Roy Mata was the recipient but he 's joined in partnership going to work as an active participant and that process as music to my ears as well excellent we 'll get you back more often David here just under the Tokoro River corridor regeneration and in the consultation that you 've got going there win-win is that likely to come back to Council so feedback on the ten options only just closed on Monday night at six o 'clock and so we 're having a look at all of the feedback that 's come back through and we 'll be wanting to put that in front of councillors and have a conversation with you about that within the next couple of weeks I think it would be remiss of me not to kind of mention that I think the the community board in the local community felt quite overwhelmed with the number of submissions that were all going on at the same time and I think just possibly it might be worthwhile just to reinforce that this isn 't the end of the line that 's just step in the journey so the next step is to look at narrowing terms of master planning for the whole of the design absolutely and that 's the important next step for regenerate Christchurch is looking at all of their feedback from the community as well as economic impact assessments and other information and one of the things that we really came to do and the boarders came to insure occurs is we refined the options from 10 down to 3 as to have a regular engagement and conversation with the councillors to ensure alignment in the direction of travel yeah and could I could I also suggest the community boards that for whom that the corridor represents part of their areas of influence and that the reason that I say there is that the community boards can can give you quite a good steer on on that local that local feedback and possibly a way that the broader council wouldn 't possibly perk up so I would certainly encourage I think there 's the two community boards that whether we 're that corridor traverses appreciate that we 'll make sure that happens yeah I 'll use thank you and just wish to know region has been willing to work with the communities and the process that means just talked about the board and its workload you may or may not be aware that Ellington bill would open tell you know those some of those corridor communities designed their own process by way of feedback to you they rent it themselves and I was a good level of interest yeah it 's good to have Rob there with one of the sessions is it angel very delicate but you know if we can break your conversations with some of those local communities maybe we can look at some team preapre force but we 'll see how we go I 'm just trying to think that the the wording of the resolution surely it is just to receive the reporters enough so I don 't think we need the entire all about we 're just just that the council receives regenerate Christchurch as August 2017 status report set out in the potential day yep thank you thank you Paul so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say you know yes okay right so they don 't want to give us a cup of tea so we 'll move on _"

reporters week and for the second time just draw your teaching two to three issues in the report obviously the North wished motivate extinction that is coming through it 's obviously going to have a huge impact or hopefully a impact in our sorry and they 'll have a huge impact hopefully on the amount of traffic through our what we like a number of other wards have quite a number of issues around that traffic particularly areas around here Wood Road Glen David Road etc which raise of a number of our people in the in our ward and second one is also just their continuing of youth development fund and to deserving youth in our community and I 've learnt it too you 're gonna throw your arm up and and also just the Jewish Road water reserve just the looming issue or a infrastructure project and questions I assume that this is a ref and a Jamie moving and seconding very good I did want to just raise the the we still trust correspondents that you 've raised in your report is I think a number of us had in the past being contacted by the group of residents in relation to the change in character in immunity Glendive in Idris and the nature of the roads and their area are hugely challenging and I understand that because I use it as a mechanism for getting from the east to the west and the quickest possible way myself so I understand exactly me but I don 't drive a truck yes I I so I 'm quite keen to know Messiah understand it you 're going to hold a workshop and then determine whether there 's a working group approach to be adopted with the residents association that is that is correct that 's the intent on you to ring the gentlemen concerned which I 'm intended to do today the system guidelines around how we want to engage it in seeking some outcomes or with the idea as the hip point here they 're gathering within the next fortnight great and then with a view of around a roundtable discussion yeah yeah it would be great Thank You Vicky beam Yanni um last time you were here I asked you about the house at mona vale in terms of the artists and residents and last time we had a joint workshop with you you were having a workshop on that just immediately heat of that indeed and I might just bring an errand thank you and here if we came to that there was a very exciting project being subtly there a few Street I believe around a film initiative so it 's still in it as a culture dynamic around having movie set or animation I believe it 's the creek tube like a 3d modeling moviemakers and becoming and using particularly using the house so that lets the latest on the information and it 's been sort of been championing the pro tuning around to look at Miri I thought there may have been a item a late item on the agenda today around the artists in residence program and the initial one was quite convoluted in the sense that people would apply then would apply behalf of the improv the funding to help them through a process and I 'd be their quarter of a year and so on and so forth but we had something crop up where there 's and it 's gonna be public knowledge and a couple of seconds there 's at film animation studios currently being built in Christchurch for what 's called claymation animation there 's a guy from Christchurch called an L worthy who 's one of the best animators in the world he works with where 's Anderson he does the Tim Burton films and he 's coming back home because her children and he was moving to Auckland he talked the producers into setting up the studio in Christchurch and so for that studio to be here and to make it work they needed some accommodation for some of the artists that are coming up from Canada and they will be the ones hopefully will be moving into there to help get that be employing a number of locals they 're working with Aurra and there 's going to be an arts and direction program for young people in Christchurch that have an interest in animation because one the best animators in the world don 't hate coming to Council yesterday and on the lease under their delegations so it 's a it 's been approved to actually level to be a lot of the commercial rate added delegations and it 's in the property Pierson 's developing a lease sent a delegation thing is preparing a memo to go back to the community board that 's a happening thing right yah e3 thank you for the report just know under 5.5 you talked about the Western Belfast bypass and you do talk about people cycling there on its open day yep has your board had any presentations around the not just the open day cycling but how the cycling Network uses that stretch of the motorway because I 've looked at the plans and it 's very hard to see not the naira can recall in any Pacific detail there has been wings to the airport for example or the localize disciple ways we give some reasonably detailed information about it not but not on a global expected I know in the past I think the board had that filter by Mary Boyd did raise concerns within to TA around there 's a lyrical cycle ways along the motorway Velcade who is very Edward with Lane transport around having cycling permitted on that stretch of road and or actually having a set-aside area especially for cyclists it wasn 't a doctor than hasn 't been built I just wonder what the change of government and the new priority around cycle ways whether that 's on the board would consider picking up again probably about my paid rent but Sidney somewhere we can certainly look it example alright I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thanks very much now we 're just gonna stop for one and two it 's 11 o 'clock so apparently it 's not outside yet so we 're gonna go ahead _"

    "text": "exponentially good morning Lee a makeup Mormon counselors good morning these are straight items that would like to highlight from air report response into Saddleworth we 're going to look at the heating walkway which was actually at last month 's information excuse my voice I think it was counselor killing us with some information about it so here we have a mech I 'll just start off by understand that this is a long-term project in us to create a continuous walkway from godly heed to Adelaide Heat really it 's an exciting project and I would just like to acknowledge defeat that once again the community very passionate about it and also to acknowledge Paula Smith that 's here today and she really worked hard to drive this project and who time and I 'm sure she 's still pretty passionate about it that 's something that we believe or treat visitors from you know locally and throughout the country so that 's something that 's worked on you know pretty hard by the growth people that come together we have a really good weekend party group that so any here sorry just going back to the meat I 'm not sorry joining the area of them which are the parts of trait they 've already been and finished and then we hate with the parts and read that are going to be worked on shortly in the Batson Oringer to follow so you can see there 's quite a lot of work there in one of the challenges will be the going through privately and and negotiating was lien donors and things like that because it really is something that if the walkway can be kept as close to the coastline as possible would be great but don 't you see it 's next to go through in some areas private property so that 's you know all negotiations that have to happen going forward the schnitzel is just her ear to church bay as part that 's going to be our route down shortly and the community they 're very happy to help out and once again we 're happy to see that community involvement that 's good partnership now the neatest item was a diamond that are happening down the armor wolf to accommodate LPC 's staff carpark I did flake this last month that are there 's a lot of pushback from the community in regards to the bus has been taken down to one that will be able to pack down on the wolf with his several meetings I felt peace say and they 've listened to the community and the community board in combat with a new plane to accommodate two buses been kept down on the wolf which is great that also looking at how people that are not able to walk across the wolf can be taken down through the security gates and dropped right off that theory so we 're really thrilled with their outcome we just believe it 's a real good one for the community it 's really good the next item of the diamond Harbor Village playing and I just like to introduce we 've hit the Thomas Cole pay come there doesn 't have a community association he 's been instrumental along with Richard Sagar and in the earth members of Don have a community plane and the diamond have village plane which the community board endorsed September meeting the diamond have Aviles playing focuses on programs to produced you in a vehicle circulation or safety that has also identified two projects as for the long-term plan based on the interest plan anticipated benefits in comparatively lower costs so we 're really thrilled with the work that happens over and Diamond Harbor they 're great bunch of people very proactive what tenacious really that can lead us Martha not happy about something so anyway I just like to hand over to Thomas to speak away but about Luke I 'm standing in for Richard Saget who is overseas he would have loved to address you I just wanted to thank Council for a decision you made about two years ago two and a half years ago to support a planning process for food Island Harbor and and to fund it about yes also two years ago you invited in Barlow to pretend on the program of village planning and I think that quite a number of our community attended those workshops and that was that a partnership around village planning could could happen with this council I found that staff was tremendously receptive for for that kind of approach I like to thank a specific team around the Charles Jenny Moore and and Belle home but for the unwavering support of of the process and of course also the team around John Blachford and the community board that support us so well we have a plan now which I think can be divided in projects which can feed into the LTP which is great but I hope the process doesn 't stops there there are quite a number of time and have a community initiatives from the reserve management committee down to the diamond have a community association song where there is a think capability to extend the partnership into the that where we hope we can we cannot only plan but also do projects and one of these one of the problems we might face there is the interface this council and with things today much more complex that they had been maybe 50 years ago 30 years ago when the community built its health center so things like health and safety provisions and the RMA and and secretary requirements are possibly so complex nowadays that we will need council support if you want to tackle projects ourselves but strengthening that process would be very helpful because we would like to see diamond tower be more self-reliant and resilient and future and I hope you support this kind of initiative so has anyone got any questions or comments yep so I just want to make a comment how with diamond have a being such a great example really of you know a village or a whole group of people it 's a great partnership with the community board and council and what you 're achieving and also in the end the report is the native regeneration aspect such terrific what you 're doing I was lucky to be able to walk and last weekend from Tacoma to or through to our hour and there 's similar planting in there and on that coastline by the local groups of people too and just hearing the bell bridge was just so lovely so cool thank you way you work with us so I 'm just having a weak consult over there Yanni thank you um I just not on page 13 that you make reference to tachypnea key reserve and I mean I was fortunate enough to have the privilege of being on the hearings panel when we did the conservation I think it 's the conservation report all they 're hearing so I just you haven 't really touched on in your presentation but there 's anything that you could just let us know about that in terms of a timeline for getting them the reserve management plan in place and also I was kind of wondering if that was coming to Council any search before it goes out if it 's just going back to community board I myself a consultation at the moment we did have a deputation I think might have been two months ago and obviously we were really thrilled with the work that 's happening over the year think that they want to look at the areas you know the whole area beyond the tofu situation and meet in look the year so at the stage it 's at the consultation I don 't meet finishes and you know December you know I would imagine it would come to council on the court sure what think steeps thereafter date like a memo staff just to send us around some information about some counselors interested certainly yeah I think that would be the easiest thing is just an update on the next report and maybe a little bit of a focus on it yeah it 's a really special side yeah and it was it was a it was a proof by council in 2012 that we seek national reserve status according to this report so that I mean it may well be there in 2017 we should we should be Rhian door seing that as the new council so I mean that might be you know something that you could you could put on your report as a recommendation that we reaffirm our support for that for that objective yeah yeah yeah okay damn thank you for raising it you only because you know we do believe it 's very all right okay well I shall put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carry thank you everything _"

Deirdre hat from the University who 's a member of our peer review panel and his I 've seen the revision of the reports you 're going to receive today and also Peter Kingsbury who 's in our natural environment team and Tessa sent from our engagement team Justin cope was going to join us but with the change in time he 's unable to so he is at this moment briefing his counselors on this report so he may join us later so today we we 're going to take you through why we 're doing this work a little bit of a climate change 101 and an explanation of what the scenario itself and then talk about what happens next so starting with why we 're doing this work so the mayor has clearly laid out the challenge of global climate change and we in local government are right on the front line and we 're right on the front line because of the pieces of legislation that have been put in place in this country so the Local Government Act itself has an emphasis on sustainable development and the purpose is to satisfy the needs of today 's communities and future generations in terms of local infrastructure in public services so it has a forward-thinking component to it the local government official information and meeting it has is its core principle the availability of information so when we have information we make that information freely available and it also has some specific provisions around the land information memorandum so this information will be updated on the land information memorandum for those properties that are affected we also must consider natural hazards under the building act and under the building act we need to look forward at least for few years and consideration of consents under the building act the Resource Management Act is where there is the most opportunity to plan for the future so that is we we have the provisions in place around land use and the key guiding document there is the coastal policy statement and coastal and the coastal policy statement objective five addresses coastal hazards and asks us to look at the impacts of climate change and consider both new development we 're green films development what we do about existing development and the areas affected and how we can look after natural defenses along our coastlines so there is some quite clear guidance there and finally the civil defense and Emergency Management Act which has a focus on improving the management of risks and working quite closely with our communities to communicate those risks and reduce those risks as well as our familiar risk reduction readiness response and recovery functions so I 'll hand over to Deirdre Hatt to talk to you about climate change itself marina I was asked to give a very simple climate change in our CP 101 this diagram explaining the Panel on Climate Change it explains that basically we have solar radiation we 've got radiation from the Sun we call that shortwave radiation coming in at the top of our atmosphere filtering down and hitting the surface where the surface is shiny say you have a reflective cover like sea ice some of it will bounce back out of our atmosphere as reflected shortwave radiation however we have got an absorbent type surface and the sunlight comes in and it heats up the Earth 's surface so if you 've got attack absorber layer then when it heats up the surface some of that heat is also filtered back out through the atmosphere but the atmosphere acts a bit like a protective blanket to keep some of that heat and that 's why we enjoyed living on planet Earth because of this greenhouse of heats because of those greenhouse gases that traps some of that latent heat all that long wave radiation making it a pleasant planet to live on however the greenhouse gases there in the right hand side of the diagram we 've been changing the amount and a large scale so these are things like water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone in particular carbon dioxide and methane I 'm going to focus on so when you increase the greenhouse gases you 're making that blanket thicker or its ability to trap heat within our planetary system down here at the surface so it starts to warm up now I 've put to mr. Fourier there on the right to emphasize that this is not a process which has been discovered by IPCC it 's quite old information to climate scientists in terms of the physical processes and the word greenhouse was used first by econ to describe the greenhouse effect back in 1901 so a little bit before everybody 's time here the IPCC however has been involved with getting thousands and thousands of scientists and lots of peer-reviewed publications together to try and refine our knowledge on what 's going on today with these processes and what the future looks like so this is just a plus on the left here linking temperature change with observations of carbon from the atmosphere this carbon observations come from analyzing ice cores and Antarctica at the Vostok ice core you can blame the Russians and they 've basically seen that over the last four hundred thousand years changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide lead to changes in temperature that 's a natural cycling of climate that goes on over geological time this is a slightly old graph but you see towards the right-hand side of the graph and you 've got thousands of years before present so as we approaches zero you can see the blue curve which is the carbon dioxide observations temperatures in red are peaking beyond what we 've had in our recent geological past and that 's our Industrial Revolution and 20th century and ongoing emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases as I said this is a slightly old diagram and so just to update that curve we 're now it 's four hundred and four parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and to put that into context pre-industrial revolution we had 280 parts per million the 404 is a seasonal low we 've in the atmosphere some people question whether the difference and the increase is due to measurement technique that 's not a robust debate at all because there is overlap between the older techniques like ice cores and the modern techniques like using climate stations just as with sea-level there is overlap between using sea level tide gauges and satellite measurements so there is no issue with measurement technique the data is good now you might not have noticed the carbon dioxide going up in the atmosphere but what you probably will have noticed in terms of climate change is records being broken so on the right we 've got the 2016 land and ocean temperature percentiles and basically the colors just show in red we have got warmest years or warmer than average for the record and the blue is coldest years so this map shows you at least two things one is that records are being broken in terms of warming and temperature change in 2017 we 've even got better than that we 've broken the 2016 records we 've also got decades which are breaking records so so we are now detecting change in response in the preacher in relation to the changing carbon dioxide the other thing though that that map shows you is that it 's tricky it 's complicated it 's not changing exactly the same everywhere on the planet and this has seasonal and enter annual variation so not every place has the exact same response and that 's why we tend to look at changes in the average or 10 changes in the mean to try and look at the trend and how it 's it 's changing but we don 't always feel changes them the trend what we tend to feel is changes and events so changes and storms changes and records being broken this is the ICP 101 so they 're the entire government or panel on climate changes representative concentration pathways or a CPS and they are in their 50s meant report which is called AR 5 lots of acronyms there but across the top we 've got the representative concentration pathways called two point six four point five six point O and eight point five eight point 83rd percentage or eight point five plus as it 's called in your report so all of what 's in the tanka nutella report is within the IPCC science what those mean basically is that scientists have looked at population socio economic and technological trends and they 've said if we go this way we 've got one type of scenario and if we go another way in terms of our development and our use of carbon we 've got other scenarios so the variability in these scenarios is about human behavior and this is where things like the Paris climate agreement come in because we have choices to make here in terms of our behavior but basically underlying the scenarios is carbon concentration equivalent so when I talked about co2 in the atmosphere here we 've got all of the greenhouse gases translated into that carbon dioxide equivalent and ICP 2.6 you can see that the the maximums would arrange the century is between 430 and 480 parts per million we under that scenario we need to peak our carbon emissions now or yesterday and we need by the emissions negative emissions basically means that were actually starting to soak up with lots of carbon from the atmosphere this number one line is about atmospheric carbon so that 's quite an optimistic scenario 4.5 with peak emissions in 2040 and then after we have a decline in emissions 6.0 similarly we peak in 2080 and then there 's a decline our CP 8.5 I won 't call that as a business-as-usual scenario but some people do refer to it like that what it really means is that we carry on as we are today so we keep emitting carbon and we keep looking for carbon and discovering it and then using that carbon and putting it into the atmosphere so you would have increasing carbon emissions throughout the 21st century under that scenario as I showed earlier increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide equivalence here lead to changes in temperature so number two is the temperature range that each scenario considers and there we have at 2.6 from about a degree to about two degrees and you will hear in the media a lot of talk about say it 's no longer realistic with what we 're doing at the moment but that all depends on human behavior right up to under 8.5 we were looking at between about three and over five degrees that 's for the 21st century these scenarios carry on beyond the 21st century and the carbon emissions that we put into the atmosphere yesterday impact the temperature for at least 50 years so what we did this morning and getting to work and driving our cars or in using carbon has a 50-year temperature time lag the sea-level time leg is a lot longer so oceans basically over tune they turn around they rotate with currents and that takes about five hundred years so the lag between extra carbon and the atmosphere increasing temperature and a full ocean response takes a lot longer we can look at well beyond 2100 the sea level line there number three the different ICP scenarios the average sea level rise by 2100 ranges under RCP two point six point four meters or forty centimeters up to 63 centimeters under eight point five now that 's the 2100 before you ask why those numbers different from the table in the report it 's because we 're projecting out to 2120 and if you look at the Tonkin and Taylor report on page 8 you 'll see that the curve accelerates so every year past 2100 every year past 2120 the curves going up and so the rate of sea-level rise accelerates so the numbers get rapidly bigger the longer we go into a scenario in the future now all of these scenarios and have underlying assumptions they as I said before they look at population increases and socio-economic development of countries around the world they look at different levels of commitment to GHG or greenhouse gas reductions so under 2.6 we need to return to 1960s carbon emissions within the 21st century now everybody talks about the Industrial Revolution putting a lot of extra carbon into the atmosphere that 's when we started to put a lot of extra cabin into the atmosphere we 're just doing exam marking and some of our students made the mistake of saying the Industrial Revolution happened in the 1950s and level but actually it 's not that funny a mistake in that the change in the carbon emission curve we get a slight flatline before the Industrial Revolution we get a little increase after the industrial relivin revolution but in the 1950s and the 1960s the curve really starts to trend up so it 's actually a forgivable mistake it 's sort of that boom time post-war where we really started to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere so going back to 1960s levels will take an enormous effort but 2.6 as a scenario doesn 't just say that we 'll go back to 1960s emissions globally while still developing and still having growing populations it says that we 're going to those negative missions now this means that we need to sponge carbon in other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and we need to do it from the century onwards and definitely until we clean up what we 've put into the atmosphere now the eight point five assumes that we do none of that and that we keep on going in terms of trying to find new carbon 4.5 and the 6.0 this assumes different scales of lowering our emissions and then starting to sponge the greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as well so they do include a reduction and they include a reduction under technologies that we haven 't invented yet so this is sort of the Jetsons type stuff it 's new technologies that need to come online very quickly to start cleaning up the atmosphere now the other assumptions that underlie the RCPS the representative concentration pathways are that the Greenland ice sheet in Antarctica behave in a moderate way so that 's one of the areas of uncertainty and even RCP 8.5 which might seem like quite a big scenario doesn 't include accelerated reactions from the Greenland ice sheet and West Antarctica and so there 's a big scientific effort at the moment to try and study those because those ice bodies do seem to be loosening up and starting to respond a bit differently to what we 've got in our current fifth assessment from the IPCC so these are the our CPS and the top left plot and they are just emissions and you can see the green line at the bottom that 's nice our CP two point six which is trending downwards as we start to soak up the carbon and below it we 've got the historical sea level rise so the historical sea level rise that 's data that 's not modeling that 's actual data and you can see this variability in the data because depending on exactly which port you measure sea level rise it you get a little bit of variability this is global data we have quite good data from our four main ports including Littleton in New Zealand so historic data there now the first sort of modelled sea level rise data that I 've gotten this presentation is there on the right and this is the RCPS translated into sea level rise scenarios on the plot it shows a blue band and a red band there 's quite a lot of overlap in the early years up to about 2060 so our first time frame in the Tonkin and Taylor report is represented by the the black oval there and you people talk about there being uncertainty in terms of sea level rise projections if you look at the 2100 timeframe you can see that the sea level rise scenarios are much broader between the bottom blue RCP 2.6 and the top red ICP 8.5 so that uncertainty is not scientists trying to work out what 's happening with greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect that I showed you from the 1800 's before it 's a lot more to do with what society does in terms of emissions so we 've locked in the next 50 years with a little bit of wiggle room in terms of the exact syllable rised numbers but we have uncertainty is what people are going to do in terms of emissions and sponging carbon so their influences the range out at 2100 um just a few points on these graphs you can see from the historical trim line that the ICP 2.6 is not a huge departure it 's not a huge change if you look at the blue line in terms of the slope of the curve so it 's quite similar to acceleration of the change in the rate so the curve gets steeper on the right of that syllable plot it 's got all the RCP bands in colors so we 've got the darker blue and the light blue the orange and the red showing the four different ICP scenarios but syllable rise I 'd really like to emphasize to finish up is not the only component of a coastal hazards assessment it 's just looking at the baseline and as I started out we may not feel the change in the baseline unless we live in a very low-lying area how we might feel a change in the average sea level is through flooding with rainfall and reduced drainage it 's through storms where storm waves can get further up beaches and also another thing to emphasize is that storms are likely to change so sea level rise is not the only predictions from the IPCC they also make predictions around increased storminess what does that mean that means different things in different parts of the world but newest is that locally increased storminess probably means not an increase increase in the intensity and other global estimates say that per degree we 'll get about a seven percent increase in the intensity of storms so we have bigger waves and will have higher storm water levels on top of our already higher sea levels and then the last point I 'd like to say is that everything we do to respond the coast will respond back to so every intervention we put on a shoreline or in a Jun system and the Coast doesn 't just sit there and not respond it responds dynamically so we have dermal geomorphic response which means that every structure or every plant that we put in everybody send that we change or influence the coastal system takes that in its own response and has a change and so when we look at options and responses we need to consider the dynamics of the coastal system because there are pros and cons to every single one that community will want to evaluate Wow thank you thank you that was incredible but carry on Alan thank you some of this will be a little more over the last two days and what else you had to think about so I 'm going to take you now just through a little bit of the background on the technical report give you some more examples of what the maps and that and the information actually looked like and what that means for going forward so in the last 18 odd years there have been a series of reports done starting in 1999 that was at that time there are the two IP the first and second IPCC scenarios that that that first report was based on and compare that to 2017 now where we have the Firth IPCC scenario to work with so there 's been quite a development and that information from the panel over that relatively short time even prior to 1999 there were three other quite detailed technical reports done for the council on coastal matters I haven 't_''_1710.0 included them in here but they helped they contributed to that 19 99 report you 'll be very familiar with 2015 where two reports were produced by Duncan and Taylor for the council as part two reports came a an initial peer review of that work following the removal of the coastal hazards chapter from the independent hearings panel process we then conducted a second peer review by an independent panel of which dr. Diedre Hart was one of five members and a detailed report was produced for us on what we 're seen as the areas that needed further investigation or further interrogation so that was done and in October this year we have now produced the final report of which there is a summary document for you if you don 't feel the need to read the full report again dr. Diedre Hart was the peer reviewer for the 2017 report as well and that was done in a particularly in a particular way to ensure that from the start of the 2017 report dr. Hart was involved to ensure as a rolling peer reviewer that there would be no surprises at the end and that the recommendations of the independent hearings panel had been clearly understood and clearly implemented and addressed and the report right the report itself there 's been a between the 2015 report and the 2017 report if you do have a copy of the 2015 report you can wrap it up and give it to a relative for Christmas as a Christmas present because it is no longer valid at all the 2017 ort replaces an it 's an entirety that report so this shouldn 't be any cross-referencing or comparison between those two reports there are quite different beasts as you heard at the workshop the areas covered by the report include only the main inhabited parts of the coast and the way that the coast has been described in the report is the open coast now the open coasters are fairly obvious from the Waimakariri River down to the end of Brighton spurt but it also includes Taylor 's mistake and Sumner as they are open to the open coast what 's described as the harbour Coast and includes the Brooklands Lagoon and the Avon Ithaca history and four bays within the akaroa harbour and four bays within lyttelton harbour up there has been commentary around the use of models for this work but it 's that give the output there is other techniques and other information used in conjunction with the models to produce the results that you see in the report and that includes things like ear photo interpretation ground surveys and surveying inspections the use of the lidar information Beach profiling and GPS surveys so there has been as much as being possible to do ground true thing of those models to ensure that they fairly represent what we see today and what will happen in the future my last point there before I just show two slides of the results is that we consider that a technical report that we now have as as the best that we can have that 's comprehensive it clearly addresses the the recommendations of the peer review panel and it is a useful document and with other information to go out to the community as part of the wider community engagement process study areas you 'll see this and you 'll report a little bit clearer but as I said extending from Brooklyn 's and the north the wiremac through to South Shore the history area further down on the map the four key bays of the two main harbors so we 've got wine OE devotionals and akaroa which one among us in there Parral Charteris bay Allendale and one other in lyttelton harbour so those are the four key areas that have been mapped as your well we are two main parts to the report coastal erosion and coastal hazards I 'm just going to deal with those and a slide each for the coastal erosion as for the coastal hazards as for the coastal inundation the time periods considered are the next 50 years so out to twenty sixty five and the next hundred years out to twenty one twenty four the harbor coast and that 's what I was just describing before and on the right-hand side of that slide you can see a snapshot of part of the harbor coast just north of Brighton Pier illustrating the fact that there are four RCP scenarios modeled and with two sediment budgets as well so you might not be able to count the lines from where you 're sitting but there are some models shown there and that one shown the errors for 2120 and you can see the dotted lines so they are the 5% rare but 5% lines that extend back beyond the back of the June system and into resident residential areas for the harbor coast the modeling is a little bit more straightforward we have the 50 and the hundred year time periods showing as poor as that Allendale map therefore 10 to 120 the smap 's also include the 2011 baseline which is where the shoreline was at that time to be used as a marker and they also show the influence of where there are sea walls or structures which influence the rates and the amount of erosion for coastal inundation again there are the two time periods considered so next 50 years and next hundred years the same for our CP scenarios as for the erosion but as the mayor made the point very clearly at the workshop these relate to return period events so this is an event which is described as a one in a hundred year event or an event which has one exceeded so you can 't have larger events and it certain doesn 't mean that you only have one of these events in any one year you could have many you have three four of those in one 12-month period that doesn 't mean to say though that they are still not one in a hundred year events and just a little aside on that when you 're looking out long term a 1% chance in any one year so one in a hundred year of and over a 70-year lifetime and we 've used that previously as a verage lifetime which is a wee bit on the short side now but that 's still close enough there is a 50% chance that you will experience a one in a hundred year flood event over a 50 over a 17 year period the two maps just as for illustrative purposes the one on the right winery here we 've got the 2065 projection or 2065 met with the 4-hour CPS if I had put up the other map of a 2120 met for the same area you would see that the lines would extend well into that area there the other met on the lower left of South New Brighton 2065 again a slice through from sort of Bexley through to Brighton or South Brighton there again showing the the extent of those four scenarios the 20 that the hundred-year these are the 21 20 lines if you look at the right-hand side of the figure extend well beyond the lines that are shown there out towards the beach in the open coast so this is flooding from from the river not from the open sea just to recap again on the figures of properties affected you 'll recall back in 2015 we had some where around about six thousand properties affected by coastal erosion and some 18,000 around coastal inundation if we look at that today bearing in mind the different the use of different RCP scenarios you 'll see there the maximum extent out 2120 is somewhere around about 25,000 that 's for our CP 8.5 plus and now for the erosion the total been somewhere around about 958 so to position ourselves compared to the 2015 report side of our CP 8.5 and that you 'll still see that between 18,000 21,000 there is still an increase in the number of properties affected by a none Dacian but far fewer many many fewer properties affected by erosion so the erosion modeling initially was over conservative and it is now less conservative but fear I hand over to Helen so is this was introduced we do have time to respond to this information and we have a bit of an outline here of what happens next so the first thing that we will do is go out with this report to increase awareness of it amongst our communities and to increase the understanding of the challenges that we face so information will be available on our web site as well as a property search function and droppings and we 'll we 'll have another slide on that following that we want to work with each community that is affected and look at the values and objectives those communities have for the place where they live and extend that across to the whole of the city because these places and we want to engage the whole city on the response following that we 'll look to start to develop options in these adaptive pathways so there are a wide range of options for how we respond to this both through instruments such as our district plan we already use consenting under both the building act and the district plan to ensure that people understand what the challenges are for the sites and build to respond to those and there are further options that we can use in the in the future in terms of adaptive pathways the the reason that they need to be adaptive is well we know the general direction of travel we don 't know how quickly some of these things will unfold along our coastlines and for our communities so we will have adaptive pathways and to the point where we can reassess and decide what what the best approach would be once we have those mapped out we will get into more detailed strategies and implementation fans and they will be about each community but they will also be citywide for example our thirty-year we need to be careful in terms of lifeline routes and what we do with our network infrastructure and we are responding today and there some of our network infrastructure for example the surge at East we 've gone to get human precious sewage systems where we 're facing rising ground waters so there are already some changes in the place there and finally there will be ongoing monitoring and review and that ongoing monitoring and review will be of the basic information about our natural environment and the risk profile as well as how our responses are trekking for communities so what what responses are working and what we need to change and I 'll hand over to T so to talk about the community engagement that 's going to happen immediately following today good morning and just a little bit of a review for you obviously in 2015 we did go out with a series of drop ins following the initial release of this report we are proposing drop ins again but it 'll be a different situation in 2015 there was the district plan changes which made people attending those meetings so what we what we 're proposing now is that we have these drop-in sessions we 've got seven two in the bank 's Peninsula and five in the city areas and that 'll be really around getting good information out there and letting people know what this what this report actually means so we will have our technical staff prison as well as representatives from CDM the defense and Emergency Management a consenting unit and a discussion around what future engagement might look like if one of the lessons that we 've learned from last time and as you say we have got time that we can really involve the community right from the get-go about how do we engage you how do you want to take part in decision-making around our coastal futures what might that look like and it might be that we end up with fairly different engagement in different parts of the city but that 's what I think we would like to at least offer from the out seat and we can we can see how that plays out so talk about six of December giving people plenty of time to think about other things after that we then want to look at a speaker series we 've already had some very successful international speakers come and that was you know they 've been really good event so we want to continue with that we might look at the things that you see up there you might have speakers from each surface or nywhere that sort of thing so we 're we 're on our way to booking those then now and then of course the community engagement itself will start proper after the Christmas and New Year break and we do very genuinely want this to be co-designed with those local communities not to the exclusion of a citywide conversation and we will see how that might happen at the same time so we 'll get stuff together late in January to talk about what we heard at those drop-in sessions and work with those community boards as well just start to figure out a very clear engagement strategy from February 2018 onwards thank you thank you very much in the week with our community boards and we 've had the opportunity to ask and and ask questions and in fact you 've taken the advice from our workshop on Tuesday that you answer some of those questions and your presentation and that is probably the most excellent comprehensive presentation on any subject that I 've ever seen at a council meeting so you know all four of you congratulations and thank you very much and I know that you 're fronting for a big team that sits behind and obviously Tonkin and Taylor themselves with the report that they 've done so thank you very very much for that was that was great thank you and I think it 's governed everyone a bit of a moment to sort of really reflect on the challenges that the globe has to confront because it 's not a city city challenge it 's a global challenge that we all face so I 'm happy to move that the report be received I don 't know I 'd like to invite David to second data Fitz thank you and an arrow really want to go into questions we 're receiving the report so like to contribute to the debate yeah another question related to the engagement and some of the comments that we heard today which we didn 't hear previously look at this seriously I 'd like for us to receive the report there 's going to be plenty of opportunities to talk about the engagement process I 'll just keep my comments very brief and my last questions um but I just to say that you know I definitely see this as a step on on a journey and there 's a lot of work to be done I think it 'd be really good to clarify what 's happening with the community reference group the coastal futures group and also there 's been reference made to the new infrastructure being successful but I 'm still not clear how we are actually analyzing our infrastructure that 's going in in response to what we 're learning about in terms of coastal hazards for example the new vacuum systems and bromley did not work because of high ground water so set up a process where we can actually be really clear about what this means in terms of our infrastructure so that the community can have confidence that the infrastructure that we are putting in is resilient and will stand up to what 's happening and it 's not just they underground infrastructure I also think it would be good at some stage to think about what it means for our built infrastructure and I was gonna ask which obviously we 're not having questions was around how do we actually look at this and the regeneration lens as well I mean we 've got a report in terms of Red Cliffs school later on the agenda that 's raised a number of questions around the coastal hazards so I 'm still not quite clear what the process is for us as a city to look at that regeneration legislation and look at how this feeds into that so there will be a number of questions that people have as we receive more information I think it 's heartening to see that local governing Zealanders now picking up the mentor will also be a lot more progressive in this space and I definitely think that it is something that needs to be done with people rather than to people so I look forward for those two that that work beginning in continuing clean Livingston thank you thank you for this fine work also wish to acknowledge the community which had a right to a call for a peer review which has been duly undertaken and I suspect although substantively in the big picture of climate change you know nothing 's changed but it was the process I think which needed to be challenged by the community we went out too hard but now we have the chance to reset the clock and perhaps be a bit more respectful and what we 're doing just wish to make a few comments that life is about adapting anyway we 're all aging we have to adapt to that we you know people and their families face changing circumstances they have to adapt we need to adapt to our planet we have a chance now to turn things around which we all must make changes and adapt to our environment in the environment in the regulatory space you can see that in some of the housing around the the river corridor it 's quite noticeable now how that reflects some of the the changes there we also have an opportunity in front of us a great big opportunity in the form of regeneration and the residential red zone so this area which kind of served to take away so much both through seismic events and then the subsequent land decisions now has a chance to kind of give back that could be an exemplar area by which we are plant so you know there 's an opportunity to create a a carbon offset as you know a small but I think still a significant contribution for the community with the challenges that we face so we may be thinking about how does it affect me but it affects us all how can we all do something together for the community there are many things I could comment on in this but but I won 't simply to say to echo what the Mears future for the city there 's a future for the east of the city we can all see that the future literally being built before our eyes out there but what we do need to take seriously our future as a nation as well as locally it came as some relief to me to see the change in government not only for some of the social issues that we 're getting out of hand but also the need to address what we 're talking about today and I 'm pleased that we 'll see that that leadership you know taking us a long way forward with that one thing I 'm curious over we often talk water take the kind of one of the my takeaways here a sediment take there 's a river user with the lower y mark Aditi I 'm curious over that and how you know peps RMA processes can conserve to address that I look forward and Tesla 's talked about this with the community engagement in a more respectful way when we don 't have big meetings with people yelling at each other but look at the maps that Jen write talked about look at this changing circumstances they 'll make up their own minds they 'll work it out themselves the intelligent people don 't know what to do people move throughout their lives anyway for various circumstances so I think in time if that 's what they feel they need to do they will do that but in the meantime there is a future there there 's no need to panic but it is time to act collectively for the future of our tenant Thank You Phil clear water and I certainly agree with agree with others that we owe a debt of gratitude really to the compilers of this report and all the great work has been done I would think that probably in Christchurch we 're right out the engines of leading New Zealand in terms of the quality of the work and the end and the clear scientific information that we now have and that gives us a head start and it will be backed up I 'm sure by by the the work that they when local government the and Lian referred earlier to really this is about how we sort of live with our water and clearly though too it 's also part of how we manage the surrounding land and I guess now this clearer information it 's really spelt out now and it 's it 's clear in the discussion in this report and in and respect to the but their value of the protective factor of the sand dunes and it 's very clear in the discussion where it says that remove but and tooth of the protection to go if we were to go the other way that removal of vegetto could result in greater erosion response both long-term and short-term in and I think that 's something which I guess has been contentious but is now absolutely clear in terms of and in this more there 's a lot of specific information in this report about the different rates of accretion and we 're for example and Deirdre referred to it today where we 've gone in to try and protect some areas for example by way of stone walls and in the nature the natural accumulation and protection factor of the set of the dunes and I think that 's something I want to flag to counselors to into that we know that some excellent workers being done by way of protective planting and adding to the marram grass the native grass planting along the dunes but we need to make sure that in fact that program continues and that we make that that is funded through a long-term plan that is something that certainly I will be keeping an eye on so I think one of the key messages I receive from this it 's a very full report is that we have to respect the natural protection factors that we already have and we 're in many ways I think Christchurch is blessed that we have there and that many people have done a lot of excellent work both you know in the field and scientifically to achieve their you know I just endorsed the mayor 's opening comments so I think she hit the nail pretty much on the head with with a lot of things and can number of topics this morning and I have to say that I thought I knew a lot of stuff but I 'll add a few things this morning so that was exceedingly good presentation this morning look I I represent the coastal Ward which obviously contains and a considerable number of the people looked that potentially are at risk from sea level rise and other factors and I look upon that sort of philosophy you buy a house and your house is your greatest asset and it 's probably the biggest investment you 'll ever make in your life and so I really look forward to to some surety that in the process is going forward that the views and aspirations of local residents coastal residents will be heard acknowledged and acted upon and I 'm sure that will happen in 2015 we had a couple of reports and look they were challenged and I feel proud to be part of the community that did challenge those reports and that has resulted in peer reviews and the outcomes that we now have in 2017 I I think provide a lot effects of sea level rise in climate change I do think though in terms of coastal erosion particularly one factor that it 's very lightly known at the stage is actually the sediment budget and councillor Livingston to touch upon it briefly and I think that is one area that does require a lot more work because Christchurch Beach 's unusually around New Zealand are accreting and this is a obviously the critical factor in the whole equation does that tipping point as to when does accretion stop and windows erosion potentially start and I think that there needs to be a considerable amount of work on the settlement budget that we do experience coming from particularly the way very River I 'm personally want to be more comfortable with some of the modeling and technical aspects of the report particularly with reference to the data that 's being used and in margins of error and some of those things so that 's an aspect that I 'd like to take up a wee bit further than myself but overall look I 'm comfortable with the process of the document the mare has outlined in her opening address on adaptive management and I am exceedingly strong on this point that we have time and we need to do things in a measured and practical manner and reviewing our coastal our coastline in line with our long-term plan planning every 10 years to just see what exactly is happening and adapt accordingly I 'm also mindful of and I 've used this a couple of times of attending a coastal dunes forum a few months ago where there was a coastal Sciences from up in the Coromandel area who had the philosophy that when you are dealing with these matters or coastal matters they can be quite a motive they can be quite a mocha probably the best word for it and his philosophy was that if you develop strategies you develop processes and take the community with you while you are going you will get an outcome in the end that everyone buys into so I 'm quite buoyed by the fact that we have through the the peer review process and looking again at the Tonkin and Taylor report but we need to be acknowledged that going forward we do take our community he Willis we do it use an adaptive management process in this very very complex subject and controversial subject going forward in our society and I think if we had use that sort of approach to it we will get to a an outcome that has buy-in from everyone and will will work if we go the other way and it 's we are we are doing it to our community we will not get the desired outcome so I 'm happy to second the motion today and I look forward to some productive discussions in our community acknowledging the views and aspirations of our community to work towards a solution that we can all live with its climate change is inevitable some people think I 'm a bit of a skeptic but I fully acknowledge that you know sea-level rise has been happening for a hundred years now 150 years or more and we have to react to it so let 's do it in this manner and I am absolutely sure if we do Sarah Templeton thank you I 'm gonna repeat things that have been said looking forward to the engagement but it 's really clear from the presentation that it 's not only adaption that we 're looking at as a council as a planet the the greatest range and variability about what 's going to happen is to do with our behavior regarding emissions which is why it 's so fantastic that at our last council meeting we voted as a council to mitigate our own organizations emissions down to net neutral by 2030 and to look at getting a framework together so that the city can do that as well and I just like to really make that clear we need to make sure that we don 't get into that 8.5 range and that the effects aren 't as bad on our city as they can be thank you thank you Vicki Burke helpful well it 's turned on sorry I thought the statement that you made about your emissions this morning on in the vehicle that you came to work on or whatever has an impact on the remit the fact that every one of us in Christchurch has a carbon footprint of I think seven point eight tonnes from the last report that Helen did last month which is higher than Wellington and higher than Auckland as well individually and then the comment that was also made about the 50% chance in a 70 year lifespan over one a hundred year event is very very sobering this is not just an impact on the coastal communities although it deals with coastal hazards this affects everyone living in Christchurch and everyone living everywhere I think in the last 15 years the council probably and government definitely have been incredibly slack on climate change I don 't think we 've made it real in a sense that these are the things that we know and we set these out for discussion so that people can actually choose the actions that they take well ahead of them happening like Glen I 'm relieved to have a climate change Minister and government that is actually looking at a carbon neutral act for 2050 so that we know as a country we planet that will suffer the planet will recover it 's just the humans and every other species that lives on the planet at the moment that will suffer massively from climate change I also like to comment about every step you take in relation to the coast the coastline responds dynamically and I think that 's quite fascinating that you 're almost dealing with the living organism and returns and in regards to the response that it will take back from the accents that we take so we need to do this carefully and well and I like the fact that there is time to do it although there isn 't any time to muck around because this is happening at a rate that is actually a mildly terrifying and you obviously didn 't include the West Antarctic Ice Sheet I 'm glad you didn 't because I think none of us would have got out us meeting an inny state of emotional well-being had you included it in terms of the impact but I think what 's been really good about what 's come today is that climate change we regard as too difficult too hard we 'd like to put it aside and deal with the things that we feel that we can deal with climate change is one of those ones that we have to deal with and that we have to take every step along the way and take the community with us so that everybody realizes that there are things that they can do today and there are things that they can do next year and that there are things that we can do as a city and there are a city council and there are things that we can do as a city as a whole that will make a huge difference and this pretends that where our small nation not going to have an impact on the world a pure fabrication given that our climate emissions are one of the highest in the world as it 's great to see that we are actually finally getting past that denial phase as a country and getting into some actions so I appreciated the presentation very much I thought it was excellent and thanks for thank you I also would echo the thanks that have been expressed to staff and those involved with the particularly the preparation of the presentation that we saw this morning the the climate change 101 certainly called some of those issues out for me in a way that that really resonated I 'm pleased to see the inclusion of a number the banks peninsular settlements in the report the conversation to date has been largely around the eastern seaboard and that 's natural given that that 's where the large numbers of population ah and I 'm encouraged by the fact that there will be a couple of the early engagement sessions held on the peninsula as well the potential has got a long and varied coastline and as the report calls out there are some areas of population where there are effects that the community need to start talking about and then the communities need to be aware of but I think what we 've got in front of us here is a real a report which is a really good and sensible basis for the start of those approach with the community and that 's exactly the reason that I think the earlier engagement will have real value as to how we work together with our communities to to tackle the issues that are raised very well in this report but the last thing that I just want to say is is to refer people to the crotchet City Council website so CCC gob T dot indeed and Ben slash Environment lien living with water but I 'm think of you google living with water on the council website you 'll come straight to the page it 's got all the different aspects of the report some of the references to it but I just wanted to read one line which is we want to explore the options together so we can come up with a mix of ways to adapt and see the best possible future for our coastal environments our communities and our city and you really couldn 't put it better than that so on that note I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "and we moved to the public forum and I 'd like to invite David lunchy and Cuban collie to come forward to talk about their awareness campaign and that looks like enlightening Christchurch from here by eyesight 's not as good as it used to be oh right okay okay good excellent and it fixes the city at the same time thank you thank you very much madam mayor councillors for this opportunity my name is David Lynch and I 'm here with my colleague Kevin calling it a lighting designer we 're here today to officially launch then lightening Christchurch very close which is simply an awareness campaign to promote and communicate lightning as an important tool for the regeneration or continue to generate regeneration of the CBD of Christchurch the night appearance of the city is a product of both public and private lighting outdoor lighting should reinforce how Christchurch Reserve and Foreman scene and promote the appreciation of individual works of architecture old and new this is important to ensure the defining elements the CBDs physical character is legible after dark Christchurch like any city is very about shortly enhance the transformation from day to night and doing so it should produce positive changes that enrich people 's experiences and enhance your understanding of our CBD the use of night lighting also ISM them is important to orientate people and help them find their way around the city after dark furthermore it is particularly important as it promotes improvements to road safety personal security amenity and especially for pedestrians a luminous CBD will in reinforce the perception of Christchurch as physical form and to achieve this we need to ensure a consistent attractive and balanced approach to the design of lighting throughout the CBD is pursued so what is the opportunity in our view more could be done to enhance people 's experience of Christchurch after dark to achieve this we believe there needs to be a better understanding and appreciation from many people regarding the importance and the value of lighting of our buildings old and new those in private ownership council control ground owned and also those special areas that we refer to as the public realm we also believe that during this time of creatively light the steel and concrete skeletons of buildings going up in the city under construction rather than seen them as dark messes at night they could be beautifully lit and we also believe that new retail now established in the CBD should be encouraged to switch on their window lights and show off the fact that retail has returned to our city as I 've mentioned enlightening Christchurch is simply an awareness campaign and it 's to promote and communicate lighting as an important tool for the regeneration of our CBD our expectation today is quite simple and that as lightening Christchurch campaign will be the catalyst that triggers an important opportunity being realized to creatively illuminate Christchurch as a shining light to the rest of the world and to demonstrate what can be achieved in the rebuilding of a city following a devastating earthquake so how can Christchurch City Council assist and make this happen well we believe the council can influence private outdoor illumination through the development of the planning process however we acknowledge a range of communication and collaborations will be necessary to complete the synergies the council will need to consult with other public authorities and key private sector stakeholders and we have identified a list which I won 't run through given the time constraints the City Council 's could also develop a regenerating lighting strategy which would need to be developed in partnership with building and business owners in the CBD that would provide guidance and direction for public and private external lighting throughout the CBD the strategy with the site that would define the issues identify the objectors and help set priorities for lighting projects however the strategy would not restrict what is currently happening with private initiatives being purchased pursued independently so after eight year is how does our CB look after dark I 'll now hand over to Kevin who will present a number of lighting designs some of which have been recognized here in New Zealand and internationally as outstanding examples of what can be achieved when tasked as he has been with lighting iconic and important buildings in Christchurch this will be followed by a number of images that we believe highlight the opportunities to improve the CBD address by presenting in lighting an enlightening Christchurch project which requires the council 's support for having the external floodlights of the Christchurch Cathedral turned back on and we 'll talk more about that shortly so over to Kevin thank you dude so after having let some of the voice that the world 's most famous musicals and sings the LED technology was coming in I had a vision for the city of Christchurch before our event that we were going to make it a welcoming safe and elegant looking city in the first place I started of course was the Christchurch tower so that when visitors arrived Christchurch that 's the first thing that they 'd see and I think Jesus is a really interesting and exciting city to come to after our event of course the focus changed and in May 2015 I presented in New York City how to light a broken city and it was I have to say it was very humbling to to be in a city that actually had experienced recent events themselves and they were very sympathetic so what I was showing we were going to be lighting in Christchurch in some of the achievements we were going to achieve by actually lighting up some of our heritage building and of course this was the first one that we started which I 'm sure you 're all being familiar with and the Isaac Theatre Royal needed to be in a state of elegance in heaven and have the splendor and elegance of building but have a specific color on it that actually made it look magnificent when nothing was actually happening and then of course what we could do is you could change it in any particular color you wish to depending on what event was actually coming up and then of course after that I got a proach by britt anderson from christchurch casino who actually asked me if we could get people back into victoria street and if we could actually do something with the lighting on victoria street so we created this which i don 't know if any of you have seen at night but I didn 't I 'd encourage you all to get out and have about the casino is that that particular building can be changed at any time for any particular event that 's actually happening within the city the interesting thing here we had an actual we had a French program of programming at the hot at the time and he put the French flag up just to have a wee joke so but I thought it actually showed things off really very very well and of course it 's not all just about color it 's about elegance and of course just across the road from from us we created the RSA created some stunning lighting on that to enhance the city and to show the RSA off and all its splendor for its architecture so that 's a warm light so it just doesn 't necessarily need to be color and then we started with Durham Street that 's two to nine Durham Street if anybody needs to go and see that it goes off like a firecracker every five or six minutes because the developer actually wanted people to be attracted to the building and how were we to do the way from warm to cold and we have a bit of fun with it this is our next project that 's actually just been approved as the OG be in the city which I have to say is one of my favorite buildings and after say it 's one of the most magnificent buildings I 'm going to seal it because I think that 's absolutely splendid and apart from that we 're doing at the moment Trinity Church as well which is right beside a GB of course and now we 've just approach to do the Time Vault hour and Littleton which is going to be equally splendid so now our hinder back to David will now just quickly flick through these images we believe this represents a really good opportunity for Valentine 's turn our particularly after the development opposite has lit up we think we wonderful if the council could encourage Valentine 's to consider doing something to reintroduce your wonderful shop frontage on to Colombo Street not only obviously is it is helpful to encourage people to to look at night but lighting up example opposite where you know they 've started lighting up but it 'd be nice to see some consistency with the other retailers that have committed to come back in the CBD here 's an example the ollie building on down the street a stunning building during the day sadly as Kevin you know I 've discussed very strongly lit on the bottom of the building but now attempt to light their fins and make it something of interest at night so there 's another opportunity this is not a particularly good photo but we say as we mentioned earlier about transitional opportunities the Convention Center site which is viewed by a number of hotels and guests that go up and knock down rather than looking at a dark depressing mess they could beautifully like that simply with some lighting across that whole site if they want to this is your new Learning Center I believe all library here 's a good example where we think with a little bit of imagination some creative lighting could have gone into that building as the structure formed and eventually being pulled away the Crowne Plaza a beautiful opportunity perhaps illuminate that wall again taking away some of the starkness that is confronting many people that wander around the city car parking we think it 's appalling that anyone that builds a permanent car park has to provide lighting and we say that the council should be working with Wilson 's to say and the owners if you want car parking please make sure it 's lit because that we need to provide safety as well and this is another area that 's not helping us lift the spirit of the city now now these are people that have actually made an effort within the city that I feel they 're just a few fairy lights which I think look quite elegant and they 'll put some some lighting down the side of the the walkway so they 've actually made an effort which I think 's fantastic another building being the old McKenzie and Willis building another another example of how people have actually taken on board to light their their building and make it look attractive and then we have a public realm it may not necessarily be the best example but it 's better than a lot of what we observed the other night when we went through the city and again we think that more if it could be made to do things like this and make it interesting now to not Church and to conclude this address lighting the Christchurch Cathedral there 's a little bit of background I think it 's important you understand thinking behind this following the devastation to Knox church from the earthquakes my company approached the church nots with a proposal to light up the ornate ceiling for Christmas 2011 I sit them at the time that they would normally be lighting up the church but clearly with the destruction they couldn 't do that so they agreed and the idea was to provide a symbol of hope for the city and to allow the church to say that we are still here and by lighting up the ornate ceiling they agreed this would provide a prominent symbol of warmth and a beacon of hope for the city 's recovery at the time introduced to him through the casino and Kevin agreed to assist the images that you now see show exactly what was achieved and during that time the lights were on before the church was rebuilt many people could be observed photographing that it was used in advertising campaigns and it certainly exceeded all expectations and as I say Kevin also who was involved with this was recognized both locally and internationally by his profession for what that achieved and were presented so following the recent decision to restore the Cathedral I approached Kevin again with my idea for exploring opportunities to have the external floodlights of the Cathedral to back on as soon as possible after a number of visits we confirmed that the majority of the external lights are on Council Orion light standards with one set of floodlights within the grounds of the Cathedral at the East End opposite the old government Life Building light knocks the proposal Kevin and many others that I 've subsequently spoken with provided me the feedback that I was hoping to hear and that they felt that turning on the lights the symbol to mark the significant decision that after almost eight years of darkness the Christchurch Cathedral is to be restored furthermore illuminating the exterior will certainly help improve the overall environment to vote to those that visit to those that work and to those that operate the businesses in the square we have yet to approach the Anglican governing body the Synod or the greater Christchurch building trust regarding the proposal however although following today is address it is our intention to do so obviously we would appreciate your support with the necessary introductions to make this happen in summary what are we asking for today we hope that you will enjoy oratory that you will support our endeavours to promote enlightening Christchurch we hope that you will consider developing a strategy around rejuvenating writing in the city and furthermore that we hope that you will support our endeavors to assist in having the external floodlights of the Christchurch Cathedral turn back on as quickly as possible thank you very much thank you very much you know as you know this is a five-minute slot at the beginning of a like to perhaps enable this conversation to continue and I know that the chair of the innovation and sustainability committee has a particular interest and various lighting matters and I 'm just wondering whether we could resolve as a council to review you this particular request to the innovation and sustainability committee I 'll be happy to move that and second up item and if that 's okay I 'll just put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you a much we

    "text": "now I 'd like to move that way but Oh oh my goodness they 've come in with the big guns okay so back-to-back two hearings ten over up oh no right there so thank you for that short delay we 've managed to consult with the expert mr. O 'Connor so so then why are we laughing and explain explain the issue so Robert I might let you talk through but essentially we think there 's enough protection already in the lease but if need be and you 're still not satisfied do we have another option so I 'll enter to Robert so I understand the issue is noise and the need to control noise and for their content to be consequences for breaches of conditions around noise I 'm looking particularly I don 't know whether you 've had this document put in front of you or not but all 16 of the draft lease contains a provision which is a standard fairly standard commercial lease provision that you 'd expect to see which requires the tenant to comply with the requirements of the city plan and under the city plan and so what that means as if I understand there is a resource consent and the resource consent is quite prescriptive around the types of noise the timing wind noise certain noise there was a permitted in those those sorts of details so if the if the tenant under this clause was to breach those prescriptions around noise then the landlord the councilors landlord would have a remedy and that remedy would be it potentially could cancel the lease in terms though of the property law out the process to cancel the lease is prescribed by statute and in this case it would require a note to be given by the landlord to the tenant specifying the breach in requiring the breach to be remedied within a short period of time only if the breach was not remedied having given their notice water right of cancellation arise so in my view the the lease that 's been drafted contains the clause that should and that Clause does give the councilors landlord the ability to bring the arrangement to an end if there is a breach of resource consent plants and here 's the bat so if you 're I mean that sounds like a breach you know like you 're doing something that 's kind of a continuous state of affairs but if you breach the condition which is to go over the noise the Moto X number of we need to preach at once and you could use this clause read it out again well it is that it 's it 's generic it didn 't our paraphrase that the tenant will comply with the provisions of all statutes and the requirements of the applicable city plan including any amendments and amendments or changes or replacement of a district plan and all by laws relating to the use of the premises by the team in Section 16 section 19 deals of the council with the cancellation No so anointing once is if you 're failing to meet those things then we could cancel it I think no 19 is a different cancellation clause dealing with different matters 19 is about observable perform any obligation under the lease 19 is about eight years of rent basis of this lease and they lacey has failed to remedy that breach then we could serve them a notice yep this is what I described the whole lot of other circumstances we you so the another option we were I alluded to is to use that clause and link there more closely to 16 but from Ed Matic benefit nice to go through the same process it 's one of the reasons the hearings panel put on the annual review rather than just a weekend look at a dedicated age so are you confident Robert that say they go and spend because they 've got a 33 year lease they go and spend millions of dollars it 's not relevant no but then you want to them they break all the noise limits you can still cancel that lease and not have to recompense them for improvements for anything I 'm not sure the lease is about improvements you have to quickly flick through but they could take away the lease mm is there a stroppy applause no you the property law rate is pretty controlling around the circumstance we of landlords and tenants off and it 's come up with this arrangement that where you if they fail to pay the rent you can kentley landlord can cancel immediately but if any other breach such as the noise provisions that we 're talking about you have to give this notice you have to give them the opportunity to remedy the breach and then if they don 't agree MIDI then you can cancel i 'm confident that we could issue the notice to to threaten termination and if they fail to rectify the breach we could end canceled I 'm just live time sorry can you just go in the 16.5 season releases represent us will actively participate in a constructive measure man it meaner in any committee meetings and the lessee will use its reasonable endeavors to implement any initiatives agreed by the committee to reduce the number of complaints received in relation to the permitted use it doesn 't indicate that there is an absolute obligate or absolute right sitting with the lessor that they can cancel it 's a potential breach as though there are more breach pause and it committee is there well the obligation is in 16.1 I know but where does it say you can cancel the lease for breaching 16.1 yes but it sees effortless he fails to observe will perform any obligation and has failed to remedy that breach within the period specified and a notice serve on the lessee in accordance with a property law so we 've got to serve a notice of them for breaching that 's what I 've described noise conditions versus eh involves giving a notice yeah you see the notice and but and then they don 't do it again yeah I mean if they if they limit remedy well as I described the property law Act prescribes how a landlord can cancel the lease frightened free for a breach which doesn 't involve non-payment of rent yeah so that 's every other breach the landlord the only thing the landlord the process the landlord must follow is it must issue a notice specifying what the preachers and if the breach is remedied to a third of the acquiring the breach to be remedied remedied within that period of time that 's it problem solved very cheap making noise when you 're not a very choose not remedy then the lease can be cancelled yeah but how do you remedy how do you not continue the breach when you 're not actually well if they continue making noise you so know that they 'll make noise the next time they run on the bend and then you have to save another notice if people are generally happy with it but you know we were asked to look at the we we did ask to look at the lease as part of the way of signaling to them how strong it was house have yeah how we didn 't want to unsure yeah all right I gave up history I 'm defeated right yes absolutely I know when to give up so just reassure you did we have a motion do we have a resolution Hey I honestly ain 't once this moved and seconded no I don 't want any reassurance so I know when I 'm on a losing streak so and I the motion all those in favor say aye although the pace they know that 's carry thank you thank you _"

    "text": "welcome babe right now this is this has come straight to counsel so I haven 't got a accounts a lot I kind of caught on to so perhaps if you would like to introduce the paper okay so the Kennebec accessibility charter and came about probably was conceived around about eighteen months ago i guess and it was a an initiative that was conceived by earthquake disability leadership group and barrier-free trust new zealand and the vision for the charter wants to create a model for best practice and ensuring that business leaders and people responsible for the built environment and canterbury took advantage of some of the opportunities that we have here in canterbury and as a result of of the earthquakes leading to you know redevelopment you know a lot of things have been happening in the city and there 's there 's a lot of room for improvement we 're not doing too bad but you know there are a lot of situations where there could be better collaboration between agencies responsible for the built environment and some consistency in the way that things are built places and spaces and Canterbury become universally accessible and enabling kind of Canterbury ins and visitors to live work learn and explore and play equally and sitting in expectation of best practice design and development which goes beyond minimum requirements of current legislation so the Charter has four main guiding principles and they 're centered around leadership education technical expertise and health and well-being and Christchurch City Council has been seen as a leader and implementing the Charter within this organization and it 's an organisation that other key stakeholders in Canterbury are looking to for guidance in the way that it carries out its duties or or that 's its various activities around providing facilities for the community and people with disabilities the Charter is about access for everybody as well so it 's not necessarily just people with disabilities it 's a whole of life experience for people so it 's a better level of access for everybody the council here we set up the staff set up a an internal working group that worked across multiple units within the council we looked at things that we do for how we might improve what we currently do now and so we 've come up with with a few initiatives for implementation and there 's some things there like you know cheeks on our buildings from time to time to make sure that over time you know we may have built something correctly but after a while somebody 's chips and furniture around or put some boxes in the way or whatever it is that we have continued good quality access when buildings are built and our own facilities and that the appropriate Chicks put in place to make sure that they are meeting at least minimum legislates and also that we look at some best practice for some of the things that we do and and some of those best practice things are around you know looking at the minimum legal requirements and then building on those so it 's things like the visibility of elements that we are perhaps a ramp for an example might have a minimum requirements for a slope but we actually make that ramp a little bit more gentle and provide better handrail looked at as a group and we believe that a lot of what we need to do here is cost neutral there are some additional costs involved in engaging level of expertise and some of the built features that that we would provide that those would be minute within project budgets the barrier-free trust and EDL G have a official signing of the Charter and our function room tomorrow afternoon and there 's around six key agencies and Christ Jesus that will be here to sign that including most of the City Council so today and the staff here are looking for endorsement from the council the executive team that 's that 's this workers mainly operational so the executive team have given their endorsement to go ahead and and manage the operational aspects of the Charter and that staff are looking for council endorsement today great so Aaron but do you want to move it you 'd like to make that film yep just very very good report and in terms of the Charter to my memory really pleased I 'm sure Aaron will do so too but I at around training for the staff and as a whole plan for there and I would expect to that yes because leadership has part of us that counselors counselors we could be included somehow in that training yep so the the objective was to provide a base level of training for everybody and the council including counselors you know we 've looked at some things that happen over time as well and we think that we sometimes we 're you know there 's maybe a little bit of a downfall that 's as a result of a lack of understanding I think when you get that base level of understanding that becomes common sense or second nature and it helps lead a culture of thinking about access for people so yesterday we and the council 's smoking unit staff group near 2n agreed to work closely with the council 's disability advisory group which would include staff training in in counselor training because that 's your practical yes that 's meet all the requirements and it 's ever miss met best practice but still our members and blind foundation are alive as well so that 's that lived experience voice so we 'll make sure that that is perfect any other bullet I 'll put it open to debate now Aaron you know speak to this I want to call me Phillip at the end of it the this is so we will hopefully support this today then you know sadly sign up tomorrow and I say sadly because what a sad country we live in that we 've got to this point that we have to have an accessibility charter that we have to have we have to reflect on everything we built to ask is it good enough for people with different disabilities as it accessible and the reason why I say that is that every almost every company and organization in this country does not employ enough disabled people and that is the entire problem here we wouldn 't have to have a relook at all the designs if the people working in the architectural firms and the joinery companies and the concrete companies had their fair share of disabled people working there and we looked at have a completely different lens over the way we make and do any everything I 've just come from a disability committee meeting ground health board and it was brought up there and once again our patience is about to open but it will be inaccessible because of the roadworks all around the outside for the next year and a half that 's because groups like Oh taro and Sarah and everyone else don 't employ disabled people who would have seen early on in the process if you do that roadworks then this building that 's going to have a lot of disabled people using it won 't be accessible and we as an organization are guilty of it maybe in private businesses some of us own and have owned have been guilty of it in until their attitude changes we will need charters like this to drag us over the line and make our country and our city accessible and for me crushed it should be the most accessible city in the world because so much of its being rebuilt but we should be the number one attraction 's pretty darn good rains on average 28 days a year and we in its flat so what a great place to live so if we start to embrace this part of society which has been completely undervalued in fact just using the term to disabled or disability starts with the negative and if you ask or know people with any form of disability if you know them well you 'll know that they have a nature has given them a counter to that which means they have a real asset that we often don 't see because we see the other side of them first and that 's what we need to flip on its head as a society and then we will not need these charters and stuff in the future to get us to a point and that gives us an accessible city tote so until that day we will need this tomorrow and I do hope everyone supports it and it is a good start but it 's a really sad indictment of our society that we 're even at this point in 2017 so I fact though that the Charter is just so necessary and so that in fact we do make our city accessible for especially or for people a wide range of disabilities really and that 's the thing that especially with the reconstruction is Aaron alluded to it is but just so challenging and even in building or transport infrastructure we certainly found for example there cycleways they offer a big impediments really for people who have disabilities so there 's a lot of challenges in terms of how we actually get all this work done and so I think us as Aaron said to us as a council becoming leaders in that area already approved there because for a long time people with disabilities kind of were on the back burner and you just have to look at for example the car parking even around some of our of our own council facilities and and the excess for for people say here in the cheer so we 've got a long way to go but I think this is great and I think the concept of best practice will work really requirement which in some areas we may not achieve so you know I think very much thank the staff for some great work and teamwork being done on this in in glad we 're doing this today Andrew thank you I also totally support this and it 's a very timely conversation of course we 're at a unique time in the history of Christchurch with the amount of rebuilding and regeneration that we 're doing at the moment if there was a time that we were going to talk about how we rebuild and regenerate to enable and in fact ensure access for all at all times this is the time that we should be having the conversation so I think it 's a great piece of work it 's also a very timely piece of work I 'm encouraged by the way that it 's collaborative and I 'm also encouraged by the commentary around going beyond the minimum standards and really as a council setting the bar high and leading by example but also as a sitting we 've got the ability to become recognized as that example to the rest of the country and possibly beyond that as well so I 'm very supportive of this and thanks to staff for all the work that 's gone into it thank you just a quick comment another good reason to keep control of our district playing back and get those principles put back into the enter the plain over live now Jenny just really quickly on this I just want to say that although it 's a disability or accessibility charter you know this really is don 't think of it as just for disabled people this is virtually everyone and I think that that 's what 's so critical is that if it works for disabled people it works for actually everyone whereas young people whether it 's pregnant mums whether it 's old people living in an aging population from a business perspective why would you choose to alienate a section of customers you know so it works on every level so commune staff and in and agree with everything that 's been seen anyone else I 'll put the motion all those in favor you very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "[Music] just a shame that Aaron 's not here yes I know yeah is he coming back he was jus Beckett okay cook look sorry can we just leave this one I 'll hold this paper over until Aaron comes back with it I asked the chief executive when I noticed that he wasn 't here but if he 's coming back we 'll deal with that next item 29 the hearings panel report to the council on the proposed lease to the Canterbury Cart Picard club who cheered this one was that you Sarah the Jew chair the this committee would you like to introduce the report and I 'll head to here and it was best dealt with it 's part of the district plan it was to do with the noise the noise the noise requirements under new district planner actually much stricter than they were under the old district plan I think the the car club under the old district plan could have increased its noises which which won 't be able to do now they 're much stricter in the only change that we 've the original lease document it recommended it just said that you know the lease all may at any stage ask to look at all the documentation and we 've actually recommended that there is a formal annual review of their documentation to make sure that they are meeting the requirements okay so you 'll move there yep do I have a seconder for that okay jaimé jaimé yep is there any discussion or question and so I 'm not sure of the financials of the Contra care club but a number of those who are pune organizations are quite major organizations but still pay the same for our reserve as if they were a football club so in just in terms of the cost of the land have we actually looked at what is reasonable to charge for it honor under D not under the hearings panel because the Hearing Panel was dealing with the one objection which was to do with noise levels okay staff member here that 's a non-starter station [Music] currently the club place rather a librarian with we haven 't_''_152.4 agreed to a new rent them a heads-up of what we would expect as being a rent and it 's based on a hit deer right similar to what the golf club pace across row so what that sort of divulging figures it 's about four times what they 're paying in the moment and does that have you seen their balance sheet okay and second question I just think the reach reflect their use to what just put it 's unusual I think for a reserve to be used by car club anyway the second one is there a capacity to put within the document because the difficulty is we sign these documents for thirty-three years and then have problems with them and there 's no nothing to allow the resolution of those problems if they 're it because there is issues with noise and there is a divided division within their community about that out there and yes I understand there 's been through the Environment Court but if they don 't meet the noise restrictions that they 're under is the revision to do something within the lease from the stages that for a year for because the district plan rules error Aaron in your turnover of noise limits but they actually have a noise monitor on site now and they have been pulling cars off that breach the limit yeah so if there is major noise issues can we do something anything within the terms of the lease or can we put something and so that we can just sort of I like to sort things out while there is no problem rather than after the fact first all would be dealt through by the district plan because of thanks hey we actually monitor as well the the noise levels get sent them to our noise monitoring Honest John helps he is actually even regularly looking at them now so can we not just put in a call it to us that if there is a persistent breaking of the noise barrier that council has the capacity to revoke the lease or something like that so that in ten years time if it is an issue we have some palate but the in Council has some power to deal with it and now rather than wait for it to be an issue and discover that we 've got another 23 years it was a previous time possession adopted by the council your attic or it is somewhere in the paper I 'm just trying to find it I 'm I 'm not you know I 'm I 'm quite keen for something close to be Russian and that basically defines you know that the breach of the conditions of the of the lease but as substantial and sustained breach yeah of the noise conditions it will actually mean that will terminate it is written in the least about the district plain it refused to the district plain in the noise levels yes I know but but but persistent breaches don 't seem to always get dealt with here hot food yeah pursued with as much vigor as some of the people that have to listen to the noise what would expect jump in will help if we got a copy the clause and maybe delayed this to later in the meeting and got you the copy of those specific clauses that beefing up we can look at that yeah is this is this time constraint okay so [Music] under Clause nineteen so there is reference to it in terms of the lease that they shall comply but in terms of cancellation there 's nothing that I can see that is covered there I think that would certainly give us a bit more comfort there 's no breach in you can see you know then there is an opportunity to cancel no no that 's fight though no they don 't if you don 't have any translation calls then good luck trying to get them to yeah yeah so yeah my experience is that we sometimes are very generous with our leases and we forget to put in all of the ifs and buts and maybes that can happen and I would much rather sort of have a really strong provision in the in the lease documents so we have some attractive look could we just does this need to be signed off today quite a while beside I mean I 'd rather just flick it to later on in the Thompson scratching his head before so it might mean here it might mean an indication of a contribution that he 'd like to make from a legal point of view it may not it might just mean he 's got an itchy scalp I think they would be beneficial yeah I think I think we just take a minute because if we could write a provision and beer which which talks about you know sustained and significant because you wouldn 't want to do it like there was the occasional breach but yeah those kind of terms themselves are actually not specific enough and we found that with a keen when it comes to for example odor controls it talks about you know a Phoenix even though those kind of subjective terms are really hard to enforce so we would need much more specific things such as the conditions under the district plan to be able to take them to so the district playing conditions actually have specific numbers of breaches and those kind of things that are monitored by the noise monitor and there is a thing in here log the track blogs all of those kind of things we could put it under sixteen sixteen point one of them because we 're gonna be teaching those annually but if there are more complaints that we 're seeing earlier that come through safety community board that could be reviewed because there is still the whenever we like we can check all their logs but those kind of subjective terms are actually really hard to enforce so that 's really so I think we should get the right wording as well looking at can you guys hit a lot of it because that what this document says is that these new district plan provisions negate the need for additional controls through the lease but it seems to me that the lease doesn 't come to an end even if this but I mean the thing is though if the if they breached the consent conditions and they 're not able to operate but they still have the lease they 're still not operating and it 's bit stopping the noise and they 're going to want to stop there to is to be operating but we could add something in 16.1 we 're at see that they shall comply with the provisions of the statutes ordinances regulations requirements of ypres district plan and that ends and so in maybe in 16.2 we say that you know we could review the lease should they not be doing it well any sustained and and whatever ongoing breach of and persistent breach of the provisions and the best role in yeah will result in the termination of this lease not result in termination but if you do it any breach IV review yeah could that 's right yeah yep yeah I would cut out the word sustained I would just say the breaches well I don 't need the words to put in but I just want some mechanism for 33 years noisy motor racing yeah could we leave you to just do some wording and we 'll go back to the perf into the accessibility charter now that Aaron 's Brides I 've no colleagues seed that you should be here for the for the discussion on there I 'm very sorry fools _"

    "text": "our next item is the consist bility charter oh sorry I put a line through by mistake development contribution or emotional application item r-25 yeah this is the bit badminton one that we had quite a long debate it because in Galloway is sitting back from the table on the satellite we 're not participating we were very keen to help them because there is an incredibly good community outcome of this but we can 't find a way that doesn 't open the door for so many and so I was going to move that we grant this it wasn 't going to go through and so we 've adopted the postponement method is the way of doing it I can 't_''_56.21 I would have been of the same mind as you in terms of supporting less largely because I know that for badminton you know yeah if you 're looking where players come from because we stopped on the east yep and we 've got Canterbury badminton supporting this even though they operate out of Cal Stadium so I 'm a little but confused also by the argument think of any of examples that are used by way of comparison are sitting a preset or having a precedent set around thus especially given that this comes with it public access and children 's access to the facility free of charge and you know I don 't know whether that 's a negotiable doll if people felt that wasn 't sufficient but I think there 's something coming back to the city that would justify we totally I totally agree with you the rest of the committee perhaps not so much but the difficulty is that even the City Council for the community facilities it provides still pays development contributions so that was the difficulty the staff will elaborate but all of the facilities that are provided if they required to pay DC 's are not remitted we cut just because there is amazing community contribution so that was the difficulty with the Badminton one which I would love to give her so does this mean that if we turn this down that there 's no free courthouse for kids he 's gonna keep it anyway right David give crossover also with community-based organizations that actually provide facilities that councils not going to provide in their planning and I know in the building consenting and resource consenting fields we are looking at a mechanism where community or not profit not-for-profit organizations may be able to have some remission of a building and consent fees and whether in fact that the work in that area may need to be expanded to look at development contributions as well there 's a moot point that certainly from the regulatory performance point of view there is a piece of work that 's being explored at the moment in terms of resource of consenting and building concession fees remissions or partial r emotions to assist these not-for-profit organizations so in the context of what we 're discussing here it may well be an extension to that piece of work somewhere along the way as well and I 've sort of questioned the with the council in the development of its own facilities based DC 's I believe that we don 't we don 't we don 't we do Yani well my understanding of was that we could do development agreements with developers and so the very thing that 's been proposed where you have a non-financial benefit from the development eg the kids going for free community access with things that we could do can you just I 've seen the report there 's not an option to run the development agreement can you just help me understand why or if that 's been considered and ruled out or why that 's not as an option it wasn 't really considered because those are that 's generally where they provide a national the actual infrastructure for for the for the cost that 's like you know could be where they doing storm water mitigation on-site themself or something like that rather than actually providing a facility that 's generally my experience was provide private development agreements not so much actually providing a actual built facility so there was no consideration given to a private development agreement no there 's anything legally that prevents us from doing that Paden is there anything legally that would prevent us from doing that not not that I well and there there was no there was no suggestion of doing there and the advice was that deal she couldn 't see any good reason to recommend approving this but we could certainly explore the option in the future I guess of that was the direction well have you got a an indication of the of the specific you know infrastructure that needs to be provided to support us and have you talked the developer about a an agreement around no because what what development contributions it 's not these three things that are just going to be built in the future it can be it for its infrastructure that already exists so generally we can leap development contributions you know the end of the program for a period of 30 30 years for giving the revenue from that so lots of time it 's it 's actually already there so it 's actually nothing that they need to do at this stage to leave the development go ahead in terms of putting an infrastructure it could be for costs that are already there or if disposal of you of the yes if they built storm water mitigation unto their site that could be something you could take him to account own only if there was a requirement for them to do that so so if it was lacking and so if they needed toes perhaps part of the consent if they were providing mitigation on-site but therefore they would have to do development on site which would probably be just the same as having to pay us to do it for existing infrastructure or put in an infrastructure I wouldn 't actually be a cost saving they 'd just be paying it directly themselves rather than us don 't so do you actually know whether that 's the case or not whether they have required to mitigate not not that I 'm aware of it 's pretty it 's pretty rare that someone be required to do their earnest you know on the condition of the consent and that goes to the stormwater engineer anyway who would recommend to us that we give a reduction in stormwater because of having to mitigation on-site sorry get a question right did I don 't either okay nope move it by Sarah seconded by Mike so is there any discussion Roy yeah well yarny and then Jamie I was gonna say that um I 'd really like I mean even if we can 't get it back in time for the staff we 're going to explore the postponement but I 'd really like to gets a little bit more information around development agreement and whether I know it hasn 't been our practice but actually if that 's something that we could use as a mechanism because I do think we 're we 're getting a community benefit of indoor court space which we know has been a huge issue for us as a city even before the earthquake and with the metro sports we 've you know we just we always have had insufficient indoor space and the idea that we would look at a development agreement that would enable development to provide that I think does possibly save us money I mean if you take nappeun or Y which is pretty close we 're not proposing at this short to medium term so yeah I just don 't know why we wouldn 't look at a development agreement to try and deal with this issue and I don 't think there 's anything that we 've heard that would stop us doing that but I appreciate that staff may want to take more time to do it so yeah I just wondered whether we could include that and it 's under two or an additional resolution to just seek a memo around that possibility I don 't know the mover and seconder happy just for some wording around not just the request the staff explore the postponement and then I suppose there 's another one which is also but it would go under the postponement once I 've been you three request staff report to innovation sustainable development committee on on the orders why don 't we just add to development contributions policy and breakers including development agreements that is it what they called private developments including private development agreements and then just put that in brackets afterwards is that okay yep well but you could just leave it I think there 'd be support for that nine oh nine and I know you put it on the wrong one so put it on three after development contributions policy yeah that 's a good thing because we know that major clear peers it 'll be right all right yep okay right so um does anyone else want to speak on this I 'm Jamie and Ben Jimmy Thanks it 's kind of a tricky one it 's almost like that by lore for the the sex workers type thing we 're making a decision and it almost doesn 't feel right but I think there 's a similar in the sense that I think deep down it is actually just consistent with our staff which are the experts in the end their advice because one thing that we need to be very clear of is that DC 's are not a punishment just because what you do is good doesn 't necessarily mean it has any correlation to the payment of development contributions I think you know you can 't confuse the centricity residential DC DC rebate scheme that worked is because it steps stacks up financially that we say there 's a result of more people that are in the Central City more community orientated development would occur which does pay DC 's so I think that we you know run run a really significant risk if we were to go down a path of saying this is a saying that we 'd like to see in our city so we won 't charge DC 's for it I think anything that added anything positive to the city could rip respectively open up a can of worms around there where that begins and ends I hate to imagine so DC 's are simply charged for the operational cost and for the upgrades when additional strain is caused on the on the infrastructure any development you know assuming that it doesn 't have DC credit or developer contribution credit is going to do that but it is not a stick that 's brought out because they operate is in the commercial space or they do something that we do or don 't like they 're just not all sentiment of you know what Vicki said what Yanni see what the mayor said that there are things or avenues that we could explore whether it 's development agreements or getting probably having a wider conversation just around the development contributions policy in general about what we could do but a straight out remission I think is a really really dangerous precedent to be sitting and just saying that we shouldn 't be considering because it does devil with that notion that DC 's are a punishment which there 's something not their effective life like different exits so someone 's got to pay for it and it doesn 't mean that what these guys are doing is not good and there are other avenues and really really keen to find ways that we can help not only them but also other organizations and future I just agree with staff that I don 't think development contributions of the way to do that as a way to create far more problems than it will solve some an agreement with the committee recommendation Jimmy Theatre face Oriya bodies matey especially we private bill at least a facility and also this facility actually had a few people community meant to use this one I mean we are all aware only in the northeastern area have a kind of standard a quality of payment and the facility factor in the waste South West area Nordisk and especially I remember populous tree even the three or four years ago the still some of the the payment and suppose the key person and also committee asked me whether is possible no can kind of council consider whether can co-share with some or a council own facility in those the car poor members they can use this one today I feel very sorry about this one they try to build up this facility in the southwest area however you still need to pay the addition of the TC the feel and also is country 50 sovereigns quite a few but because this is the kind of the another consistent with the well contribute country you know the policy someone can break down bridge of this one so bad I 'm still further cry solely so I two if the staff export is the post-punk or the weather contribution purple within the at least crap for five years whether have some other you know the alternative options can give them or not only she herself maybe this the kind of the community sports car in all their members you know to give them a kind of help I just like to say that I 'm completely understanding of how frustrating this must be to a family that is just making an absolute commitment to the city and to providing or remedying what is a lack of facilities for community hall school halls in this area this is where the kids come from who are going to be our badminton players of the future they live in the southwest they live in the West and I just think that you know that that somebody like that well their family like the jury family should be supported but also agree with what Jamie said analysis development contributions are not a punishment but it 's interesting to see who exempts themselves because central government exempts itself from paying them to have granted themselves complete absolution towards contributing to the cost of any of the infrastructure while a community person who 's not going to be made rich off the back of creating this facility especially worth the excess for kids for free you know as unable to request the similar treatment from from his own counsel because it doesn 't meet a very strict a standard of unique and compelling it 's pretty compelling to me actually so I would have been quite happy to support it but on the basis of the recommendation that we look at private development agreements and assuming that within the context of this one it wouldn 't be too late to come back to council with a change to the policy at some stage while it is still being developed then I wouldn 't be opposed to that either good so so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "a innovation sustainable development committee report carbonate mutual item number 24 just introduce this yeah this this actually came to the committee in the tomb of the last government when there wasn 't quite looking to be quite so much action on climate change so this is the recommendation from the committee what what 's happened here is that there was a verbal and PowerPoint presentation the committee looked at all of the possibilities and has come up with these recommendations and you 'll notice quite a lot of things about those recommendations so there wasn 't at that stage staff recommendations from the report so I 'm not quite sure why they 're here now but I 'm going to move the committee recommendations all of those staff ones can come back to the committee at any stage that they want to anyway but the committee was quite clear about what we want to do so what number one we want to set our target for the Christchurch City Council being net carbon neutral by 2030 we went through how that can be achieved we know that is achievable work is actually done obviously we want to develop those frameworks the third one was one that we spent some considerable time on in terms of a very conditional one that talks about requesting staff to work with the committee to investigate a framework and strategies for setting a target for Christchurch itself to be carbon neutral by 2050 it 's deliberately quite open at the moment so that we can do all that work then we wish to invite other Canterbury councils and the wording should just be including Environment Canterbury rather than especially environmentally debris that was me being naughty to adopt the same targets and develop their path to achievement to achieve the same goal and then obviously asking for future public transport initiatives to have a waiting for electric or low-carbon options and that all new contracts be electric within six years and then to look at the sequestering of carbon by tree planting and management and both the red zone and the peninsula and Port Hills in terms of the committee 's commitment to this this is one of the council 's top priority goals adopt clear targets and start working on them now we know that the impact of emitting co2 now is that it will still be around in 300 years time so what you are miss it in your car driving this morning is going to be part of your legacy for the next 300 years and will probably last longer than any of the other decisions that you make here today actually so the legacy that we know we will leave that children 's children 's children 's children is our carbon actually so we want to make sure that we actually do something about it this is the first time that actually as a whole population of people on the earth we 've known the impact of what we 're doing and to not do anything about that is just worth or neglect so what we want to do is work through this systemically but to start now so these are the recommendations that are before you and this is what the committee is recommending seconded by Mike Davidson okay so Helen pets would you like to start with an and why they are materially different or where they are materially different from the council committee 's recommendations certainly so the first thing is that the the briefing to the committee was not as complete as we would have liked in terms of supporting the recommendations that the committee subsequently made so we did follow that up with some written advice and then turned that into a for council so the staff reports supports and endorses setting a target date for 2030 for the Christchurch City Council operations to become carbon neutral and we have a program in place and have plans to achieve that and essentially they start with reducing our admissions then look at sequestering our emissions through planting either our own planting or by purchasing credits and finally and only when we need to offsetting through trading so that that program is in place where there 's a difference is around the recommendations for the public transport fleet as we haven 't yet done sufficient work to support that transition within a six year period so we certainly support the going to a low-carbon option for transport of its emissions so that 's why that recommendation is amended and finally in terms of our target date for Christchurch City as opposed to the city council operations rather than signaling a carbon neutral by 2050 date we would like to do some more work around what the pathways to that would be and align that with whatever the national government is doing so the national government targets at the moment for 2050 central government sorry if it seems like a slightly bit of framing you made much beautiful phrasing so the central government targets at the moment for 2050 are a 50% reduction and they 're not looking at carbon neutral yet but that may come about and that will change the framework within which the city works so that will change key policy settings such as the emissions trading scheme and we would like to explore aligning what the city does with what central government in other major metropolitans are doing okay Sarah great thank you and looking at the staff recommendation number five we that differs substantially is that if we decided not to sign up to go with C 40 or not to sign up to anything it would mean that we weren 't doing a framework or sitting any targets at all unless we came back with a new resolution and so I 'm just wondering if the one that we had there already where it says investigate the framework and strategies is actually one that gives us a broader scope to do things in exactly the way you were talking about looking at the way different people were doing things in because all it 's all in our one is saying is investigating the frameworks for setting the 2050 target yes it does and and it it it doesn 't tie us to a target of being carbon neutral by 2050 but if we didn 't come up with that target it would look as though we were back tricking so I don 't want to I don 't want to articulate a target until we are clear about how we would make our way there so I mean other cities have set targets and in backtracked so it 's and it it rev yeah thanks question on carbon credits you said there was a process in place already for carbon credit purchase or is that just the new zealand emissions trading scheme but not from the council 's perspective the council has participated in terms of carbon credits in the past and under the scheme we could participate in the future so it 's so in terms of signing off on this and we signing off on any purchase of carbon credits no because this is about carbon neutral for the council 's operations by 2030 so we may be able to do that entirely by reducing emissions in the in sequestering carbon we may or may not need to purchase carbon credits we won 't know until we have much closer to the time thank you for covering some of the issues just one in your report I think it 's in five seven you refer to effect that council won 't be able to entirely avoid or reduce completely our emissions could you spritz explain it a bit further Helen just when we look at our missions profile and the very preliminary data but most of our missions from last financial year are based around transport and that includes aviation that includes shipping that includes cars buses and a whole range of emissions so that 's likely to be their biggest target and it 's probably gonna be in under 60% with the latest draft report but that 's cheap kerosene whole range of things the other area of air emissions around about 10 15 of stationary energy diesel from so that 's for the city I 'm sorry your questions back to make their councils activities that can be both they can be very so with the electricity where most of our carbon emissions comes from electricity and because of around about 85 percent renewable supply with electricity we 've always got that 15 percent we 're aiming for 90% over nationally weimar for ninety percent so electricity is actually councils biggest emission of carbon at the moment because not all our electricity is from hydros it 's well we 've got the two coal burning power stations and on in some guess it 'll change over time as we can deal with that by 2030 going well with electrification that was still got what we 'd is the electricity come from in regards to its remaining emissions diesel stationary activity and with boilers etcetera now with Council we can work council activities we can work on that and are looking at that but the HID yeah looking forward into the future the expectation is probably still going to be some emissions that we can mitigate in 2030 so we need to plant trees or we need to buy carbon credits right but will aim for litigation answer is the scope in terms of mitigating those effects by so big the big program of planting trees which has been suggested either on the portals on a red zone if the scope to sufficiently mitigate that 's what we 'll be investigating with offsetting the mitigating is very much fuel switching will being more energy efficient with electricity yes so getting the emissions down first as always the prime target and then if there 's still emissions to get to the net carbon target you need to plant trees or one more question of when a just it 's a round what you referred to in terms of the the costs of convert of converting air Airbuses say to electric electric and you 've indicated that those are unknown but I 'm just wondering if you can give us some current information has to help what those sort of costs might be it is early days because this is a public arena I can 't tell you too much about a current project on on that areas commercial but not in too distant future that will be made public and that will be quite a potentially exciting project to keep that sort of data but the cost of battery electric zero emission buses is is falling and the slides and pears and they are operating overseas now we don 't need to trial them it 's really cost peter maintenance because you haven 't got these or engines and all the things that go with net so over time the prices are coming down and greater production of those buses so that 's the sort of work helen was mentioning there with the current knowledge that we have with where the buses are going but it is rapidly progressing overseas okay I wouldn 't mind just working through these individual recommendations from the committee so that we can just understand whether it 's whether some of the concerns perhaps that staff might have had and our are necessarily problematic so let 's go straight to number three which is request staff to work with the innovation of sustainable development committee to investigate a framework and strategies but setting a target of Christchurch being net carbon neutral by 2050 that doesn 't actually commit us to 2050 it 's an aspirational statement but it was as dependent on I 'm bringing back a framework and strategies to achieve that so we got a problem really with going that far I mean I hear what you 're saying in terms of yeah I mean I hear what you 're saying in terms of not wanting to backtrack but I feel quite disappointed if really we couldn 't develop a framework and strategies for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 for our city I me wants to say to you that we 'd like to have more information to give you more certain advice on that but there 's a report coming to the innovation and sustainability committee later in November on the signing up to the government and as a climate action plan within there that requires us to see the target and we 'd like to consult on that with the community consensus that we arrived it so it doesn 't actually set the target and it just talks about as you say investigating a framework and strategies but what we want to do is get on with it I don 't think anything the staff are saying where they come back with proposed plans for how we how we do this and the framework and what works and whether this is achievable is in any way contradictory no no no and and that 's what I 'm getting yet but but but I also quite like the the staff recommendation that we linked us to the work that they 're doing on the Global Covenant of me as the kind of are doing that anyway and you know every but I wonder whether they can be a reporting back mechanism that specifically mentions that and you will see yeah and this context table number three okay that one do you like to add well presumably within that time frame you 're not going to be able to come up with the framework and the strategies but you will but but as signing up to the Covenant does mean setting a target so and if that 's coming back to us and November as the as there 's some wording in here that we could just simply note after number three that that staff will be reporting back to the Committee on the program of works to implement the Global Covenant of Mears for climate and energy telephone is that does that sort of kind of because I I kind of want to link the two because they are related but I 'm also picking up what Sarah said and that is you don 't want it to be mutually exclusive so recommendation five the staff recommendation five is more specific about for Christchurch City to be carbon neutral as part of the appropriate weeks and what but I 'm suggesting that we 're likely to as a council to support what the committee has come up with and but as I don 't want to lose what what you 're also saying there which is that it 's contained within a program of works at the same you know so so that there 's a link between the work that we 're doing on the global covenant of me as for climate and energy yes so I like your idea of hitting the note yeah just put that a note after three note that staff will be reporting to innovation and sustainability committee later in November later in November on the on progress on signing up to the global Covenant of Mayors the climate and energy relation to their action plan to will be will be to consider a recommendation to sign up yeah and once we 've signed up we are committed to producing right ok exciting you know that staff will be reporting to the committee and November on to sign and then just take out the risk the words to there and then put a comma at the end and say which would require us theme to sit a it requires us to see the target for carbon reduction to see a target for carbon reduction is it I am 16th 16th of November we added some extra ones Mike for carbon carbon reduction isn 't it yes yep right that 's right yeah now inviting and challenging all other Canterbury councillor wisdom for you actually have to challenge them you know invite us okay it 's basis and right and we can take out especially Environment Canterbury if you like now we 're bleep leaving including invite other other Canterbury councils actually no no it just yep yep yep yep including my own hit agree to adopt the same targets and and develop now to adopt the same targets is fine what do we to consider adopting the same time time yes back to consider adopting the same targets we changed this about six times at the committee said yeah I know it 's way later I the Kenda Romero and I 'm just you know that they 've actually established yeah so help working group on climate change which is significant steps little steps are important the inserted it right take out and develop their path to achievement yeah it 's kind of like yeah but now the the joint public transport committee I 've just been to an international conference on on intelligent transport solutions and we don 't have an intelligent transport public transport system I didn 't have to go to the conference to know but I 've come back absolutely determined to get to the get to the right solution this is my real personal target for the next two years we will have a fully integrated public transport system for Christchurch and its two neighboring districts and we 're gonna don 't doesn 't though everyone will tell you that they 're putting on hard wired infrastructure unto the ground when you 've got autonomous vehicles coming as a waste of time thank you no I didn 't don 't didn 't the yani was encouraging me to say it because but he is absolutely right so I use that yani knife a hundred percent of the total agreement on the Smitha now so let 's can we reframe this so that because there are a number of issues that the joint committee has to address in terms of existing contracts which start expiring from the end of next year and I 'm personally of the view that we should roll them over while we actually redesign the public transport system for our area you know and I 've started conversations with some people who are going to be very influential in this area so can we just say that in the meantime ask the representatives of the joint public transport Christchurch cities Christ CCC 's or count invite the Christchurch City Council representatives on the joint public transport committee to report to your committee with with an update on how to address carbon emissions in relation to proposed changes to the public transports it 's something I know he 's like yeah but I like the idea of meeting with those committee representative and working through how we do this to meet what the sustain innovation system sustainable innovation and sustainable development committee to to develop options or yeah to develop options for public transport that will reduce I mean develop options to reduce carbon emissions and public transport yeah it will reduce carbon emission carbon emissions in public transport and do you want to say and to create certainty for the contractors about the future of electric vehicles and public transport yeah probably okay you can well no no we don 't_''_1432.1 I mean we should discuss I get it that 's funny okay boys yeah okay if I get my way it will be okay that 's important we were aligned on this we are totally aligned on this it 's not a conference so I 'm aligned with you unless I 'm aligned with Yanni on the other one so it will go you transport steps of the joint thickness enough that way all right and then the other one we 're basically agreed on in terms of our recommendations anyway yep yep yep you happy with that mr. C get it very good we don 't 't allowed to it though I 'm very happy with the changes I think especially for example around the joint PT clearly we 're a part of a partnership and I think working this way will certainly get there and so you know I 've always been adamant about the need for reducing and eliminating our carbon emissions especially on sea sea level rise I 'm very happy to see these No I think there 's been some positive changes made and I think they should be work I hope that what the staff they will be very workable motion oh sorry Helen did you want to I 'm sorry you 've just got reduce the impact of carbon emissions could we simply hear from reduce carbon and I think I started a different yeah they were reducing emissions yeah right okay I 'll put the motion light quickly talk to it cuz obviously this is actually quite an important decision we 're making today obviously one of the strategic priorities we we set ourselves was to be climate change leaders and this is well maybe not leading in the we know it 's very achievable right now if we spend a lot of money just to do the office it 's it 's actually a really good target it gives us something to work towards while we actually reduce our emissions to a point that the offsets will be actually quite low and costs and what we 've already seen today with the LEDs is actually when we start looking to reduce our carbon we can actually create lists effects for for the council and around the world people actually see and when they sit these targets and work towards them they actually improve the local economy so this is actually a really really good step and this is saying we should all be proud of as a council in the direction we are heading in the 2050 obviously you know that 's that 's a good target to have and I think now we have the right government in place and is a climate lift governor Mason there 's a climate change Minister and it is the right move lift Minister in there so this is actually really along the way all right Oh yummy to make a very quick point which was I was fortunate enough to be on the council 's Hearing Panel into the climate smart policy and ironically we were allowed to call it climate change for risk of offending the government and so I just wanted to reiterate how nice it is that we 've finally seen a change of government that actually takes this issue seriously and we can actually start talking about climate change because our climate is changing and this is I agree with what councilor Davidson was saying that it is really important that we start getting I think as a council you know for the last decade we 've gone backwards we used to be a very progressive world leading council I think we 've got an opportunity to start trying to get back to that and I think that started about four years ago so you know I think this is a work in progress but I guess the other thing is that we had the most amazing unique opportunity after the earthquake out of that natural different in terms of embracing an environmentally sustainable future and while some of that opportunity has been lost we always should have hoped that there 's still things we can do with huge projects and and money being spent as we go forward to actually be that still if we if we can get things like this through so now I look forward to this opportunity I think you know it is important to take it especially with the change of government which hopefully will be a much more collaborative way in which we can work together and you know just to reiterate you know 400 million being spent on the inaccessible city for a fixed system of hubs and spikes which may be obsolete in five years it just is massive amounts of money we 're spending on hard infrastructure in our city when we know the world is changing and changing very quickly so it 's really good that were looking at this today David I 'm going to abstain on this motion either Phil I don 't have quite the information I would need to support this the city becoming carbon neutral by 2030 however the other piece of information in my mind needs to be further worked on I 'm always mindful of the fact that the Icelandic volcanoes spewed here more carbon and half an air than the world and saved in the previous 30 years so I probably need some more information and whatever to bring me over bring me across a bit further but I do support the notion of the city becoming carbon neutral but I will up stands clean be yeah thank you and I respect my colleague gave it 's a few yeah while you are away how many times do you think the the coastal bill would board as a whole board you know acknowledge climate change and its objectives to mirror the council 's and and its Community Board plan I think that 's exciting I think it reflects the setting in which our boards are so in the residential red zone I see a tremendous opportunity to have a carbon opposite offset with you know tree planting in cetera a quarter of those hectares would yield I a quarter was planted in trees that could be a living laboratory for children we already have the programs and groups in place to you know kind of make it a living laboratory and mitigating the effects of climate change also the easy uptake we 're ahead of our own targets I noticed that with Kiwis and their propensity to take on new things like smartphones we shift up the international letter pretty asked and we sort of like getting gadgets and new things and being progressive and I think now we 're gonna reach a tipping point over our TVs and other things as well we 're going to be real leaders so lining up with the new government great way to go Vicki I think one of the things that was noticeable in the last month was the feeling of over know if you guys felt it of intense relief that there was finally a government in New Zealand that wasn 't going to drop us to the bottom of Carbon action in the world and that as a privileged developed country we were actually going to play think that 's incredibly exciting and way overdue and I think it 's really really important that every city around the world realizes that they are going to have to be the leaders in climate change for the possibility that this planet remains habitable for for people actually the planet will be fine it 's just the people where people when the creatures that live here that won 't but I notice in the data here that the the tons per person out of Christchurch just seven point eight tons per person of carbon emissions which is higher actually than Auckland which is not a situation you want to be in and at seven point five tons and Wellington 's at five point seven so Christchurch has a long way to go and I think it 's fantastic that we 're actually starting there we know that this is not going to be an easy journey and that it 's going to be one that we have to start now in order to get to we 've seen the vivid report the OECD report their parliamentary commissioners report we know still need to do more to meet to meet what needs to happen and we also know very clearly from the climate change in business conference and every presentation there that what business and groups and organizations want is certainty around targets and knowing we 're the direction of travelers so that the way ahead of most governmental organizations and I think creating that start of that journey of certainty is absolutely impressive and so I think it 's fantastic that the City Council is actually going to do this and do it well yeah sorry I mean sorry I 've invited the mover of the resolution to speak to toasters for debate I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no that 's carried and abstention report of a deceased thank you _"

    "text": "I just like to acknowledge how my colleague here Trevor Cattermole and [Music] item number 21 greater christchurch regeneration at canterbury sports you 're all fighting over so rex moved us Andrew I heard fit the second second dirt are there any questions for staff it 's just just one so hang on I 'm sorry Yanni but just you know you aren 't the only person that also Mike Ben Sira then yeah where I 'm who 's who 's dealing with this one we 're just trying to get Richard but no ask the crystal well we might be able to deal with it okay bye Richard Mike Davidson 's just asked a question around the cost of going through this regeneration a proposal for Canterbury sports so we 're in going to enter into discussions with Canberra sportsmanship with regard to them paying for the technical reports that we 'll need to support any section 71 regeneration plan that may be put forward by council so initial discussions are that comfortable with that but we haven 't yet concluded exactly what the scope for those pieces of as infrastructure so we 've done saying someone was the Cranford base I 'll just so you get an idea of of course this is a private development and we 're obviously stretched a bit warfare money so just one word gets a lot bigger around the dollar terms kind of cost in terms of staff timing mmm I think this one will be considerably easier than Cranford Cranford was complicated by virtue of the fact of the or a number of reasons really transport as well as the quality of the soils that were very peaty in the depths of groundwater we don 't think there 's any similar sorts of issues out on the site here so I don 't want to put a ballpark maybe a hundred to a 200 okay I 'd say but but possibly at the lower end of let 's go in just finally obviously this is quite a good sporting complex with quite a lot of stuff including an aquatic facility in there which is quite closely located to another proposed one is there any concern about actually the closeness between these Christchurch in the potential of these competing against our own facilities yep that 's been an issue which has been raised by a sport some Ric people there is other proposed aquatic facilities which you 've alluded to and that 's one of the issues that we 've raised with Kendra sports and I think that will be something that will need to be addressed as part of the process that 's here thanks a couple of quick questions and firstly I know there was some questions early on with the Cranford region plan and especially with that the potential conflicts here does it actually meet the test for using the region act like is it regeneration or is it just is it something new as such at the product development it 's the only way that we can actually change our district plan at the moment I know I know that but I 'm just wondering that it meets the test we get to do a full report on it and that 's why there as you 'll see the resolutions are to undertaking this serie technical work to our initial viewers that you so does I 've had discussions with regenerate all notice and while we currently working with them to work out now who pays the Kostas and the technical work that 's not covered by the resolution so if we pass this resolution today and they decided not to pay costs would we be lumped with them because we 've passed the resolution and or should we put a note in the resolution to say that we are the that maybe it 's contingent on them paying some of those costs you said we could do that we 're as I said we get to draft the scope of works for those technical works yet so until we do that we don 't know what the exact costs for doing it will be and then we need to sit down and agree that that be responsible for them so we 're just not at that stage yeah quite like to say that as part of the resolution but they 've responsible for I mean could they actually undertake some other technical work themselves they could yeah 's who it might be that they do that but a work sometimes yes they might engage the on themselves or and also for some of the transportation we can look to do some of that and house ourselves it just just because the resolutions needs to reach stuff to undertake the necessary work means that should they choose not to it means that we have directed staff to do it even though there 's a cost and it would give them an ouch for paying they would they were just go why you 've been told you have to so we 're not going to pay for it so I think that having something and they would be really useful work was it paid for but though that the various proponents under Cranford development with that one we had a lot of the work had been done as part of the district plan review because they were submissions on that so we sought to utilize a lot of the work that we had to do for our evidence for for that so no it wasn 't contributed to by proposal wasn 't this proposal put up as an amendment to the district plan in front of the independent hearings panel you said well so I think the key thing with the infrastructure is that you know the pipes just don 't quite reach the site so you know it 's a matter of who 's gonna pay for that and and that 's probably what the an infrastructure assessment will say and that 's the evidence that we gave at the independent hearings penalize per the district plan review for transport you know a lot of it will come down to parking on site and obviously NCTA will have a keen interest in it given a state highway network in and around there and the other one is like to be a visual impact assessment I don 't think the visual impact was my recollection I can 't recall whether that was traduced well at the independent hearings panel but yep so some of the work has been done but but we 've once standalone documents I think to support a process which were robust so that we could more work will definitely need to be done well could we get you to do the preliminary the necessary preliminary work to support the application and bring that back as quickly as possible because that you know the thing that a number of us felt was that this was a plan change that should have been able to be person you know progressed through the district clean review I remember a number of us Jonnie I think you raised it and and it wasn 't able to be progressed in that and their context so you know I sort of feel a little bit of a need from certainly from my perspective to see this really you know given given some focus of attention and and do due diligence but you know get on with that sort of things get on with it just to clarify with the district plain review they get resigned from rural 5 which is basically a rule we have infringe and the operative plan to open space community parks so just a plain review did introduce an open space zone to it so that did to do just not make the density that they want to it so and and the key thing that was struggling with at that point was that the panel you know made some comments about saying what does appear on face value to stick out for what the applicants proposed however it was outside the urban limits so that was as far as week ago in terms of our evidence in terms of being accordance with that those higher order documents and that was as far as the panel were comfortable with going as well so we did make quite a bit of progress as part of that but we were limited by the higher order document being the regional policy statement which said well you know it 's outside the other limits so you can 't really rezone a for Metropolitan facilities because they 're as metropolitan urban a nature so that 's where it got to a bit of a dilemma as part of that process yonni I thought we were doing we were trying to get a change to the RPS and pecan refused to do that 't quite like that a configur was that there was a view that it was the other way around that we were holding it up because it would compete with our facilities but that is not the case either I understand that originally we had we had like two or three options one was to go through the district plan review but there was also the option around the land use recovery plan when that got amended and there was another option around the original policy statement now I know that we 've moved on from from there this is the only way you can mean both of them at the same time yeah so that process around the cannery regional policy statement that that 's pretty much there 's no opportunity there with the new government or new you can no I so you can looking at a full review of the regional policy statement sometime 2020 ish plus so that might start now so you know picking discrete things out and doing them on an ad hoc basis is not something that they favor but then understand I 're not opposed if anything that that 's important but this is kind of it 's almost be careful what you wish for yawning because a change the regional policy statement will take years we 'll know in toad that 's right under classes I will take man like our district plan we can do private plan changes or amendments when it under normal circumstances not now but yeah you know it so my understand was II can can also make changes to the original policy statement like on an individual level so it 's something now I think under Section 60 of the resource management we can request to change to the regional policy statement ourselves but obviously you know we would come undone with our own district plan order on council issues so the the analysis that we have done and the achæans done indicates that that should the council be in support of this proposal that at the moment Greater Christchurch region eight pathway is the best way forward just in regards to that there 's two options there 's a region plan and entry section 71 about the huge amount of technical work that we 're about to embark on for this when we could use one of those options which wouldn 't require as much technical work now to get it through and then that would just become a part of a normal designation so the designation aspects why don 't we not just go down that road plates require technical reports the minister would not make an intervention without having the backing of the report that they can rely on I 'm sure they 'd be report back things the liver of information and the process around the are quite different the section 71 is a lot quicker and less requirements this onerous so so in terms of section 71 that that again we 've we 've deliberately kept the resolution on orbit vagin and that regard I guess the risk worth it is that once it goes out for public consultation and and goes to the minister before going through its other steps then it 's a yes or no decision of the minister so you mean it 's where it becomes a process where you go all that seems like a good idea yet would probably a good idea to amend the section 71 you don 't have that luxury so there is a risk and there is a I guess the onus on the proponent to make sure that they get everything right before you put it out for public consultation so the the region plan processes is you 've obviously got your outline that 's more time-consuming process but but the little of technical information you 'd need for both of these doesn 't fall away depending on which one you use it still be the same the minister would still be looking forward to know that you have got the infrastructure yep what are the visual effects what 's the transport look like so all those things will need to be answer answered regardless of whether you go through a session 71 I just can redeem contrast it to the very limited information we 've had around regular school or that I 'm not gonna enter into a conversation about regeneration planning to do with another site so I 's in front of us today so if there are no more questions I 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye yes you can speak to it and I won 't be voting in favor of this today purely because well I think the concept of the actual development itself is absolutely fantastic I would like to go ahead what we 're doing is we are directing staff to do something that is currently unbudgeted in unco stood and I 'm really really weary of asking staff to do something when we don 't have the money set aside we 'll know how much it 's going to be I wasn 't going to here is an opportunity to for somebody who wants to develop privately amazing facilities in a part of town that doesn 't actually have facilities like that at all it 's obviously got a very sports focused not general public in mind but the fact that somebody wants to do this privately with their own money on their own land and it misses out on the city boundary by a whisker yeah as as those facilities for those people who think sport is really really important in their life and want to spend a lot of time doing it to actually have those facilities and we would love for them to be provided and that 's the simple thing as far as I can see I just think this is a really easy lovely opportunity for us to take and I 'm delighted that he 's doing this and that he 's doing it in your test it 's great any other comment uni yeah I mean you know this has been such a long time and coming and there 's been huge information I think going through district planning processes appreciate there might be some additional work but you know I think again like we 're really fortunate having someone that wants to commit to this sort of facility you know ironically I compared the car parking that they 've already got five hundred and thirty car parks what they 're doing now and and and you can trust that to the central city metro sport so it 's about the equivalent its development so you know I would hope that there 's not a huge need to do a huge amount of technical work given how much work we 've already done around sports facilities aquatic facilities there must be a simple way I think of getting their information appreciate things like the sewer and the technical information around around the waters connections etc but from a from a point of view of this is someone that 's been wanting to do things for a long time in the city and the planning process has created so many I think delays and confusion it would be really good to get some certainty to this development so that we can get this process sorted so you know I have a view of which one we should use through the regeneration act I appreciate your going to do more work on that I would hope that you 're looking at you know what is the the most cost effective efficient way to get a decision on this site as soon as possible given the history of it so I welcome that work coming it would be really good at some stage as Council to get the strategy and work planning program because at the moment agree with some councils that are raising concerns like we don 't actually have an overview as a council over the strategy and planning work program we haven 't had that for a number of years and it would be quite good just to know how much resource we 've got what it 's going towards so that we don 't get into these situations where there 's one one thing coming up and then we don 't know what 's possibly missing out I very supportive of us and I endorse it No thank you as one that 's generally supported all sport and recreation facilities and one that 's appreciated the support we 've had for stuff in the eastern suburbs are more than happy to support this resolution thank you okay I 'll just wrap this up because I think that this is really important this I remember going to the opening of the football facility that the individual who owns us then was had consenting took compared to the development of the site and it was an exponential difference now that was a neighbor who objected with with our central government for new leaders sort of powers to come to the to support the regeneration of the city and we need to use them and I think we should be actively promoting and supporting thus the asset that it will provide for the city will far outweigh the technical advice and support that the council gives at this stage so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried sir it 's an abstention from Jamie who should have just stayed out of the room until he heard that yeah I hate voting on things yeah it didn 't take that on the voters right the next item is the _"

    "text": "well it was but are there any questions I 've got Pauline kammath moved at Mike Davidson has seconded it and yannis has a question yes but I still don 't have a really clear answer about the prices like normally these things would go through the committee we had a committee meeting scheduled yesterday that was canceled because it wasn 't anything on the agenda and I just don 't understand like given that we 've had other reports to the committee around the contingency fund and all the pressures that we 've got on it why this is coming in isolation and not going through that process welcome my tena koe everyone the reason that 's missed out on the comedian comes straight to Council as a matter of urgency we really need to keep this building this facility moved from its current location to McFarland Park so we can start on the sin orphans community center rebuild doesn 't explain the question which is we had a committee meeting scheduled for yesterday which this could have come to what why wasn 't it put there I wouldn had to have come onto the agenda after it had been to the cat to the meeting which means that it wouldn 't be here today we 've just done that for finance actually we 've got a report from finance that okay so it could have happened but it doesn 't so what tell me tell me where this makes a difference in terms of considering this particular because we 've got all these other community facilities that also have pressures on our contingency well this is now getting into debates just deal with questions to staff so how the decision was made to bring it straight to council rather then take it to a commitment or a committee meeting because it wasn 't sufficient time in between Pauline we 're just asking staff to clarify so this building belongs to the lives so even though it is coming from where it was in st. Albans the Lions still owners know they will be actually gifting it to us so it will be a building but now they own it every moment so in the value of that building thousand right and so the council is we pay you 're asking for next 125 plus 170 225 yes we already have funding through the annual plan for 100 this 125 is what we 're asking for today in with the building thing with two one six plus four lines paying for the move yes they are so yeah there 's a little table here on page two which describes what the contribution from Lions International is so 272 270 mm and total from the lines so basically about buying your second ever seen basically the community it surely the trustee will be giving a community seem to lend it on site and all plunder with the car park etcetera for a cost of two hundred twenty-five thousand from the City Council yeah drink turning 40 yeah would you consider there to put notice extremely good value when you consider what a cost for a community standard to be the establishment a million visible thank you and the mic here and just a quick check on our process so you the fact that a community facility whether it 's moved from the overall facilities rebuild contingency fund does that mean that if we for example don 't have quite enough money for the Woolston facility to get a fit for purpose facility that we can also as a community board request money from that contingency fund yeah my cool Garin yeah quite suddenly yes that 's great because we had a board resolution or reading on it let 's go and do the other issues but are there any more questions on this particular measure Yanni it just seems like a huge amount of money to just relocate a building the question just straight to the question we 're not going in to debate you please sir have we got the costs have we got either peer-reviewed or several quotes for the cost of doing this and why is it so far yeah absolutely when I came in here look at this project to begin with and one of the concerns with this project is that it sounds easy taking a building from one park and putting it on another and I 've quite a head that view myself in talking about car parks you 're talking about accessible building you 're talking about plumbing signage you know it 's its power its it is expensive foundations so sorry have we exhausted competitive quite have we gone out for two different quotes thank greens like the was the same back teeth that was looking at this in we challenged the quote and he actually has come exhausting see that it 's very competitive and it 's actually like low price to get it done so I 'm sorry so we do have we do have like competitive quotes we did we haven 't gone out for a second quote or anything like that but you know Dave works with the industry all the time and say you know is what 's reasonable and what 's not so okay just um yeah I mean I guess I 'm also just surprised if we put money on budget through our annual plan why the amount we put on was so much less than what was needed oh yeah that 's outlined in the report and page two so you know compliance costs planning as we 've come to resource consent stage yeah his raise the total cost any other questions open it up for debating morning we can so closely with the Lions who 've been really generous to Christchurch to this area and said Albans and Shirley have been a little bit under the radar and how hard they 've been with the earthquake the Shirley Trust is really looking ahead to try and raise money to build a really good center there or in that area somewhere there 's a real need this will actually keep them started will they allow them to start having a conceit picture and here 's the tiny little wee tiny wee area that 's been working out of it 's probably going to get really really tiny and the programs he 's running out of they were just amazing they 've got a really good outreach into the community the ethnic diversity in there is incredible that door not they 've got really on top of what was a quite a serious game for the in that area over the years and I just trust to have a base and to begin really stepping up their programs and really getting some activation and the community and they look at some actors as a prime example of what can be done these people are on the first rung and this is going to be an incredible benefit and I think that I personally you know how community board is so grateful to the Lions Club for the generosity and providing this building I think we 're really really fortunate to have it and and I believe that they are intending to gift it at this point which is even better and the next year and March they want to have their giving an international convention here which people from the Lions coming out from overseas and they 're wanting to make sure around this building so this is an incredible wooden fishery and I think we 're very lucky and I am very grateful for it so please support it thank you you know I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "so that 's everything from Italy so now moving on to the regulatory performance committee options to support the relocation of street based sex workers to address residents concerns item 19 and Dave I 'll come to you to introduce this item please this has been a incredibly sensitive sometimes quite divisive and in a difficult situation to resolve I 'd like to acknowledge the difficulties that the local residents have had to endure however excuse me however Council have engaged with the local residents on the basis for a bylaw development on the basis that the police supported and would enforce the bylaw however developing a Boyle law to regulate the location of street based sex workers there 's quite legally complex and under the current legislative framework this is largely due to the limited enforcement tools available under the Local Government Act 2002 and in respect to general vile or making powers I believe we still need to show a positive reinforcement and a commitment to the people in this area and as part of the spoil recommendation before you today there is the development of a multi-agency the police have have advised that they are unable under the current legislative framework to be able to enforce any Boyle or that we created but I really would like to encourage the police to have an intensive presence in this area to discourage the activity north of BDF we have made some minor changes to the staff recommendation we have not precluded creating a boiler in the future we 've inserted the words at the stage and should the legislative provisions around by law enforcement change in the future well it may be an option that we could consider again with amended clause 5 to ask for quarterly reports on the progress of work with this community reference group to come back to us to back to the regulatory compliance committee and in Clause 6 we 've added a provision asking that council would consider funding initiatives that have been presented by this collaborative community working group to be considered so the excuse me the recommendation as there before you I think it 's reasonably self-explanatory and as I said it was it 's been an extremely difficult situation a community that 's extremely frustrated and annoyed at the activity that is continuing in this area and unfortunately a boil or at this stage is not able to give the police the the powers to enact it and make it effective and I 've said on many occasions there 's no point in having a pile or if we can 't enforce it and that 's essentially where we 've come to today it doesn 't leave the residence with much comfort and that 's why I 'm saying that we as a council I think still need to be showing some positive reinforcement in terms of commitment to activities that we can pursue to address the problem in this area and as I said earlier I really do encourage the police to take in a really intensive presence in the area to actively discourage the activity further I 'm happy to defer to the team up the front for any questions may arise all right so thanks Dave for that introduction I mean clearly there 's been some this has come here to counsel before this clearly been thanks for um detailing that tours we 've got staff at the table are there any questions for staff on the report that 's in front of us so Dion and then Pauline and then Glen what is the reason that we can 't make a bottle we could make a bylaw but it 's about whether the vinyl will be workable and enforceable and because the only vinyl making power that we can use as the general Baili making power and the Local Government Act the only enforcement tool available in their act is for that bottle making power is prosecution and that 's extremely difficult and a workable sentence for this issue so under the prostitution Reform Act two thousand three and six and 14 by laws regulating location of brothels if that part of the legislation actually mentioned street based sex workers could we create a Bible that would be enforceable an amendment to the prostitution Reform Act with a new bylaw making power that specifically looked at regulating street their sex work and had Rick with an appropriate enforcement powers for the police would be very it currently stands doesn 't allow us to do a workable bylaw I 'd like to ask that I 'd like to actually put an amendment into this and actually see if we can work with the government to pose of it we see request a review of the prostitution Reform Act to to look at street based six-week because at the time when it was taken out I win that when the prostitution Reform Act was was done in 2000 2003 it actually talked and said they didn 't put straight both sex work in but they will look at it if it became a problem I just wonder as a point of order mr. chair yeah maybe through debates a good time well that 's somewhere that we 're so in terms of process we 're talking about an amendment to a resolution that hasn 't yet been moved or seconded so Dion are you suggesting that you would like to be the mover of this but in an amended form no so you 're going to wait till somebody moves in seconds what 's in front of 'd like to move an amendment yep so can you work on the wording of what you want that amendment to be so that we can debate it at that time yep so if you work on the wording of the amendment that you may choose to put once this has been moved and seconded by others because you 're not wanting to move it will then deal with that amendment at that time rather than debating an amendment now which hasn 't been put to a resolution which has neither been moved nor seconded okay let 's now move to the next question which is Pauline 's [Music] non-regulatory approached at that point we believed that we had the support of the police to assist us in enforcing a violent that was implemented and during the course of the working groups we discovered that that support was no longer available whatever reason the police had and I think partly it was resisting but probably the challenges are actually enforcing that so if I got that you have so would that situation still exist if we went down to young Act included a new bylaw making power and it involved related enforcement powers they 're specifically empowered the police then that would be a workable situation the example we have is probably the alcohol and public places by law under Section 1 4 7 of the Local Government Act so that 's a bylaw but it has specific enforcement powers that allow the police to issue instant fines and to arrest people for breaching that particular bylaw so if they were appropriate enforcement powers then they would change the situation there 's two reasons why police are unable to really commit to enforcing a bylaw with this food base its food isn 't it as it was January and even understanding if there is different legislation in place and then different rules about evidence-gathering would apply and in 2012 when the council submitted on the Medicare bill about regulation of street prostitution first submission that the council made was not strictly on the bill I was asking the select committee to recommend amendments to the prostitution or reform act not to provide the council of final making powers but to could be an appropriately enforced and that would appropriately recognized the health and safety issues for the workers and they end the submission also pointed to the fact that the focus of legislation and other areas was on the client rather than the sexual services provider so there is some groundwork if you like that the council 's already done back in 2012 and that we can build yeah there 's a desire to approach the government to keen about I mean it 's the heck there is some groundwork already that 's being done by the council but not with a focus on giving council volume a house just about not involving the council having legislation that deals with the street basics because that police can force can enforce directly in just secondly and the non regulatory approach out of the working group we have actually expanded the working group working group I know the will continue so can you tell me who it 's working progress so it 's developing and changing day by day at the moment so it 's in the process of being set up including other groups that are active in the central city anywhere of different church groups and Department of Corrections whether there 's any options there for people that might be on remand and whether any other legal tools could be used there of course includes already the police to prostitutes collective youth and cultural development in Salvation Army community and public health so there 's a number of other NGOs or government agencies or other bodies that will be involved in that as well as of course the residents and and both areas in a sense because one issue is that people north of be Li EV who are wanting to make the prostitutes down to the central city area and also the residents in the Central City area that may be impacted by that change so it 's the size of that right thank you thank you okay so I 've got Glen mic Phil and Sarah Glen okay thank you at one point we were talking perhaps 11 or 16 workers at its peak I think now has there been a change in the last couple of weeks week whether everything else might be they have been up to four operating in the particular area of concern at its height that the number of around 16 was some time ago now numbers have been declining quite a bit and particularly in the last six months and there 's been a lot of work done by the outreach workers so that 's those three NGOs and have been forming relationships and talking with the street based sex workers initially they were trying to work on behavior while the workers we 're located in that area but more recently they 've been trying to encourage them to move out of the area and there has been largely successful for most people okay an entirely different question do you know that you know is there an appetite and the collective to seek legislative changed from the view of affording greater protection to those working on the street then there is now a with an end that it might actually serve to oppress what we try to address here but also you know provide greater protection and we note since the introduction profile mirrors so we would want greater protection for those working not to speak on behalf of the New Zealand prostitutes collective but I would say that there as an advocate group advocacy group for strip ethics because in sex because generally they are interested in anything that would improve an assist with the health and safety for the workers but they are opposed to regulation that may inadvertently mean that this situation is more dangerous for example anything that seeks to to push street-based sex workers an effect underground or out of sight out of mind it can lead to a lot of safety issues for them so in a lot of places where regulation has been proposed I think quite strongly against it because they 're concerned that it could antennae vertically increase the danger for the workers right okay thanks Steve thank you Mike thank you so obviously a lot of the issues but hear from residents there 's obviously about the nuisance caused that I see is costly from that the sex workers which could happen across the whole city for various reasons not just some around it or nuisance in general there there 's a range of different things covered by legislation more generally mostly in their summary offences it but a lot of those though they are there in primary legislation they can be difficult to enforce because often situations need to be witnessed as as things are occurring in terms of things like yelling and noise and voice noise and vehicle noise they 're not covered particularly well but a range of issues that have been identified through these reports and by residents as occurring are covered by a number of pieces of legislation so we 've actually got the tools in place it 's just that I guess the policemen aren 't able to enforce what we what is the already including resourcing being there at the time to witness offences happening is probably the biggest issue and we can find the remnants of the activities you know such as discarded syringes or condoms or whatever but actually taking there and to Ackerson in in bad to chant something it 's actually just looking at clear if this isn 't a it direction and actually creating a boil all that we don 't need one of the reasons why we think that the collaborative partnership approach would be a good approach that it 's about building relationships and talking with people and affecting culture change um so that can have more of an impact than just attempting to to come down on people thank you so now I 've got Phil Sarah and and timpz of film so look I 'm pleased to hear that the outreach workers have you know have made some impact on shifting theory of most consume but I 'm just wondering about have we either enough resource or resources there to actually support the creation of the collaborative community group because I had understood that in fact that was also underway so this one room kind of like have there been enough resources around it at the moment its staff time as the resource that we 've been using there is a recommendation that was moved at the committee around funding for any future we accept the partnership undertakes so the partnership is intended to be driven much about what that might involve or what may be worthwhile pursuing so in that sense the costs of those actions that the partnership might take are not yet known I 'm just wondering is it possible to because in fact was it you know it was sort of like a bit of a dichotomy this happened the previous council decision was to ask staff to look at the legislative possibilities and also to look at ways of supporting the six review so I 'm just wondering in fact if that whole process has become diluted by the focus by the focus on the regulatory approach and some of us have been focused on the real Ettore approach in in others in a team have been focused on the partnership approach which has been going alongside this approach yes it just seems that we have made great progress today and I 'm just wondering in fact will more legislation really assist this problem we 're hoping that the community of partnership will will be helpful and come up with options which will see a useful impact to help my people so Sarah and unlinked him Sarah thank you bills Christian Earth most of what I was going to aspects leading on that the three resolutions that we had originally from the 25th of May the continuing to work with relevant agencies and residents the working group the interagency group representatives and then they work on the viola one and would it be fair to say that the work on the bylaw actually took up quite a lot of time of the you know the interagency with all of those people and that was the key focus of the group rather than the other addressing the issue stuff it was sort of focused on the by the law rather than the other track it was in and also because we were delivering on that council resolution but also because it wasn 't until the completion of that project that the police confirmed their view is not supporting a bottle yeah so a lot of their energy at that time did but since that was confirmed some weeks ago now there 's been a lot more time to focus on the non weeks since that 's been confirmed by the police there 's been some progress quite quickly yes yeah meeting some things happen it these things do take time yeah progressing thank you and then Tim starts to clean up that was I believe part of the discussion it 's something that you are considering this there a number of different options there around additional rubbish bins or repositioning existing rubbish bins changing the frequency of street cleaning we 're also looking at siting a sharps disposal or medical disposal bin that success to the workers and south of Manchester sorry south of billion so that that could assist as well but some of it will hopefully come out through the partnership because the people involved in there are aware of where the specific problems are in what 's occurring so so we 're hoping that they will have an impact right thank you and in terms of involving the residents and the working party how does it look what kind of how would be what sort of action would be involved for them and what would your involvement look like point of business in it is everything all right okay really okay let 's can let 's continue as we were assuming everything really is okay yeah it looks like we 're okay I 'm sorry the residents level of involvement will depend on what the reasons would like it to be one important part is that it provides a an easy step conduit of information if they 're having particular issues of trouble that they can go and talk to the partnership so it should be more accessible I think it has been difficult in the past having a specific person or group or place to go within the big organization or Council to get concerns addressed so this is a way of making that happen so the beginnings of reaching out to those residents in getting people together as has been happening in the background great in final question is it would it be helpful to have any kind of indication of what kind of financial resource you need at this point in what we could and how we could support you we don 't have that yet is that it 's driven from the bottom up not from the top down so we haven 't been prescriptive and what issues the partnership will look at what might be helpful so I suspect that some of that will come along and the the recommendation to report back to the committee quarterly I suspect that issues as they 're identified in can be scoped will come to the committee thank you thank you Tim Thank You mr. chair um I guess for me I think there are two issues here and one is a more appropriate place in a safer place for the street workers which I mean it 's affect they 're not going to go away that they are effective life here but with any face to face transaction with which a business needs face to face if your client can 't get to tell you you 've got to shift so I 'm just wondering rather than looking at a bylaw what its regards to respect to u6 with on on street sex workers which has been very made very clear that it 's not supported vehicles on a street because Manchester Street is a dead end when it comes to me and she 's just us when it comes to each we 're at his Sherbourne Street to the west so we 're we have the restricted vehicles with regards to the land port and Port Hills Road and Hazeldine Road and many other areas around ear for etc so earth you made it impossible for the client to get to the product therefore the product has to move so if we and if we actually had better foresight and bit of vision well you know maybe we would have cleaned and done something better in town and close to the city on Manchester Street where they traditionally have worked but just in the short term because this is really what we 're talking because hopefully there will be plans to make a better in safe environment for them to work could we do that because we have residents that are being put out there 's a community that 's being affected and realistically to date nothing has worked and nothing is proposed to work beard night it 's irrelevant what 's happening a beard night for those reasons as a beard night so the question is have we thought about another way to do this which would be it 's a highly effective on we know that from the businesses that have been recovered from the DRAM costs if you like we know that it 's worked around the inner main port on port hills right off Port Hills Road so could that work here because each we wrote as a dead end it 's certainly something that has been looked at through this process and we 've looked at a number of things around no stopping lines or no stopping standing parking signs there are issues around enforcement of this activity happens late at night there issues around safety for enforcement as well you 're absolutely right the traffic flow has an impact and that 's one of the reasons why we have been hearing that the six workers have moved north is partly because of roadworks that 's been happening in the center of city that 's been stopping the through flow put in place you could build out the corners so that you physically can 't stop there as opposed to painting yellow lines or having some other enforceable tool we need to look at the basis for which those tools can be put in place whether they can be put in place for this particular issue or whether they 're related to traffic flow or traffic safety or other issues so we need to use the tools carefully and appropriately one but it will be looked at mom I understand the phantomon help because the the old shooting Papineau a community board and we looked at bringing in you know no stopping lines all the way down all sorts of things closing streets off everything but but you come to dealing a bit excuse the pun because anything you do like that you need to consult in as soon as you go out to consult get all the other streets around and say we 'll hang on you 're moving them from Manchester to Bishop Street were you 're moving from the mentees to the shoe board how do you would prove costly to consult in difficult to actually keep the it through to this we did try there may be two years ago yeah I guess but that 's why I was saying it 's kind of a to prompt and one is to supply an area debtors safer and to help EPS more traditional it wasn 't closer on Manchester Street because let 's face it Manchester Street has traditionally been the place for prostitutes to work whether it 's from in town right through to I guess kilmore Street and slightly to our Salisbury really seldom in the old days where they passed it so if we were to that 's a two-pronged attack to look at making a place more safe they traditionally were to move them all I guess it 's not your hand anything that 's what we 're looking at now we 're looking at distant sentence in the northern part in incentives and the southern part to encourage okay keen to stick to questions for the moment so yarny and then jimmy to committee get any advice around the future of Manchester program is that there 's a whole bunch of stress that are going to be closed to traffic as we 've seen with Wooster Street unfits Gerald so but related to Tim 's question like it seems to me that that would naturally actually stop the issue the thumb and it just seems to me like I don 't know where that 's got to but surely that 's something that could be a low-cost solution the information that we 've had from or talked about at the moment is that the the roadworks at the moment on Armour and Manchester Street will be completed around Christmas and it will change that link and then further south there are more changes proposed my understanding is a bits of prioritization of bus lanes in there will be Islands in it 's about traffic reduction so that it 's local traffic and not through traffic through that part of of the road and there will be some changes up to just south of Wall Street sorry I just pipin what Ellicott and phrasing it I 'm concerned that attacker o Sierra are areas that Tim 's talking about but non residential area of Manchester Street which will further push up north into the residential within the four hours that when we were first given the accessible city we were told that there 's a whole bunch of streets that will be closed across biele across Fitzgerald because the idea is to have a racetrack around the outside of the four oaks and that 's why we slow down the traffic and within the Kouros is they have a racetrack around so we 've done that for some streets but are you are we not aware of any plans to restrict any access across Manchester and Bailey at the moment other than what I just outlined no but the other thing is that a lot of this is unknown so if these things are put in place in a terrific sense that may dissuade the workers they may like it they may go there because it helps them so we 're not the the outcomes are all unknown at this stage so the changes in the central city might have might achieve what south towards a central city it may push them out further a lot of that is uncertain okay just a final question is just picking up on the security and the safety have we had any requests for additional security cameras and have we got a program in place I know we 've got a number of security cameras in the city that we put into different places is that something there has been raised through this group and through this committee and are we able to look at that as a kind of I just I guess there 's a more urgent or or short-term intervention Council cameras on the corner pictures I just wanted can we search the recommendations in front of us like as a yes the working groups under the only relevance to questions about how infrastructure might develop and so on is how workable is what 's in front of us likely to be and the answer is the environment that we 're working and could change in any number of ways an infrastructure development could be a part of that or may not be set of regulations in front of us that create a way forward so the relevance of any questions about the environment in which we 're working really are to inform whether what we 're agreeing to here is likely to be workable on I mean the answers were getting to a lot of these questions is there are things that have been planned but we we don 't know and that 's fair enough okay I 've got one more okay let 's let 's stick to process I 've got one more question which has been on one more person asking questions which is Jimmy will take Jimmy 's question and then we 'll move to a mover and a seconder will move into debate and we 'll get it sorted Thank You chair my question is that because the in the regulatory performance committee meeting of last time some of our fact leader residents they make a deputation based on their reputation they kind of emphasize request council develop a law it 's more effective but because the do Tula we consider is nanoucoco dandenong impossible so we know your animal support is the lung kind of the developer pilo but my questions regarding to the new the collaborative community working group the they have affected westerns representative will be in this group whether one of lost temper take the potato will be in this group or not if some other representative on their behalf whether they 're the are the resolution they would like to accept a loss of resolution for those affected at residence this my question the the residents that attended for the deputations ever been approached to be involved in this process if they would like to be involved in this process my understanding is that they are interested and they involved in seeing what what will come out of it okay all right so have we got a mover for the resolutions that are in front of us day based seconded Sarah Templeton okay so this has now been moved and seconded Deelen did you have your amendment that you wanted to put it 's up there approach the Ministry of Justice Minister of Justice to request a review of prostitution Reform Act in residential neighborhood areas would you like to speak to your amendment oh yes good point we need a seconder for the amendment is there a second Erin okay deal the reason I want to request the minister to the government to actually look at this is because it i believe thats actually we have probably appropriately lies when it comes to the issues that we 're dealing with with the residents and in christchurch now I appreciate I mean there 's been two two angles of work here there 's been the regulatory stuff and the non regulatory and both have been working quite hard on both issues and you know I 'm relatively okay with the with where it 's got to with the non regulatory stuff there 's some really good partnerships that are actually established but the problem is still going to be ongoing I believe and if it becomes ongoing we do need some sort of mechanisms somewhere to be able to address it it 's one of the only I suppose industries it doesn 't have some sort of regulation and what I think the people who are either living there or doing the work there and actually if you can start taking away the conflict I suppose if you have certain areas where it 's actually okay to do this activity I think that 's a little be a lot better that is where it sets and we heard the advice from the staff which is already a lot of work that 's already been ongoing I think one of the things that the prostitutes collective are quite concerned about is that some of the bills or some of the stuff that has gone to Parliament has been around re criminalizing Street by six week I 'm not saying that that 's what we want to do I want to make sure that we have tools where if there is a problem we do have the ability to do something about it at the moment we don 't this has been going for six years these residents are at what seemed and and now they 're so so sensitive to this issue it only does take one person to upset the applecart and say hey look this is not okay to be here you have to go down that other side and whether that 's an instant find or something along those lines I may not even women pay that instant but it just gives us the mechanism to say Bing but we 're not actually even asking to go that said we 're asking the Minister of Justice did all the government to actually just look at this and say we do have issues and we aren 't the only council that 's got issues there are a number of councils around the country it 's just because we could not create a bylaw and then probably the reason that the police are not supporting this is because if we create a bylaw the balance of getting a prosecution which is the only mechanism to do two to enact this would be very very low because of different ways that more works I suppose but if we just had simple mechanisms within the prostitution Reform Act that actually allowed us to do something it would actually make the world of difference here we 're not trying to advocate for what 's weird I 'm looking for two to put to isolate street-based six week it 's just to sort out problems when they actually come around and it makes you from my point of view if this type of work did go here we could actually create safer environments for the street by six weeks so it actually could end up being a better for all that 's why I would like us to do that it 's only asking but I would like us to do it thank you is there a speaker against the amendment well maybe we should do that actually what let 's deal with the amendment first okay let 's deal with it okay so speak to the amendments and just the matter that 's raised in the amendment then in that case or otherwise if you want to wait till we get the to the debate on everything else then chip in there yeah all right does anybody want to speak against the amendment Sarah all right is there anybody else who wants to speak against get an answer let 's go to standing let 's get a answer to standing orders question yeah benefits of the discretion okay so Sarah I 'd like to speak against um the amendment I 'd there 's a couple of things here in this it 's been really clear through the process today that the behaviors that have been complained about already have legislation that covers them it 's the enforcement that 's the problem but also in the the commentary around the prostitute reform act it was clear that if it became an issue then it would probably be the summer offenses act that would be the most useful rather than the prostitute Reform Act that would be the one to be changed I don 't think of all the priorities that this council has when it 's talking to the government at the moment that this should be one of them and so I 'll be about making stuff do we have a speaker another speaker in favor of the amendment Erin um I would request that all of us actually did vote for this because it 't review our decisions after a soon to certain amount of time and I expect governments to do the same any law that they bring in they should review overtime any policy because the world changes all the time and you can bring in policy wanting a particular outcome and not get their outcome so what do you just stick with the policy but and it 's flawed we 've had a number of murders in the city those girls are not safe their clients are not safe a pimp was killed as well and that 's just the bodies that have been found don 't think that there could be some that have not been found as well when you work in their industry it is not safe and it is not a pleasant environment for the people that live in that neighborhood and this is purely just asking for a review to see if what 's there is working and if they come back and say it as will then so be it but it 's only asking for a review it is pretty simple and I ask on many occasions and I can tell you if you speak to the families of any of the victims of crime from street based sex workers they would probably ask for a review as well because they don 't all love it okay Phil you 'd indicated you want to speak against look I don 't think there 's a product this is a priority also think that in fact continuing down the kind of like religious life approach that has disent in you to only dissipate the the other non regulatory work that 's being done and because in fact there 's been no real suggestions as to what how this actually might might work and what actually might be put in place apart from a review so because and ultimately the only thing that Parliament may do is make make some aspect of this more of an offense which actually involves enforcement which so far hasn 't worked so I 'm not really I don 't think this is a priority at the moment either and I 'm not going to support it okay does anybody else wish them just monitored my writer has no reply to reply on Amendment we 've already spoken okay so I put the amendments all those in favor say aye all those against No can we have a show of hands all you want your deals calling for a division so let 's have inform the division yes No so that means the status quo remains which means the amendments lost so we therefore go back to the resolution as originally moved by Councillor East and councillor Templeton okay so does anybody wish to speak to the resolution as it 's now going to be put Jamie I 'm really happy for the Working Party I think to care and take up some of the issues that Dionne raised the or those specific ones and I think that that 's best place for it not to thresh out at City Council so all that I think is the perfect yeah perfect place for that and to agency working party to deal with and if that involves talking with the crown and they should be doing that anyway going back to really to or understood the paper you clearly couldn 't do anything else but support developing a bylaw but the fact of the matter is if you haven 't read or if you have read and understood the paper you truly couldn 't obviously accept anything else other than not developing a bylaw so the advice is that it 's meaningless and utterly unenforceable creating a bylaw and that 's the crux of it so assault intimidation indecent exposure drug use drug sales all of this behavior is what is problematic for the residents understandably so it 's abhorrent there are real laws that exist to combat this and real laws that are enforceable the reality of the situation is that the police force find even these to enforce so if they find real laws of the land hard to enforce in this how a set of they unenforceable bylaws can be enforced is well another nonsense so look I think voting for the creation of a by Lord might make people you know feel good but I think the fact of the matter is you 're being really disingenuous because we that it 's not going to achieve anything the people that you would expect to enforce this have said that they will not be enforcing it and cannot enforce it so I think that just really leaves us with the right set of recommendations that we have in front of us that are recommended by staff and also the committee but one thing that I want to make really clear is that this isn 't a recommendation to do nothing this is the recommendation that the experts are saying will achieve the outcome that we want the experts are saying that the Bible will not achieve that and there are a set of recommendations up there that are saying that will it is not the do-nothing approach it is working collaboratively across the board with a whole host of different agencies that actually have clout in this area to try and get positive change so it 's not the easy option because I would love nothing more than to just vote willy-nilly to create a bylaw but deep down know that it achieves actually nothing that 's wasting time that that just makes a joke of the entire situation but there is a set of recommendations that all experts and people that are actually going to be enforcing the laws are saying is the way to address it if we want to actually change the situation so I think we 've got something quite pragmatic and sensible in front of us and I need you to support the set of recommendations and also in light of what to you on raised I think it 's all really valid stuff for that interagency working group to take up with the crown but the place for that is as a networking party and not here at Council thank you Sarah thank you and I 've got to say Jamie 's right you know that is this waste of time in money in resources and it 's been that way for the last five months since the 25th of May when it was very clear even on the 25th of May that a bylaw wasn 't going to work people voted to look at a bylaw because they were hopeful they wanted to 's meant that for the last five months the interagency working group has looked at a bylaw option and wasted its time on that when it could have been spent looking at all of the other options that have been canvassed around the table today and we 've heard already that has you know in the last couple of weeks since the police have said that they wouldn 't even for such which they said at the time would be difficult anyway that there has been progress made and I wish that we had started that five months ago on the 25th of May thank you Thank You Glenn thank you this has been a difficult and challenging matter to address as many of you will appreciate and I suspect if one of us was met bonus and also a city councilor we you know we 'd want the council to do something but I began from a regulatory position I 've shifted it 's just not quite hitting the threshold of a citywide problem visa vie freedom camping so that more than met the criteria in my view for the law the we 've had a go at looking at the public places policy but then again proving a transaction was problematic and in fact a transaction doesn 't always take place as we heard summer gratis they 're known as charity there again it 's difficult I 'm hoping that we can still though call on the resources across our program of work and the council to do something in the homelessness space for instance and we heard that many work on the streets are homeless I 'm hoping that we can address some issues there you 'll notice in the act that the only kind of explicit reference to protection is to protection of those working on the street surrounding you know around their benefits wins was probably a kinder organization back then that it has become lately but I 'm hope for with a change of government that it will you know have the doors open a bit more to our people so I hope that we can be proactive and provide other options by which people can actually make a living and and live safely this is all right great thank you I 'll just take some advice here for a moment and then we 'll continue great apologies for that um Mike thank you I will be supported in the resolution up there I guess look don 't think it 's acceptable that residents actually have to live with a lot of nuisance outside their properties we have they obviously sleep and it 's causing disruption no matter what the activity is but but what I hear is obviously the police do have the tools they 're just like in the resources and while we hear all the deputation from the residents one other person advocating them for them was Duncan we 're both he 's now and government so I suggest he actually go talk to the minister of police to have a look at that angle if he 's so concerned with the residents than there because I am concerned but obviously what we know is we just cannot achieve it through creating a bylaw so I suggest actually Duncan with have a chance the new minister of police Jimmy because regulatory know but today my decision still remain the same but except a few ways wonder I would like to explain the early later because I consider whether this by law the developer is workable is infant enforceable or is important implementable these leases right in the committee meeting quite clearly based on the summation based on the staff or the written information and the all word interpretation as well as the police in some other different agency information quite clearly so that 's why the top of the non pilo is Payton in vital in Korea situation second is we developed a collaborative community working group a juries Cobo Hall OOP under the wonder great umbrella a reader the group are all in school then take a positive way Elise is a mutual constructive communication but some of the affected residents ta consul whele because they talked before but that before is different from the new what they call you based on the stop they mentioned earlier actually they steer cavil like other accepted police they still cover some other like a community popular hills or some other the group idea is it or the other one is it with review this information it looks like you would take the more kind of a beta constructive positive wave they were trapped you we will review if the reason amounts we can try from a regional 16 to the up to now maybe only three or four but this inform is 102 so this quite effective Sewell is the the kind of the the no working group I assume but why I support a pew pew is right we need to separate show them in the long term my view this one you we take a positive a publisher and we can deal him in this issue however I 'm still concerned a long time because the street the base the sex workers they are not always in there they are not always the same person in there some people in there probably they still you know have a new face new line that whether they are aware this kind of a situation is my concern and also the council were eligible to request the central garment whether you also should actor expect to the 2000 industry for up to now has been 14 years so this our privilege so that 's why I supported pure but I don 't think so this is your team along to have any contradict or any the conflict I don 't think so she 'll be the simultaneous at the same time we can read request this is my view Aaron you have to speak quickly not ask if you could put number one secretly and the recently all the same so I would urge everyone to not support not doing a bylaw I think we should be doing the bylaw and I cuz I look at all the others and the wicked continue to work together that excuse the pun touchy-feely type stuff that 's gone on that 's happened since months after that February quake it started in like June of 2011 to try and encourage them to move so on and so forth there is no power it is absolute rubbish that it 's unenforceable if you have a Bible that says you cannot do something in a particular area like street prostitution then you can 't do it there there would be a little bit of signage and the police can just use it easily as a tool to say please move along that 's all they don 't have to arrest people or get rid of them that just gives them a tool to say don 't work in this area in fact I believe the gills themselves would see the signs and move on they wouldn 't even stay there because they wouldn 't want to be hassled and when you say it 's too hard to enforce or to work out you 'll find that when they want to work out if someone 's selling alcohol to underage us they do muff these things it 's pretty darn easy and I 'm sure you 'll find someone who will dress in mufti and go along and ask a girl if you can bias particular service on a street in Manchester and if they say yes then they can say oh you 've breached the bylaw it 's not that it 's not that hard let 's be of this I appreciate the amount of work that 's gone on sirs honored in to this by staff and by the committee and on that basis we 've got the recommendation in front of us not to develop a bylaw there is no point whatsoever in developing a bylaw for the sake of doing that if it 's going to be unenforceable or if it 's not going to have any effect and of course that 's on the basis that we would decide to create a bylaw even if we could and that 's a debate all of its own so my view is that what we 've got here is a collaborative partnership approach that we need to give the best possible chance of working the clauses five and six in the recommendations in front of us really I think do that we 've got monitoring and evaluation and quarterly reporting back to the committee that 'll pick up any issues or any opportunities on that quarterly basis and six you know obviously that 's another way funding is another way or considering funding is another way will be a productive collaborative space I 'll come to you Dave to close the debate and then we 'll take a vote open why addressed by just reiterating how incredibly sensitive somewhat divisive and very difficult this situation has been to resolve and also acknowledge the the difficulties that the local residents have had to endure I 'd also like to acknowledge the Supreme amount of work that Tina particularly has put into this piece of work Abele supported by of Judith and Helen it 's been an incredible piece of work that they 've had to put together obviously I 'm going to support this motion before us and I would have supported Dion 's I did support Dion 's motion before but I then think two points the council of Livingston raised that really the although in the long term even if the act was changed and we did have some mechanism to be able to enforce it to a degree there is still always that problem of how do you actually confirm that a transaction has is or has taken place it 's so pretty difficult I also pick up on points that councillor Davidson raised about the police having tools that they can address certain aspects at the moment and I certainly in my opening address suggested that if the police were to have a an intensive presence in the area for a reasonable amount of time that would probably move the problem on as well but having said that I 'm also totally supportive of the collaborative community working group approach as well I think you know in the society we live in today coming down with the big stick approach is not always the best solution to solve the problem and if we can you know collectively address the issues and move the problem along in the long run that 's probably better than trying to take a legislative approach and to curb this issue so I will ask that everyone support the resolution that we have here before us today it 's been the culmination of a lengthy period of work some of which Sarah Templeton addressed earlier it 's been work that we 've carried on for a long time only can 't have the tools to adequately enforce it so this has been going on for a long long time now it 's not the ideal situation that local residents are looking for but it 's not the end to the solute into the problem either we are still working forward and I have some confidence that the approach that we are embarking on now has the potential to to actually give us some positive outcomes so on that note thank you very much it 's been a good debate and I 'll now as requested put Klaus one first separately so this is just Klaus one all in favor aye against do you want those recorded yep so counselors coun and swigs against was there anybody else against so if we can just note that and now I 'll put the remaining clauses all those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "so that 's obviously the secret to getting something through immediately after the break provide cake okay all right so now let 's jump back to the main order of the agenda so we 're now at where did we get to secure site or parking update which is the remaining item from the infrastructure transport and environment committee Pauline you 're going to advisors this is a relatively simple recommendation I think from the committee we seem to drop it out which I think probably should have stayed in just noting the ongoing biennial spring and autumn monitoring of on-street of public secure cycle parking facilities by operations team and this will Annette allow for improved understanding of asset conditions then use patterns in the central city to allow for a more agile response to demand and I think what the committee 's permission I think that should still be in our recommendation so pickup clause one in the staff recommendation and lift that up and make it a clause to in the committee recommendation all right this is an ongoing program but the committee does have concerns that with demand so we 're really keen to have this budget seat so that we can have provision for parking throughout the city in the suburbs for the increase in cycle parks so I 'm happy to move it once the other one is included yep a noting that including the budget of 20,000 in the draft long-term plan obviously this will be subject to long term plan decision making processes before it 's confirmed in the final budget yeah great all right so let 's get that new resolution in front of us it 's just a freaking datian which is on page 121 yep yep this is allowing me to see how these two screens are working perfectly actually this is great yep all right so Heron you 've got it so let 's now move to questions so Aaron yep yeah just on that question because it sees included and the draft so it still goes out for consultation include it in the draft and then we 'll have our decision making on the draft that 'll determine whether it ends up in the final LTP or further questions Phil just a comment and in fact in many ways it 's um okay that that 's a minimal amount in my view given that recently we 've been informed of each car park in the city costs at least thirty thousand dollars so we 're actually asking for this money then one compact but however I think that that I 'm expecting that that amount should cover the cycle parking we need well can i probably should check there yes so Dave how many how many black parts are we gonna get it was a nice piece of cake I 'm getting these benefits in providing cake isn 't there I 'm going to introduce Trudy who will be able to answer that but one of the things I do think there may be opportunities also to get sponsorship around cycle car parks if you are a clean cyclist you may want to put a little brass Park on a young an appropriate cycle park somewhere people put them on cheese for example where if you 've got a someone who 's a keen Walker and they can accelerate that program or that budget by a little bit of a sponsorship potentially but Trudy will be over to answer how many cycle parks she will get through here to 80,000 thank you for your comment well and thank you for your question yeah I think we discussed this last time per unit maybe five hundred to a thousand per unit but I think it 's the ways and means that we 're delivering what we 're delivering in cycle parking so I I 'm quite keen to explore working with bike wise you have sponsorship and gifting ideas from San Francisco does but yeah you you know you 're not getting too far word to imperative so it also wonder for example you know with the cyclist commuting for example heaven to some key hubs in the suburbs especially for example shopping centers in fact this this will be focused on the central city and that 's the reason why sorry does say citywide oh okay also i wouldnt visit it being businesses or operations that are not currently covered under district plan don 't have that they need some assistance but yeah I don 't see 20,000 being necessarily spent on per unit and filling in gaps in the central city I know there 's demand but it 's not necessarily quantified and analyzed but what you see it I would suggest with the agreement of the tier and dippity that we increase us to 30,000 so Phil you 're you 're wanting to move an amendment or you 're wanting with the permission of the mover and seconder you 're suggesting that we increase this to 30,000 there 's a further suggestion that we increase it to 40,000 in making a million okay I mean all this is gonna be subject to debate as part of the LTP anyways right what we 're doing today is deciding what we put forward to the draft LTP so mover and seconder what are you going to be happy with 30 or 40 or 20 14 Pauline 40 all we 're doing is putting forward a number to build into the draft LTP that we 'll be discussing as part of the draft LTP and as part of subject to change anyway yeah all right so we go 40 so we 're still on taking it that we 're still in questions are there any further questions at this time dee on the winzip tae ever fund bike parks look I imagine that somewhere within the provision we may be able to look at some depending on what other produce we 've integrated into I say look I can we can we ask for a record look to see if we had that possible I would like us to actually investigate that if we 're putting 40 grand I 'd actually like in zotero partner fund of this type of thing because in duty oh you 've got a funding manual that actually sits out there funding and look if we had the right person here they could give you the answer to that why don 't we bring that into the LTP discussion as we 're gonna need to we 'll make sure we put the right funding mechanism for there whether it 's 20,000 of rates because it would be 51 if it was eligible okay one line item for parking and accessories but it was only I think 50,000 I mean if yes so I mean I 'm a local Cyclades business case so what I 'm thinking here is that if we 're doing if we 're doing this and we 're kind of sitting a bit of an example around the country we should actually be setting an example maybe a best case or best practice I suppose for NZTA to actually start rolling around the country that could be something that we could lead TOS really committed to cycleways and I think the comments from the new Minister of Transport again the new government the greens are very committed so I do think that they will they 've been very good on support to date and I don 't imagine that will change so so if you can pick that NZTA potential funding the opponent offers something to bring to the LTP discussions that 'll be the best place for that to land and that acknowledges the question now Mike you 'd indicated was that a change or did you have a Aaron so my question is before we throw just money at the problem of by tax how difficult do we make it for private individuals or companies to put in bike stands outside their business do we make it really difficult for them so the best way to solve the problem as the council just spends as much money as it cans on putting in as many bike stands as we can or do we encourage businesses and they can just say hey look you just come see your local community board they 'll sign it off and I 've got men date you can put one in I 'm not sure whether the community boards got mandate or not mandate about activities on the street but basically I 've never had a complaint of someone who 's wanted to put a cycle stand outside their business and we 've said no but you may know more than I do but basically and I haven 't also had a lot of those kind of requests come across my desk do you know I think there have been a few individual who are saying why is there not last week a cycle stand right outside fresh choice in the Central City and I quickly looked at the map and I thought there 's a lot at the interchange and some on the other side but I guess she was saying she couldn 't take her shopping 50 meters or whatever turn closest public cycle stones that were available so that might be a business for instance working with bike bike wise and the public where their businesses are made aware that their customers would like at the door convenience cycle parking I don 't know if this is the right time or place to say but we 're consulting on street designs where there 's a lot of opportunities for individual car park spaces potentially to be useful cycle corral parking I know we have a consultation process but I would say there are a Givens in street design and there are aspects that can be consulted on and if a business is feeling perhaps they would like more cycle parking on public road reserve then there 's potential to convert worked in that area pre-earthquake and yeah that 's what I 'd like to see potentially in the future obviously we don 't want businesses in the situation where their cycle parking is blocking pedestrian access so you can 't over crowd that service area so there 's on street space yeah and the reason I ask that is I 'd rather we 're in a position that we 're encouraging businesses and individuals if not going to the point of having a competition for the best bikes then like there 's the ones around the country for the best public toilet but in christchurch being that top cycling town in new zealand we have a competition for the best bike stand and every year it 's awarded someone and they put them in themselves they pay for them we just sign the bit of paper doesn 't cost them doesn 't cost them 10,000 for a resource consent to put in a bike stand it just happens I mean these are all things that we probably could pick up as part of that wider discussion through the LTP around get for our money and who 's paying for them and to what extent could we catalyze some investment from businesses yeah great any further questions okay great so we have got a mover and a seconder for this is there any debate Sara thank you I mean it 's really interesting that we 've got 240 thousand dollars which give or take is one or two car parks when we 're looking yeah we 've just been twenty eight million dollars building eight hundred car parks the Litchfield straight with a few counted bike parks down down the bottom we are looking at you know transforming the way that people move around the city one of the things about cycle parking being actually quite close and convenient to the actual shops which is different to cars is there 's a real security risk with bikes and there was an article in the Prius about 18 months ago where there were 50 bikes a month stolen and the CBD and it was with locks cut and those kind of things and so for people who are you choosing to use the shop is actually and it 's really useful for commuters the the longer-term the secure bike parking is much more useful but for each or shopping being close to the shops as is quite important for cyclists and you did manage to get twenty thousand dollars out of the the region but we 've been reading budgets that have been reallocated for this is financial year these extra cycle parking going in at the moment in the CBD which has been really good so I 've managed to get some on Mazda Boulevard who investigating some extra parking outside the piano at the moment and some other near some some key shops and things like that in town that have requested them over the last we well I 'm really keen that this doesn 't get used to supplement funding for major cycle route parking and master plan parking those have their own budgets in need to they keep it this needs to be kept separate for areas that aren 't serviced by master plans and by the major cycle routes to be outside of those areas I don little bit of this budget eventually when they 're short on you know 500 bucks for a bike park this is to extend the reach not to replace what 's already planned Thank You Dean I 'm in favor I would like us to see what NZTA will do but I will implore this council to stop the conversation about bike parks bicycles those car parks or cars it just is not helping the city at all car parks the reality is they have been positive net present value they bring income to the city over time black parks don 't because we don 't charge them look we 're independent open it here if you look at the numbers and I just worked it out they do but that 's over over a period of time depends on what you 've what your return rate is but it is not helpful that we 're talking about car parks through his bike parks or Carson versus bikes we 've just got to say this is a way we 're going to do it we 've just got to do it why we 're having all these problems with some of our streets in the city and people sort of getting antsy about each other and stuff like that it has got to stop and I would really I like this this is really good and we need to be doing this but we can 't keep comparing it to how much one car park will cost or something like that so I just want us to start changing our language around how we talk about by spiking in cycling in the city and actually looking forward positively rather than actually comparing it to what was yawning I just wanted to pick up before the earthquake we spent a huge amount of money I think was about five hundred thousand putting in cycling public psyching cycling parks for Bike Share type schemes and there was very low uptake so we had a whole bunch of excessive cycling infrastructure that wasn 't used so well I think the big change for the city day is register claim the requirement for private developers to provide a certain level of cycling parking as a much greater response than us to spending money as a council putting in the infrastructure and I really just want to pick up that you know part of the report mentions that but it 's not just the central city when malls redeveloped for example East Gate basically didn 't have to provide the minimum requirements they get a consent to not provide the cycling parking which I just think it 's counterproductive to to what we 're trying to achieve so we do need to take a multi-faceted approach to this it 's not just about spending money and putting them on public sites it is actually about I think requiring those larger scale developments to provide a suitable adequate level looking at the future demand particularly with the cycle ways that we 're building so you know I welcome the opportunity to look at this through the long term plan and I think also the other thing in here which is mentioned which there 's been virtually no discussion and I look forward to the time when we can be briefed as the public transport review the strategy have a whole network of suburban bus interchanges that was you know that what 's happening there I 'm not quite sure but the opportunity that some of us have asked for a long time they have those as multi-purpose rather than just for buses I think you know as a way to look forward to the future so the sooner we get that in front of us I think the better because there are other opportunities that we 're currently not looking at which I think have the potential to do it but yeah happy for this noting that we 're going to have this debate through the long term plan anyway so I don 't think we should have a huge debate about the quantum at the moment other than the desire to see good monitoring and putting this cycle at some place film sir.you_:_1101.73 Andrew I think as account sir we 're all aware that in especially in the inner-city the focuses on an accessible city and there is to cater for all modes of transport and in terms of investment this is really good value for a matter of competition between cyclists and Walker and walkers and buses and cars it 's a matter of how we do this well and I think clearly the points being made around the value of this is that for some time we haven 't had these in the the numbers of the counts of of cyclists on the cycle ways we 've put in has far exceeded expectations so there 's a really good time to actually make sure that we get this part done thank you pulling in town so we 've got to get ready for what 's going to be a massive influx with the uptake of the cycle ways and it is increasing as Phil sees all the time and beyond expectations so we get them in before we need them don 't wait till we wean we need them to get them in which is already pretty much now so I 'm supportive yeah in the context of providing infrastructure for cyclists that works as a joined up Network you know we 've got the major cycle ways that we 're investing in heavily already we 're expecting to see far greater uptake we need to provide realistic parking options and solutions for the cyclists that are using those major cycle ways so I think this project has got a huge value I 'm pleased to to hear the support around the table and I look forward to the discussion when we get to the long term plan taking into account the additional information that we 've asked for that 'll come to that discussion so that we can come up with what turns out to be the right amount to deliver what 's needed to make the most of the other infrastructure that we 're putting in Harran since we 're only 53 days till Christmas I 'll be the Grinch I was happy with the 20,000 and I thought it 's it a good label but I 'm a little disappointed that an hour after a conversation we were about how our city can 't afford to pay its rates and we leave a limit of what we can pay we just Chuck 20 grand into the LTP just pretty we did I believe there are more creative ways to solve the problem and we should be encouraging a lot more businesses I like white parks and I like the ones that I 'm serious pushed for in the inner city I 've used some of them already my bike hasn 't been stolen it 's kind of too cool to steal anyway because you 'd stand out too quickly so you get my bike back but the the thing is that I think there is a better way and if we want to be a more creative city we should be looking at different ways of solving this problem so I would have supported the 20 not happy to support the 40 because I think we should be more creative with our spending we just have not got an open checkbook but we do need the cycle car packs recycled packs oh yeah absolutely support it but I just would have preferred no cuz I 'll just vote against me a radience one if we can even see I 'll put one or two separately and obviously you know the debate one fails because everyone suddenly grows a an economic conscience and the next couple minutes then we 'll try the twenty again alright so I 'll take that as you foreshadowing a further resolution if Klaus warned files that you would move 20 all right Thank You Glenn thanks here just a couple of quick points that the first this is still a draft so we are going to have that through the conversation and I guess just to straight-out return on investment I could hardly think of a better return than this I mean when you think forty thousand for the resulting social and health benefits and I 'm sure they can 't_''_1346.539 be quantified you know that that 's excellent it 's right up there so I 'm glad we 're doing this could be good if we could avoid the cycle versus care debates I think we need both but we are trying to bring about change in the city with the rollout of cycle waste coming out of what people wanted for the rebuild Christchurch so yeah let 's just keep it going and great investment going to speak to this because there 's a bit of a no-brainer really but following Aaron 's comments which I think a lot of us now obviously understand that we 're getting to a point really where the rates increases are just not acceptable and obviously it will be looking to try and bring them right down but we got a look at what the projects are we 've got multi-million dollar projects that we just keep pushing through and pushing through without appropriate reports to actually do that so this is actually really really important for the city as we move forward you know if we get more people biking and this will encourage people to bike if we put in bike stands outside of shops their local cafes and things like that around the city actually people will start biking less people start driving and actually the maintenance on roads will decrease so this actually has positive impacts across the city if we do this so 40,000 on a draft long-term plan actually will have better benefits if we 're looking to decrease rates we need to cycle weights as a whole all these portal building this is what we need to look at it to reduce the the mess of big rates increases was there not forty thousand dollars towards bike stance which potentially will have a positive impact on the city Tim oddly enough I actually support what Mike and Aaron are both saying I think you know that we are going into a really difficult and probably the single most difficult long-term plan financially that we 've gone into for a city and the analogy with regards to the dogs tell actually think is a Serpent 's tail because it 's just going to keep going on and on and on it 's going to have a bite to it I do believe that there are more cyclists on the road and with more arm bike parks but one thing I think that we really have to do is a councillors just get cleverer there are more clearly to be pronounced with regards to you know like sponsorship you know there are bike manufacturers a whole lot of things that we can start thinking you a city where anything can happen and you I think in some areas we are stuck in the spot so I think we 've got to be just just a bit more wise we were going and you three are looking at multi-million dollar projects but every single projects going to count at the end of the day in our long-term plan because we are at a point their rates where I believe our community cannot afford it and that report that we talked to or many of you talked to on item 15 should really be emphasized what the legacy of kostas to the ratepayers of Christchurch with all these projects all our community projects everything that we do is going to be affected by those deals so I 'm going to support Erin with regards to number one just to add another 20 grand whether it 's two hundred on a to 400k budget or whatever we 've got to be very clever and care for what we do so on earth thank you alright so I put the two clauses separately so I 'll put clause so that 's carried do you want those nose noted yes please okay so those that voted against if you could raise your hands please so it 's Erin Tim and Dave noting that those three voted against and then I 'll put close to all those in favor against that 's carried great thank you _"

pleasure to have you with us and you have five minutes to make your presentation to us this morning thank you by Nina Oberg Humphries and it welcomes the community to take part and make her artwork so in the Christchurch Art Center in the classics building we have hundreds of schoolchildren who have made head adornments like we have on today and other items which are becoming part of her collaborative artwork so please go down and join her and have a look and see what she is doing it 's about celebrating Pacific Island culture bringing their proud culture into the Central City and making it visible as part of the rebuild and the return to the Art Center you are we are in our season and we 're really excited at spring it 's beautiful weather we have so many people out enjoying our artworks we have 14 new artworks as part of scapes annual season thank you to all of you that have participated we have had many of you join us on our opening events at our parties and also on the train we 've taken regarded walks with the staff at Council who have contributed significantly to the planning and delivery of these 14 artworks thank you who are we we are a private trust and these are our governor 's you met some of them this morning I am the executive director we have a very small management team Caroline grant is going to present very soon she 's of our philanthropy and communications manager and we have an occult out who is our financial and fundraising controller again we are very very small team and we 're very proud to be presenting public art in Christchurch our vision is to make the city full of public art and we have done that through difficult remained throughout the earthquake after the earthquakes we carried on we didn 't stop producing public art we were a reason for people to come back to the central city people came back to explore public art as we opened the the central city we have made a major commitment to public art over the years and we have hundreds of supporters from business behind us who really believe that we can have a strong vibrant public art scene in Christ next year will be our 20th anniversary and to date we have produced 214 temporary public art works twelve permanent legacy artworks and we have future public artworks in the paper that you can see there we have very high attendance last year we tracked a hundred and eleven thousand 602 and we 're tracking very well to exceed that this year all of our positive responses you can see out there from the audience 's 90% most positive from our surveys our model includes partnerships with council and business to produce legacy permanent artworks our annual seasons which we 're in the middle of now where we refresh art walkway and we are looking at flagship artworks for the city at entranceways we 've already produced fanfare and we 're involved with public art advocacy a very importantly were involved in public engagement promotion and education I 'll pass over to Caroline now to take you through the elements of the season Thank You Deborah seven elements of the season to take you through the public art walkway which Deborah touched upon one walkway you 'll see in purple notes are our legacy our permanent works it doesn 't have those in the city year-round people can take a modular walk through the city we hope those artworks away finders and reasons to visit it 's supported by our app which has geo tagging with each artwork and an audio guide to take you through those all work art works in the season we go to our dozen or so temporary installations on our red temporary public art walkway for the season and each artwork you can collect a map you have one of those each today and again they 're supported by our app the second element managing curator has made an exciting selection of national christchurch and the international artists you may remember before the long weekend Tom Dale from the UK 's terminal blue was flown around the city i knows council saw it from the offices round and round Hagley Park whose children played sport on a Friday array Pacifica in the Art Center giant diatoms which you 've helped us to invade hagley park with and of course dinosaurs now roam in the city of Christchurch at the casino and at the Arts Centre the third element of our season is reactivate this program works on two levels for adults in emerging artists which we encourage to produce artwork you may remember the subversive signs you may even have given some contact for them and restart last year the children 's program which is an annual program supported by Lewis Bradford consulting engineers and Dominion constructors is an open call to all the children in Christchurch the remit is allow the margination should have no limit and you see the wonderful results of that in hagley park with riri be williams and charlotte in hagley park for the season our education program the fourth element of the season 1,000 children will go through the scape central city classroom this season they may be making a cute okatee which of the things that we 're wearing on our heads today or the leis that you 're enjoying wearing today and they will all be brought together in an artwork at the end of the season our speaker series and events is an eclectic mix and a large program free to participate throughout the season you may wish to jump on a tram with me at 6 o 'clock on Friday and experience their charmed Pacifica 's art style or a walking tour or a speaker you may wish to hear studio one-to-five gallery is a new philanthropic model of escape second opening second exhibition open now in Merivale Heather brand studio which we open as a gallery the funds from the raise from that go back into public art in the city into the artists themselves and then the last element is a new artwork with each season a permanent artwork for this city on solidarity grit this is an international publication which is going to come out and German and English on the work this is your asset and artwork we 're very proud of that we 're really here today to talk to you about deepening our relationship currently we have a one-year funding agreement with council and we 're coming into our twenty years we 've really really want to solidify our relationship long term with council and we 're suggesting an MoU that captures all of our activities our annual festival season and our public art delivery we have delivered very strongly to the councils and commitment to public art for every dollar that the council has given to the permanent artworks in the city we have matched that with three dollars so we believe that we have a very strong role to play here in the city with public art we want to have a long-term vision we 've set out some of it here for you we want to strengthen that this is where we are now I think you can see we 're doing really really well terms of our collection of public art where we want to go to these are artworks that have been a snapshot from global current public art projects this is where we think we can go this is our aspiration and let 's do it together we want to work with you and we encourage you to get up and have a look at the season and we 'd love to have a discussion about deepening our relationship towards an MoU Thank You great thank you very much indeed for taking the time to come and talk to us this morning and for what 's been a an inspiring and very visual presentation so thank you very much indeed for that thank you okay so now let 's move to our second public forum item and I 'd call I 'm Stephen Howard and Marie Horton from keep our assets Canterbury thank you for joining us this morning and you also have five minutes to make your presentation thank you honey hi polka hearty Porto de aqua hoo-hoo my name can I talk to in Tokyo to tattoo my name is spokespeople we 'll keep our assets Canterbury we 're here today because there are still decisions to be made regarding public transport assets to know today Couric contends that public transport is best owned designed and managed by the City Council firstly we thoroughly support the City Council owning and running the public transport infrastructure so congratulations on obtaining the bus exchange thus ensuring public ownership of that part of the public transport system congratulations also to those of you with ties to the Labor Party and other progressive parties we have high hopes of having a new Minister for Christchurch regeneration and medium woods with her association with color national campaign to keep large assets and state hands who prove more conducive to the respectful open and lively relationship between Council and central government we still have not seen the restoration of democracy to local government in Canterbury but he can having members appointed by the central government and many functions that the CCC should be still doing usurped by opaque and undemocratic bodies hopefully when the council Rena gates the recovery costs agreement sharing agreement it will include democratic place with open democratic with Logan within the open democratic local government an example of the possibilities occurred to me when on Tuesday evening I heard Phil Twyford speaking about the tendering bus earth process for buses he said it 's just not working and it needs reassessing we agree of course during the least Merrill campaign LeeAnn stated strongly that she would like to see the Christchurch City Council was so on and why make currently District Council 's control the bus services for great across Nigeria we heartily agree with Lian that we 'd like to see all public transport under the district and City Council 's returning red bus to the CCC 's strategic asset list would reinforces our mantra for mere campaign on free buses which we see as being cheaper than the present fragmented system free buses was our most popular policy it 's if serious about wanting to get more cars off the road Council needs to be bold in terms of public transport policy the standard we could expect from a commuter transport scheme would be the use of the existing rail our field and possibly extending to light rail within the central city we 've seen been seeing a huge spend on roading in the Greater Christchurch area and recent with ostentatious overpasses on John 's Road and a northern expressway through st. Albans and redwood this spin has been and is continuing to be colossal much more than the proposed light rail system of Bob Parker we know that the people of Christchurch has successfully campaigned several times to prevent the northern expressway now this money sunk and sunk into a technology that is in contrast with the present government 's commitment to consider carbon neutrality this wasteful spin results from the corporatization model which produces solarization and fragmentation of the transport system with lack of coordination among the functions of various central government agencies such as transit and trans rail and those of the open democratically elected local councils local council ownership design and control would reduce the waste Christchurch City airports recent announcement of even more car parking development is another example car parking at airports is expensive and would be unneeded if there were a tram system shuttle bus and or tram and CVD not as a toy but as a real service and with free Wi-Fi on public transport would encourage people out of that sunset technology the private motor vehicle and on to public transport it 's time to be bold in public transport and use a new regime to take out OTE into the future as a modern and progressive City with local control and ownership of public services and restoring rid Buster the strategic asset list would be a start curator do you think that the whole funding model of Transport should also be carefully at risk Stephen well I think you 've got an opportunity with the government with a change direction and the opportunity to renegotiate the cost sharing to move money away from those white elephants like the northern expressway the southern motorway and the Jones Road development and into more useful stuff like light rail and public transit thank you very much indeed thanks for taking the time to come along and present to us this morning thank you so now we move to presentation of petitions I 'm of generation 0 here to make a 10 minute deputation regarding item 24 which is the report from the innovation and sustainable development committing thank you very much indeed for joining us maybe you 'd like to make some introductions and then you have ten minutes to make your deputation thank you and and we 're here representing wishing to comment on the report from the innovation and sustainable development committee and specifically on the target of carbon neutrality for the Chrysler City Council by 2030 so first of all we want to commend the excellent leadership shown by the committee we know we 're here often complaining about things but I think it 's also important to acknowledge when work is good work is done so in comment the leadership shown by the committee with the recommendations it 's made to the council we also want to comment and acknowledge the excellent work done by the council staff in their recommendations and we ask that the council set a target date for carbon neutrality of 2030 for the City Council itself at the latest in addition to that we that we request a council to set a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 for the city of Christchurch and our staff to immediately explore strategies and avenues to achieve this target and the science is pretty conclusive we as a species need to achieve net neutrality on carbon by the middle of this century if we 're to stave off the worst effects of climate change and as the small parts make up a whole cities have a unique opportunity and a moral responsibility to lead the charge here Christchurch as a city that is striving for innovation and doing things better should be at the forefront of that charge and committing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and immediately starting a plan to get there is the way to do that secondly and really importantly we ask that the council take a carbon budget approach to achieving the targets both by what for itself by 2030 and for the city by 2050 now a point in time targets like net zero by 2050 or net 2030 or whatever are really important they are vitally important but what really gases in the atmosphere not what you 're emitting at a point of time so given that what 's crucial is a total amount of carbon dioxide that we put into the atmosphere or we sequester over the next 13 to 30 three years so we therefore encourage the council to adopt a carbon budget approach so work out how much carbon you can emit in total and then base the strategy around that rather than simply trying to get total of zero because it doesn 't matter if you get to zero if you too much carbon all the time getting there the city white the citywide budget should be in line with the budget allocation for New Zealand under the targets set by the Paris agreement not that this isn 't a formal allocation but it is calculable using the total remaining carbon budget as per the UNF triple c recording so we can prorate it down to the populations pressures we also ask that the council adopt a coherent and broad strategy to achieve its targets and budgets both for itself and the city and this would change mitigation goals in mind when considering other aspects of frying the city you know whether they be public transport or whatever this is vitally important if we had to have truly meaningful action on emission mitigation and the wider benefits that come with acting on climate change in addition to this we think that the cccc should start a public engagement process to explain the importance of climate action and some of the nuances around things like targets and budgets we encourage the council to engage with stakeholders in this area around the city so groups like us and leverage these resources to reach communities broadly across the city for specific climate related engagement education and outreach so I 've just asked if you can bring up that presentation Joe thank you awesome so in line with the carbon neutral targets that you 've set we thought it was worth us also discussing another project that 's building a bit of momentum at the moment so the zero carbon act is a policy framework that generation zero have drafted alongside a team of policy experts and lawyers and it zero carbon emissions by 2050 we 're currently campaigning to get this act pass into law with cross-party support across Parliament so a quick rundown of the Act it 's modeled on the UK 's climate change Act which was passed with overwhelming cross-party support in 2008 it 's it 's an overall long-term budget of net zero carbon emissions and by 2050 and it has legally binding interim targets which would be every five years and advised by an independent climate commission we recognize that there 's a certain amount of warming already locked in which will need to adapt to and that local councils need the support of central government to do this so the zero-carbon Act also requires a plan for adaptation there 's no specific policy Lucian 's solutions that are prescribed by us it 's up to the government of the day to decide which policy levers they choose to pull a little bit of background this campaign started out as the seed of an idea almost two years ago and now has a huge amount of momentum behind it this is just a snapshot calling for the same thing for Parliament to come together and pass this act because climate change is too big of an issue to continue being a political political football so as you may have heard our new government has promised to enact a zero carbon Act this is great however our one is slightly different and our focus still remains on getting our proposal or as many elements of it as possible pass both cross-party support as this is the only way to ensure it will stand the test of time earlier this year we saw endorsements from the youth wings of all the major political parties and this shows that young people right across the political spectrum realize that it 's our future on the line and that we need to work together on this a few other things worth noting the parliamentary Commissioner for the environments report released earlier this year commended the zero carbon act and recommended it 's key elements the seed energy our largest fossil fuel retailer came out and formally endorsed the act and just last week Dunedin City Council was the first we need as many city and regional councils across the country to show their support for the act as this since the strongest possible message to Parliament so this is where you come in we are asking the Christchurch City Council to join the call for all of Parliament to pass our proposed climate law by formally endorsing the zero carbon act we look forward to working with you and we have some time for questions great thank you very much indeed for the presentation and if we can just get Lee can we get the clock back up on the screen and indeed that does allow about three minutes for questions do counselors have questions no questions Vicki just on the zero cabinet and it has two baskets of emissions in it doesn 't it yeah so do you want to explain that a bit yeah sure I 'm so what that 's about is the recognition what is scientific literature and by experts that long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived greenhouse gases have to be treated differently so long-lived gases are things like carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide one 're basically there forever short-lived gases are things like methane which you know have lost about seven to ten years in that must feel an average now because of the dynamics of the systems that means if you turn the tap off on me thing it 'll disappear from the atmosphere in a short amount of time comparatively so you can 't treat the two targets the same so for example carbon dioxide we have to start cutting right now because anything we put out there now is there forever whereas me then we have a slightly longer time to act on also it means that we can have a sustainable level of methane emissions it doesn 't have to be Net Zero but it has to be much lower than what it is now whereas carbon dioxide the modelling shows has to go over Net Zero so the best way we think to approach that is to approach the two targets separately rather than using the carbon dioxide equivalent which is kind of a big hammer for us and set up different looking nails and a screw so that allows New Zealand to act on its agricultural emissions which are primarily methane in a slightly different way to carbon dioxide which is the thing we need to get get in control right now meeting can start maybe three to five years after if they 're next thank you any further questions all right well thank you very much indeed for the deputation timely obviously in the light of the matter that we 're considering today which will be considered later in today 's meeting but thank you very much for the again very visual presentation and and the yet the the things that you 've raised with us this morning that 's great thank you very much thank you thank you just a question Vicki as chair of the innovation sustainable development committing is there anything in the deputation that you 'd like referred to your committee to pick up on why should we just simply refer the content of the deputation to the innovation sustainable development committee so you can pick anything out of there I think we 'd quite like to see the government 's zero cabinet to your committee for further discussion or further workers as the committee sees fit so I 'm happy to move then that we refer the matters raised in the deputation to the innovation and sustainable development committee seconded by Sarah and that will then allow any matters that the committee wants to think about further to be discussed in more detail or worked on in more detail at that committee the committee referred them the council referred the matters recent deputation to the innovation sustainable development committee so moved and seconded all those in favor against that 's carried great thank you _"

    "text": "so then moving on to the next item and again this is from the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee item 15 the closeout of horizontal infra infrastructure governance group report so Pauline do you also want to introduce this one as chair of the committee and this report is from the independent chair of the Chris McKenzie and the focus of the report is on the learnings from the horizontal infrastructure governance arrangements for the three public entities which was Sarah in CTA Medicine Council set up in 2011 with the purpose of providing leadership to work together to deliver essential repairs to the city 's infrastructure the the huggs independent chi was required to produce this closeout report and he 's highlighted some disagreements in a messy beginning the basically states that the group dynamics for excellent and also that there were several iterations of the structure there basically is overall supported the network performance approach and maintains that the delivery gave us value for money but the committee wanted to highlight a couple of things and one of them was a 4.7 on page 9 and it regards highlighted as well that this was outside the scope of the cost year agreement because it was not deemed eligible but he 's recommended the corners council continue to hold discussions regarding progressing the land drainage recovery program works the committee also identified a gap and the governance arrangements and the diagram on page 6 or our page 112 there was no area the if a council committee to feed in or out a committee noted that the report highlighted the area of communications which was often substandard and especially around the changes in the design standards and indemnity and the fact that public expectation often exceeded the scope and I think this was a fairly serious issue there and we also highlighted blighted the need to integrate works throughout of cost and time efficient and this did not always happen but in saying that this does have its challenges and it 's not always possible especially when it works up very urgent so just remember this is not our report this is a report from the independent chair of the hug and it focuses on the learnings from the a governance program to oversee any future significant event not just likely that but nationwide he also notes in four point six on page nine that it should not be understated underestimated as to the task ahead to bring the city up to normal so that business as usual covers all horizontal infrastructure projects in other words as a heap of work to do still even though the Alliance has wound up so in a resolution we 've highlighted very our notes these facets and the report that we identify as a get or that we felt needed more work going forward and you 'll note you there 's a correction oh it 's been done number four and number five because we actually didn 't ratified and the minutes throughout committee yet but I think number five we did not actually request a further report so I 'd like to take the opportunity to remove that and just say perhaps that the committee felt that including the summaries of the earthquake response MCD and the lessons learned would be advantageous so do you want to remove Clause five altogether I think just just leaving the learnings from the emcde even would be quite good and there because then actually affected the recent like the standards and the indemnity I believe all right so on the assumption that your guidance from the eighty Committee on this though because it 's my view that we did not request a free the report because this is not our report but who from who would you want the report from okay so yeah let 's let 's deal with this that way so what we 've got is a recommendation from the committee presumably this is and I will just get confirmation of it this is the actual recommendation that the committee agreed to at its meeting on that day so if there were to be a change to the committee 's recommendation it would require someone to to move that but to move an amendment to that or to remove an amended version of it so that that can then be debated today whether we actually want the report or not the committee requests that we include the summaries of the earthquake so you are going to move an amended resolution so just take after requesters to take out of through the report just say requests and take out the record including summaries all right mr. Duman maybe I could be of help we could by February give you a list of reports that have been done to date because whole-of-government in bi you have put them out order to office of the Auditor General put them out so I could get a bibliography and maybe a summary or the executive summaries it would actually give you a position of what 's out there because there are and I must admit I 've been asked requests for those from the general public anyway there 's probably I 'd hate to think you know there 'd be 20 substantial reports if not more so that maybe then would give you an overview of what 's out there and it could include this report here of course in that little list but it would then give you an idea of what 's around because that would then form potentially a great start for a different perspectives have put together what agrees what disagree so would that be is useful for maybe a way forward so that would be something that could come back to the committing so Pauline is the mover of this would you consider adding a further clause that reflects what Davis said requesting those reports or summary of them so requests a summary of other reports relating to I was thinking requests a report a bibliography of reports that have been released by various agencies to come back in February and we could actually put well okay so do you still want that five I was saying to replace five so if we expand or I listened within all of those different reports and so from there you could then decide what your best section was from there all right so if we can expand Clause five with the wording that 's just been picked up from Dave because the MC so replace Clause five with the wording that Dave just provided okay now just before we move into questions were there any other comments Dave that you wanted to make this report I mean this is obviously one report which is one of many and reports that have had different focuses and have been prepared for different reasons was there any commentary that you wanted to make around the context in which we should be looking at this I think councillor Kotter summed it up pretty well I think you 've got to recognize this is a report originally from the chairman of the egg the horizontal infrastructure governance group to the minister how had effect a lot of the learnings if you go back to the office of the Auditor General 's report or summary in 2013 which set up the head in their report in 2016 a lot of the learnings you 'll find our exactly the same and so there 's a lot of commonality but I think you 've just got to make sure the context of this report really was a report from the chairman of the committee to the minister which they agreed to share with counsel all right that 's that 's helpful thank you so Pauline I 'll note you as the and seconding obviously we 'll them will have used the mover let 's now move into questions are there questions so I got Sarah Phil Glen and Yanni Sarah meeting is actually it was it was soon after they had been some public discussion in frustration about the lack of lessons learned symposium or lack of lessons learned generally about the earthquake and the experience post earthquake and so then the committee was concerned at the time to make sure things were captured and that 's where the recommendation I think came from with the change of government it looks like much more likely and that we will have a proper lessons learned and I 'm really looking forward to it great thank you so sticking to questions for the moment so Phil all right so we 'll come to debates in just a moment Glenn thank you thanks Dave this made fascinating reading my question is around did the independent report go through that community group that the minister set up just after the quake so he wanted a I can 't remember I 'm asking David thank you was an agreement that there be an independent Assessor that would look at what was outstanding and it was all part of the cost share agreement originally and so that was done as an independent you may remember Ellen a trout did that work and came back with her recommendations around what was outstanding what was eligible but she also came back with the recommendations with the big one being around the land drainage program and the issue around the land drainage program if you look at the legislation that talks about damage of assets what happened in the land drainage program is the land sink but the assets didn 't necessarily get broken and so if you applied the letter of the law the eligibility criteria was correctly applied however it 's no use having NASA that sets up in here so she did specifically raise that point so no it absolutely an independent things she just got information from whoever she wanted to government ourselves skirt non skirt because this group didn 't only look after the skirt program about a third of it for example is outside to do with skirt but it is controlled by this horizontal infrastructure governance group yeah thank you and yawning yeah appreciate that this is one person 's perspective of of what happened but it does seem that there 's a few things that are kind of left out things like the missed deadlines around timeliness of the review being done what why is that stuff not mentioned in here do you know no but I think the it doesn 't really make a mention really of you know the sharing agreement was sort of external to the the third I 'm talking about the end opinion if you have a look there was a Memorandum of Understanding set up just think early 2014 just before I arrived at Council that actually set up the horizontal of the structure and gave it the governance powers that it had now basically by that time the deadline had been missed of when that independent so it was done immediately we could get and agree on an independent chair so it was a summary report as opposed to a real detailed report I suppose I say it was a report to the minister that they agreed to share with the council so the big problem for us as a city has always been that despite agreements with government to do things in a certain time frame they missed every single deadline so the cost year deadline was must the the cost was done two or three days before we did our through year an order said plan it was supposed to be done December then it was supposed to be done April and it was never done in time I think that a lot of the independent way way beyond the power of the horizontal anthrax governance group that had a job to do that was set up under as I said the Auditor General 's report had a very set scope which was set out under a a Memorandum of Understanding between the council and the crown and so that was even the independent review that was supposed to be done to inform the further work that they who had control over wasn 't done in time to inform annual plan for the there 's some assumptions in this kind of review or some things that are kind of put in there that don 't actually freaked the difficulty that we have as a city getting clearer information about what costs where we 're up for and I just I don 't understand why things like that like timeliness of information to us isn 't picked up okay so I think it 's important to note that Davis here is the organization staff member commenting on a report that was not written by him or permission you were on the hook right I was so but that 's that 's quite different I mean that 's a different role than been the staff member who 's in front of us today to answer questions on this report that was neither written by Dave or by this organization nor commissioned by Dave or this organization so I think it 's important you know certainly we can we can expect some commentary on the report as it 's written but the content of the report is what it is and that was driven by the 's who 's reviewing the infrastructure repair from our point of view as a city around what 's worked and what hasn 't because at the moment I haven 't seen any information around that and we are putting together a just a report on the horizontal infrastructure and we 're at sitting what was promised in the first place and it is beyond it 's trying we are trying to finalize at the moment the real difficulty is trying to get some financial information across it some things like the funding of renewals is moving feast at this point in time but we are I 'd say 95% finalized so at this point in time so so things like the removal of the indemnity and the cost share agreement which actually was Nevis in the council report that council agreed to has got no reference and here so it makes it seem like we are great to the removal of the indemnity okay so I 'm keen to keep questioning to this report and its content yeah so not to the environment in which this report was written or may not be covered in this report well it season here a key learnings indemnifying that earthquakes remain in place too long and consequently was hard to control costs and expectations well some of us would never have agreed to the removal of the indemnity if we 'd known that that was part of the cost yet but we were never given that opportunity yeah so the sum of what you 're saying Yanni I think there 's probably more appropriately covered in debate because you 're stating a view and you 're perfectly entitled to that view rather than as a question which our staff member sure so final question as there 's some comment and here that things that decisions unanimous as we went through the optimization process I can recall us being briefed on several occasions around the consume we had over scopes and standards and that we were raising things at the hug that we were being outvoted on by NZTA and Sarah so why is that have you got any idea of why we 've been told that things were unanimous when we were raising was happening and I think you raising concerns around technical decisions that were laid down if you have a look at the structure and they 're made at those STG meetings rather than actually at the head meeting at the end of the day there was an eligible eligibility criteria and so those recommendations that came up which was strongly debated by the various areas however there were those who say we would work through all agreements so that you would actually get consensus rather than things so yes there were things that we didn 't agree but there were also things that if you don 't agree there are timing penalties and all sorts of things so that 's basically where we 're that we alright thank you right Yanni 's kind of covered and I 'm not really sure I put a question to ask I probably make a comment yeah so we 're moving to debate shortly and I don 't doubt people you know we 'll have some views they want to express so we 're done with questions okay so this is moved by Pauline let 's move into debate so I 've got Glen raff Phil Yanni Vicki okay thank you I was curious to read this the build Pegasus and the Hagley fairy made form Awards took up I think an order of sequence anyway that the biggest proportion of the the skirt budget all along I take some of the points from the independent report but the fourth and second and last reports particularly the fourth I want to challenge so where it says close engagement and communication with the community and service providers ensure the successful rebuild process for horizontal infrastructure as a gross generalization it wasn 't the case at all we had multiple the generalization ok exaggeration yep work generalization we have multiple issues on the ground with residents it was not necessarily smooth running I think a lot of the skirt staff did a good job but there were breakdowns but between contractors so communication often was blocked up residents didn 't know what was happening notices weren 't put out roadworks proceeded or all were changed and people weren 't informed so I think going forward that have a grassroots component of the community I 'll notice up there council committees which would suggest that we really do need that emphasized so that you you you you know you literally have that local voice present in any structures one or two other points there I 'd like to say we did raise this accounts all several times over the sick of the last bullet point that the one dick principle which I think skirt now admits was too hard to attain so that skirt proceeded from the east to the west unable our own company from the west to the east and residents often found their footpaths dug up several times over having first had four appears in the five of broadband was put in later and over the process finally I would suggest that best outcomes resulted the firt often fit the further along the I ap two spectrums so our script came to the bill with Pegasus board and said we 're going to operate in the first two columns and form and consult and they presented the two columns to the board they didn and empower and best results actually often came about the further you shifted along that spectrum and trusted the community and took them with you so I 'd like to think that going forward we will take these lessons I 'm not onto the word learnings I don 't know where that came from anyway but the lessons going forward I think it 's really important that we have that community voice it 's the old saying as stitch in time saves nine so take the community with you place this actually as speed thank you thank you rev just quickly okay so going through the report and item two was on page four paragraph one which says you know the skirt alliance was set up to rebuild the damage to underground pipes bridges roads retaining walls etc then if we flick forward to item four point four where it starts to talk about eligibility of the work scope which in 2014 was changed and this was to apply a network approach rather than actually repaired damaged pipes now we 're all aware of that but I think the implications four point six again the bottom of the paragraph I think it 's Yanni mentioned or somebody you know the underestimated task of bringing the city up to normal in terms of covering all the horizontal infrastructure projects and at four point seven when it looks at the lower cost of the three hundred forty eight million dollars which was lower where of course that the crown contributed much less than they budgeted for the top line there was a focus on restoring Network performance rather than the repair of all the damage so they changed this thing halfway through so instead of actually repairing the damage they basically just they got everything working again which is fine now the problem with that and the problem for the ratepayer and the public as we 'll see during the long term plan process is that we have a very very long tail of infrastructure costs going out over the next ten to thirty years and that is a big problem and I think the most important thing from this report is the public needs to be clear that that 's why for the repairs post-earthquake which were promised by the government to be funded properly and clearly with a short change I think this is an important report for people to read and actually understand you know why these costs are still being borne by the right pair and will be for some time into the future Thanks thank you um Phil Thank You you I think but clearly this is a most important report for us in terms of lessons forward and looking at looking in the future and around around the the governance part in where we 've made a change to the last section five it just seems to me that looking at the establishing the government project program but also looking looking at the reporting back part of their in if the agreement of the mover and seconder I think that should be aired then because that was the that was a gap where clearly there was a lot of different views between Council and and in the crown and a lot at times though even though they had its own governance that information didn 't really to the to the AG committee so that that and the illness the the report acknowledges that the other part too of course is that I think the report does in some ways understate the achievements like it refers to the 743 projects which were completed and a large amount of money was spent on and basically it the report says cost-effectively but we and we know though that in fact what was achieved was hundreds of kilometers of Eron horizontal infrastructure it was repaired and renewed and the ground both you know by what although all of the threat including all of the three waters and I think and and ref refer to this and so did Pauline that one of the key parts of this report and it 's a back up for us and LeAnn has referred very clearly to it and it is around the the work that the independent Assessor did and how in fact we clearly were shortchanged by nearly three hundred and fifty million then the original cost share review and so and the report recommends an effect that as a council we think this is a very helpful report and I think the other point that ref touched on and Pauline did too around the expectations of the community and what they will be in the future is was just like the earlier on before when the skirt started the community had expectations and in fact all would be fixed into a top standard and in fact we 're going to have similar problems as a council and that 's another area of course we are going to be discussing I 'm expecting we 'll have discussions with government the key area that 's clear in the report is around that land drainage part which in fact certainly needs attention because we all know that is what the earthquake is what caused that and that was the part that 's been left out so overall I think that this is a very helpful report for us as a council thank you so Phil were you suggesting that you wanted to make a change to the resolution agreement yeah just that after the terms if you get governor probe and reporting back at doesn 't matter too much we 're as I suppose willing but whatever work whatever fits back yeah so Pauline Mike you 'd you 'd be happy with that change as the mover and seconder okay so Phil what wording did you specifically want to change there just so that we think um and point five in the second line after the comma on the establishment of the governance arrangements and reporting back to oversee future on establishment of governance program and reporting back to oversee future signature you know oh yeah governance program coma and reporting back does that make sense requests of people over food reports including the summaries of earthquake responses mcdhh m and lessons learned on the establishment of the governance program and reporting back it feels as though those words are in the wrong place Hank Israel I 'm really referring to the reporting back to the council and reporting back by February 2018 if possible and no no no the the issue mr. chairman what was that the reporting back at the time around governance Council was was was was insufficient it was communicate back at times reporting framework reporting framework we find code maybe if you say yeah yeah and maybe and communication and reporting framework yep yeah rather than reporting yep okay just a slight detour I think the counselors to terms back felt the problem is we had a big change in counsel so in the last term the ward reports specifically on scooters and everything else stopped so but it was there and the term prior that it does so I we 've moved outside of process then you 've already spoken into bass phil is suggesting I 'm just keen to get this back on track Phil you 've suggested this wording change that Pauline and Mike had indicated they will be comfortable with now that we 've captured it up on the screen Pauline Mike you 're comfortable with that as a mover and seconder yeah fantastic so let 's move forward with this as the resolution that we 're debating and then in debate we 're moving to yarning I just also wanted to move an additional wedding under three I don 't think we should exclude huge huge issue so is it possible with over in the second at Edie notes that the council committees community boards we 're not included in the government 's illustration and we get some staff comment on that the structure that was in this report has taken straight out of the Oh AG report so basically that 's where it came from I think you can note that basically in future you would like to see more involvement council committees community boards but the structure and how it was set up was exactly as was set up by the oag so that was I just wanted to make there it wasn 't a decision made by counsel or by the crown or whatever the OIG and then we just dump them in and so that 's where that picture came from basically you know council notes it concern that doesn 't incorporate council it goes directly to the mirror and I suppose it 's similar to central government minister Muir that 's where they it 's kind of quite often happens and central government when they make recommendations I mean the lesson learnt should be that councils are actually local democracy 's not you know not don 't operate as the ministers operate or central government operates so yeah I personally think it 'd be good but just to speak to I mean I just agree with it so I 'm sorry Jonnie just before you going to debate that changes that you 're making there it 's just as no thing that 's not Pauline Mike you 're comfortable with that change what do you want it dealt with as an amendment do you need any further staff advice on whether you what the implications are what the implications are you are in a response mode and you actually need to do things quickly so you know basically I suppose that 's why one of those things was put in place so the more steps and people you put in I don 't actually think that the oag would come down to that level within in a future event of the scale but having said we 're just noting though the purpose of this particular course is just noting 're talking about the very high level of governance structure there and it 's up to our organization to feed through to community boards and to encourage the communications so maybe rather than putting it then we could add at the end of Clause three notes that community boards were also not included yeah all right so let 's remove community boards after that slash and at the end of sentence three notes that if it needs to be a separate paragraph if it were better runs a separate paragraphs and fair enough notes that community boards were also not included and this which is noting effect essentially so Pauline you 're happy with that that wait Mike yep great fantastic okay so moving now back to Jonnie and debate so just to give some context first with the community boards it was such a wasted opportunity that projects would not come in terms of detailed design to local community boards some community boards like my own for years had been working to improve Street immunity there were areas for example where we 'd spend huge amounts of money doing and reduction enhancements where and then skirt just came in and removed those without any public engagement with local communities we also had areas like if you take wooden road and Lynwood EV where that roundabout or that intersection there 'd been a desire from the community to improve its safety and yet no opportunity with all the millions been spending or billions been spent on infrastructure repairs no opportunity to look at a holistic approach and put in something that would be safer and tragically there were accidents at that at that intersection after the skirt repairs so there 's a whole number of projects through this that for whatever reason I think the governance was quite flawed and we really should be learning from that where we 've got local community boards who had delegations who suddenly ceased to basically have the normal delegations that they have and we 're not talking and the immediate aftermath of the earthquake we 're talking actually three three years off where these things still weren 't happening so I think it is really important to include community boards they have the report is very rosy and fails I think to really adequately address what happened which was the council as part of our financial strategy had decided to defer renewals because it was always clear from our expectation and a letter of indemnity that things that would be done in terms of fixing the infrastructure would have the opportunity to actually do do it and do it properly not do a patch job that we ended up with and the standards and scopes were changed in secret the lack of transparency over that I think is absolutely damning on government and the factors it appears that they was simply interested in spending as little money as possible in as quick as timeframe as possible without taking a big added a big holistic view of what 's best for the city not necessarily what 's best just for there chick Bock and the reason that so many of those deadlines were missed in my view was around the fact that government wanted to be in surplus so they convinced us to do an unaltered three-year plan at the height of these infrastructure for the things that we needed and as a result of us doing an unordered three-year plan the true cost of the financial infrastructure was never known until the new council came in which i think is quite a huge problem for us but you know just to read one comment from a memo that we got from our staff over the hug optimization again a process that was done in secret with very little transparency to the community but ccc feels that the O&M and the optimization reports are realistic we are also concerned that break rates on water mains have deteriorated in the last financial year it is not coincidental that this has occurred when skirt have stopped water management renewals at Sarah 's request the key indicators above all point to the fact that the waste water network and water to a lesser extent is know in their previous value performance leaving critical defects in the network which will slow recovery of it to a stable state and have undesirable social and environmental effects the water network break rates are already deteriorating given Sarah 's direction to comes through to say that NZTA and Sarah had the ultimate decision-making over what we did with our infrastructure and that council was basically a minority view that had no influence over what they wanted and they were able to basically instruct to do things for their benefit rather than for the good of the city and I think that there 's a huge lost opportunity for us and it 's said that this report I think paints a very rosy picture of those arrangements which actually a number of us have challenged from day one because we 've lost those opportunities to take what 's best for the city approach from a modern sustainable environmentally dynamic City and instead we 've ended up with a patchwork of repair that sadly has seen a duplication as is mentioned of roads being dug up after they 've already been folks to what other services or other repairs done to so you know this is a really sad situation and there 's a lot of lessons to be learned and I look forward to the time where we as elected members can and measure the cost both in economic terms and environmental terms to the city which is massive and it will be a massive legacy going for a long time into the future thank you Vicki just in terms of the report I agree with a lot of what you only said M with what rep said I enjoyed the section and the way that Chris put it an item and paragraph three one area which was a constant source of debate between the crown and the council but also on occasion the public was the early announcement made by various organizations that led to an unrealistic expectation of the standard to which the repairs would be completed they varied the early announcements made by various organizations was largely the prime minister actually at the time who people would expect to get it right so people thought that they were going to get this that he repaired too as it was pre the earthquake and they were led to believe that quite deliberately that was not the case in terms of the amount of money that they funded originally and then it met some arbitrary goal of actually actually the goal was very clear of cutting the money that they were spending in Christchurch so they found some other new standard but Yanni 's point about the fact that the amount first was underestimated and then further it was cut and people were lead to unrealistic expectations well actually quite a realistic expectation that the city would be repaired to create quite standards means that we have as referes pointed out not just a long tail I suspect it goes right up to that we 're using the dog analogy right up to near its front paws actually in terms of what it means in terms of ongoing cost if you look at the breadth the pie charts that have come to the Infrastructure Committee that have been by the staff of wastewater stormwater drainage of roading footpath standards none of there none of those as anywhere near where we were pre quake and the cost of getting those back to pre quake post the era of skirt and Hague and all those two and three D three and four litre that 's what 's driving a huge amount of the rates increase yes there was under insurance in the built infrastructure but the reality for every city is that it 's really hard to ensure your streets roads footpaths and your path and your pipes sorry and the difficulty that every city now has and the listen that I would have taken from this but I probably would have written this report differently than what it 's been written is that if your area has a major disaster you are in deep stuck deep trouble because actually Christchurch pre quake was at the situation unlike every other city actually and every other region that has had massive assets it had relatively low rates and has had very very low debt levels no city is in that position no city no region is in that position now so if any other city is affected by any disaster and that will happen we just don 't know which one and we don 't know when then they are in an impossible situation we 've had to increase our debt levels dramatically we own and we are now faced with rates increases that I think are quite untenable for most of the population because the government did not in any way shape or form keep its side of the bargain in terms of we will repair your yes we will work with the council on a cost-sharing agreement which we 've set out which will repair your assets we are left with a huge legacy of this quake which stretches forward and the next 30-year infrastructure plan so it 's not just this generation it 's the next two generations as well that will be facing the costs of this earthquake and the how would you express it the exaggerations or perhaps the untruths that the government told about what they were spending and what they committed and what they did and I think the really big learning for every city is being incredibly aware that if this happens to you you are in deep trouble because you simply do not have the situation that the City Council the City Council had pre this quake no city would be able to withstand us actually gonna say it 's been said but I mean one of the big things for me actually is we 're always told that the cost share agreement can 't_''_2552.349 be changed the cost share agreement can 't_''_2553.909 be changed the cost share agreement can 't_''_2555.379 be changed yet the report says here this report says in November 2015 cabinet confirmed crown contribution for the financial sorry crown financial contribution at one thousand six hundred eighty nine million and it was one thousand eight hundred and the cost year agreement does anybody actually know that like the public like they 've just taken a hundred and eleven million dollars of off the city not off the council but off the city 121 I think that 's actually that 's disgraceful and I mean that 's that doesn 't even include the the you know the amount that was taken off three hundred and forty eight million dollars less on the on the entire the total the the amount of money if you look at the other part of this report in 4.8 roading in infrastructure was list and allocated because taken off now people are complaining and crying out for us to fix their roads yet the money has been taken it was it was taken off the other thing that really really really grates my grill from this report when I was reading that was actually the piecemeal approached by the sounds of it that 's been put into a lot of our infrastructure so even if we did fix the roads to what people want them to be fixed because people are getting their suspension buggered all over the place we 'd have to fix it again because the infrastructure under the ground isn 't actually done right in some cases I mean you know there 's a lot of good work that has been done but that is a real concern and we actually really do need to know as a city with the data that 's come in from skirt what infrastructure hasn 't been fixed or replaced to a new standard it 's just been sort of inferred through what 's being reported here that has been it 's just restoring the network performance you to last in those kind of things so I 'm really consumed by what I 've read him in this it is my generation the next generation that will be paying for this be paying for the four we didn 't do it right first time we had the opportunity to do it right and we did it and now we 're going to be paying for it our rates for years I mean we 're facing some massive financial constraints around the infrastructure and as Vicky just said I mean it is a massive problem any other city in New Zealand will face I mean it is huge and I mean in page 11 of the report for a future of being speed of planning funders could result in better and complete result what yani was saying I mean this is where if they 're going to be digging up the road do the footpath do the other things actually bring all these things together and start talking I think there 's a lot of lessons that actually really need to be pulled out of this there 's a _''_2721.7 explored in one report and I really do look forward to the opportunity that we do have as a city and as a council to actually unpack a lot of this stuff and actually look at it in more depth but this is just one example I think of so many things that have happened I mean EQC and all of the other appears and that stuff that 's just been going on and I think you know poor Christchurch really I 'm a little bit upset by when I read this but it 's good to get it out there and I really hope people and the media do pick up on this and actually really start digesting it because people in the city need to know we keep you know I keep going back we were always told the Kashi Agreement can 't_''_2760.71 be changed blah blah blah yeah they change it without telling anybody Aaron yeah it 's an interesting story the titles wrong it should be this is how the city got shafted would have been the should have been the document title here I agree point and that 's that other cities and districts won 't be in as much trouble as we are because they start from a different position that they start with no money so they will get the help from the government that they actually need because there is the only way forward when you start at the bottom the only way is up but unfortunate for Christchurch we had some really good stewards prior to our time that put our city in a good position and that meant that you don 't get the help that you actually need because you look pretty good and we 've had exactly the same problem at the DHB in fact we get the second lowest amount of funding per head in the entire country at the Canterbury District Health Board because we don 't have problems and that is the same situation for our council was that we didn 't get the money we deserved from the government because Christchurch was in a basket case prior to the quakes and so that 's the one point that I just like to make and on from Glen 's point earlier it was a different time after the quakes Skoot was set up really quickly there was a good there was a good arrangement we were feedback to it every community board meeting I 'm sorry every month they come and they talked about every job that was going on in our wards there was really clear reporting we had all these meetings with Gerry and and sausage rolls and coffees and lamingtons for Africa and we knew everything that was going on and then suddenly then wheels fell off the bus and and no wall no one was even on the bus anymore and so something went wrong in the middle and that 's the story that 's not being and that we 're going to find out except our ratepayers will have to pay for this for a very very long time and that is just not called Christchurch was lied to I think we were deliberately lied to to stop the population fling 7,000 odd people moved out pretty quickly and to stop more of tens of thousands from leaving you tell down and their streets will be repaired to the way they were prior to the quakes in fact some places will be even better and because there was a benefit fund what suckers we were thank you so Pauline but basically this is a helpful report for us in in mainly because it 's now out in public and there 's a lot of facts and a lot of figures as well and I 'm going to look forward to the bibliography of all the other reports that have been done and I 'm particularly hopeful that discussions around the eligibility of the land drainage recovery program but it costs you will produce an outcome that will be helpful to Council and our ratepayers and as data through to means the land rising and falling even if a pipe is not broken if it still doesn 't work could that be considered damaged so if you have meaning and key lessons to be compiled for any future arrangements and in the purpose in report states as well the purpose of crown involvement was to restore horizontal infrastructure network performance functionality or repair all damage in for this reason the public expectation exceeded the scope we might say the hips the public expectation is fear and the public expectation is actually correct so for this reason I think that you know we 've talked about the right part you know continuing to pay for many years to come because the expectation was too high or was it so I think this is the basic question that does need to be asked in this report in 2017 and June this year scoot handed over the completed assets but there wasn 't everything completed so to have that sort of appears to people that here here it is it 's all completed but that 's far from true and the report also as I 've said earlier highlights the communications and the faults and the communications and I think part of that is this yoni has referred to the community boards got left out of the loop as well but I think so did we and there were things going on that we found frustrating because we didn 't realize what was being left with was a magnitude of it I would say so at least it has been highlighted and the report about the communications so I will just leave it at that we are receiving the report we 've noted some highlights that we 'd like to have glaringly obvious going forward and that we 'll look forward to the continuing workshops and the symposium and pulling all the streets together for all the other the bibliographies as well thank you so yeah of course this report is now in the public arena and there are sections of this report as a number of councillors have noted that will be of particular interests of the people of the city and those have been highlighted well by some in this debate a lot was achieved by describe the scope program delivered a heap of work and some of that was done very very well and very quickly there were other aspects of the skirt program that weren 't such a success and there are aspects that have been referred to by others in the debate around the the way that certain streets joined-up approach to the work that needed to be done the the communications aspect certainly as a community board member and councilor at that time in the beginning communication seemed to be very very good but there really is a sense that the community boards and the people of the city weren 't really engaged in what was going on in the way that we we might have expected the lack of a joined-up approach certainly was was one of the frustrations but certainly thinking back to the last term of council the the review of standards and the new standards been adopted and the use of the word optimization as a euphemism for cost savings at that time you know this discussion brings back all of the frustrations that we as a council experienced at that time as we realized the assumptions that have been made when the cost share agreement was signed weren 't actually delivered in the reality of what was provided by government through that cost share agreement particularly when we got the outcome of the Eleanore out independent report on horizontal infrastructure my belief is that at the time the cost chair agreement was signed it was never anticipated that the outcome described in that report was was what was expected as a result and Clause 4 of our resolution today talks about the land drainage recovery program which of course is an absolutely massive program of work and we note the recommendations in the various reports that there should be continued discussions and of course they are discussions that we are wanting to progress and quickly with our new government it 's the same discussion that we would have had regardless of who was in government but certainly now that we 've got a new government it represents a line in the sand and an opportunity to pick that up again hopefully in a meaningful way but the comments that Raph and Vicki in particular have made are absolutely right where the the position described in the independent reports on horizontal infrastructure has left us and where the financial outcome is left us is either with significant financial implications for the city for ratepayers over a long period time or with significant significant implications of time and it 's my view that neither of those is acceptable and that neither of those was anticipated and that what Christchurch is now facing should as Vicki said serve as a warning to other cities in New Zealand that might find themselves faced with the same challenges as a result of natural disasters that inevitably at some will happen in some place so I think it 's been a useful discussion this morning I think the fact that we 've got the report in the public agenda and aspects of it have been highlighted are useful in terms of residents understanding why we are in the position that we 're now in as a city and it 's timely in as much as a lot of that discussion feeds directly into the long-term plan and some of the explicit decisions that we face as a sitting over the trade-offs between the cost of restoring the network to its stake pre-earthquake or the state of the network that we as a city are willing to accept in the mean time but there are the opportunities for discussions in that that 's the case so the report has been the recommendations have been moved and seconded or put that motion all those in favor against that 's carried now _"

    "text": "bring onto the next item the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee item 14 conversion of road lighting to light emitting diodes so Pauline would you like to introduce this item as chair of the committee program and there 's many advantages of these including reducing operational costs and reducing our carbon footprint increasing efficiencies and also bringing in a 24 hour centrally controlled system with smart city capabilities now currently the council has thirty nine and a half thousand council owned streetlights and we do have an upgrade program that currently we 're only computing with one thousand per year so in 2015 NZTA provided a whole list of benefits of converting to LED lighting including the use of a central management system but in March 2017 they further reinforced this by increasing the subsidy from 49 percent to 85 percent covering the council 's upgrades and financially use 2016 17 and 18 so and also included in the subsidy is the installation of a central management system so that means you can actually done the lights and bring various controlling features unto thee under the new lights so this thousand and twenty seventeen and eighteen and three thousand by the end of 2018 and to actually complete the rest of the program by not me David is it 20 that subject to the LTP so our committee was very supportive of this and it 's a bit of a no-brainer in quite an exciting thing to be doing for our city thank you any commentary from staff on this report I think what generator that was in GTA 's increase in subsidy to 85% and also the ability to claim work that 's happened claim additional subsidies in previous years so effectively the subsidy rate this financially is 102 percent and say it has significant environmental benefits with reduction in carbon 1,500 tonnes if we complete the whole project and reduces operational costs say the work has been done on finances is that it 's rates neutral and yes and it reduces maintenance costs as well the at some stage the lights will have to be replaced because the old technology will become unavailable or more expensive say and there 's probably a timing win yeah we 've already the they would be supplied so we 've had to remove those from the new route great thank you very much and the report makes all of that very clear so thank you for the additional comment are there any questions on the report yonni thank you just three questions the just the financial impact in terms of the operational savings where it talks about a million dollars in terms of electricity is that a million dollars per year yes great okay cool and the second question is we 've previously heard irritations around the idea that the city would look at a dark skies kind of concept from people like Margaret Austin which is that how is that being incorporated into the kind of strategy around putting these lights in place and I just I guess just make reference to and some of us have had complaints from some at the earlier in the very early days around the likes levels and the brightness of some of the LED lights of it but uh no no that was a few years ago but can you just kind of tell impact and I guess the wider strategic sense in terms the dark skies stuff that we may have looked at previously so the just going back to the million dollars that 's when the complete network has changed over say that some relies on completing the project the with regard to the dark skies dark skies presented to Council in 2014 and they recommended the color temperature which because how white the light looks um and here it 's probably around 4000 degrees Kelvin and asked for it to be below for an hour thousand degrees cold when the first lot of LEDs were installed particularly overseas they used very blue in cold color temperature which is a high for five and a half to six thousand degrees Kelvin the say we 've settled on four thousand and that 's what we 've been installing recently the dark skies initially said keep below four and a half which we 've done they 've in support of the use of 4000 K they 've now moved to 3,000 K and they want to move lower so it 's it 's going areas of round TKO and things like that whereas a you know there 's a national don 'ts guys area that 's been here at Egeria so um the the issue of between the different colors is that the eye is more receptive to the caller colored light so you see better and very low levels of light which is what we 've got on the street lighting with a higher color temperature so the 3000 paid and sufficient and you don 't see quite as well so that that would lose some of the savings that we would be getting to move most of us you know if we 've now got about 5,000 LEDs on the network and as we haven 't really had any negative feedback or I haven 't_''_401.979 received that as if there 's a couple where we put in and the lights for we had to move one because it was loading up someone 's bedroom too much it was the end of a street nurse the light was too closely into the street but back to support of that but it 's and lot of research not all the research relates because a lot of relates to interior lighting and the much higher levels inside the other thing is that with the control system we are looking to try and reduce the levels of light sort of midnight to the early hours which will save energy but also reduce the impact on the night sky as well silly the in the past we could only put in the lighting at one level so we lit it to what we needed it at the peak times so now we have the ability of my father and just the final question from me was in regards to I mean it 's great that we 've got the electricity savings but actually being able to have things like solar powered or yeah lighting that it can generate provide itself rather than having to connect has any thought been given to trialing or looking at I get I don 't know if there 's newer technology around solar or battery yes we 've looked at solar we looked at it as part of the major cycle ways when we 're running new cables through a park it was sort of they 're all more expensive than than running a cable and putting on on the system the part of it is because the way the solar companies patched the deal they package the solar panels and the lights in the lights they use aren 't as efficient as the ones that we use on the powered system they 're not as effective at distributing the lights a so they end up with using twice as many poles which means more infrastructure and things like that so even if they use the right light it would be a bit roughly equivalent to what we 're currently using so when we are out in the street we 've got over here wise we 're putting the pot lights on those poles we 've got a wire right there obviously it 's it 's much more economic the other thing with solar is you have batteries you 've got to maintain they have some hazardous materials and those that we have to dispose of so we have to go back is improving and and you know we 're looking at it and what are the stages we 're replacing ones that are already connected to the power system so for new stuff that 's obviously those may have some infants Thank You Aaron year just mine 's just around um just a handful of streets across the city which have your touch treason and like Sabine Street in st. Albans would be one that springs to mind and so for the last 30 odd years with butchered the trees every cut Lea is to pratik the powerlines will we during this process potentially look to just underground that handful of streets rather than just connect because if we connect the lights and leave them that means we 're still going to keep reaching the trees and it 's only a handful of streets but that could be a consideration here cost of undergrounding is a lot Peaks related costs so the impact of undergrounding in it 's extremely expensive so it hasn 't been considered but that 's a different projects and what we 're talking about here anyway yes you 're doing one to replace the lights they 're saying yep when you 're doing this job not looking at taking all of the lines and putting them on the ground putting new poles and putting light fittings out yeah so it 's valid question but not as a regard to this particular project are there any further questions Jimmy issue regarding to the paragraph four of the staff in the committee the recommendation here I just want to know actually how many numbers of l-e-d will become but how many we 're looking at complaining 34,000 replacements say at the moment we 've got 7,000 on the table and we 've already got about five or four and a half to five install it 's a totally it is about 40,000 lights say at this stage we 're focusing on the the ones that are attract subsidy from NZTA because we get that and then it would roll out to the rest them so we at the 38,000 lights about 4,000 a comparator that 's when we did the business case the another 4,000 installed by December 3000 been sorry for thousands installed but German yeah 3,000 to be installed by December which leaves about 27,000 to be as part of the LTP but this the money at this stage doesn 't give the we haven 't_''_738.38 included the cost for the Installer than 3000 it would become as part of the yes the sedation wider my my concern there because you have a 27 you know thousand where become dirty so each year is around the nine thousand but a moment first or two years you 're just a four thousand and also the other three solids while you can make it or not make happen the we 're installing four thousand between now well if we get together hit between now and June which is sort of a just over six month period say the the way the program is developed as we already have a maintenance contractor goes around replaces lamps and cleans lights and that 's on a three or four yearly cycle so instead of them cleaning the lights will take the light off and put a new one on say so you thousand lights period and cleaning it they will have to add more resource to that but that 's the most cost-effective way say you we 've discussed with our contractor and and they can add resource they will build up to to go and to be able to achievers so yeah it 's all one thank you so back to Erin and then Sarah Pauline Vicki all right okay so Erin we 'll come back to you for the question yeah and then okay so you know I take it with the controlling of them it 's done in sickness and grits and stuff across the city just and my question around that would be if if it is that when there 's particular vents if it 's dimming at midnight through till daybreak to safe powering let people sleep more but in particular areas if there 's an event that it can stay up for a different amount of time or if police have an issue you would like obviously seated that you can leave it ramped up or even take it up if you have to for particular there 's a device on each light like an upside down coffee cup sitting on the top and and that 's we have wireless connection today so that also gives us the ability to bring data back first smart ass smart city stuff as well the controls and other additions to developing some places if suggesting if there 's a problem the lights can flash or whatever say it says who at this stage we 're just folk trying to step into it at a low level but there 's a lot potential to use it for other things in doubt can you rent them up above the normal rate that comes out do they go brighter when there needs to like if there 's a mowing crow on a particular Road at night that 's it 's debatable it 's at the moment we sit to 100% we can tweak we can the lights come and various wattages before we used to get little big gaps between the outputs of lamps now we can get them a little bit say and that 's an adjustment rather than the control buying them all the one watt arginine we would reset what the hundred scene does for that light and then we have some capacity so in the Central City we 've allowed to actually reduce the lights we 've still haven 't_''_942.27 we 've got lights operating but we still haven 't got it running through the system because we haven 't got a fully Commission but there is a potential that we possibly can increase beyond 100 percent but that effectively puts at risk the warranty of the Lumineers looks like that and say for short Tim probably okay but yet it 's not quite there yet thank you Vicky did you have a question okay so Pauline and Sarah have beaten you to it so moved by Pauline seconded by Sarah is there any debate Vicky yummy I just want to say congratulations to the staff for bringing this to us so quickly I think it 's stunning move and I think it 's one of the most interesting things on the agenda today I think it has huge impacts for the city the change from NZTA from move from NCTA and not a sense since I say that often actually but I 'm delighted to see it in terms of the council at the eight and a half percent reduction of the council 's carbon emissions is dramatic and brilliant 17 percent reduction in our electricity charges when it 's fully implemented a million dollars a year and this hazardous waste as well as better lighting all strike me as just being incredibly sensible and the fact that you 've just gone ahead and done the report and brought it to the committee and want to get on with it as fantastic I think it 's really good move yawning yeah yeah I 'm really supportive of this as well you 'll recall when we did our electricity contract that I did raise the significant amount of money we spent spending on electricity and obviously this subsidy and the work to get to this point wasn 't available then but you know I think this is a really positive thing for the city particularly around cost savings and I just think it 's great to have it we can think about maybe a presentation to each community board just going through because this will be a change for some areas of the city and it would just I think it 's really it 's great there 's a lot of detail and information behind it as it gets rolled out but it 'd be great just to get those community boards aware of what we 're doing and I think you know obviously the technology will evolve but the idea that we can have as can secure is raised as we can have different uses in terms of different times a day or different environments depending on what 's going on in an area I think is a real positive so you know I think this is a really good thing I 'm really glad that we 're trying to get that NZTA subsidy I was a bit concerned when I saw Auckland and Wellington getting it ahead of us but I think you know hopefully we can get the benefits of the lessons that they 're learning and we can get get this happening so yeah need to just think a bit of a strategy around how we roll it out making sure that people are aware of what we 're doing and in that local communication but very supportive of it really glad to see it happening deal you know I 'm really supportive of this as well I 'm one of the big things that I was worried about was the health impacts on LED lights and the and the wavelength obviously with 4,000 to 5,000 Kelvin but obviously been with a central management system I think that 's really good so we can actually sort of mitigate some of those risks and if these sort of you know issues we can obviously tweak it over time to actually sort of benefit the communities if there are some issues so I think I 'm really supportive of this especially with the power savings it 's quite incredible great yeah I 'm also hugely supportive of this I mean it allows us to take advantage of the increased NZTA subsidy it brings about all sorts of additional benefits additional features such as the fact that managed significant cost savings the cost savings noted in the report six hundred thousand on on maintenance and a million dollars on electricity that 's significant in anyone 's language and of course the environmental benefits as well that have been mentioned the decision for this financial year with a hundred and two percent subsidies is a no-brainer and obviously we 're signalling an intention to complete the conversion to led by 30th of June 2021 appreciating that that will require some decision-making through the LTP and we 'll certainly look forward to considering that at that time having said that 7,000 out of a total of 34,000 that we 're approving today is a significant step towards replacement across the whole network and starting to really achieve those savings yeah I think this has got a huge benefit in the decision we 're making today is a no-brainer and clearly we 're signaling that we look positively at the further funding through the LTP finally I 'd I agree with the issues that yani is raised just around communication obviously there are changes to the environment that people are the community boards been aware of that allows them to be advocates particularly if they 're aware of the the savings and the benefits involved in this as well as the change and the more that 's able to be communicated to the wider community and so that people understand what 's going on and they 're now hoods and environments the better so I 'm sure there 'll be a engagement planned but really just picking up that message out of this meeting as well that the more we can present this positively the more advocates we 'll have out there in the community that support what we 're doing because they they understand all the facets of the project so this has been moved and seconded I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "carried and then moving to item 11 the development Christchurch progress update and we have representatives from development Christchurch here this morning to speak to this report and answer questions RAF as chair of the committee was there anything that you wanted to add at this point okay so Rob and team over to you good morning and I think you for having us here today we back this up due to the PX session as well but I just wanted to take this opportunity to provide a quick update on the foreshore developments in New Brighton work and we 've just handed out the feedback as opposed to consultation pact that we 're seeking from community at the moment and some updated plans and included in there is also a postcard are produced by the New Brighton Saturday markets which we doing quite a bit of work with around enhancing that offering as part of the regeneration project so really just want to take the opportunity just to update you on progress workers substantially underway on site on the foreshore my foundations have been laid for this passion play for the 20 metre long 7 meter high Walker are being finished at the moment so the critical path item for us at the moment is the steel fabrication of the of the walker which is in a factory here in christchurch now we 're still on site being constructed and we need to get that out on site and then we 'll be the wooden elements and carvings that will be attached to it 85% of the playtoy splash play area water cannons disability access merry-go-round_''_128.02 and equipment that attaches to the locker here in Christchurch now we 've been fortunate in the last week and a half with weather after the the heavy rain of a couple of weeks ago which caused some issues on site so we remain on track for the ambitious target we set ourselves of opening prior to Christmas the view no doubt will be some finalization of some of its post that but that we want to get this open for the people of New Brighton by Christmas it is already having a positive impact on businesses in the commercial core with a anticipating that increasing through the summer as confidence is is coming back to New Brighton that things are moving hid in a really positive way last night I was joined with by a councillor east councillor Livingston and Minister woods at a public meeting which was attended by probably between two and three hundred people out of New Brighton and updating on the various projects probably the the levels of concern with what we 're doing would be an association to be with the surf lifesaving and bathing Club in its location which has been worked through at the moment but things are progressing well once we 've completed the feedback for the for the hot pools will be looking to lodge the appropriate resource consents to get that moving in the right direction questions great thank you very much indeed for the update and the additional literature this morning are there any questions yep so all we 're discussing at the moment of the matters in the report on the open agenda DCL we 'll be back this afternoon and any questions or discussion on the items in the you okay so questions Jonnie and then Dave yeah thank you um are you able just to give us a bit more of an understanding about how you 're involving the local community or the children and the elements of the playground where possible yes so as I 've reported previously our children and schools were engaged with with the design elements and that 's occurred following your feedback previously councilor we 've chased I 've chased their tap and we will be having input into hand stamps and in concrete there will be tours as we get the development moving so kids can see what is going in so that 's progressed as much as we care with what as a busy construction site at the moment presently there we 've got large excavations on-site concrete works and heavy machinery operating regards to obviously street art has been something that the city 's really embraced has there been any provision or thought given to some street art and in this area yeah the yeah we 've we do have a wall where the toilet block is being constructed in some artwork to be put on that also incorporated in the design of the equipment and clearly the walker with its linkages heritage linkages particularly to denied tahu in the references to that I 've been carefully considered and the the layout of what will be for environmental purposes around wouldn 't break will be designed in a way which will be aesthetically appropriate and pleasing thank you Dave my not so much of a question it 's more of a commendation last night 's meeting was extremely well received and the the debate on aspects of DCL were are involved and was very positive including the streetscape elements to the foreshore development as Rob indicated the only sort of issue of some concern at the moment is whether or not the Surf Club will move or as a feasible but I just like to offer my commendation to the superb work that they are doing in New Brighton the rest of the meeting was probably more the subject of land swaps where there was the contentious issue there but but again Mike my commendations to the superb work that questions great well thank you very much indeed for the presentation for the additional literature you 've provided this morning for the work that you 're doing in New Brighton and other projects and we look forward to our invitations to the pre-christmas opening of the beachside park all right thank you very much

    "text": "right now we deal with the last item statement in case or for consultation the gods died and brandished to come down and she 's on her way to answer any financial questions you might have okay so the provisions noting rescission of their anger consented we this decision triggers the special consulted procedure which we agreed to at the time of considering a proposed counts of grant receives the staff reports agrees on the mechanism by which the proposed grant will be funded to the council approve the proposed grant adopts the statement of proposal attached to the report noting that the agreed funding mechanism will be included and authorizes the general manager finance and commercials for preventing non material changes approves the consultation process contained in the statement of the proposal and appoints a hearing its panel to hear oral submissions on the proposal and others a recommendation that we change this at the end to to actually devolve to the earrings panel the ability to make the make the decision because otherwise that comes back to council and we want to get this dealt with before Christmas I 'm really open to this but I 'm perfectly happy that the hearings panel is the counselor so that we set ourselves up as a as a senator hearings panel so that way I would share the hearings panel and they 're all councillors are members of the hearings panel which doesn 't mean that you need to hear the oral submissions yep okay so hearings can panel comprised of the mirror and all counselors and all councillors to consider all Russian and oral submissions received and to make ear delegates to the hearings pin all the authority to make all decisions and respect of the grant towards the maybe but maybe the proposed grant yeah alright so are there any questions that people have fun Pauline Mike Sierra Jimmy yeah I 'm just two options that either borrowing or setting up a um a targeted rate but my question is and 5.18 these is that a suggestion or are we going with that ratio or if we wanted an opportunity to say extend the timeframe and lower the annual payments there 's no other time to do that probably now is the time to determine that because that 's what you would be consulted on okay so so we 're looking at suggesting ten million over four years with an annual targeted rate of eighteen dollars but if we were to push that out for five years or eight years can you tell me what the payments would be for either of those or another couple of scenarios yes I 'm give you the five-year option yep and that 's 14 thirty didn 't do an eight year option I did a seven-year option yeah that 's ten dollars twenty two and a 10-year option of seven dollars fifteen so in all cases the cost of the rate payer is it 's largely the same around seventy two dollars but it is spread over a longer period right I mean because there 's something like having a seven year one would be for your quarterly installments would be two dollars fifty which would I think would be more appealing to people to actually to do that of this one coming from me there 's a ten dollar option yeah so I think that 's worth considering because um the seven years workable for our time trying to have to come up with the thirteen moon I 'm not sure when you when the call will be made on an account sort of paid well but but but gathering the money in advance would mean that we would be out in untruthfulness so so starting from the first year being the first year of the LTP we would be ahead of any bills being required to be paid because else would cocoon at the point that all of the other funding obligations the insurance the Crown 's offer end the greater Christchurch building 's trust offer they would they would all kick on the four hours what so you know I think you know the hours are hours it 's not an inflation-adjusted offer it would be the ten million dollars yes I agree about but it would have CRO interest which would be helpful yeah I 'm just not sure what and I understand the timing as far as where we fall in the sequence what I 'm to take to rebuild it so the only risk was seven years would be that no Cathedral was suddenly came together faster than you see it that 's right I think that 's a fairly low risk I mean I think I think I did hear Mutual even ten years the project no I think I think that that was yeah I mean I 've kind of heard that you know that that but there 's a period of time for the for the planning but you more the build start so as I understand it that you 'd be looking at five years once that process has begun so I think we should I think I think I 'd rather err on the side of caution because there 's no reason why we can 't reduce it if you know for the final year if if we 've already got the money in the bank is it were so we could look at six years yeah all right so five-year is 14 thirty so six would be twelve it 's probably around the a twelve dollar mark yes yeah yep it had a nice ring to it anyway Mike thank you actually one of my questions was echo same as Paul lanes but the other one is obviously gonna create a pot full of ten million dollars and so if we actually looked at some of cuz officer we 've done a lot of heritage grants and not all of them get used it can sometimes actually lives and then we look to give them out for another heritage projects well she looked at the NCO actually if they left these ones from previous years and SIP reallocated into the new project least actually put them a net two million dollar pot to try and build that up and then reduce the actual impact on the right there 's any way that we can actually look at doing it something like that but good look at that on this there is quite a bit behind on heritage grants I know that but we could certainly go and do that piece of work I 'm not for this afternoon there if you if that 's when you were wanting it the issue here is as in terms of what we go out to consult with but I mean there 's no reason why we can 't you know when we when we come to consider the report it doesn 't you know if there 's another way of resourcing it that doesn 't have the have an additional impact on on the rating base for example then we could consider that and that might lead to a reduction in the overall you know amount there 's like Oh fairly much we can actually add to the pot as we 're going along and potentially we can we can stop the are targeted rate or all the borrowing earlier than its dissipated yeah and I think I think we can make I mean we can understand that that you know if we 've got the money in the bank as I was saying before if we 've got the money in the bank and if the interest has built it up we can even review at that point that well we 've already got the ten million in the bank sewed Sarah and Jimmy and Phil tnks with a targeted rate what happens for example we can fix the money and then we don 't need to use it so our resolution correctly is that we apply rate payers money only after all of the other money 's have been applied I mean in the unlikely event that you know they do enough fun one is you likely that they do not fundraising and the man all of accounts of money isn 't required but we 've already raised us what happens to that money because leave there 's several things because you 're doing it over a series of years if they actually raise a lot of money you may well have noticed of that before you reach that point so you may be able to stop early but and I have to defer to in here I think if you raise money for targeted rate specifically and you don 't use it don 't have to refund it yeah yes I think you would and it would be probably quite time-consuming and popular as well so is there a wouldn 't be because because people who have paid the rates over time might have been sold their house and moved on and see who does they 'll get to the people who paid the rates but the owner if you 're doing it over a period of time that 's right you are you 're able to get a better feel for it which is yeah what the members okay just wondering if we need to start in that first year because I mean it is likely to be a normos project there 's a lot of planning going on first and as we can adjust it as we go but of whether we need to start collecting a targeted rate that may end up not being applied in the first year of the long term plan or whether we can delay a year to three indicate that it 's their plan for it yeah but I 'm just I 'm just weary of I mean it is one of those things we you know we 've got the 600 or chicken already from someone overseas being seen to to this from overseas and there are a lot of individual ratepayers around the city who don 't want their personal money spent on the cathedral and that will come through the consultation process but whether we need rate right from the start or not I think those issues all come up and in the consultation process jump Jimmy D and then Phil my question oh good that 's right Phil so I 'm just I 'm assuming and I think we will do that we 'll have to that with for example the current Heritage funding so a big part of it being the length the landmark a grants that in fact council we would have to review a strategy around those in India funding and the other part of their to of course is it like currently those those fans aren 't paid and payable until the restoration of building is completed in so we 'd have to review a strategy the other thing I wondered is in terms of of pasa of the fundraising possibly meaning that council wouldn 't need to pay so much I 'm to join I think it 's the great Equestria charities trust who have been doing the other fun doing the fundraising how we might be able to detroying them say for example in supporting exercises like that the people steeple in fundraising events like there as a council I 'm sure we could I think the part of the crown offer was an independent fundraising panel similar so if there 's an opportunity to be involved woods that we might want to take that up yeah the people steeple is not included unless the team the the estimated 10 million dollars for the steeple is not included and the government offer that 's separate completely separate we could yeah but that could still be a fundraising venture absolutely it will wait yeah no question yeah eonni thank you just had two questions the first is um is there anything in terms of a covenant that we 're putting on I mean normally with our heritage grants we would put a covenant and what mechanism is there that we 're putting in place if we grant this funding to protect our _''_802.57 in the future if we have another event because I couldn 't see anything in the proposal that meant you know heaven we haven 't gone down down that particular track as yet again that may be something we look at more detail through the consultation period that so I wasn 't there for the original report discussion decision I 'm at the extrordinary meeting but has that been something that has been canvassed and times of what we what we agreed to was was the grant and principle yeah so there 's all of that detailed analysis and work to be done yet so but we want to get some feedback from the community first and then we will sort of a report at the end of that process so we would be ahead of ourselves if we if we put that up it 's just I can see if people were wanting to make a submission and we 're worried that given what 's happened post earthquake could happen again they might be reluctant to support it if they knew or saw that there was some sort of be quite they might think it 's it 's you know I bid it yes um second question was just in regards to the funding options this is obviously a significant contribution and there 's not much discussion about the intergenerational equity of you know people right now who are suffering post earthquake huge costs in terms of a number of different areas having to fund a lot of things being built all at the same time so I just felt that perhaps in terms of discussion the idea that gets paid off over 30 years is also more intergenerational compared to texting effectively putting a year from charge on the current citizens of the city have you given much thought to how that could be expressed in the in the document and the approach that 's been taken is that that as a decision that the council is going to make the option that it wants to choose in terms of how it proposes to fund the proposal so it 's really up to you to decide whether it 's through a targeted rate or through borrowing which would the report quick things first issue just off the back of that do we is it possible to put both forward for consultation both the targeted end the borrowed you give them anything so we could actually do that and people could say whether they want to targeted rage what they want us to borrow and have it paid off over time and then all of that can be discussed and that way we get feedback on both we know that when we only give one option we really only get feedback on one option and people don 't sort of look beyond that so whether those the potential to say hey there are two options here give us your thoughts on bias might be quite good in the other the other point was that if we do do the targeted rage and we collect more money than as is actually needed whether it is possible then if we have already consulted on it and said that we could do this to put it towards put their extra towards council owned heritage buildings such as Oh totally our city uni rather go down that track because I hadn 't appreciate a we couldn 't save any actual individuals whether we can donate at the time effort as a targeted rate that we consult on and whether we could consult on both in under the tag right things say if the targeted rate hasn 't or metered then it would go towards council-owned heritage buildings yeah so so we could to agree instead of three agree on the mechanism by which the proposed grant will be instead of three agree on the mechanism put agree that the council will consult on the preferred McNutt on the mechanism to be adopted for the proposed grant should it be approved and then put a targeted targeted right as it over a period of six years and to or borrowing and then an explanation of what that means because that remains an increase and rate so that goes on the rating base rather than on the target so donation advice okay well it means that somebody and one house will pay more than somebody another it 's based on the value of your house I you know that 's my personal view but if we 're going to consult on it we need to give people the implications of what that is in the second thing as that should all of the collect the money collectors and any interest earned exceed the amount required for our contribution to the Cathedral that it be provided that any any additional funds be applied to the restoration work that needs to be done on our own here 's his photo miss Billings yep counsel I adhere to Torrance Larry did you ever um I was gonna suggest that it might be good rather than incorporating that means the resolution to put it forward as an amendment because I mean my particular view is that we need to keep this as simple as possible and if we go out with too many options we 'll end up getting feedback that may otherwise be different than we would have got I think we want to go out with some things really simple to understand you know I mean what we 're talking about is less than the cost of doing this or do you not and tell us why rather than giving further options within that that might actually provoke a different type of feedback accept it I mean you know I 'm quite hippy you know I was going to move this and I was quite happy to to look for that I mean my original view was this but I don 't want anyone to think that they 're being denied the opportunity to consider what rates on base rates means versus Tigers were great and there is an intergenerational equity thing but there 's also I mean I 've made it really clear crystal clear and the outset that this is about that the reason that I went to the Senate to argue for been to or to to present to them why I felt they should accept the government offer and proceed with reinstatement was because it was the only option on the table that gives us an immediate resolution everything else ends up in court and and so the idea that the cost of your house influences how much you pay for certainty now 's that 's why I preferred the targeted rate but I don 't mind that we have a consideration of borrowing and all that means is that we make the decision on the form after we 've done the consultation that invites feedback on us as well so so I 'd rather leave it in the resolution and and move the resolution as it stands what was the other point that we were trying to address about the we are any excess and in providing that any excess be applied to a counts accounts it applied to accounts alone here JC it 's I me know if they 're all repaired by them then they could be applied to them for upkeep or anything you know let 's say it 's only applied for but to counsel own heritage yeah well I think we should because sorry it just never occurred to me that we would have to go and find the actual every single individual that we collected the write-off I mean the chances of this happening are slim but you know you never know Aaron I hold the prefer that we did vote now on whether we went with a and B option or just a option and three I don 't think he 's the only one that feels that way no one would pre talked about this we had talked about keeping it as simple as possible yep well because then the other one is if we 're going to open it up to all sorts of different ways of funding are people allowed to come in and say well I don 't want my targeted rate on the site loop cycleways now I just want it on the Cathedral or I don 't want to put any money into swimming pools sewing or got to it can they do all of that or is it I 'm perfectly happy that the originated you know that Andrew and you move and second the original motion and and I 'll move an amendment and Sarah will second the amendment right all right so is there any discussion Jonnie I just will speak now rather than with the amendments but I think it 's really good to go very clear choice for people and I I don 't think it 's over complicating it I think it gives people the opportunity to think about how it could be funded and I think that 's a good thing so you know I think one thing to bear in mind is although we haven 't increased a uniform annual general charge for a few years we have applied the act of travel right we 've also put on the waste minimisation right so actually the uniform annual general charge has increased quite considerably over a number of years and what we know from previous discussions around our long term plans is that that effectively means that the people on the lowest property values end up paying a higher a higher quantum percentage of the cost so my personal preference would be to go for borrowed because it also supports the injured intergenerational issue and I think you know the current generation has faced a huge increase in costs associated with post earthquake Christchurch so but you know I think it 's fair to go with both options rather than limit I would support the bar but I think it is fair to go out with two and that 's hard support that I think you 're always happy with the original but just thinking about the two options here I guess before is I want us wouldn 't want how we rate to become the story or to distract us from it I would rather hear the enthusiasm of the city hopefully although I have to keep an open mind for restoration of the Cathedral given that it could serve to unite the city you see the old craft on show and I think it 's central locations will probably serve to open people 's wallets I think we may be pleasantly surprised but I don 't know was don 't want us to get tangled up and how we 're actually going to fund this and so on those grounds I think it might be good to have the two options yes Sarah I think it 's really important that we go out with the two options and that they really clearly explained to people but I think issue on the table that we 're consulting on so there is whether we put 10 million dollars in with a targeted rate whether we put 10 million dollars in through borrowing or whether we choose not to put 10 million dollars because that is it she the third option there is a do nothing that 's the point of the consultation that 's do we put pitch in 10 million dollars and so I think we need to be really clear in the consultation that we 're doing three options two of which authorized funding and one of which doesn 't thanks Andrew Mike thank you I made some comments earlier I just think keeping this simple is absolutely the way to go I wouldn 't normally support a what 's essentially an increase in the uniform annual charge I normally by default would go for a value-based raising mechanism but the amounts that we 're talking about here is so low and I think there 's value to being able to call out that relatively low amount as a dollar figure per rating unit rather than the possible feedback choosing the question for the people of Christchurch here is whether we fund this or whether we don 't the the mechanism that we use when we 're talking about such such low amounts I think could easily lead to a conversation which is different than one we want to have which is hearing from the people of Christchurch whether or not we do this so as I say my my normal position would be to go for a value-based rating mechanism rather than increase in uniform annual charge but in this case I think for ease of understanding and clarity of feedback it would be good just to go out with one option as originally proposed but some comments over and above that I mean I certainly am pleased that we 've moved very quickly to go out for consultation I think it 'll provide the necessary certainty when we hear back from the people and I look forward to hearing free back it was Nick 's mic and Aaron sorry thank you and I also can 't support the amendment we 've gotten out with two different funding it comes down to really to two things does the public want us to fund the Cathedral or ps3 rates or do they not and if we go out with simple information if this is how much it 's going to cost you over this mini is then it 's easy for them to make their decision and it 's easy for us to listen to their and then make our own decision Aaron yeah I would urge my fellow councilors to vote in favor of the initial report which is to go out with a targeted rate because it lets every single household in Christchurch know exactly how much they 'll be putting in that 's less than a cup of coffee per quarter it is really clear and simpler if we open it up basically no one will know how much they pay if it 's based on your property value it would be extremely hard to work that out it does mean some people will pay five times more for the restoration and the Cathedral than others that 's that 's a given and so there is start making it really really mucky and we give our other options because this is do we do it or do we not put this funding in then other ones will come in and people have the opportunity to come and say well actually I don 't want that poll on them what anymore and that 's the same amount of money that can go to the Cathedral I don 't want the hot pools and Vine they will come up with that stuff if we open up the hornet 's nest and this will potentially be a hornet 's nest and I 'm more than happy to play with Hornets if everyone else wants to because it 's entertaining but it will not be productive they sting I shall put the aminos oh sorry Jamie yeah I won 't won 't support the amendment I think that having an amendment like this just as a prime example of getting caught up with the process and losing sight of the outcome and I think that 's what will be achieved you know with with the residents there 's a big want to get genuine feedback on and that is would you like to see the council help restore the cathedral consultation inherently doesn 't preclude anything and I think fundamentally you don 't know what you don 't know so as we go into a process we were going to hear submissions there 'll be a range of different ideas that we 'll hear and we can 't sit around the table by committee and start guessing or pre-empting what will come up and what 's valid to come up and what 's not valid to come up and I think the really sad thing about the amendment more than anything else is that all of a sudden the narrative around us is that there could be someone on the community that pays five or six or seven times more than someone else for restoring the cathedral and it loses sight of a pretty fundamental question that we 're asking so if you want it to be about borrowing and the methods for how that 's being funded and then it 's it 's kind of an irrelevant conversation that of a more important issue so I think that 's a straight-out read hearing and it would just be yeah walnuts knew something was an inscription was used earlier and it would just be a real hornet 's nest to open up and I don 't know why you 'd want to so nothing 's particular by going to consultation anyway everything 's on the table but it 's just it just muddies the waters asking that sort of stuff anyway so ignore it and I urge you to not support the amendment I put the amendment all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no no it 's lost does anyone particularly want to record which way they voted Sarah Jonnie and no no just an oyster just the uses just fine you just said you want to record how you vote on the amendment was to consult on the two options yeah so there 's just Sarah and Yanni own text on view either way I don 't care my views recorded and so now we go to the original resolution which we 're just getting which the proposed grant will be funded should the council approve the proposed grant so a question just just for clarification in terms of agreeing to that is it possible to agree to that as the preferred mechanism but also have information on the other one and what happens if people make submissions asking for the second one that we 've rejected can we still choose to fund it through that we could but we 're oh I said green now we 're agreeing now that the targeted rate will be the mechanism by which the proposed grant will be funded but that 's for consultation we 're not we 're not consulting on the mechanism we 're gonna you know if we 're in the middle of a boat so I 'm accepting a question probably out that 's out of order did you have a question yeah I just had a question on the the growth our projected growth over the next six years or whatever no no that 's not not relevant but we 're into boating so and this it 's a technical question about the green bit the target rate will be the mechanism by which the proposed grant will be funded should the council approve the proposed grant can I can I just make a point perhaps we should say a targeted rate over six years over six years and can we just have that one put super well we just voted for the amendment which was lost so you can if you and Sarah want to oppose that I 'm happy for that to be recorded but item three so that 's not in Syria so it 's just the inverse of the other boat and on that note I will put the resolution all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and _"

    "text": "all right look um we 've been working sort of quite hard on on on what the alternative is to option one I think people have clearly understood from all of the discussions that have been had over the last week while that what the community board presented was in fact a long-term option and so not within the framework of what we are capable of considering right now that would have to be considered as part of their LTP and so I 've just been working with a variety of people to see if we could come up with some wording that that captured that now I 'm just not going to accept any motions at the moment because there 's going to be a bit of a conversation there 's a number of questions that people have and I want to allow sufficient time for those questions to be asked and answered I mean the first document talks about staff engaging with Environment Canterbury to clarify roles and responsibilities and the coastal environment and I think that 's really important that we start get feedback from staff on of that consideration but that 's that 's an important issue the one that I 've been working on is that we proceed to approve the identified extensions of the bun from bridge Street to the South Brighton city and that 's picking up the language of the first resolution that 's in front of us but that we agree that fixed no actually that 's this actually it shouldn 't read agreed I 'll change my own with it should read to fear consideration of any extension to the Bund proposed from yacht-club to await further advice once the Tonkin and Taylor and port has been receiving consideration has been given to the regeneration strategy for this area and that that way it actually provides context for the deferral it 's it means that what the community board would consider was a long-term option and we 're only looking at short-term options and I think one of the questions for staff will be well what are the risks associated with deferring and the space and I think that a number of councillors have got questions around the land drainage priority area over other priority areas and what the impact is on the land drainage recovery program so there 's a whole range of issues so I kind of would like it to be relatively open and and engaged with staff so if I could start with my first question which is with our staff to engage with Environment Canterbury to clarify roles and responsibilities in this coastal environment not just like some feedback on how that process has for Goong I know that you haven 't got very far but it would be really good to have a little bit of feedback on on where you 've got to so far and I think Helen might be joining us at the table right right so we have hit a preliminary two preliminary meetings with Environment Canterbury staff around the broader issues of planning for the coastal environment because they 've also got some thank you they 've also got some planning mechanisms in the wind in terms of updating the regional coastal environment plan so the Environment Canterbury are keen on three things with respect to south shore first about the coast and how we adapt to to climate change and changes due to the earthquake along our coastline and they are proposing that we set that up under the regular forum that our councillors have with their councillors the second thing is that they support the regeneration strategy is the place to have the conversation about the long-term proposals for South Shore and South New Brighton and they see this as perhaps one of the first serious conversations we have about adaptation to climate change for our coastal communities so they 're very much support that and in the meantime they would support a do minimum option with respect to the emergency works that have been carried out so that 's the the gist of it great that 's good okay Sara thank you I 'm I just like to go back to the original notice of motion and we 're on the 3rd of August the part 2 of the notice motion that was approved looked at extending the fund so completing to every bus into the stuff that are being done which is fine but to on lessee would design history side of South Shore in the south Brighton domain to the duty one of the reasons I voted for this was because of the woods as necessary and I know that while the whole part of work has been done to look at where the buns would go and how they would be done what we haven 't had is actually information on whether the buns are necessary or not there might be a desire those things but are these buns necessary to actually protect houses that have flooded in response so sure aerated see some flooding in July this proposal is based around modeled information and risk balancing so every storm is different so we 've gotta be careful not to fall in the trap of just chasing what happened in the last storm the information that we have is that abundant provided through the the domain the middle section as proposed would have benefit in protecting particularly the campground area in extreme very extreme events there could be inundation that goes beyond the demand and through to the residential areas but in most get that far and the report says that the number of houses that have been identified might be overstated even at that point yeah so the original estimate was based on what we call a bathtub model such as filling up behind a storage we 've now hit some preliminary hydraulic modeling that shows as alluded to in the earlier report that the risk is lower because the amount of time the tide can overtop the edge doesn 't fill that bathtub yeah and the other place that we see the words is necessary appear is actually in the reserve management plan and so when it comes to the objective to protect and provide for flood protection functions of the reserves and it does allow for that which is which is excellent but three point three point ones is allows stop banks retention basins or other flood protection measures to be raised as standard and maintained as necessary for flood protection and I 'm just wondering if the test here again for the extension like I completely understand this toppings that are currently in place and they have protected homes being necessary to be able to place them and this reserve at this time odd unresponsive ahead identified inside the lanterns recovery program a need for work of this or a similar nature in this area and we however though weird prioritized it after the his get and even but management implementation plan processes so the need was foreseen for this type of work and but it was foreseen to adhere a little bit later in time but would it be necessary all sort of and desired I mean it is it going is it necessary especially when we 've got more information coming through Tonkin and Toyota of those kind of things do we know that it 's necessary or we still actually not quite have the information to spend an extra million dollars that may not be meant necessary of rate payers money my response would be the preliminary hydraulic modeling is showing that the risk is lower than that original estimate for the reasons I explained earlier and that understanding is developing with time and that with any capital works program we would respond to any significant is lower than previously thought and if the subsequent Hyderabad along that we do when we go through and confirm those results and test different scenarios AFET showed that the risk was in fact what I would gently come back and or much like the previously reported would come back to you it was a subsequent decision making process thank you so the timing for that though so if we today looked at approving extending works and their contractors already sort of teed up to do some of that work would your new modeling and advice that we wouldn 't necessarily need the bunsby in time to stop the work happening and stop the spinned we certainly well we are undertaking it design work now we 've engaged design consultant to do that work and it would certainly be in advance of physical works no but the modeling work that would show whether the work was necessary or not wouldn 't be done until the works were done and contracted no the antenna certainly to do the design work before we 're doing a construction work and then there 'll for us necessary okay so but we but we could potentially not decide today to do the Bund wait till that work has been done and then decide whether it 's needed or not rather than you having to come back in saying all could you resend your previous decisions I think that there is just that risk assessment to be made in terms of the the likelihood of another major storm event wireless you know there 's any deferral the the risk that we determine whilst we don 't know the the exact details are that it would require an extreme storm event in order to inundate that area so on that basis the the deferral would be considered to be relatively low risk whilst further work was being was being carried out and fill and then David Suki just for clarification are you really saying that if we approve the the northern part but still leave the piece in the middle on the map that in fact the risk of flooding orientation is relatively low if we consider the the three sections that the section at to the the main and the northern section to bridge Street I think in terms of priority the the first priority would be the the southern section that we 've already built a temporary pond for the second priority would be the northern section Bridge Street and the third section in terms of flood protection would be the central area from the jetty to the boardwalk so you know we 're considering the assessment on that basis and and so the other question I 've got is around by not by not progressing the middle section given that there 's machinery for example really or really they 're constructing the carpark area is if you 've got some kind of estimate of extra costs if we don 't complete debt section I know you have to come back to do it again sometime it 's not currently an tend to utilize the existing parks contract for the car park area for enacting any works that have resolved today or the stabilization works to the southern portion resolved earlier that would be a new physical works contract whether or not you could let presented in this report if that was staged then there was likely to be additional cost if he had multiple construction contracts it 's likely though that the the setup costs of coming back more than once would be relatively small in relation to the overall scale of the of the package okay and my final question really is around making sure that this decision would be consistent with the reserve management plan in tow I assume that the first part the northern part is and in that effect if we follow the decision the recommendation to defer the middle section that in fact it would still be consistent this decision will be consistent with their management plan yes that 's that 's correct David and then Pauline look I just wanted to focus on some of the questions being asked but the risks associated with what I would call area one just by Bridge Street we are can you confirm there was some planning for a stop bank to the progress from Bridge Street to a certain length into the towards the GT I think probably a couple of a flood risk in that area and will the funding that I hope we approved with button one here actually be of benefit to reducing flooding particularly in that sea field place in the back of the school okay yes there is some proposals for a short length of additional bunt just drop by bridge treatment of stopping I 'll stop in Korea as as part of the wider Aven River and stop banking project and and yes again that the Bund that is proposed between the GT and those works there primarily for the benefit of those reason it 's long stand seriously thank you and then the I agree with you I think the bit in the middle of flood risk Waller is still arrest there it 's not to the same extent as around the area immediately adjacent of registry thank you I 'm calling yeah thank you just just clarification again if we did nothing more today the risk is still as low in your view I mean Noah 's got a crystal ball but yes it 's a focus on the residential properties up the I think the from the London 's recovery program point of view we do focus on risk to residential properties and primarily to above floor flooding any any measures that we we build will reduce will reduce risk but there 's always potentially a bigger storm so it 's it 's what level we protect us I think they the the northernmost section from Bridge Street to the to the jetty there would be more risk reduction benefit in building that when there would be through the central section okay any if that piece fee was was done what a align what would the cost of it be because we 've got one to 1.4 million attached to if we did the story that 's one of which we 've done what would be the the cost of registry to the GT please the early estimates indicate it might be in the realm of five hundred six hundred thousand dollars so in there in that sort of order that 's you know about roughly about half the length roughly but yeah Nick and Sarah yeah we got notification from South 't had advice back on that can you can someone just give us an explanation about how that notification foot certain worth the decisions that we may say that 's right what are you talking about well so what I 'm worried about is we 're making a decision of that you know to do something to either minimize or mitigate a level of risk to a community who 's given us the notice around notification for liability of risk so I would like to sort understand how these two are related if at all but do we need to do that sorry well what so we don 't talk about it no I 'll just say I don 't know what you 're talking about it I haven 't seen anything know but there 's no point you sending it to me right now because I 'm not gonna be able to read it so you know because um there 's somebody is somebody referred it for legal advice yep into a question if you like to staff that if we were to approve through the buttons and they and you 're saying we can 't predict the x-team you know I think the question that he 's asking is the other way around which is if we fail to approve an extension of the bun that protects properties and there is a subsequent Flutterfield which effects houses in the area that would otherwise have received some protection from these is there a liability question that arises understand and I guess that 's the that 's the legal question that we 're asking for some advice on but and I think my position is valid also but that lets the enemies that 's the Unversed I 'm just saying like it 's hard for me to make a decision today given the number of questions that relate to either doing something called doing nothing without knowing a response to that that we we got on the 4th of October and so we did say we would get some advice when that 's received and I was just wondering if you know we can get that I have no idea what you 're talking about so I don 't get getting organizational because it did go to you as well yeah it did come in to you yeah okay so um can I just a second question then um no not relate to that but we will also had a deputation for himself Brighton and they just got me thinking of rid through in terms of the community views and preferences where you talk about I guess the community board engaging but as is there any other sort of expectation in terms of that or process that we could use to actually engage and consult with the wider community rather than just having the sort of an eternal feedback from the community would and I don 't want to this is just on 17 on page one to one I don 't want to minimize the view of the community board that 's very important and and the groups that represent it but we 've had a number of leaders deputations previously that of people that have expressed of you know some concern views and I just wonder what the process is that we can robustly engage with the wider preparation of the existing management planning and development plan the wards public consultation undertaken to determine the content of that so if you 're looking at modifications then to reconsider options consultation if the plan is going to be changed I just want to be clear if we go with option one we don 't need to seek community views or if we go for half of option one we don 't need to seek community views because those whose have been sought through the management plan yes and that was in 2014 do you think it 's fair to alarm dues from 2014 and and 2017 nearly 2018 so what yes ask the question of what to change I suppose we 'll just whether it 's it 's you know I guess in terms of risk of challenge of process or fair process whether I guess we 're nearly 2018 whether we should be relying on 2014 view so that going back to the community well normally you wouldn 't modify a management plan within at least five years and this has been some significant change and circumstances or 're just named render staff they 've indicated that the risk is very low though so I mean because it 's not near a dolphin no you have other than you know we 've we 've had a few reports to counsel obviously the local board and the councilors will be well aware ever I am surprised at the number of people that are still approaching us with concerns over what 's being proposed and so I would I would you know think that maybe that should be a sort of flag that we might need to go and seek community views before agreeing to an option just in terms of the broader views and the longer-term options as part of the regeneration strategy involves full engagement process with the community so we 're working on an engagement plan at the moment and it will be community lead to get the best and fullest involvement of that community and south strong seventy Brighton so this is one way to test those views this is what we 've explained right at the start there 's a difference between short-term interventions which so the interventions that we have in front of us are all short-term interventions the long term interventions have to await the regeneration strategy the strategic approach and as has the community at the heart of it you know in it 's a it is a really good model for in a non sort of what 's weird non-threatening environment you have an opportunity to consider you know don 't have the Tonkin and Taylor report that 'll be November yeah we consume option we consult over 300 yellow lines going down on the street for no parking we 're spending up to two million dollars or a million dollars depending on you know on something that the community of raising concerns about and we 're not consulting or engaging publicly so that 's orange it 's not remotely Lemaitre changed yeah well I sources this tune of your option says you know but the point is is that you 've got a you 've got a think of the regeneration planning as a much much longer period than twenty years hell of a lot longer but it doesn 't but you know look it 's done councils hands I mean the council is perfectly entitled to decline to go down this trail so it is if you 're saying is there a unanimous view emerging from that particular environment no there isn 't_''_1529.72 I mean I 've had emails today from people who live in the area who don 't support the view of the community board but that 's not the problem is I 'm so convinced that this is a short-term temporary option and you know I 'm I 'm just I 'm happy to support one thing that provides protection for you know a degree of protection for the area that is the that where the houses are I think we can do a lot more work once we 're into the regeneration strategic approach in the tonkin and Taylor Report for the others now I 've got a list of people I 've got Sarah term and then Glen thank you just three quick things and when you 're talking about the community lead engagement process I 'm just I 'm just I 'm just currently don 't feel like they could speak publicly against you know the the hard edge and those kind of had engineering solutions because they feel intimidated by a vocal group who really do want those and just making sure that whatever processes community lead is also managed carefully by Council so that people do feel like they can then put a contrary view and that we don 't just get a one-sided opinion yes yes so that the engagement plan will in the process well will ensure that that happens because of them the no predetermined outcomes so everybody needs to be able to feel comfortable to put forward their views and those views will be considered so it will be designed to ensure we get the greatest engagement yeah that 's good cuz I know there are people who currently don 't feel like they can speak sorry in the full the recommendations need to be considered yes cool and the other thing is on the reserve management plan it 's is that three point three point one again proposed stop banquets must be considered in consultation with vocal ie consultation has occurred at this point yeah we have had an initial discussion with MKT around the option table to the stabilisation the emergency works and the need or otherwise professional cultural impact assessment so that discussion has started yeah so I can understand that for the current stabilization works but the proposed that rather work that in place but the proposed work to the extension and have we talked to tongue a Tofino a locally we about the proposed extension we have been limited their conversation to the stabilization of the emergency works we just has just been triggered by that sort of resource continuing person okay so we haven 't done what the management plan says use yeah it 's a process that 's underway I guess that 's going to start okay but it would have been good to get feedback prior to making a decision on whether we should go ahead with them yeah and just the last one and there 's been some talk of the current management plan a beta being widely consulted on and those kind of things being revoked by the process or legal requirements are around there because I know that it 's being talked about and whether that needs to be replaced by a new at the same time so my understanding is that there is need one at all times so to modify a management plan of you looking at a minor change then that can be a council decision you 're potentially involving affected stakeholders but it can 't_''_1743.33 be accountable to decision council decision but not a community but one plan it would be normally would be a council decision okay and to simply revoke a reserve management plan can you actually revoke that but if if the effect was deemed to be significant and comprehensive review is required so that for example if you change the position of the bunt then they would have other effects in the area so that you 're probably looking at a comprehensive view which then under the reserve date requires thought consultation so effectively the standard management plans process which could be anywhere between in this case it might be a little bit short code probably at least it you couldn 't simply revoke it no such thing okay thank you reserve classification of a management plan thank you very much um Sarah Dunn Tim and England thank you um if you look at the picture on page one one seven at six point one I 'm not quite sure who to aim the question it but you know we would be cheerful with the money we have and clever with the budgets etc and we 're always looking for more being for back although she 's not here but when we did our walk and if you look at the picture you can see that GCS comes out and south of that you can see the brand new bike ramp which I have to say is pretty impressive so why is there a proposal for us or a plane or as a Plane full of sickened by cream at the car park anyone that because if we 're trying to be clever why would you give two boat ramps and we 're looking at funds in that area and I 'm presuming that we 're building the would be a net design because you can 't go from a car park to a boat ramp without some kind of interconnection so so our office off Wahid I think one was generally for public use in wonderful in the Yacht Club I don 't know 100% sure about that sorry so we 're trying to be clever and we 're building two boat rims and within 100 metres or so of each other it 's just ridiculous sorry what budgets it coming David supporting yep that 'd be easy well yeah I 'm certainly not gonna support I mean you 've got we 've got to work with communities and communities got to work together and suddenly we 're gonna have two boat ramps 100 metres Partin fantastic that felt on Hogan paid for the one for the club which is great but surely this go be smoked interconnection in here yeah yeah and we used to have yep absolutely and they used to be motor racing on that and the eastery but there 's not anymore but I 'm a fetus we 're in a different world we have in our head to science a theory be well-balanced a great-looking boat remphan it 's fantastic for that community but we 've rejected clever and thin thank you I just wanted to reassure councillor Johansson that I 've been contacted by a spokesperson from sea field place and also critic Street that met with their local MP that wanted to know what was the council proposing to do by way of any kind of sea wall stop Bank to protect properties and this is when this item was first on the agenda and so I sit back the report at the time so in terms of the consultation question I 'm not sure how much further we will kiss or rather add value if we went back to the residents when they 've already come to us so that they just want some reassurance they want to know where we 're taking some action yep all right so not just by trying to get a gauge on the the 19 homes that could be have reduced level of risk if from the funding from the July have been got flooded what was the iStent made a number of houses that could have been flooded from that I mean we haven 't necessarily run that event through the hydraulic model to get the parallel eastman and some know it might be negative or undetected the mixed design stages but it 's not something I have to answer because obviously going back to the task force task force report it said there was two houses that could have been protected there suddenly we 've got one area that somebody bumped up to 219 where we haven 't done the detailed hydraulic modeling so it 's already having been seared it 's probably an over estimate so I 'm just trying to get where that level really really sits because from what I can see a lot of this bund and all that 's going to do is protect a campground and actually not houses in Lok across the city we 've got issues with with flooding and logograms and flooding and we really need to prioritize homes that we know are at great risks and so this is my concern estimate how close we can get to a more true indication of what the risk is so in that middle reach certain made their campground is first at risk and that that there 's a depression formed within the campground that would have to fill before you overtop and flow down into the residual errors again once if there 's enough volume of water coming into that area to fill that depression and spilled down and history Roeder 's the subject of further analysis so so we 're talking about an extreme of being hair extreme dinners they need to be to actually flood these properties to go above the floor levels well we are we are to America means I think the recent July flooding is a significant it was a very extreme event and we saw that there was some overtopping of the East Ridge behind the campground and that there was some flow into the campground but there wasn 't sufficient didn 't appear to be sufficient to like the campground entirely for example or spill through the downstream so we are talking about variant frequent in biggest event since I think different properties and different but are you talking about a bigger event than that well there 's we as Keith mentioned earlier not all events are the same the flood risk is built up of a whole lot of different components we need to understand all those components individually and collectively and not forget a complete understanding of the risk that events that occurred in July doesn 't represent all possible storm events or all possible history war levels that might occur but yes it was a pretty extreme event we see them as you mentioned that it was the highest on record if we hit that same event again then it would need to go on for longer for example in order to activate that I 've learned slow paths in the way that is would be managed through this bump right okay but Yanni raised a question about the email that was received and I have collars and I have got a response to it but it and I just wanted to give people reassurance so the notification one was under the soil care not to the council so it 's an it 's just it 's just an incorrect notification and it doesn 't meet the intent of the of the legislation that would apply to us which is the drainage eat so it 's just only in their local body amalgamations the the board 's wentworth sorry they they took that the note that the the the catchment boards went with the region and the drainage boards went with the city so but anyway and we 'll just get that tidied up and sit around a table and due course but you know it 's it was fair enough i 'm sorry i just didn 't read every single email i got that day all right so so how do you want to deal with this do you want to move the yep okay well I 'm happy to second that and so that would so that would replace one and in two and three would become three and four yeah okay option three I don 't think you need to it 's the it 's the opposite though no no 't pass the point you don 't need to move it if it doesn 't pass if you if this fails there will be no additional work are there any other foreshadowed motions by foreshadow that I 've chicken to the full shadow you know so it 's it 's either this option now or it 's it fails so so I think I 'll just invite people to speak for it and against it so Dave would you like to know can I just ask for one one thing before you move that talk and and Taylor do a lot of reports for Council yeah we refer to that as the revised coastal hazards assessment yes yes once the revised coastal hazards assessment has been received wonderful reportin it 's fine yep thank you all right David before us does address the short-term funding funding sorry flooding mitigation options and that the Community Board recommendation is actually more of a combination of erosion and flooding controls I 'd also like to acknowledge that the Heathcott issues are a higher priority and that works that we are looking at here 'd like to just realize that the self brightened domain is a much-loved recreation area for the coastal ward in fact you know really when you when things are a bit scaly on the beach this area is a really sheltered and highly used recreation area I support the amendment to defer any action on the middle area pending further investigation community consultation consultation with other interest groups associated with the history and the release of the Tonkin and Taylor report that we refer to a second ago and November but on top of that odd also you know for a long time now we 've been talking about regeneration planning for other earthquake related activities in the South Brighton area and I really want to see that issue progressed a lot faster than it is at the moment we have a number of members of our community particularly in the areas north and south of British Street that are looking for some action on on that regeneration planning and it is taking an exact seeding lee long time look on the lictor to represent the interest desires aspirations of here we 'll put a wick and pray this is the lady in the sefirot in the area Samantha Fraser name and she 's taking it on their own accord to actually go and talk to residents up and down her street and surrounding areas as to work in progress thus 351 people have actually come back to her and said they actually quite liked what the community board has recommended I also like to acknowledge that yesterday we 've had a couple of letters emails to the contrary and I 'm sure there will be a number of people in our community that that would have a contrary opinion I 'm reminded of my attendance at a coastal June forum a few months ago where there was a coastal scientist Jim Don was his name who specializes and a lot of work in the Coromandel area he advocated that the best solutions ones that evolved through community input that have community Boyan and possibly the ultimate solution as a community involved in the implementation of an agreed outcome be that in its construction and or landscaping planting so I the greater we appreciate that this amendment or action in the middle area that we 're deferring will require long term planning initiatives but people in my ward or the coastal ward are very passionate about their environment and will rise to the occasion as they have done on many occasions to ensure that the best outcome for their area is achieved so I think we have the opportunity to to to look at this area is unique that is different and it has a lot of attachment to people in my ward and I really support this amendment which gives us the opportunity to explore those options and and come to a solution like Jim Thomas is one that 's had the buy-in from the community had the boy and from the interest groups and we just get on and do something that we know is going to be not only good for our area but a solution that as has the agreement of everyone as well thank you good thank you I 'd like to put my Ivan here could eastery here tight trust hit on this on I still relate to the community board as the bill would representative I support these options here you 've heard about option one and the concern of the residents who many believe they accept the realities of climate change they would also like protection with the area and I think with options two three four they will suit to allow time for the group such as the trust which unites both the Heathcott and the Aven and the community board to arrive at in a great position the trust has reached out to the board through Tim and found the reception 's been very favorable so I 'm hopeful that we can actually work together and not get into a kind of a warring scenario the we do have a duty I think of care at least and I 'll stress the mol sense of that towards both our community including the ecological community in those values which we must protect I think in a way even Smith 's initiative the Sunday it was kind of a metaphor for the whole thing you know meet in the middle and I trust and the community board and our constituents we don 't want to end up warring they actually need to meet in the middle these are hard conversations to have over climate change with earthquake affected communities but I think we do need to have them and on that note I think it 's really important that the community board itself does start to use the language so that 's our board David that we start to use the language of climate change more often and that we actually start to embed it and our plans going forward because it is a reality it is happening you 've seen that the Banks Peninsula pictures this morning you can 't deny the information globally we actually have to grab hold of it and try and work together these are really hard issues but we have to try and be open and honest with each other and find ways forward if Sarah then Phil Pauline thank you I just had to take run back to the 24th of August meeting where we actually approved the stabilization for you know sort of up already been put in this area and those stop things have done a really good job and we 've approved stabilizing them for a million dollars plus or minus 40 percent and we 've done that work already and that work has protected the houses that most need protection in this area already there are houses who are now the next cab off the rag but the worst ones are already now protected staff have told us that the risk to these other houses is now lower than previously thought and they have said that deferral of any of these extensions is now a zero low risk and so when we 're looking at whether this is necessary or not and the words necessary we 're in Dave 's notice of motion from the 3rd of August you know extend the Bund if necessary and we 're necessary it 's clearly not necessary at this point the reserve management plan for the area talks about stop banks going and if necessary and these ones are clearly not necessary the management plans is that any proposed stop bank must be consulted 't happened before today 's meeting and so I 'm not sure that we can even go ahead and approve an extension of the buns without that consultation happening a million dollars plus or minus forty percent for this extra work may not seem like a lot of money to councillors when we 're throwing around tens of millions of dollars in our conversations about land drainage but a million dollars to our community of ratepayers is a lot of money and we are legally bound to be prudent with ratepayers money I 'd like to remind councilors Livingston and east that while they are counselors for their specific wards they are also city councillors city councilors bound to act in the best interests of the whole city and of all of ratepayers ratepayers money and I would like to urge them to think about that as they vote today councilor east was correct when he talked about the best solutions ones being ones that have been done with community and pot and the reserve management plan was just there the reserve management plan done in 2014 after the earthquakes stop banks only being used where absolutely necessary and about the naturalization of the estuary edge for future good protection of the coastal environment and for the houses in the area and so I 'd like everyone today to think about that as we move forward and to vote against the the extension of the buns today and to look for future information if needed in the future om Pauline look I 'm going to support these recommendations I have I have some sympathy ready for the the concept and in fact it 's really important that we be careful with what might be sound like only a million dollars as serious as you stone especially given the needs on the got and and I think that 's been well Illustrated and into and while in fact you know that this community may need to have some flood protection there 's no doubt that there 's the same or greater urgency really given the numbers of people on the heath care who 've been flooded and and flooded well above the floor level in I think though that what the I think at this stage are compromises necessary I would think that the community board are moving up sounds like they 're prepared to move some way to actually accept what has been referred to as you know that the very and clear consequences now of climate change and well and certainly there 's every reason for residents to be engaged in this it 's clearly going to be essential that they are all fully informed about the long-term impact of climate change not just the short-term consequences of the recent flooding that weird say so and I 'm glad that the that in fact these that the options have well most of the the northern section is remaining and that 's the area where staff have indicated that in fact homes are at the greatest risk of flooding and and that flooding would be reduced so I think as I 'm saying to though along with us it 's essential that the views of all of the community are heard and us and so that they are fully informed now Pauline you thank you this is a very difficult fix the whole city right now we wish we had the money in the resourcing to do there and 2014 as a result of the floods we had then we where the staff produced the mural task force for flooding report that was a really detailed really really high level good report and only they identified levels of risk you know level one was when your house flooded above floor level level was floor level more than one level two was effort flooded below level or above floor level once so of course we know flopped and was really high up in the numbers there but then we have the second as it 's the upper Heathkit in a lower Heathkit combined there are about two hundred and three at 209 and level one and level two combined it 's the number of houses at risk South Shore level one one level two one one has it rested flooding above floor and one pass at risk of flooding below floor we have to use this as a guide for our priorities now we say a million dollars plus or minus millions or hundreds of millions of dollars of the land drainage recovery plan yes it might not be a lot but when you apply it everywhere else it does matter we 've had people in Heath kept waiting and waiting and waiting for the solution why because we still under investigation we haven 't got all the investigation done yet South sure we still haven 't done the investigation we 're still waiting for the hydraulic modeling we 're still waiting for the tile container report and I think to be a balanced decision-maker we have to be fear we have to be fair to the city and does not just I really really feel for people out there and every time it rains we get a high tide or an event that is scary that 's scary for people in Heathkit too we have to wait for evidence to make a good decision so at this point in time I 'm sorry I can 't support this resolution I can 't support spending any more money out here today and I think that what we 've done is we emergency routes in the last event and I think that I 'm just happy to or not happy but I 'm going to have to stay with it and at the moment not spend any more money out here at my kaneen Yanni thank you and I 'm pretty much gonna echo councillor Connor it at the moment in dam councillor East said earlier and rightly so then obviously this priority around that Heath good River and I think we really need to seriously look at that this is Elaine drainage working program recovery program and it 's a large sum of money but if we 're going to start pulling money out of different pots worth in there well need to put that into the priority areas and we know that the hit cut is so if we 're going to pull out this militant of 1.4 million dollars let 's see what we can do in his cuz that is actually where the real leaders listening to staff and reading through the reports it 's very clear very very clear that actually the risk to this area is sure that when we 're going to be prioritizing areas we do it on level of risk to the houses that are going to be flooded and we cannot go backwards because we have community groups that allowed of another ones that are actually patiently waiting who actually get in their houses flooded every time there 's a small amount of rain so I will not be supporting this this option we have got a recovery program it is the right recovery program and has been prioritized accordingly and so therefore I will not be supporting this yeah yeah well you know I I just wanted to say that um I think you 've come up with a good compromise resolution and as someone who represents an area that is flooded we 're not waiting for the money we 're waiting for the investigation and so I would have I was really keen after the flooding in 2014 to put in some temporary meters that would alleviate mitigate some of the potential risk and obviously that hasn 't happened but I actually couldn 't turn around to this community in some temporary measures until we get the long term solutions and I wish that we 'd done it in heathco but you know whatever that decision was made back then we are where we are today so I don 't think it 's fair to compete their areas against each other to say that basically because they 've got issues then we shouldn 't fix what is a concern in another area in fact we should be doing both and if the people that are speaking against this option would like to put forward some proposes for the Heathcott to spend this money today I 'd be more than happy to support that but at the moment we 've got this on the table and I think actually you know we 've had deputations we 've had a notice although it 's to a to a different organization in terms of a can around some of the concern around liability for an Christopher dressed post-earthquake and if we weren 't anything from the recent events in July it was the uncertain nature of the events that can happen enough city is a small price to pay for giving some residents a greater level of comfort not the perfect solution by any stretch of the imagination but we 're talking about area that is very discrete very small in terms of the reason the compromise resolution that 's been put forward which I think is more than fair enough while we spend the time doing the longer-term planning in this area my preference would have been to go and have a public consultation and engagement even over the short-term options but given that is people living at risk of injury of being flooding or coastal inundation I think it is the right thing to do so I 'm very supportive of these resolutions that are being poor I would urge councils to support it I don 't think it 's fair to criticize this proposal at the expense of others given that those other areas are also a priority and people are working hard on finding the solutions for them and you know at the end of the day we do take a citywide approach to this and my understanding of being realistic about the stuff that we could get on and do that was less complicated and more simple and straightforward versus the stuff that was more complex and will take longer to understand and I think that 's the position we 're in today start up to a huge amount of work on this and it 'd be a real shame to waste that by voting against thoughts being proposed Tim thank you well I just really want to clarify something it 's with city councillors and first of all we were you have to represent the city and then the areas we 're living with the land drainage it 's really clear about priorities and where they sit I won 't be supporting this because I think that the land drainage program has identified the priorities and where they are and we worked through it was obvious you know flopped in bells Creek etc and we are going to the highest needs and that 's what we 've got to prioritize so I don 't really like us talking about this this debt I think it 's clear I stand I 've mentioned and that my area a number of times but I 've also supported the program i 've also support supported South Brighton I 've also supported Belle 's criteria and when we work around to those next areas that obvious supporting those as well but we have we do not have a finite amount of money and when you see you know sorry boat ramps being built and all this type of thing you know we 've really got to get our heads around in 2017 because we are up against financial restraints as well so I won 't be supporting this so before I come back to David Oh Jimmy this away we complicate completely in support I 'm not supported this one because I heard that the data first one is though we need to separate the short term and the long term no you will recognize we mitigate a fraud in the immediately fried in the response that 's shorter because also maybe the option when the stop or region recommendation this based on what I regarding to the long term one have retained top at least section is part of attention of the banker she 'll be under the one for a moment we have not yet you know K the further investigation this manage second ones of all the parties we always mention especially with dealing with the some other issue we always mention as a councillor shoot citywide rather in charge before the in favor in your local area sexual so prioritize and tackle food and waste important if we go to an amendment if additional 1.2 or 104 million dollars but whether is high low priority then I call with the the particular service that the the the the turn particular she mentioned a moment this is necessary all this is the nice hey we need to identify this reader criteria so I 'm not a supporter member but I go with the staff accommodation Andrew I 'm just briefly and and this is a difficult one to weigh up both sides of the the arguments and it 's around priorities and it 's around effects and of course the effects of flooding aren 't exactly the same by numbers but I also think it 's it 's important to measure things by effect there could be a small number of properties affected but they could be affected badly in an event which caused flooding of those areas I think there are some good reasons for supporting what really is a compromise solution I can see that the community board and the the local councillors have certainly moved some distance from the original positions that were taken and I think that 's something that should be acknowledged I also pick on the comments that have been made by colleagues around an acknowledgement within the community board representing that part of the city of the the natural hazards that that inherently affect that Ward and a greater understanding of that and obviously the need for more work around it I would also remind councillors that there have been other occasions when we have funded land drainage works that haven 't necessarily been of the highest priority in the land drainage recovery plan I can recall might have been a couple of annual plans ago might have been 2015 long-term here in tears because often when it rained the Machuca drain overflowed and we funded that work and we 've now got a community in heathco so in the heat Cavelli who are a whole lot more confidence about what happens when it rains and there were at that time so there and I 'm not necessarily saying that we should take that as a precedence but there have been examples in the past where we have funded work where the effects on individual homeowners individual residents have been significant even though there may not have been large numbers of those resident so I 'm going to be supporting this today at least because I think it 's great that we 've come to a solution which is a compromise from what appeared to be some reasonably hardline positions that had been taken in the past yeah I just want to say a couple of words about why I seconded the resolution before David closes off the debate and and that is because and in fact it 's a many respects that similar to what Andrew just just said and in terms of the challenges that we need to confront in this environment it 's not just about flood risk it 's about coastal erosion as well and and once you get into those areas it 's there are a huge number of issues what this does is that it gives a temporary measure of support around the residential component which enables people to know that they 've got some this a relative protection for a period of time before we get into those really hard issues we know that the way that it was dealt with and the district plan review was unhelpful to creating a trusting environment for us to have some challenging conversations about the nature of their environment and going into the future I think everyone agrees that the eastery side is way more challenging in terms of that future than the coastal side which happens to be in a Beach which provides a degree of comfort that isn 't experienced on the other side so you know there 's a lot of work to be done but there 's a lot of goodwill around the shift even today gives me great hope for the next step which is going to be the hardest step of all which is working through all of these issues but the beauty of the environment that we are now is that we have time and we didn 't have time when we were in the you know the pressure cooker environment of a district plan review which was just too rushed so David if you 'd like to close off the debate thank you for the various comments around the room today and and I do thank you for your acceptance that yes the the community board or myself and my colleagues have moved to a degree on the proposal let the community board put up in the first place I would like to just emphasize I think that not only are we dealing with sort of flooding risk and a bit of erosion there but we 'll also have to appreciate that the dynamics of the South Brighton south shore area itself and that if you go right to the end of the South Shore spurt in fact that are considering an option one is an area that not only is subject to potential flooding but it 's been exacerbated by the fact that this area in the earthquake sent over a metre in places so there is a there was a latent issue for flooding in in the area north and south of British Street and I go back to my earlier comments we are doing regeneration planning addressing earthquake effects in the South New Brighton area and I can 't emphasize any greater to any greater extent how distressing it is to some people in that community that that process is taking quite some time so I 'm very keen to see that lifted to a place where that process can advance towards ministerial approval but before us today we have split the history coastline and we are asking that consideration be given to allowing the staff to continue the bonding and I would emphasize this bunting that 's not stop banks as Sierra seemed to get a little bit twisted up on earlier there is a stop bank coming in a short piece of stop bank are continuing the bonding from that but a short stop bank back through to the Beatty Street here where it will offer a level of protection not only for the residents and see field prison but the primary school boundary comes very close to the history and they they are at risk as well it 's no surprise for some people that post earthquake that particular school have life jackets for every every kid in the school as part of their emergency response so I 'm very very keen to see option one and two supported here today option one obviously does allow a level of protection for that particular part of the history coastline we are housing is quite close to the to the history and the schools very close to the history and so that to me is a bit of a no-brainer giving those people that added security and I 'm also very happy to support part two where we can look at their middle section and evaluate options evaluate our position if we need to go to long-term funding options well so be it but at engage with the interest groups around the history and consider the recommendations that the tonkin and Taylor revised coastal hazards assessment report brings forward so Thank You vet and I would urge counselors that they support this amendment okay thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye Hey okay well okay would sit sorry I had a helpful comment earlier on that got me to fix that so but it was resolutions three so look why don 't you just delete fall together we don 't need it I mean the staff have been asked to engage and they 're going to report back to us that why don 't we just request that staff engaged with

central New Brighton school has reopened as a community hub for New Brighton the official opening took place on Saturday 23rd of September and follows many weeks of working bees and community effort

can imagine that a lot of work goes behind the scenes in management short term options report at its meeting on the 4th of September the coastal bird community board provided the firing feedback on the staff report to the council entitled South Shore floodplain management short term options we have split the history coastline into three district areas Bridge Street to the jetty jetty to the

like to have an official opening once all these projects are finished and we 're quite looking forward to them well personal point of ice theatres are an experiment that I that we hope it works which worries me cos I 've seen those experiments backfire before I had three meetings with Christy Christina Hill when she was here in Christchurch or burn on site and I feel like I love her ideas but she said we need the 16 metres to do plantings but that 's just my personal point of view going onto that down into the issue if she Kim described this is a plague of biblical proportions actually I think she can to stated us and I 've seen the effects of it and it 's actually it 's a nightmare for the residents they basically virtually trapped inside their houses in the summer months and of course to have a bird problem so we are working together on that one the boards are great and had meetings with a council staff and they 're trying to come up with a solution but it really is a help trip for the camp for the for the residents and she we have from the fairway reserve basketball court noise issues and lives adjacent to the fairway reserve the board has requested that a noise assessment is conducted and following this that a workshop is arranged with the staff and the resident to discuss the results and options going forward we 've had quite a few of these things coming up to us you know Booker Park etc seems to be very contentious area we have packs and wizards close by we have some big problems the monkey hazard seminar a presentation of the Modi has its report was held in the

    "text": "we very much thanks Ellie true to her word right the automating the annual reports we what 's the sequence for this one sorry is it Andy you come from the table as well very good organization all right far away so I 'd just like to make some opening comments on the annual report that you have a father who has been reviewed by the audit and Risk Committee in detail in the finance and performance committee have had a bit of an overview of it and it 's a really pleasing outcome to be able to say that the 2017 financials have been given a clean opinion by audit New Zealand and while we still have a qualified modified opinion that 's just for the prior year comparatives so I 'd like to acknowledge a huge amount of work that Joanne brandish has lead on behalf of the council and working through the ESIC valuations and those other issues supported and able by others within our team and also a strong advice from audit New Zealand and others but Joanne has really led that work on our behalf resolved I 'm just unsure as to whether I should and by thank you welcome and I can 't remember what the processes and the public session you 've been very helpful to us obviously in the audit and risk and finance and pertains but conscious office obviously you 've got pressure on your agenda today so I don 't intend to rub it on at all in fact I didn 't intend to say much more than Carol just said I 'm done the burners were introduced myself I 'm the audit director for modern New Zealand who 's signing the crotchet city council 's opinion so just to reaffirm what Carol said we are right now ready to issue of an orbit opinion the recent modification nobody just relates to some prior information so that 's really around the previous assets that were subject of a qualification last year so that 's going to be stormwater and eroding valuations and also some work-in-progress matters that simply will never go into go away if you like in terms of prior comparative but in terms of you 2017 information that terms of the audit opinion and that 's actually a good foundation for going into an LTP process as well because we 're saying meet your starting point in terms of e 2017 data is he 's all on modifying yes that 's probably all I wanted to say very good anyone got any questions Glen and then Yanni thank you and thank you for this just one out of curiosity really it relates to page 187 and it 's about other affordable housing services with a an initiative that we 're undertaking with the crown and my question is more high-level so from your perspective whether we 're dealing say that we are kind of the fund holder for monies from the crown along with our own money would it be your view that in all that we do you know obviously we have to keep it absolutely clean and apply a procurement process and any element of that undertaking it would be you know with it 's our money taxpayer money it 's probably not a question it 's coming from I was just looking for a high-level yeah yeah and um this isn 't me pressed for time at all yeah next item is agenda that we see that we would deal with between 00 and 00 so but just please stick to the questions that relate annual report Yanni thank you I was just interested and 5.2 point out on page 132 we talked about the operating expenditure and you talked about the crossing car park being expensed as a grant rather than a capital cost does it change the crop that the rights impact of that and if so by how much they didn 't change the rights impact because we had planned it to be as the capital item the fact that we had to for accounting purposes treated as expense doesn 't impact how we funded it it was a technical accounting reason which meant that we had to put it into that as it treated as a ground not how we funded it so have we gone back and change the different accounting treatments of that from the previous budgets because we 'll always think told that capex was obviously cheaper in plan and so the information we had at the performance as part of affluence report around the additional cost I think was about 600,000 is that related to that nine yeah right so what 's why is that not related to the additional when the performance report was interesting it was payable under the contract from us right and I guess the question of the auditors have you looked at that transaction and made sure that now everything 's we 've had conversations around the problems the accounting treatment and yes in Natha to that level with look to that transaction Roberts Lee with mindful of materiality when we do the author of the account but there are certainly no issues from our perspective in terms of the way that 's accountable okay any other questions perhaps would someone like to move the recommendations rest Manji second to the co2 person I 'll put this all those in favor say aye aye there 's a person who night it 's carried thank you very much _"

leadership take optional or commit a community service awards and and some of those communities you 've all got all of them some some of them all of them community service awards are really really exciting things and something that we 're very very pleased to to be able to offer that those thank yous to the volunteers and their community that helped make our community such a great place and also along with the community pride garden awards as well so Anzac days of course neighborhood week and youth development funding we get a lot of you 'll see as the progress as we progress through our report and just flip to the next one if you like please martyr sport the youth development function we had a lovely youth development function and that 's where the young people come and give us feedback on what they 've achieved with the funding that they 've got from our community board towards their um their goals and their development and life and that 's really really really really good when we look at the range of things that these young people have been involved and some absolutely wonderful things that we top of the world air is problem solving and they 're young people the way winning international awards for problem solving and their rowing and sports people it 's just law looting you know stuff that we haven 't heard of before but just absolutely wonderful to to actually be able to support these young people and in the early stages of their journey through life and when we look around as long as I have and see how those some people have actually gone on to to not only be really really good at what they do but put a lot of those skills and that that they 've gained back into the community and some of these young people now are coaching young people as well so that 's that 's really really good and the pride in their faces was just wonderful this is the old horse will library which is still be no final decision made on it but it 's um it 's being used is the whole part of the Hallsville community project as a youth teen hangout and in amongst other things as well but that is one of the one of the uses that that buildings being put to now and it 's just really really ideal venue for these sort of activities because the tea how poor seniors very very well utilized thank you to the Christchurch City Council and a new library service senior at Teja power but this the old library has certainly been adopted by the community and and there we really need to see as many new things for young people in that area because we 've got skateboard skateboard park via tuna and horse without any problem at all maybe there was a little bit of a problem that wasn 't it but it was nothing unsurmountable so things are really happening there and we go down here thanks for the introduction Carol I know she 's gone now but thanks for stealing my thunder the type that says they sorry you 've got access we have indeed we have indeed and thanks to two and filth and other councils that within yani I would a lot of really liked to seen you there but anyway you were there in spirit buddy you 're there in spirit and was really really good to see the the past Christchurch City Council and their own past deputy mayor and and his family norm with as an IRA in the same class at school together by the way so we go back a long way but to think that his family the withers family with eleven children living in that only for the withers family and for the end for the other people quarry workers that done that operated in there it 's got the most amazing baths you 've ever seen I don 't know how that Devon you would ever get it hot but it 's a solid concrete bar and the sides of the door about and yeah over foot foot so once you got that hot it would stay hot for a long time but actually trying to put hot water into a solid concrete bath and expect yet all this is lovely but as soon as you sit down you go room like but anyway and it 's just really really interesting to to take yourself back in time to what it was like in those days so we really really appreciated the heritage team and everybody that was involved in that process and it 's such a lovely feeling the ranges and everybody that work around that place including the pit rabbit that lives up in the in the crusher plant that 's being adopted it 's got its own little kennel and it runs free but it 's been adopted by the Rangers it 's wonderful place to be so and we 're very very proud of that and we 'll be the community collaboration so that 's that 's something that 's going to be happening it 's it 's in the planning process now so we 're going to bring a lot more of the Hornby community together in an event and in March 2018 so that 's something that we 're working on Heritage Week events of course we 've got to Rickett and house and bush to us and we 've also got the cemetery to us and halls well and in church corner and we 've also got the the Air Force you know from the plains to the Prudential and port hills there 's a lot of heritage a lot of heritage in their halls will Hornby from a record and community board area and it 's something that we 're really really pleased to be involved and and not only in our wood but right across the city I think heritage is something it doesn 't of the historic buildings belong day belonged to families etc but heritage is something that belongs to everybody in the country everybody in the country and I think we should get more central government funding actually towards the restoration and the upkeep and maintenance of heritage roads and relying on local authorities so that 's my little bug walking festivals I just got an email this morning to say that unfortunately the potato stomp has been cancelled or postponed due to inclement weather but so the stop won 't be happening in halls will at this point in time but it will be still lovely to walk around the the other walking events in the city over there over the next week or two or three and the upcoming community events we 've got the the Southwest light party we 've got the Templeton Community Day that 's an awesome day for anybody that want to go out to commit out to Templeton and see that this this is something that the community certainly took on board and and it 's grown from year to year to year and it a sock burnin community a day in sock burn Park this is this is a second second year so that 's coming up quite a lot of these events are actually quite close together timewise with the record and street party that 's that 's a great one two and an Elizabeth Street and we 've just got them in community fun days and Harrington Park so it 's just and that 's happening all over the city so we 're just really really proud to to be able to support those those events and actually go to them and have a bit of fun yourselves and then keep the community rific neighbourhood policing team that i was just so pleased and proud to get the news that that our team Steve Jones and and his team of very very fine officers along with the community of helps the community have helped this policing team goodness this national recognition and it 's just so pleased it was a it was a trial and horn and and record and it was the first cab off the rank and it really really got so much strength and pride and and it 's just turned that whole community around and the same thing of course is happening now in the Aranui Richmond area saying that it was really really good to see that they go to a you and a national recognition from there from the new zealand police hyper helpful random facts well speak for themselves it 's just a just a wide-ranging and this is something that I think all woods would be really really good to see what they 've dragged out some of your um for helpful helpful hyper helpful random facts browsers because we 're the halls will home be record and board but you know that 's it 's quite good to get some of those faxes so we know what their communities like yep okay and I don 't think there 's anything else that in my notes here that no I think we 've covered all that you might have self look into the next item as well we do need to reflect into your less there 's any questions about but will come well because there 's a natural flow yep so do you want to go now to the Rickett and Division Street working party really need to just speak to that briefly as well and then we 'll do both deal with the whole lot together okay yeah so we have from wherever had some some it hadn 't been a lot of fun actually but it 's been serious stuff and I think the the working party worked really really well under the guidance of the leadership of Ginny Huey who keeps everybody on their toes okay but anyway we worked through a range of options and things and recommendations and and that 's the working parties recommendations the working parties recommendations and as you 'll see and at the end of that when we get to that matter and there 's some other recommendations in Part A that we 'll discuss later but it is Sun I 've been there and seen what 's been happening of talk to the security guards of talk to you know people in the area shopkeepers in the owner all that sort of stuff I think it 's been a um it had to happen and I think the outcome or outcomes will will certainly help this situation around the area of record em and might be a model for and any other parts of the city where these sort of gatherings and anti-social behavior start happening very good alright so um any questions at longevity yes please the on page 56a point of what the Pompey community event you accepted the community not getting war for this kind of life plan for the Lexia imagine 2080 when I have any local coming aboard given what he 's won over will be absolutely it 's just a work in progress to say that this is where we were intending to go Jimmy pre-earthquake we used to have the Westside party in the partying and which used to come along it it just before Christmas time and I used to get the sing Christmas carols but anyway that was that was a while ago but that was something that was really really great event and well supported or the people in Hornby but then and but then you know things happened times have changed so we just want to get back to a Hornby event as well Jimmy because we do have events and record and as you know halls well but we really need to get back to to Hornby and start planning for significant events in there won 't be would as well okay thank you the a pointer for pulley for the one I would like to the comment because I attended Lisa the work in the festival this way we reveal a success because we have a kind of a working solar from the Upper East and library and around the lost rigs and the high school they have a more than 200 people Tina for the multicultural group that 's a very very successful in the solar I would like to encourage all our effect member kandt killing for all candor of the work in the festival especially in the city why I was taught and helped me around a 30 different one he is a surrounded if she comes ahead 51 yes ok sorry Kerry fella back to comment briquette and bass exchange and we 're gonna be talking later it 's just on on the bass exchange are you wanting it what I get now no no I I 'm just because you 've moved it the the report be received on okay and I presume annual second that so is there any more discussion on the report I would like to just mention in terms of the recommendations and I guess we will talk about this later a couple of things for I noticed that there 's no recommendation around preps investigating a youth space and I 'm sorry where you know we move move they 're stealing we the report okay right so right I mean I did want Mike to speak first and cover everything off but that 's not applying to the DOE we 're still in the area will say I 'm just gonna put the report so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we 'll move to the bullhorn be Brooklyn community forward Division Street Brooklyn working a recommendation it 's a number of us have kind of read revisited the waiting at this but they 've been put on the opposite order so but but that 's neither here nor there that they cover the two issues so instead of talking about lobbying central government and having the mere meet with the New Zealand Police District Commander what with an outcome in mind I tuned it rounded the other way so request that the mere meet with the New Zealand Police Commander regional just right yeah to discuss policing presence and the vicinity of recommend bus lounge during peak time so that 's one issue the second is request staff to work with central government to seek a review other provisions of the Local Government Act relating to the consequences of breaching of local bylaws which picks up the the generic issue without again big specific around arrest and instant fines I did have that run past me yung lean prior to to the meeting and from by mr. wall freeze and I was very comfortable with it right oh that 's good okay so so 's not probably a question you don 't on this sorry oh yeah yeah okay he 's look I just I mean this is just around the corner from me so it 's an area I don 't know really well since the bus exchange came in there 's always been problems here and and people have gone down in the first two years they they 've gone down the path of Social Work end engagement with youth now it hasn 't sort of the problem I don 't think it it was ever going to sort it so the working party was formed and just the police are are really concerned that there 's a hardened group of young youth Nia and might and the concern that I have to that school students are sort of talking with them as they go through the bus exchange so it 's important we take some of these these measures in terms of the Social Work component that can still still continue youth workers you returned all youth more social work desh desh usually but it has attracted an extremely hardcore youth going on there so it 's I was putting out average young person at risk I 'm actually quite supportive of what 's there and I do want to say that I 've run to the police were beside themselves at one point in the cold it has gone away so the cold weather has has mitigated the problem so I 'm comfortable of those two resolutions you might want to put on if required the mere meets with I think that 's coming it 's coming because if it continues as it is we haven 't got the problem we had five months ago no I don 't want to wish a cold weather on the city so increase that the mayor meet with the New Zealand place just a commander to discuss policing presence in the vicinity of Brixton bus stands during peak times so I want to discuss the policing presence I don 't want to go and ask for additional police presence when I haven 't had the conversation okay you see what I mean it 's not going to the answer it 's going to a problem-solving approach and it 's a joint approach it 's not it 's not just yeah yes if it was why and and particularly when it 's me that 's being asked to do something out I was trying to influence how they does Farzin your head off for Darwinian the the second sorry I thought your head off a day to the Working Party that you would do that I meet with the working parent when did I make the team I don 't I can recall you saying that you would be prepared to meet with them the district command yes I said that before this meeting you today no no no historically but anyway yep that 's for anyway so requesting staff to work with central government to seek a review of the provisions of the Local Government Act relating to the consequences of breaching of local bylaws but I kind of had a better understanding of what what approaches we 've adopted in the past around us because the original resolution talks about arrests and I know that the cost of their and the benefit does not stack up it doesn 't stick up for drunkenness and it doesn 't stick up for this getting kids onto the pathway of arrest his all sorts of other life consequences that I think we have to try and avoid instant fines can be effective but not if you 've got no money so and a lot of these kids don 't have resources and they don 't have parents with deep pockets either so you know there are a number of issues that need to be resolved there I don 't pretend for a minute that I know what the answers are but I 'm really happy to work alongside you know that we can group and in the police to try and find solutions but I think an header issue which is around could we be thinking about more youth spaces that weren 't you know to encourage young people that are causing problems here together elsewhere transferring the problem wouldn 't be a good outcome but providing people with and useful and interesting to do might be but this may be a hard and group served in that way as well so I 'm really happy that that the local council has come to the meeting as well with the police and might you might like to come as well as the chair of the board yeah I mean just another concern that I hear as the recommendation for the about Wi-Fi if we consider the youth action strategy plan that the the Youth Council came up with they 're actually requesting more Wi-Fi and last shelters and places like that so I feel a little bit uncomfortable with the punitive kind of feeling in this report so I would like it to you know for that to be considered that I don 't know if we should punish those kids in those young people who are actually they 're doing the right thing I think we should perhaps look a bit more creatively and I would suggest that you actually encourage the youth counselor come and into these discussions and you know sort of bring their perspective as well well unfortunately I 'm just presenting this to the camp arts it 's not this in there fast for information in there so that it went it 's not a referrin to us today but look I think having that initial meeting what the police will help steer us in the right direction clean and in Aaron yeah thank you I 'm going to ask you a question I do support a developmental approach they might anyway just with as far as exploring bylaw options did the Working Party look into the the public places bylaw options so we look at that with some issues we had in Lynnwood and the police thought to be you know further empowered through that so that you look at that and see what we did indeed and and the first in the early stages of the Working Party that was something that was you know at all that the police had came to us and said this would be what this tool in their toolbox but when they went into the into the nitty-gritty of it they decided the police actually backed off a little bit and thought well you know there may be a better way there weren 't pushing so much for an anti loitering by law but some other tools and I think if we go by the recommendation that we 've got up there now of the amended recommend that 's just been put up today that the staff work with central government to seek review of the provisions of the life Government Act relating to that and breaching local bylaws I think that will be a help I really do so and there has been a switching community O 'Day in his journey he know and she would be in a better position as the chair of that to actually explain the process but that was certainly the case of calendars on that working party as well and they certainly wanted that engineering boil off but then when we in a bit colder on you know count on staff I 'm really worried that we 're going well over time I don 't know presentation we 've got the auditor-general waiting and well the office of the order waiting because I 'm and and and we 've got lots of people now who next right so the next one thing I mean if we 're going to continue down this track we are not going we are only dealing with a request that I meet with the police and that we Lobby sent well work with central government around the provisions of the Local Government Act relating to the consequence of breaching local bylaws that 's all we 're discussing today the rest of the working group is progressing and they will come back to us so Aaron you know Phil and then Jimmy and then Jamie I mean this is you know well done good this um does feel a little back to front and we were pre warned that this would happen I believe was the Youth Council that had completely different designs and options for how these and other bus stations should be done and they 're not even in the working party less in fact I don 't even know if you know and there even catches a bus and so I 'm just wondering are we going about this the right way because it feels really back to solving a problem but and and they presented to the community board I used to be on it Shirley pop annoy around their ideas for designs and and things like that so that raise then when this was first going through that they knew they would be trouble because we just would got the wrong people designing stuff and in as far as a youth space goes the most popular do space and cities next door the more risk filled lawless the most popular youth space in the city and it 's so we think we 've got this wrong and so that 's my question that I don 't even think we should go now is whether to cost us a fortune we should go back to the drawing board and talk to the actual users and the Youth Council and say is this way we should go and start there as I say we 're only dealing with this request around consequences of Bryer laws and me meeting with the local police so that 's all we 're discussing today so in terms of that wider issue I crime prevention through Environmental Design you 've got to engage the users right at the start but what we 're hearing from the community board is that there is a small group of people that are disruptive and that they are influencing others who are quite legitimately using the bus ouch so it 's not a major interchange it is a bus lounge and it has a it has got issues that we need to resolve so I 'd like to meet with the police and I 'll certainly undertake to do that in a relatively short space of time hopefully better and do their area know below okay would you consider meaning of the building runs as well yep look it 's not for me to meet with them yet you know it 's it 's really further I mean somebody else has said that the Youth Council should be involved I agree with it but you know that 's not what 's in front of us today Phil and then Jimmy and then Jamie and then Yanni okay known as a wider question it can wait okay my fine to Jamie I guess my question is what local bylaws are being breached there 's no we would know I don 't agree would go with the bylaw that 's just a possibility but the police will will will do something if they offend and a criminal may rephrase it with respect to you on recommendation one relating to the consequences of breaching local bylaws what local Bible was are being breached I 'm talking about two done in fact when that rewording came up I 'm I was really pleased about it because there 's a lot of other boy laws around that we need to have that course of action but it specifically because we haven 't got an anti loitering by or if there wasn 't any mileage ring boy someone heaven sorry because it 's not got consequences with it Jamie so this is about focusing on what are the consequences of breaching a bylaw we 're not going to create a bylaw that has no consequences so if we 're looking at the consequences of a bylaw breach I 'd like to move so that we did that specifically for the car washing for the window washing problem that we had on Linwood even the problem just here it 's just feels all around them all back to fries that 's fine thank you for tearing and running Jimmy and then visit Yanni is that he the last one name okay mayor I would like to follow the in the equation for this a part of C regarding Wi-Fi may I or just focus on the burning focus on the things that the first reason why I asked you know community for because if you back to the page on 59 by actually coming for meeting in September we have minor the amendment of the voted it 's not the exact same value a two pointer to pointer P and this paragraph reviewing the free Wi-Fi rather than merely Jimmy we 're not talking about the Wi-Fi what we 're talking about is the is the report of the of the Working Party and the recommendation from the part I which are those those yeah yeah I understand by your what you need to our recommendation a safety we saw the change he ate your company report has been changed this might yeah yeah yes C 's reviewing so Yanni so I was just try to understand in terms of the police there 's a community council I understand in Nelson Street is that is there a community place based on record on and there 's no right so is that being removed that 's that 's been gone for quite some time okay and the police say that the local police say they do not have enough resources they think if we had further resource and it would fix the problem but they haven 't got any power two perspectives Abruzzi commander I think both the political parties have said they 're gonna increase the number of place so I just wonder whether we should write a letter to central government or to the ministers meeting given s different than a vocational reason can i meet with them and report back to you know i think i 'd be really good and just the second question I had is and I 'll probably went through the phone if it is well well I just want to make sure there 's a price because we 're being asked about recommendations but what I can 't see from the poor is anyone talking to the people that are causing the problem so has anyone talked to the people that are causing the problem to understand what 's behind the behavior it would only be the police yes enemies workers and the youth with the youth workers have been dealing with these young people on a one-to-one basis for a quite a long time but they 've continued to actually conduct your activity and even even with police presence around it does distract from it but when the police presence goes away and the activity starts again I 've been down there witnessed and I 've talked to the security guards and others in the area that are talented so just look seriously we are well over time I 'm going to have to mean we 're going to have to go straight to the annual report now and it 's not fair on other community I was going to bring company owners to the table so that they could come and go but you know I 'm I 'm finding it very difficult when we 're having you know here using the council 's time to deal with the matter that 's not in front of us at the moment then I 'd really like to get a briefing from council staff over the whole bus interchange strategy and just I mean there 's a number of issues related to this one in particular it would be really good to actually have a chance to hear from staff who involved for the operation of it because there 's a number of questions that I have but you 're obviously appreciate we 're limited for time yeah and and no because there is not an order in terms of this resolution today I 've said that this resolution if it carries I will meet with the New Zealand Police District Commander I 'll discuss the policing issues that are involved in this area and I will report back to Council before we take this any further see juries happy we 're all happy I think makes lot of seeds I don 't want to vote the whole thing like I said it just feels really undercooked to me makes perfect sense but one is trying to solve it have asked for further information if you read the report it 's either never ask for lots of other information they will have dead information before they come up with really I 'm happy for you to speak with police that makes sense but there is just yeah it 's just all it 's moved by Jimmy Chin 's sickened to by injury I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye Oh as opposed they know okay so and a you against all of it yeah so Aaron and Dion against the lot and Jamie Gough against one right thank you _"

Paul did learn was there in his bow tie and jacket not boots and studies and one of his staff who opened spoken Maori for a good six seven minutes one of the park rangers Robbie and we had a cake afterwards in the coffee from the coffee cart wonderful it 's so great oh and a lot pinching I know I 'm not pitching that I know what 's his name where this whole family was invited there just as they should have been but heaven speak Norway it was a great great great day okay this wasn 't so great this is about the get gear get go give I 've spoken about before and I 'm talking to the poor unfortunate pupils of West Braden 's school because we 've installed a container waste thing that but now both beautiful colors and everything on it for sports equipment too big to be donated to our program in our ward keep going and then safety improvements on the pedestrian cycle wave fences daya 's Pass Road route the staff did a great presentation and excellent work on this project counterintuitive ly people don 't get hurt and don 't die on bikes on days pass roaming touch wood and but that 's so counterintuitive that people want the best best safety that they can get the best best safety was not recommended by staff because it probably isn 't the best best safety and it was very expensive and they have suggested a series of fences and guardrails that will protect cyclists on what looks to be a dangerous route but turns out not to be because the perception is that it 's so dangerous people actually do quite well in getting up that road yeah exactly it 's people applying for grants youth development and achievement grants and under the youth development and achievement schemes and the numbers have increased and we think it 's because we are in two-thirds of the way through visiting all the schools in our ward in our wards to talk to them about the issues that we have in common and that has resulted we think and a couple of improvements on in the numbers that are coming forward to for gap brands to put you on national radio doesn 't mean to say your posh alcohol licensing we we had an application from B base for a 365 24 hour restriction on alcohol sales in a very wide area around Hong Castle arena our board after reading the submissions one of which was not in phase we don 't think vbase had noticed that it wasn 't in favor of the ban and looking at the legislation 147 a local government tech 2002 which puts a very high bar on restricting freedom of our citizens and means that you have to have excellent reasons we believe that the reasons hadn 't of the issues that were raised including perhaps temporary bans for 24 hours when there is a an occasion that we base that they think might justify it and can be and they can give the evidence to support that we did not approve the 365 days 24 hours a day been on alcohol in the area of Eddington and so questions or comments Andrew and then aim thank you item 3.1 in your report what 's the off the ground fund and what does he support what yes bill and Jeanne Huey who was our advisor and it 's not not long after the earthquake thought that we could have a very small grant 250 dollars that would take very little to get paragraph to fill in the paragraph and give it to staff for something small that would be cheerful and engaging in the first one and we and we called it off the ground firm which I think was Ginny 's idea as well and the first one was the erection of a dragon in a kindergarten the building of a dragon and the kindergarten and since who have had an idea that just needs a little bit of cash and that would be cheerful and engaging especially for children in our community see and it has been one of the nicest things that we do sometimes 250 dollars means a heck of a lot more than 20,000 it just means something over and above special tiny little you know and so we 've been it 's one of the things that 's given us great joy over the years and and we don 't even approve the grants really the staff approved the grant back send it round to us and if we objected I expect they 'd say no but we we have the opportunity to say no and we seldom do it 's been terrific all sorts of little things yeah and and then clean thank you we report you 'll be pleased to know that the guiltier give great skiing that 's being adopted by our would as well because they 're so cold it 's a great model and I 'm just trying to think of the people here that might have that never mind let 's put in those thank you for this it 's great to scheme yeah I am interested in your decision not to recommend to alcohol being yeah and I 'm the reason interested in it in your decision is because it is working in other places and cry situation successfully and given concern about the harm that alcohol is causing I would have thought that this would have been an opportunity for us as a community to signal it that we are making a stand against it because it 's actually one of the few things we we can do it 's a yeah it 's the Local Government Act says that to restrict people 's freedom means that you have to have really good reasons then you have to have really good reasons and we did not have from memory there were three small notes from local residents I lived in the area and there just was not the problem we 've never had complaints we have no complaints from broken bottles or crowd control or anything from anyone in that area there 's a home castlereagh arena no complaints the level of bro I 've never seen outside of my house which was a hundred to three hundred meters perhaps as the crow flies from one castle arena I had the police breath testing people outside my house periodically to test people coming away from Hong Castle arena or the rugby which is adjacent and I 've never I 've never had a problem and the people parking outside my house have never been in any trouble at all the one submitter that Hong Castle arena had not realized rebates had not realised was against the proposal was talking about how behavior had improved in the last few years which I believe it has if you looked online there were several people who said this is about the cost of alcohol supplied by Hong Castle Arena I don 't know if that 's true or not but certainly they are an alcohol supplier themselves and there was no evidence that in the one or two people who may have caused problems there was one apparently a Bruce Springsteen 's concert one there one or no it was no evidence to suggest it was about people drinking in cars they could have come from arrington licensed premises of which there are several so there was just they just the evidence just was not there and if you look at the stats young people are drinking less these days certainly than my generation did but that wouldn 't be hard but I think there has been an improvement towards alcohol in terms of drink driving and general behavior I think there has been an improvement that would be my view but if there had been the evidence we would have approved it at Glendon Davis well thank you that was my question Carolyn how many assaults I think they quoted there might have been a couple or one to two I 'm only remembering can you say in normal washing times been five years or something they mentioned one or two concepts like there was one concert where they caught a man taking alcohol from side alcohol not pre alcohol side alcohol I 'd never heard of marginalizing someone the side loading someone outside the arena picture of a couple of pictures of broken bottle there was there was a free car apparently at the Bruce Springsteen concert one person David I just wanted to just clarify one point that was made and raised a moment ago about alcohol bans actually working around the city yes they do but most of them linked to events like there is an alcohol ban currently in place for Sumner New Year 's Eve there 's one for the right regular race course for race day there 's another 4 cup day they yes they will be well but in terms of permanent bands around the city I think that is the only one that maybe in places around the university which I think we all would agree is probably quite appropriate and and does work well but that 's the only one in the city the rest of them are all temporary bans for around an event our board approved the cup day one and the evidence was there it was substantial the evidence around this was known Hardeen is there anyone else okay so I would suspect that the report I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye all those

    "text": "and right thanks Peninsula Community Board force good morning Lee good morning everyone we 're here for things that would like to highlight for me a report today in the first one as the government space g2 project so here 's a photo of what it looked like and what it could look like again so in September 2016 the council sold the GT to the governor 's bay GT restoration trust for a dollar and once the work is completed you know we sold that to Council for a dollar let 's go four people are so skilled and enthusiastic and watch you know here we had meet you chose day for as long as I 've known to eat this project underway it 's been through public consultation in summary and the GT as a much loved icon that people want to walk along jump off submarine boat to in admire the view from most people want the tt-talk virtually the same but support features that have low visual and Pete once again this is just another example of community lead projects and we 're particularly thrilled to into it so is about traveler 2017 the GTE has no chance that the design stage so we 're excited to watch this project continue a next item is increasing pair resilience in little cherry and July 2017 Arroyo and briefed the board about what they would be doing and this is putting the cable through the tunnel to stabilize the pier supply too little turn out to kiss Bay so that meant that they would be out as a pair of outage which meant that would have feet thousands of homes not to five hundred businesses so a community board a package with what I Ryan obviously to say if we could try and keep some of us there power supply going throughout the day so what they came back with was two large generators that were container sized and they were able to provide power to all of the community for the period of time the community did the part by using as little pair as possible and the whole day went smoothly you wouldn 't have even known that there had been a change so that was to happen next one is their environment or shows once again to ID sigh at flooding and that seems to be a continuing continuing fame we 've had quite major slips on some of the roads on the peninsula we 've just been advised that we have new project manager who will come and update the board at a a 30th of October meeting and once again this causes the risk of isolation to some communities there 's quite a major slip on the road to Diamond Harbor and so what the concerns about the theory that made the community very anxious about didn 't turn from those areas we were told yesterday that these was a bit tweet 1200 and slips through the peninsula and you know who congratulate staff because I doing their best to try and get these sorted as soon as you know you know they 're keen so we 're just watching knowledge the weight that 's going on the board has asked for drainage improvements to be considered in the long term plane to try and help or suddenly we in our final item some of the bays that there 's quite a bit of coastal erosion hit me need an addition so and the ball will raise us when providing input into the little he 's explaining in the long term plane and we 've also our staff to investigate whether any of these issues can be mitigated by maintenance you know with coal works and clearing etc our sorry this indeed was another one I 'm sorry most importantly this is another example of lots of rain and that we 've had recently so this trachea is Rihanna Governors Bay and the wall besides the trach as something that the community consider V idea and it was built by the prisoners from Parihaka who were imprisoned in Littleton something that lobster and community commemorate yearly and the parihaka in the whole and preservation what happened here so we have asked sorry I 've just lost my page here oh sorry okay we 've asked our staff advice on the cost of conducting a heritage assessment or preparing a conservation plan for this area and obviously there 's a lot of work and this one here particular because that 's a trust and we 'd like to say something down there I think you excite me questions deal as soon as it was by significant to me obviously are we able to get some sort of report back on that one on those issues especially that one some note to sort of figure out how to get the community boards ask for stuff advice on there she 's all right I suspect that we could get would that 'll be covered often in the next report yeah oh I didn 't realize that that was actually built by the pony yeah that 's a whole history around there here 's some don 't realize but it didn 't make sure realized specifically that was there because it was something like their baser oh yeah inside the president some sales obviously keep done the president was really as Rose Garden yeah yeah yep Aaron just only kid to heave walkway and I clicked on the link and it 's the same word just what 's on here but the that 's it 's an the levee that 's on the active transport levee that 's an on their rating bill so I was just wondering if we can get an actual update at some point with the bits that have been finished maybe some photos the actual map of where it 's going to go because I don 't think we 've ever seen it either to Eddie but I think default committee would be quite nice to see I think as a project long term once that 's finished that 'll be like it a world-class tourist attraction pretty sensational plan so if we could get that at some point with some pictures maybe the finished bits where it 's going the timeline be good thank you just saying the way that 's been done you may be at next month 's community board would be good before you have it 's just a little special presentation on that would be certainly appreciated by me and most of them pretty sure be interested the name of this chicken device here I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no its carriage thank you girl _"

agenda it seems my time so that 's item 14 so if you 'd like to speak to it [Music] yeah and as you can see we had meetings on 4th and 20th of September and as you can see from our agenda we 've had we 've had a lot of activity in our area one of their significant issues that 's come up before in there and it was it came up also I think way back when I was on council um was that as the odors that come from the and walleston and specifically from the gyrator victory and we 're having to deal with it a lot we 've had one workshop where he can staff and ask them to follow up on several issues to do with this and one of the big problems here seems to be the wording on the resource consent that this company have in things are and how can it be measured and so over here in terms of the council 's involvement that he came and CCC are made their joint party a Joint Working Party to deal with these issues of the costs between um like smell so I would really like to ask that council come back to us in terms of that Joint Working Party as to how far they give me head with us because um this is beyond the cards for a very very long time they got a bit of reprieve after the earthquakes to get their act in to act and the gear in the house an order but it doesn 't seem to be happening because the residents around there are still having a lot of issues with smelt and we believe that we you know residents you have a right to live without smell so we would really appreciate any help we can get from this joint working party to do get on top of this issue remembering that the part of a very both German company this company and they have the resources on we 've allocated funds to 53 community organizations and strengthening community funds and approved 52 neighborhood week applications we 've got to go yeah and you can you can read all about that and we 're having the works will be completed by February 2018 moving on to the and one Motor Group we 've got some amazing groups in our area and they 're willing to do a lot of work and one of these is the Walmart of Commons at Bradley Park and we 're keen to have a lot more staff involvement and trying to get this landscape plan worked out for them I 'm sure if you move which I not notice it sorry I couldn 't tell which park right a vaguely Park all readily paths yeah it 's a very it 's a very long narrow park with nothing much happening enough to end with this group that things are changing here so be really good in the community is really involved mobility sparking spaces the board supports putting sensors on the mobility Park parking spaces and would like one put on some some of the car park is a pilot for days and terms of the coastal pathway we 'd really like this to be included and the major cycle routes like it was originally and we 're very happy that the Woolston community facility is progressing the way and as you look forward to seeing things move further on that and and it 's well on tech now so it 's really good community resilience fund we 've put forward a few applications but we like staff to provide information on this fund so that we can understand it better what exactly are the ones we should be putting forward and things like that Tito anger why Cora and the former learn would lower fields it 's been converted to an urban fastest you 've all heard and this is a really exciting project and probably I won 't be around to see the actual fulfillment of it we know the trees are growing but we enjoyed for generations to come the opening of this is on Monday next Monday the 16th at 30 so I hope you 'll all come greatest walking festival is now taking place and it runs to the 15th of October with over 50 walks in within 14 days so lots of things to do with it dear I think I 've covered most things we do have a big issue with skateboarders making a lot of noise and the newly formed pack known as Street chemical people trying to deal with this and their neighboring motels are complaining so we would really like helpful give me something done about that thank you okay I 'll just comment on the the breeze walking festival and that I had a tower or taro even trail as opening with a meet in the middle celebration so some of us are walking and from the city and some of us some of the others are walking out from New Brighton are you on the New Brighton end I 'm going from there you 're just gonna tune up at the middle no I 'm doing that I 'm doing the central city into the middle it 's on Sunday Sunday yeah yeah I think it starts at about Tina for these six kilometers that I shall be walking say but it should be great fun and sorry I had even looked at the weather forecast yet that 's what I said about french-kissed so yeah meet in the middle yeah I think we 're meeting at 00 today I think I think we 're jus and and it 's in the middle at about 15 yeah they did offer for me to just turn up in the middle but I thought that it wouldn 't be all thin Turkish oh yeah Rick it gets here by 12 9 it says that it 's good I think city side starts at the firefighters reserve or somewhere sorry are there any questions yeah Yanni thank you so late do you want to give an update on the limb of Woolston poll because I thought the ball had asked that they get rice as well in terms of what we know so far that we 've had our last update was a big session on the site selection and and the matrix they designed to show which would be the better site out top four I said the question you 're asking Yanni I mean like you know as much as I do you can do this as much as you were there with so I thought the board was keen to ask Council to to have that information and I was hoping that we 'd be able to present the site selection matrix today as part of this report but obviously that hasn 't had it 's not so out of the report so but if Nick beyond the next one that would be great it would be really good if we if we go counsel that information initial nomination so I think that part a is coming to council requesting that right okay that 's great and just the other thing is um you talked about that the other issues in walleston just in terms of I guess any other comment around the other issues in Bromley and in the air quality I think the board at the last meeting requested an update from staff on what will be happening in terms of the partnership of all the working together the public will be notified so at the moment that 's gone as an action memo to the relevant staff and we 'll be getting a response to you and you sumo something out he came to you yeah so you can I think the issues that boss tells each other in a separate workshop and they 're working on those issues separately did you hit the workshop on the 2nd of October yeah so I think the key thing is that so it 's been up there was a council resolution probably about three two years ago around having a joint working program with eekend to adjust the air quality issues particularly in the bomb the area in the board hood that that was just starting sometime soon so but it was something that the boards really came to just pursue given that we still get ongoing complaints in terms of our area needs to be on there I 'm not sure when it o Toshi 's a specific issue in other parts of the city or not but it certainly is a big issue in our area I one or I 'm afraid today at the board which was he can are gonna base someone in the eastern side of the city to have pic much faster response time because what was happening as people were lodging complaints and then by the time that he can would respond up it several hours or sometimes a long time after the smell and the odor if you had disappeared and so my understands council working with a can around that joint monitoring approach which hopefully will be a bit of a model around how to improve but the other thing the board also gave feedback to e Ken was that people room all the complain but they don 't get any feedback about what happens to their complaint and so he kind of taken that on board generically well yeah but it 's important if people are lodging complaints over environmental harm then there should be a way to follow that through to see what 's actually happened as a result but I don 't know whether the council 's plural F to address how they feedback once then once so I mean a bit bit something that the chief executives made an oath off and will ensure that I mean it does seem to me that there was an agreement reached some time ago that there would be this Joint Working approach and they have obviously been challenges in that regard but we must be due to have another joint meeting with the governance of II can and as well so we 'll pop that on the agenda up here as well thank you it 's brilliant thank you very much so would someone like to move that the report be received Dion Yanni what the motion all those in favor say aye or as a post they know that 's

got one part a and this is the one that you 've just heard the deputation about here and we think too far oh really matter for coming along to support us in this because you know they 're trying to get a community leader to seizure and that 's exactly what we 've got here under our recommendations now I should have added it hasn 't been added yet now we 're just getting a fourth one which notes that some of the specific planning tools on the Greater Christchurch regeneration act may be required to facilitate in my opinion it 's probably under if you go up it 's just come up as an item before so note that some of it is it yeah is it and it was gonna be added to three but it 's just been put up as a fourth item it doesn 't matter and they 're both it effectively produces a result for every communication it 's that the purpose of this is just to make it clear that the the reason that regenerate Christchurch kind of facilitates and the background is is because some of the specific planning tools and the act may be required to facilitate planning that they can really only be an outline in this area can really only be generated by the council or or by reaching christchurch or yes nation is basically knowledge in that um that we 're trying to get this project moving yep amber trying to keep the community involved and you have a community lead approach from the bottom so um so I think we 've kept it at all the announcer number four yeah and you know would not you too and some of them over there very good Phil yeah just I 'm on the item 15 I can 't find any financial implications so I take it there 's none whatsoever Norman sees when there 's none yeah yeah normally all our decision-making financial implications are in the report and so every decision we make you can see how much it costs yeah as I 'm assuming this is no cost planning planning as what the council does so it 's not free stuff no it 's my understand that but within the council 's operation it does undertake planning and they will be supporting this and that also the community but this is a community and lead approach which does have you know I mean yeah so a community leader proach does require resourcing but that 's being dealt with in a different in a different way this paper isn 't dependent on that resourcing is here and it says here the cost of the proposed approach is outlined in this report would for this initial phrase be absorbed from within existing budgets across the relevant organizations feeding on the scale of food with the grant cities and projects may be needed so that 's 5.4 and the paper have Phil in England my question is really about we 're the Lynwood master plan FETs so my understanding from the report is its you said what we 're doing it 's complimentary so in fact is it like a part of it or does that mean as changes to the plan list could you just explain it okay so it 's it 's is complimentary and the master plan will continue that this will run alongside it so there 's still the stammel Road upgrade which is planned in the master plan and that 's also in there and the annual plan as well to happen thinking 2021 and so that will continue so this won 't amend the master plan but it will run alongside it at glean question from Tesla Arab just picked out all right um did you have your hand up so that you could move the resolution I 'll let you move the resolution and seeking to facility motion hey no it is good yeah so does anyone want to debate important to acknowledge that this is one of the communities that was hit really hard in the earthquake and through the central city plan that council did this group has made a number of submissions to a number of processes and I just want to distress the importance of central government being involved with local government there are a number of things that we do need to look at and we can 't do it as a council we simply don 't have the tools and the power Scyther gets really positive to work with regenerate around us there is some very real issues around land use in this particular area that that can be addressed through this but also I think it 's really important just to acknowledge that the community with very little resources has done an amazing job and I mean if you contrast it I guess to what 's happened in Fennell tune with the post office going into the council service center this was a post office that has remained open in the community through the huge volunteer efforts that this group has made so in place that uses all the tools available to us to get some really positive outcomes but I also just wanted to acknowledge that we know a post earthquake that the communities that could least afford it and were the most disadvantaged end up being bearing an unfair brunt of the burden and certainly if you look in this area what you the loss of low low-income affordable housing the inner-city bed sets etc that has had quite a devastating consequence alongside the loss of those affordable local businesses where people could go post pre-earthquake and now post earthquake obviously the cost of rebuilding has priced some of those out so I really look forward to this I think you know if we can take this opportunity to use the collaborative approach between central and local government in the community then I think where we will be in a good space I 'm you know sad that it 's taken this long to get to this point but I think we need to look forward now and just embrace this and make sure that we get regular reporting and key see progress in this area thank you a lot of the temporary accommodation shifts in this area meant resulted in a loss of further accommodation options in a city across you jeast so I think it 's important to have reach in there they may peps come across as sitting in the background but if they need to just ship forward a bit and use some of the powers available to them in relation to the district plan that would be good because it is a you know quite a significant chunk of housing that was lost the significant it 's not just in terms of number but actual social need so I 'm pleased to see that Regina 's is there in our sense that you know they 're ready to go and everyone is so let 's push the Go button it 's everyone only down had the last word but I want to say a couple of things this to me is the reason why we worked with central government to change the model of planning post the Sira environment to establish an organization at arm 's funded and resourced and accountable to both it 's created an opportunity for planning to bring community to the heart of its processes so community engagement as as as what it does as part of planning and to me that makes more sense than anything else in terms of a previous approach where you know planning sort of took place in a in a private environment and then a great big announcement you know after a hundred days and there you 've got the blueprint no opportunity for feedback no opportunity and with you can see the process that 's going on in the residential red zone it 's completely the opposite it 's totally engaged as putting options out it 's allowing people the time to feedback and we will waste head time after the earthquake I think there was an expectation that things would happen a lot more quickly but international experience would have said it was always going to take much longer than perhaps people had desired at the time I just want to mention that Illinois Community Trust and the the reason that I mention that has represented an area that that that has you know been at the same scale in terms of the deprivation index so I hate using that language because I think if you look for the assets and the strength of the community that 's where you start building from if you always look to what the negatives are then you only see problems and communities aren 't problems to be solved they 're people that require additional support in order to achieve but they need to lead the process and that 's why I 'm really supportive at first that I don 't know a model was that they set as equal partners at the table with central and local government and that 's what I want to see here I don 't want to see communities strucker 's supplicants you know mere applicants for funds I want to see them work and partner what the full support of their council am a central government in order to achieve dere inversions and goals so this is a really good model and I 'm hoping that it becomes the exemplar that let you close off the debate I think you took the words right out of my mouth that 's it 's put me off a little bit no all I can think about is meatloaf and I 've got hungry so I mean this is this is exciting I mean when I was first campaigning a year ago well H it was a bit more a year ago we 've got a leak that a year ago I 've my eyes was struck wide open at the the deprivation and Lynwood East while inner-city East area given that there 's so much a couple of blocks away in the central city and so much of the focus had been on the Central City and this area seems more filtered that time that it had been forgotten and you can kind of still see that if you drive down or even walk because it 's it 's the local supermarket that I go to the stem water road supervalue there 's still buildings that are falling apart from the earthquake that are still stuck here seven years six years later that demolished cleared so there 's a real need in this area and you can see that from the psychosocial indexes and all those kind of things where if we 're able to sort of support the community and Revital regenerate I prefer to use the language that 's in the in the act we will see an exemplar for how we can sort of move forward it is a that what to fund it away matter are doing there is support in a community hub in a way for the community so it 's it 's for the community by the community which I really like seeing the homelessness I just wanted to touch on there is an issue in Lynnwood village in in which is what I like about this process is it 's actually going to not just address the physical look of Lynwood village or maybe the planning tools that we need but actually the social needs area has as well the Central City is a lot as a focus I spend a lot of time dealing with stuff in the central city because there 's so key part to the central city I actually see it actually as you know the playground to the central city in a way this is where people will live to work in the central city and we need to make sure that it 's a good place for people to live that they have the amenity and the values that they need I just want to finish by saying thank you to Jeannie for all the work that you 've been doing you 're you 're a real start for this area and it 's great to see and also be be sitting in the from regenerate Christchurch she 's been in a role not too long and you 've already done quite a lot of work to get this along the road so just wanted to say thank you to you and also to Katie as well from every generation team i as as Liana said this is going to be really good at something that when I got elected I wanted to get through and it 's finally a year later getting through so please everybody support it some good key milestones some key dates that we can actually start seeing stuff and bring it back to council and now it 's going to be on the community board agenda most of the time it 's standing item now but I 'd love to see the council involved in this and actually bring stuff back so that we can actually see the progress that we 're putting in here so yeah thank you everybody for the work it 's good to see thank you very much right well if they moved and seconded so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"
