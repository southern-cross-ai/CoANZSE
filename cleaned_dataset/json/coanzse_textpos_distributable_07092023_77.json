    "text": "get everyone my name is Ross McLennan from in Valli cabins and tours why do you want to come to Townsville well quite simply it 's the best place on earth basically if you live here in the city you 've got 13 kilometres of beachfront to take a stroll along grab a coffee and a gelati if you want to go into the mountains behind me you 've got a thousand vertical meters and some of the oldest continuing rainforest on the planet you 're the world heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef off the coast we 've got our own Magnetic Island as our holiday destination on the weekend so hey come and have a look for yourself and find out why this is Australia 's largest regional centre north of your lovely city so of course people always say to me when you live up there you don 't have all of the amenities of the big city and I say well I think I 've got it better I can be wherever I want to be in Townsville in 15 minutes if it 's a walk along the shopping centres to do some shopping or it 's quite simply getting to a meeting on my push bike we 've got a major Regional Hospital base here with the with the Townsville general based hospital servicing large parts of northern Australia schools there 's a huge variety to choose from we had no problem getting our little girl into a daycare center and the the waiting list is definitely aren 't as long to get them into different schools and institutions here in a smaller centre but when we keep saying smaller centre Townsville is the largest regional city north of Brisbane in Australia I moved to Townsville in August 2011 job opportunity brought me to Townsville after I can put in my PhD I received two offers from Australia ones from James Cook University and other from a university if in Melbourne I chose jcu because it was an ongoing position academia physician and also offer me a better opportunity for my academic career development I love the Strand it 's one of the most beautiful beaches in the world I have ever seen and also the kissing approached me about tents well I will say come over and to experience cancer you will love it I guess my love affair started within probably 14 15 years ago I was working for the government down in Brisbane an opportunity came up to travel north so I had two options we furrow ringing so I put an application in for both my management rang and said Scott you 're going to Ingham so I guess the first reaction was Ingham you know I 've heard of it it 's not the place where they have the chickens England 's a little country town north of town so I remember making the phone call back with my wife Hilger and seeing whether they have all the TV channels we didn 't know what to expect so I told all my friends all of my family look I 'm going to go up to Ingham I 'll do two years as my country server so to speak with the government and I 'll come back home we had our first small child and Helga was pregnant with our second child we us now 14 years later we own our own property we 've just built a brand new home here in Ingham our youngest child was born here in iam so when people ask me you know why why Ingham you know I in my line of work I get to travel around the country very fortunate I have a great job well I get paid to actually go fishing so I meet plenty of people that want to know why Ingham and I guess that the biggest reason is for me it has three things the people the landscape and the fishing obviously I 'm in the fishing industry so one when I talk about fishing destinations people want to know and it 's a big question I 'm asked where 's the best spot you 've ever fished Scott you 've traveled the world you 've traveled Australia tell me your best your number one fishing spot and without a doubt I pause from in a scratch my head look when I say i 'm in north queensland it 's where I live and it 's one of the say well the hilly is are loving it right here in England I 've been living in the verdict and now five and I would have to say that was for the career prospects that I moved up here I was currently living on the Gold Coast and I studied at Griffith University down there but soon as their a job opportunity arose I jumped at the chance to move to the Pelican the thing I love the most about living in the verdict and would have to be the people they 're just so welcoming as soon as I moved here I had touched teams to move into nibble tears to play I joined a surf lifesaving clubs I see a fantastic opportunity the reason we come here was that we had the the benefits of an agricultural area but all the raw materials sourced we were already been planning expansion and we need water for expansion but we also need to get it out of the ground we also need to get it back into the ground so we 're in a position here where we can take as a as a feedstock for the sugarcane if we need to or as a raw material for an ongoing changes the other reasons we have is there 's a lot of power around here anyway the farmers here use a lot of irrigation pumps and consequently there 's 22,000 volts all over the place so we don 't have to put in much of our own infrastructure it 's already there we 're very close to a major port Townsville Tony 90k is up the road so that cuts our Road transportation costs down and when you start doing the numbers on road transportation versus sea transportation sea is a lot cheaper so the closer you are to a major port the better so it allows us to utilize a small town as an agricultural base and then also to have a quite a large town which has got a major engineering base right next to us so we 've got the best of both worlds it 's a no-brainer really we came back to charters towers and ret is a boilermaker by train so if you just went decided well I do it for somebody else we 'll try and do it ourselves and started our own business and now we have three sections of that business so we expanded with the mines around charters tailors so business-wise we couldn 't have asked for a better spot than China 's talents if someone approached me and was thinking about moving to charters towers particularly personally again for me it 's about family so charters tell us just offers that work-life balance for us it 's a type of town that you can walk down the street and you know most of the people you 're waving to everybody on your way down to bullies or whatever one of the great things that we find in charters towers is there are so many amazing places in Far North Queensland so many amazing places you 've got the bush we 've got the Great Barrier Reef you 've got rainforests and it 's all sort of within a few hours drive so all of those sort of things you can do with kids without spending money one of the major choices and charters towers we have three major awning schools there and then a whole bunch of states because I think there 's six girls all together so you really spoilt for choice and spirits that goes and you have kids sent from all over the state to come to charters towers because these for us chatez towers we love it it 's graves been great to us so yeah we love it yeah you look up you 've done far more my life in certainly and growing up on Palmers certainly and have been wooden probably the best place in the north of particularly an island community smack bang in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef is a nice little shyer I think the only Shire and the particular indigenous Shire in North Queensland that lives within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park precinct in in my life I 'm certainly done all my schooling on town I went off to boarding school did a bit of studying at James Cook University for a very short period working the Northern Territory for quite some time weakened kids for where your heart is and it 's the place in the environment a getting up in the morning in down sitting on your front porch looking out over the waters in the reefs and the islands you know the rainforest meets the reef type thing so they 're really rainforest the island lovely beaches lovely reefs and just a nice not over overly populated community and I think that 's what 's really important about the business fish and chip shop in North Queensland and certainly that was proven actually for the tourism Alton Bay for par we there was a massive lines at the fish bar outside the building actually with the almost the probably out of this round visitors that come and visit us for the day probably about 150 of them lined up at the fish butt and that 's the experience Sydney the pound offers is there real not militarized guided tour type things but a relaxed and come over and enjoy yourself and move around in feel free to mingle and mix with the locals you _"

on display and then when my great-grandfather he died 1955 so I never knew him and then my grandfather 's younger brother lived in the house and then we moved him to a nursing home and that was when dad wanted to nail the cupboard doors shut because you didn 't want prying eyes looking at his grandparents things and he nailed the cupboard doors shut the house was sold the cupboards still nailed were taken down to my grandparents house which was empty at the time on our family farm at guru and over the years we 'd go and have a look and pull things out and admire things it was like a little antique shop but we didn 't realize the importance of what was in those cupboards he actually went to Gallipoli and we didn 't know that until I 've got his war records and I found the said did you know your grandfather went to Gallipoli and he said I had no idea because he said he never spoke about the war but he said speak to my cousin Norman her husband had told her that grandfather had told him some of the really horrific things that he had experienced at Gallipoli but he made him promise he 'd never told grandma because they just weren 't suitable for a woman 's ears grandma used to tell dad 's cousin that he was always the life of the party before he went away to world war one he loved to dance he was always the last to leave the party when he come back he was virtually an alcoholic and a lot of families stories are sort of funny stories but they 're sad also because it 's related to what he got up to because he was always drunk he joined the mac i mounted infantry as a lighthorseman when he was 17 years old in 1890 he went away to the Boer War in 1899 and when he come back from the Boer War he fourteen when war broke out he enlisted with the fifth light horse regiment this is a photo of the training camp at an AA ground near Brisbane that the Lighthorse were training before they left for the war this is a guide it 's actually written by Charles beans it was a guide to Australian troops for Egypt just everyday things sexually transmitted diseases advising to stay out of the brothels and not to drink the water just food and shopping I guess if you had time for shopping these are the badges off his uniform and this is the like the coat of arms for the fifth Light Horse and there 's other little buttons and things that would have been on his uniform at the time for most of his military life he was actually in a light horse instructor and it was sent to the school of instruction in Egypt and his job was to instruct and train the men to send out to various battles and then of course he was sent to Gallipoli when they dismounted the Lighthorse well this is one thing we found Gallipoli the hospital ship offer ends at coke just before leaving this ship the guilford castle one wounded man was killed and another wounded by Turkish shrapnel stray lien sisters were on board this boat this is a dugout another soldier in a dugout at Gallipoli this is William on the Oriana he was evacuated from Gallipoli in September 1915 and this is on his way back from England because he was sent to hospital in England this was a book on his regiment it 's written by the colonel of the regiment of the fifth Light Horse and it was issued to the surviving members of the Lighthorse in the 1920s it details his arrival at anzac cove and other battles that they were involved in I 'm looking at his diary from 1917 on the third of August went out on a stunt with the fifth Light Horse to scoop up Bedouins our post within five miles of Beersheba we were fired upon by Turkish outpost return to camp without casualties and then by the end of the year of 1917 he was actually ill and he had mentions when he was in hospital on the Sunday the fourth of November the wounded are coming in from Sheba fight our present kept the 15th of the 619 16 I 'm waiting um cartons of beer in the desert our regiment in part of the sixth at Sarah poom the camel train was about a couple of miles long my father doesn 't remember him very well but he craved knowledge what Dad does remember is him and his cousin would come up from guru and stay with their grandparents and his grandfather by then he lived in bed he was a Brazil and he 'd keep a notebook beside his bed and he 'd have all these questions written on the notebook and they would have to go off on their bikes around Townsville this is in the 1950s and find the answers and dad said they rarely ever found the answers and recently I asked out what sort of questions we 're on his list and one was apparently on the old trains there were metal foot warmers and there was a substance inside them that would know what the substance was and anyway so dad they never found out so I got on google and I found out the answers to but I always say that on Google would have been his best friend you _"

    "text": "counselors today I rise in the chamber to table the city budget for the 2014-15 financial year this is a budget for balance it recognizes that many people in our community are doing a tough it is set against the backdrop of disappointing state and federal government budgets and with soaring increases in basics such as electricity transport medical and insurance costs there are a lot of local families who are struggling with rising cost of living pressures in the last year more than 6,000 full-time equivalent jobs have been lost in our northern region so today 's budget acknowledges that our community needs a break this budget will minimize increases to council rates and charges it looks to build local business confidence and create jobs through a major capital program it prioritizes funding for services and facilities that are fundamental to townsville progress and lifestyle and it continues to responsibly play down the city debt and delivers a budget surplus that allows us to respond to emerging community priorities this is a back-to-basics community focus budget that is right for this time I want to thank the councillors the budget and for being able to do more with less during some very challenging economic times I believe strongly in promoting business confidence in talking up Townsville 's economic opportunities however it is important to recognize that framing this year 's budget has been difficult in the face of rising costs that impact the council including the forecast increase in the coming year of three-point-one percent for services and materials some of these rising costs include a 1.6 million dollars in higher electricity costs including the loss of a six hundred thousand dollar subsidy from the state for street lighting ninety thousand dollars in higher insurance costs three hundred and sixty five thousand dollars fuel costs as a result of the federal government 's decision on fuel excise 4.2 million dollars increase in depreciation on public assets and 281 thousand dollars less in federal funding as a result of the Commonwealth group freeze on the federal assistance grants these costs have a significant these costs have a significant impact on councils operating bottom line however in line with our budget philosophy we have worked hard to absorb these costs where rate increases this budget will continue a strong and sustainable approach to managing the city 's finances including reducing our debt in 2011 12 the council had a forecast debt of 380 1,000,000 and was making annual interest and loan repayments of just on 45 million for the third year in succession we will continue to reduce the council 's debt in this budget by at least five million down to 328 million by cutting the depth accounts the council 's interest in loan repayments this year will reduce to 42 million thus freeing up vital funds for services and facilities this responsible approach to financial management places us in a stronger position for those times when we do need to borrow for income-producing assets the budget includes up to 15 million in New borrowings in 2014-15 and a further 20 million next year should it be needed for the upgrades at the Cleveland bay treatment plant to meet the state government 's environmental licensing requirements these borrowings will be dependent on discussions with the state government minister to attempt to renegotiate some of these licensing conditions notwithstanding this these five million for a third consecutive year we will also operate in the black the 2004 between 15 budget forecasts a surplus of four point three eight million however this does include 2.86 million from ND double ra payments for disaster repair work the real surplus is 1.5 2 million for the 2014-15 budget includes an overall increase in rates and utilities charges of one point eight seven percent and i will save us again because i think it 's a great headline the rise in overall rates and charges is one point eight seven percent this equates to a one dollar 17 a week rise for the average residential rate payer the overall arise is well below the predicted CPI of three-point-one percent for queensland and represents the lowest rise in overall rates and utilities certainly since amalgamation this includes a general rate rise of three point five percent of which one percent is caused by skyrocketing electricity costs there will be no rise for sewage for residential or business customers the standard water plan of 772 kilolitres rises by one point nine six percent or from 714 dollars charge is up by one point eight percent to two dollars 79 or about 3 cents a kilowatt ER the fixed service charge for the water watch scheme goes up 2.2% from 325 2 332 dollars with the price per kilowatt are up two point three percent to a dollar 33 or an extra to Center kiloliters councillors I am proposing a new waste packaging this year 's budget that will reduce waste charge by three percent from 231 dollars to 224 dollars or seven dollars 34 a week it will provide the community with a more equitable and fair access to our landfills the system I 'm proposing would replace the and underutilized voucher system with full free three-day weekends of access to our tips and a bulk curbside rubbish collection in urban parts of this city this collection will be carried out across the city over two financial years to ensure its financial sustainability with those in our urban community having access being charged for this service Townsville waste charges will remain one of the most affordable in Queensland and I ask counselors to support this initiative which the problems we have of illegal dumping overall with general rates utility charges for water sewage and waste collection the rate rise is an average of one point eight seven percent or one dollar 17 a week to assist with rates relief the council will also continue its fifteen percent discount on early payments of general rates and the appropriate concession for pensioners pensioners will receive concessions of eighty-five percent all on their general rate or up to eight hundred dollars a year to assist them to stay in their own homes a total commitment in this budget of five point three seven million in addition the pensioner transport subsidy scheme of 324,000 will continue well I applaud the state government for reversing its decision and maintaining the pensioner concessions cut by the federal government it 's time our pensioners were treated with more respect by our political leaders our pension is like many in our community are doing it tough and the last thing they need is inconsistent policy that instills a culture of fear amongst the most vulnerable in our community the total budget for the 2014-15 year 215 million with local suppliers to directly assist local economic activity over 1,000 713 residents perform full-time part-time or casual work for council including 34 apprentices and 30 trainees this injects an additional 147 million into our local economy annually the budget also supports a range of initiatives to promote and develop economic opportunities for the city economic development is a commitment of this council and we must draw the line in the sand government must reinvest all monies from any asset sales into this region we must fight tooth and nail to ensure these monies are spent here and not in Brisbane or the Gold Coast the closing of businesses in Townsville is an indication that this city is suffering Pacific Coast engineering horizon and the Townsville hospital have either closed their doors will reduce stark numbers we must attract businesses and investment from outside this region as part of our promotion of Townsville as a place to invest and live 734 dollars in general funding has been earmarked support Townsville Enterprise this year council will continue to work with Townsville enterprise in

    "text": "well my name 's paul martin is i was born in Townsville I 've spent most of my life in Townsville except for some education and the University in Brisbane a couple of years overseas but apart from that I 'm a towel boy and I 've been a lawyer for admitted for 44 years I think all most of the day I think close enough and all my lure except for a couple of beers in the UK has been in town cyl or North Queensland anyway but operating out of foam here which is Wilson run and gross and they 've been around since eighteen ninety-five you well I 'm going to quite compare the Mona Lisa which I saw in the Louvre and 1971 with the allen painting townsville 1894 but I am going to say that after the arm was acquired and pustaka arranged through the museum to fix it up it was the ugly duckling turned into a swan and to that extent the experiences were similar they were quite magical how the museum was able to drag away 100 hundred years of stuck with been stored in somebody shed for Lord only knows how long it was quite remarkable I think it 's a marvelous painting is start being its own right but to see its conversion was quite fantastic i bought a number of paintings by kath meharry over the years probably spanning a long number of decades the first one I bought was called Paley reflections I remember and my own family history on my father 's side was that of he arrived in this country when he was three years old help Spanish parents but they come from Argentina where he had been born and they lived in a in a little house that my grandfather had chopped out of the out of the forest in Silkwood the north and I didn 't know my grandmother really well at all and I 'm very sorry about that but this plenty of reflections was very much had a haunting incisiveness about it of the people who really put their heart and soul into this country and and could think about it now only as a dim memory and you know that was other because i think she 's a fabulous local queensland artist and the other painting which I quite treasures a Aboriginal back painting from the Northern Territory up in the air fear of swamp it so doesn 't tell any of those Dreamtime ones that are so attractive with their dreamtime images and black and white and tying Dreamtime tales this is what they do now it 's big painting back painting and it simply shows all these goose eggs or duck X that collected over a period of weeks when they 're obviously laying and I go out and these canoes and they raid the eggs right the nests put the eggs and the canoes go back by Bill these little hump be arrangements in the middle of the swamp and the painting shows a nighttime daytime coloring and it 's something that they do even now that particular painting is especially nice for me because photos were taken as it was being done they 've been cut off the tree been flattened out and then the really thoughtful going over and lines which is being done and so the painting so it seems but they they 're probably my favorites that 's like weird to use I didn 't really choose it it shows me it 's not often that anyone can say that they 've got more money than the council but what happened was and I don 't know how I got picked I just was probably one of those lucky unlucky things but it was towards the end of a financial year and for some reason I had some money Oh which is pretty unusual for me and the gallery at the time had been approached to buy the album on behalf of the council that wasn 't being offered privately it was being offered to the council at what was thought to be a very keen price still wasn 't cheap and the council didn 't have enough dough to buy it had because I watch it den and and that was that whereas I so it was in a pretty poor way at the time but its its intrinsic worth and it 's hidden Majesty was there to be seen I just didn as it did so that 's how that particular painting which is called Townsville 1864 I think came into being I particularly like the painting because in the front of it there 's a fella standing there looking back towards castle hill and I like to think of him as being council 's first solicitors a bloke called Norris and he was quite a quantum planning where it would all end up it 's great painting because when I first saw it I thought he 'd been taking a fair amount of poetic license and customer didn 't really look like that because I like was brought up in mr. Dennis night and saw it from a completely different angle since then around the North Ward and you get a different angle but you don 't get the angle that that particular painting is taken from and you 've really got to go to South towel the Metropol Pablo I think some good place to go to have a look at it from and you 'll see a completely different style of Castle Hill that I don 't think most brought it home for me and it 's a great painting it 's got all the bench for full walls there and all the shipping that was the lifeblood of Townsville at the time lifeline so that was special for me well I think I 'm best described as a camp follower fringed weather because I have no training my formal appreciation I suppose it 's bit like drinking beers and wines and those sort of things your taste is tailored by all sorts of things you get a general idea you know what you like you like what you know but it doesn 't have proper foundation as the curators have god i can analyze it down and that 's fantastic but i can 't do that and when i try a fail so I enjoy just being a camp toilet I can 't follow her and they sometimes go well I think that the gallery has been coming on so they tastic alee shane has been slaving his stuff and trying out a peacock feathers proud as he should be with awards which has been taken not just that 's a significant achievement really for a town which is fairly sporting mad-dogging sober as mad as Melbourne but budget we 're probably close and particularly North Queensland so it 's very satisfying to me for the gallery to be exposed to more people like a lot of things it 's like going to a chamber music festival thank God and your lawyer why do I but you go to one and say I really enjoyed that and it 's a bit like going it 's a bit like this you go along and really enjoyed that you go to the Museum of tropical Queensland mmm maybe you 're taking the kids the grandkids or whatever I really enjoyed that and the musica the aquarium is exactly like that who gots the aquarium over against the aquarium by and large but those that do rave about it absolutely fantastic because it 's only at doorstep do it anytime go to magnetic island anytime you want so you don 't but these things I 'd like to think are a small enticement but the museum the gallery are not for of ordinary boat and people with ordinary tastes who want to spend a bit of time looking at things that they don 't usually look at getting a bit of inspiration and that was the other thing about being out of there at the collection a huge array of different styles it 's it 's not all just artwork and it 's not all just paintings there are all sorts of different elements that are used by people to express what they see what they think what they feel and not every one of them 's every but everybody 's cup of tea but many of them hit a chord with different people and that 's what i think is the good thing about our university are our own Museum that it 's it 's it 's a place for all people and for all seasons _"

isn 't being bad to the next building but between the units so that they can at least they can have all the privacy by of the art by placing and the windows of strategic early so that they can have a yeah yeah it 's an active choice rather than being forced it right right yeah i think there 's also you 're actually right maybe it 's not not for everyone but what 's what what we should have said about this process it 's an artist there 's some relation residences live living there because just like any other big city artists are being forced to move out in the city because it 's so expensive and soul is no exceptions so expensive we went there so so there 's a common interest they 're there and and they 're they 're kind of in residency and they 're all hardest and there 's there 's a line out the door to get into this place I mean so many people want to move in because it 's kind of a shared interesting so our goal for the next version of have it when it 's not as far as what there is professionally there 's a different kind of person living how do you how do you make that space if one can choose I mean I did the tapioca is there one can choose to retreat into their little space or there 's an ambiguous ending public where you can choose the way you could share so this is what it 's not resolved this on that side mission is that something specific about the culture I mean all of those sections and the high windows and I think most Australians would go crazy without being able to to to look at a live in a box of polymerisation that 's right it 's really um it 's it could be a cultural thing that there are you know there are some windows but but that media sea of the outdoors is right there you can just walk right outside onto onto the terrace that 's that 's that could be it you could have two terraces on each side of the unit so instead of the window you is all the mid the micro theater and the gallery spaces those are all meant to be living rooms just building itself show you that 's right so it 's a kind of a you know we 're sort of we didn 't explain it correctly I think they 're not just sells the whole building works is one community so you can go downstairs and Jim itself is a bra so via social experiment it meant he is social experiment it would be in that and by the way we actually you know we were working with the client from you suggested go to the smallest unit possible by law you can 't do a even smaller than this legally because we could have actually up begin to occupy these maybe a slightly bigger and sort of sort of an exercise of what happens when you make it that small but then you maximize the zoning envelope you actually get these residual spaces so the residual space we 're trying to argue it that I can actually add value it 's not just the fact that you 're living many million if any living in the city should I gotta head to sleep a night Ethan thanks a club so stop you can 't it 's not a cultural thing it 's much like living in a city this size that 's right yet they 're already in the city exactly right everything around the clap we special in English setting Korean as well as it was we should have done it done by they won 't oh there was a friend of mine that that wrote this poem about you know like the words are about excess and melting snow and gets kind of thinking it it 's really supposed to be like this ominous story about the environment and so I just recited it I actually did the narration for that in the soundtrack so they 're hearing me whispering but it was hard to translate it down today to drink it 's the class solid power of that we tell them we wish you try to we try to do that beyond that the controller for it actually is very very low wattage to dissolve LEDs a the power supplies like a little like that kind of thing so it 's low power but it needs to be silicon yes the baby lock send messages across the mouth great great i didn 't see I told you you gotta be great at we 're at software probably one more question seems like Salesforce Cal response like you see sync with what support our project failed when you get to I guess that urban sprawl pensions is that something you like your attacker from the time try move those IDs into suburban I mean the way that 's right and how they grow a prison for example let 's say it is bounded by like a remote server preserve every day so at some point something 's gotta give so you see the target product at a time to move the area sounds like they 're so good people wanting to move in there that 's right that 's right the gentleman in the middle dairy you brought up a good point that the project thought thrives because it 's also surrounded by other verbally stuff around in and of itself you can also just walk down the street and go to great restaurants everywhere there you know we work in this the most suburban we 've gotten is that is that house to break the braver house which was in a pre-war suburb where the lots are still pretty small and dense we haven 't done their large a very answer but on the idea of this micro-housing it 's not the purpose only to provide this minimum on living space but they 're so we wanted to make this is this face um that the people can expand their living space depending on their knees so brazen sequel one person we have a lot of the floor they have two units that the client wants to rent that to the couple so the earth use one space in the postman use the other and they meet in the corridor degree so 04 and then they break out they can you know easily for so oh there is the plant that that is the people can um the get the more units to so that that you live because you need a bigger space they so that the depending on the stage of date you 're right um then your family size gets thanks man it gets larger or smaller but the width is the system could provide this solution that says the Bombers you can leave in Guam placing even longer so that the the community becomes more sustainable in that way so that the idea can be applied in the in the Lord s the area with the same Rosie you _"

    "text": "hi I 'm Chris SST we were based in Boston neyo and so it was John Paul and I 've had my cup for the SSD for 10 years I 'm originally from Korea but I moved to the United States when our six months old my name is Christian dual I 'm the manager of the asia pacific design library State Library Queensland the apdl is a shared space for industry academia and the public to come together in the generation of new ideas and knowledge centered around design the age of civic so a lot of what we do is about bring people together around ideas and knowledge less about this containing books no I 'll building but more about you know sharing and connecting people online and offline as well I actually originally started in the third design not a picture but I when I studying the street design I am wanted to explore the design possibility if further then objects so I testify I reach out to her I 'm picture feel let 's see um that 's been of the short answer yes think about 'd be an architect and there was a program at the University of Virginia and I actually that was the only program I could get into a small they had affirmative action at the time which which allows minorities to get into school because I want to be a musician and so I applied knowing that I wouldn 't get in but I got in through this tavern of action and then I realized it was great because there 's no right and wrong answer in architecture it 's how you develop an argument how you develop an idea so it was a great fit but i just stumbled into it by accident i grew up working for my dad my dad said build up and I so I grew up around a lot of farm you know timber in 10 and working with my hands but I was also really into art and music is well at school and when it came time to do Mikey Tech and you know choose my subjects at the end of high school my mom actually suggested that architecture would be a good up whether to study music or architecture and I thought that architecture would be a more stable career I was wrong but that 's kind of how it all happened here as an architect I think that the best part is that this you cannot predict everything that order your design based on that you research that depending on how people perceive the space and how people use the space it can be the space can be transformed so that is the unexpected thing sometimes that actually happen exactly what I expected but sometimes there are things that I could discover from the order use so that is the still is it so I can learn from the result of that what I 've done so most powerful thing to see is is being able to change the city through a building and being be able to change the way people interact with with the city and with themselves well so it 's it 's um on one hand it 's a bit of a control freak thing because all of a sudden you 've made it maybe change on a change for the better it 's very inspired and I think changing people 's habits in the way they they live in the city and the way they live in space can actually be good terms of people with the other social social issues as well as environmental issues I 'm inspired by creativity more than anything so I 've stepped away from being a full-time architect and that was a whole random bunch of reasons for that but what I 've discovered in that process is the value of the creative process of you know problem solving that architects use and it 's not just architects that use that processes all kinds of designers but its inherent everyone and I think as we grow up creativity is kind of boxed stamped out of us through school and so I 'm really inspired by people who have you know really tapped into their own creativity and I 'm also i love working with people to help them find their own creativity and I love seeing you know people who don 't think they 're creative think creatively and the release tension create a better world as it 's really exciting well I think well I look at the Bing designer so I I think myself as a designer architecture is one of the subject that I designed and the design thinking nature can be applied in many different fields so well I 'll design something I love I 'm a jack of all trades so i can play so many insurance when I bad at all so I play saxophone guitar bass well the subject we 're currently interesting is the Micro urbanism which we 're gonna which going to lecture today is some is it about the way to build a new cities in existing setup so it 's not about like amazing certain area and build an entirely new cities but it 's about implementing the essential ideas is the elements in this city to revitalize the existing conditions the subject actually got immersed from the project we are we 've been had we been designing so is to relate to where is it came from the hour just our interest I think is it not from of does problem out of that the work we 're really interested in creating new lationship between people in their environment and and that 's what micro urbanism that it does the kind of subset is sort of smaller footprint living which means less energy and and all those things but doesn 't necessarily mean small space although small spaces is a factor of it so I think as the world population grows cities are growing and all this kind of thing I think it 's a very significant thing in terms of separating what we 're saying is that we 're separating the idea of value from the idea of size because people think bigger is better all the time a bigger house is is all of a sudden better because it costs more money and so we 're trying to separate those things about the quality of the space rather than the size of the space so that 's that 's our mission with my one of the missions with microorganism the term of microorganism is pretty recent but then the idea behind of this microorganism is it _''_506.419 work for a ten month I think I think architecture is at a really interesting cross road because we have this older generation of capital a architects who practice in a traditional way and being disrupted by all these changes in technology and social connectivity and all that kind of stuff and architecture is has to evolve or it 's going to die and it 's like architects like gin here and john from SSD tonight who have shown the value of architects as generalists who can think about a lot of things at once and bring them together so not just about creating a building but about thinking about sociology about the environment about behavior and psychology and technology and particularly technology i think in buildings and the way that senses and smart cities and interaction can happen with our buildings i think is really exciting yeah this is great be here at least yeah i mean i spent honestly probably a little bit more than 24 hours I in Australia 's for but visit is great experiences to my first time and you know Christmas continent that I sure is a very unique position on this day so with the geographical location but also it has a lot of natural resource which is it et al is very the precious becoming more precious in and is it it 's so far what I offshore they said people or the people here it 's open to new design I I see a lot of nice design I think maybe in Australia there 's more forward looking a little bit and it 's about creating a language and a culture for the future I feel like it 's very superficial but you know going around and seeing buildings I I feel like it 's not that that folks are just not thinking about culture and history it seems like they 're trying to create cultural history it was a book that I 've read in the first year called analyzing architecture by Simon Ireland and it 's it 's really it 's a black book and it 's just got really simple like line drawings and explains the basic elements of principles of architecture like horizon column plinth and then create buildings and when I was in first year architecture nothing made sense it was all just a blur and confusing and that book was kind of like a voice of reason and simplicity in a sea of confusion boom yeah I still love that book I think we might try to stick with one thing for a while because we we try to do so many different things we 've recycled highways into housing we 've done so many different kinds of things and there 's there 's so much to to explore it in terms of microbes and we can explore perception and that goes into the part we can explore like mechanical things which almost is like building a boat when you build a small apartment it 's like all the pieces have to fit so it 's also very technical it 's also very theoretical too we should write about this stuff and be arriving so it 's sort of a it 's a small topic that can open out too many things of it 's like gee I thought it was really good and great sense to see global architects of their stature come and talk about their portfolio of work and then to find that there is actually some elements of connection and even some messages for Townsville in an urban sense so yeah really really informative and fantastic for for Townsville where sometimes we can feel a little bit isolated and left out of the you know the the global context so yeah and hopefully you know my my my brethren will take some of that with them tonight sort of like she was great it 's great to have that sort of quality of professional and architect coming to Townsville and Brisbane spreading it regionally not just keeping it in Brisbane think it 's great great opportunity Oh you _"

    "text": "you you yeah the the street art project here is has got a couple of different elements to it we 've engaged with some local street arts from various kind of corners of the community which have come together to create the wall that 's behind us here Eric and we 've also commissioned a major major piece buyer of well-known street artists so I 'm sitting over on the wall here the mural by finta McGee which is very exciting and then some pieces by younger artists and other members of the community sitting here yeah I think before he 's been passionate about Townsville and the Townsville community and you know one of the areas that is probably less awareness or bees is that of you know the arts community in towel particularly the street art community in Townsville I 've always been pretty passionate about it myself and have the opportunity to introduce it into this project so it 's something that we 've been thinking off quite a while well I think initially we thought of it as an idea but then we went the virtual the first Tucker gallery who were very helpful in probably just coordinate and you know organize it and you know who to go to and how to approach them we ended up going to a series of kind of local community groups and local street artists that we were aware of and commissioning them and also for for the major piece are seeking out some significant you know nationally and in some cases internationally renowned street artists to get involved alongside the young artists yeah I think it 's very exciting for Townsville I mean to to have her I guess internationally recognized street artists like Fintan McGee you know who 's known all around all around the world now to come and you know do something in our own backyard is very exciting and I think it can actually appeal to all levels of the community not just the art community from you know someone that sees it as an interest piece right through to you know art lovers that you know collect art I think they can all appreciate it I think it could drive you know so general interest piece or for those that are interested in art are interested in street art they can all relate to it equally I was close you I think people have been very surprised that you know what a amazing artwork it is and I 've had a lot of positive feedback you know how quickly it 's come together and how it really changes this this space I think everyone really likes my hope is that it this is going to be that catalyst or the CD the seed for more of this kind of thing because you know I think it 's a great opportunity to engage with your local community and also the arts community coming together you know to build these places and to recognize that art has a significant part in our culture and our site it probably being a slow process really i started writing graffiti when I was like 13 I grew up in West End in Brisbane and in that area we we had a pretty active graffiti culture so I kind of first developed an interest when I was coming in of went on iron rod in art school and started developing oil paintings and stuff like that and I guess I kind of started to marry what I was learning at art school with my graffiti practice so yeah it was kind of slow thing I know if I was ever really interested in street art or graffiti first or what but um he has a slow kind of development and evolution to me it 's kind of tricky man i guess like there has been kind of more commercial successful lot of artists it 's definitely a lot of artists are changing the approach now as a result of that certainly there 's been a shift in some communities to kind of broader acceptance but I 've kind of seen a shift in other direction in other in other communities or you know in other parts of Australia as well so it 's kind of a bit of a constant game of tug-of-war or back and forth so I don 't know where it 's headed man like in the future I mean I guess time we just gotta movements as they come and go or their they evolve and change you know I think that 's definitely being it being a big change away from kind of hit and run tactics like stencils and posters more towards kind of like large-scale mural work so that 's kind of a shift we 've seen within street art already and that 's probably just happy that 's happened since i was around that 's probably in the last 10 years we 've seen that shift so whether it changes or dies out or I mean yeah who knows man that 's that 's up for the universe to decide not me so yeah yeah like collaboration I think it 's kind of like pretty important it 's a good way to loan you know you kind of have to compromise when you 're collaborating quite a lot so that that 's definitely a good way to kind of get out of your comfort zone and experiment learn new things I don 't know if collaborated with a lot of different artists over the years a few writers you know softballs different Australian artists recently collaborated with Seth globe painter and Hawk so when I was in America Mesa when it 's in Dublin Vienna she 'd army yeah I mean there 's a lot of different different artists of collaborated with but it 's always challenging as always it 's fun good way to learn first work in Townsville yeah I was here when I was a kid man like just butters just like with my parents you know so this is like my first time really in Townsville as a grown man definitely our first time working here so yeah it 's good ah four or five days usually depending on size and detail I think this will be a solid four and a half day project so I could work pretty quickly once I 've got like the design and everything 's planned out I can usually you know get stuck in and and produce something pretty quick now I want to started out I was working like mostly with spray paint actually but just I don 't know I kind of found it it 's a bit smooth that kind of wasn 't really satisfied with what I was doing you know so I was kind of looking a lot of the South American artists for lack of materials or a budget for projects where I 'm you know kind of compromising and using cheaper house paints and just kind of using whatever materials they can get their hands on and as a result that I think their work was kind of a lot more painterly and it just kind of appealed to me a lot more so yeah for that reason i can 't really like pay i really like painterly art you know really like you know thought about paula rego and and you know the Expressionists and you know a lot of different artists you know Brett Whiteley Lucien Freud their kind of work really appeals to me so I kind of try and recreate that in a different context and different setting the best way to do that is with house paint you know so yeah I mean I think it 's it 's it 's definitely growing it 's definitely one of smaller regional towns and it 's pretty impressive considering Townsville can be a little bit isolated you are quite find North here but you know I think it 's you know it 's important I hope it continues to grow it 's a good way of kind of you know bridging the gap between you know gallery art and and you know getting kind of art to a broader community people that would normally be exposed to work in a gallery so yeah I think it 's definitely important man hope it continues to grow here and more projects like this you know start to happen in LA I 'm I got painting two murals in arm culver city so pretty similar to what i did here maybe not quite so big but I 've got to to do so i 'll be a busy boy when i get there man for sure i 'll do my best i 'll be a little um do my little bit for tourism queensland you know it 's work hard man that 's that 's really I mean it 's such a cliché work pays off eventually experiment and just have fun man see if you 're not enjoying it it 's not going to work you know so yeah it 's not really like the most original advice you could give someone but it 's it 's trill in it and it definitely worked for me I guess the worst got a little bit like pretty personal kind of surreal i guess like I 'm pretty interested in surrealism generally but I don 't know it 's kind of like an ode to my kind of personal experience with the Brisbane flood a lot of my work kind of explorers you know broader themes of climate change but within the context of my own personal experiences in Brisbane with the floods and it was kind of cool that I got to do something in North Queensland cuz I know you guys have had you know pretty similar experiences to what we 've had in southeast Queensland and you know maybe maybe a few more cyclones which are a little different but you 've certainly had your fair share of floods up here kind of it also like it draws on the community spirit if you want to kind of look at that of people working together and supporting each other you know during times of crisis something that that was very important something I was really lucky to see when you know after the floods in Queensland so yeah I guess the work kind of speaks on that _"

    "text": "you this year the part of National Youth Week as as well as folks new initiatives I 'm counselor council collaborated with the young people to community in order to release a number of different project that young people can actually take a hold of and actually get out there into the community will they get mentorship support and everything and if we get to follow that story all the way through to start to finish the idea for this project came as a result of it being National Youth Week we really ask PCYC we really wanted to see where we could fit in and deliver a service to community as certainly one in a garbage area as its involved without is your voice in an ongoing basis Leon Stubbs who works closely with the garbage state school and is the chairperson of our branch here had this idea that will be a really great opportunity to create at a painting that the kids could connect with in a local area of garbage of garbage as a suburb and sort of their connection to it and their thoughts on painting so we 're basically displaying that here at the PCYC and giving the kids an opportunity to connect to the branch and feel a little bit of ownership over their work Leon wanted something about Garbutt about the pathways that the kids kids trick throughout garb and the activities that go on here so I went to Google Earth and had a look at Garbutt from the air and took a took a photograph of of an aerial view of Garbutt and and started to superimpose ideas over it to create the design for the murals and in this way to the kids could relate they could check the map and they could find their house on the map and then when they painted their own houses with their families in their houses they were able to find the right spot on on the mural to to put their houses and they helped me paint the background as well each had a little block where they could they could add that whatever color they wanted in whatever techniques they wanted so we 've got some very nice textures in with all the kids with their house illustrations and their families and all the activities took like a couple weeks and painted yeah it was pretty fun and yeah huge event we want to make this it 's just the biggest event of the year for the young people for them to come hang out be safe it 's all about using your voice to make an impact and it 's all about living life full on and so for myself that 's something that I want to see in the young people and obviously I 'm young as well I 'm 20 years old and just showing that you don 't have to be 30 you don 't have before you don 't have to be a grown adult to make a difference the I want a little them that we run we 've actually run it for the past couple years and so we just see the young people of Townsville just how amazing they are and how much passion and how much drive they have to go after things and so we just thought during national youth that really lets them share their ideas share their thoughts share their yeah their feelings towards things that go around in cash there 's different areas that are very key there 's two areas that I want to talk about specifically the first one is the small world big smile and that areas were really cool area we 've got this massive world map that 's on the floor takes up the whole floor and there 's different pictures of different cultures and different people around the room and what the young people do is they can actually take a photo of themselves hook it up to a helium balloon and let it go in this area and the point of that is just to show that they 're part of something bigger the second area is the right your story have an impact and that 's a really cool area what happens if they write a story about different questions that are asked personal stories stories about someone else and those stories while should be published into a book along with different photos that were taken from tonight so voice to make a difference and to share their thoughts share their opinions on different things that not only happen in townsville but around the world as well we can start over so it 's a great event we put on like bring you all the news into one place into a drug and alcohol-free environment to just get together and have some fun let loose oh those in have you know everything on the head little Street sports a huge heart box has never worked in love the variety of we 've had questioned 415 up come tonight so you can switch them which is being really young people have a voice and sometimes they heard and some we really want to make sure in the way that we gonna cuz young people that they always feel like they value they feel like they 're so long and they feel like they can speak up when they have something good to share and maybe if they even have things that they 're you know confused about or have questions on or even struggling with and so our voice our people to be able to share whatever it is and then on the other side it 's also helping them to know that they are the ones that can make a difference so if they want to change something in their lives they want to see something different or if they want to grow then it 's up to them as well to make that impact let 's do something about it so the W know we 're here we 're listening we want to know what 's going on you also have the power you also can make a change you also have the choice to do something with your lives collective shout is a grassroots organization that 's against the sexualization of women and girls in the media so it really looks at sort of entertainment 's and magazines and things like that advertisements as well as sort of how we were spoken about in the news and things like that starts a new expression buzz buzz portray it 's-- so Melinda came to towns women spoke to the community here and we just felt there was a of us started up about a year ago and we 've just been putting the group together since then and this is our sort of first big event as collective shark Townsville so we started off with meetings and things just to see you know could we do we have the resources to do this you know the people we need and all that sort of stuff so we have a few meetings and between all of us we 've all had different contacts and it 's it 's been great so with the help of birth their grant from the council City Council as well for youth like that 's really what was the driving force and what I 've got a school into here basically so so the film really focuses on how women and girls are portrayed in the media what stands out to me from the film was how especially women in politics are more scrutinized for what they look like as opposed to men in politics we just felt that message is important i think a lot of the times it in society maybe it i think this really brings it to life and maybe watching something you think hey maybe that 's not okay so there is no appreciation for women intellectual is all about the body not hungry matter what you say you never come o best the information has been very real and probably a little bit too close to hug but yeah just very informative and true it 's just really excited that there was an event supporting like feminism and women actually be able to do things in positions of power so I just thought I that 's a really great positive way to like sir I really wanted to sort it he wants to change the rules and again and I 'm not gonna complain too afraid live what I won 't tell master front then change my may yeah I 'm really encouraged by the responses and the questions and just the interest in general after the movie and after Melinda 's presentation the questions that were asked of the panel I think people were you know probably a shocked by a lot of the content but i about how do we make a change and how do we get involved which runs a weekly youth program every friday night during the school term we do have a bit of contact with young people that either know of someone or aren 't personally involved in youth crime and we just wanted to do something more than just providing that program for them the main purpose is to raise awareness and empower the young people to speak out and stand up if they knows are the people that are probably pressuring them in to do things that they wouldn 't normally do we would have disowned it on a low budget probably would have gone a little more low-key with it if we didn 't get the funding but getting the funding and the support from the City Council just allowed us to really take it to a whole nother level the events being amazing we 've had lots of people get up in the panel and speak their different opinions and even views on the crime that 's happening here in the city I liked how youth focused at them but they got to have their own voice and opinion Youth Week is one of the best ideas by government has because it really puts a highlight on on youth nationally we hold all these events where we can we can we can lift like young people up and encourage them to like show their talent show their skills no shown we 're all not just walking the streets at night looking for trouble then I can 't bring up bring up issues like this mental health you know can we have anything during this week again give them a voice let them tell us that they are good people you know we 've got a few again in any situation you get a very small minority that spoil it for the rest so I think yeah celebrate I 'll use my length and speak up letting us what I think I 'm hoping that young people take away from this event so they can make a difference that they have influence and that you know they realize how significant they are to their peers and they use is an annual nuke week event this is its third year we were supposed to run in youth week but unfortunately cycle and I too came and so we 've just been running it tonight jus the idea is to bring young people together to showcase their like various skills so we do lots of stuff at the other people around the community throughout the year and then we get them to tell us what they want to see in the event and then we make that happen so we work with young people to make it happen we actually get young people involved every step of the way so that 's kind of operation X in a nutshell we 've been invited to do some skateboard demonstrations and some kids and tricks and it 's gone really well been a it 's really amazing to see how the community actually put something like this together the importance of having someone like drawing boards come here is when you 're in a regional area and there 's not a lot of opportunity for just engage youth to find other activities region here so there 's a place where you can go at any time and do something they want so we can build the confidence and these young people and teach them some tricks and also give that opportunity on the mentors to be able to be escapable coach and you know via skateboarder and do demonstrations the things that weren 't possible before we came here you know we 're dealing with a lot of different people and you 'd than all different age brackets and communities and cultures and I feel that our voice our impact is about who standing up and being a part of stuff they enjoy it you know standing up for themselves and making a difference in the community and choosing the things that they want to do instead of being told what to do and I think that 's really important because these people are can have open minds and I still allowed to make decisions within the community young people quite often don 't have a very sort of loud voice when it comes to dealing with politicians and government and media that I try to do with the youth network is be a bit of a conduit between the young people and and the broader community to let the community know that there 's young people out there doing really cool stuff and then are all stealing cars and breaking into houses and doing naughty things which is what a lot of young people get recognition for especially in our community we focus on a really sort of small percentage of young people doing so naughty stuff and not so much on good stuff so it 's something that I 've tried to do is try and focus on the good stuff young people doing and get it out there as much let hair repeating a piece that just says operation X and it 's like the letters for from the sky the skulls around there 's like dollar balancing any day that I get to paint it just cheers me okay yeah a friend of mine Keegan woodhall we came together one day we brainstorm some ideas on how we could get the positive vibe from the skatepark out to and they thought it was a great idea we had a meeting brain still a little more than proposed idea to town to City Council and from there we 've got the funding to make the video it 's called skate of mind at our all the youth and towns will use a skate park and how it all come together to create I get some family for a long time I guess not just in Townsville throughout the world the skate parks have over negative either that or how people see the kids in there it 's a very big stereotype about you know everyone 's at the skatepark doing bad things that they shouldn 't be there waiting school or the down okay part trying to steal stuff get the fight so the film 's more about trying to show the positive side of the skatepark that not everyone down there is to start fights or wax cool we 're down there to have fun and I guess just do our own thing and stay out of people 's way council City Council helps a lot actually with and if we didn 't have that sort of a person we couldn 't do the video at all biggest thing was a fisheye lens that really helped us I 'll run to bring sort of like a traditional I guess skate video into the clip as well so official eyes are major part of you know skate clips so it was pretty cool to bring that sort of feel into it we also got some tripods microphones and lights that helps a lot with the interviews the female voice that impacts what it means to me is it sort of like that the kids in the community I guess that you get to have a say now in what they want to see and what they want to have happen in the community and they have their own saying a lot of agendas now sir Oh skating 's good life it 's really healthy flee mentally and physically it keeps you fit some ways it makes you stronger like you 're pulling off all the time you sort of just pick yourself back up again and try try again everyone 's like a family to skate park everyone looks out for each other if there 's something that goes wrong whether it 's at the skate park at home everyone 's go eat other 's backs might not be in a fight that we 're always there for each other no matter what my project about music Sarge ancona I got the idea from just hanging out with my friends they 're all users and I love listening to them and comparing them and all that and I thought it 's a really good idea for kids out there to be influenced by music and maybe I if they can be influenced by me and my jam corner I can help them some way by giving them this opportunity so in my gym corner event we 've got guitar lessons but we 're giving away and I think we 're doing a couple drum lessons as well from iron drummer I 've met Rachel through the youth Network um she holds very rarely I suppose you could call it a geek called untitled and well I just started going on from there we SAT there down spoke about it and we speak about the people that we both knew right and vice versa and narrow down the list of people that we wanted in well considering it can pay my volunteers and I 've been able to you know come up with the idea of guitar lessons giving away a guitar and all that that really helped a lot and then also with the advertising sorry it was a great help right for one fun thing it 's all about young people and try to show them what they can do with music organized today was the skate screwed BMX demos so that was pretty cool so organizing the local demo is was pretty hard because I didn 't actually know everyone that I got to organize I mostly went around to the different skate parks and after the kids who they thought was the best and asked them to give me some names and numbers and stuff and then I rang the people the event was postponed so I actually don 't have the same people that I awesome and went well everyone showed up so I was impressed with that the idea came about because Rachel let me know about operation axe and the create your own Youth Week thing so I was like cool I think it 'd be a good idea to have some local demos and stuff happening because we don 't really have many skate demos or screw demos or BMX demos and council and it 's kind of sad because a lot of people actually just move away and try and further their skating or BMX career over there because there 's not much happening here all they just quit and they just work instead I see me coming from the same friends constantly talking and whinging about it also we do actually have some pretty good talent in townsville so I think it 's worth you know supporting that and showcasing it regularly so keeps happening and aspiring young kids to come and do the same thing our voice our impact means a lot to me because I think a lot of the youth don 't really feel like they can hearing so to give them an opportunity to display that with other kids and adults and stuff going on as well as council City Council 's funding helped just for recognition of the challenge that we do have here the fact that they 're being paid makes a huge difference to them I think the best way to celebrate people in Townsville is holding events like this where they can all come and do their thing and feel appreciated for it one word to describe you well that 's a really good question fun oh yeah awesome awesome future energy one word passionate yes future is probably a pretty good word like I think that when we 're gone believes i 'm behind and they 're going to be better than us and what we did so i would say is the word you Oh _"

    "text": "I 'm Vicki Salisbury and I 'm the director of umbrella studio on flinders West well I describe the arts as a huge surprise probably from people from the outside who wouldn 't be expecting the vibrancy the diversity the longevity the stability and the sophistication of the Arts in Townsville I think there 's something like 200 arts organizations so we 've got terrific theater we 've got many dance companies we have youth arts visual arts and specialist in Visual Arts with the water colorist group and fibers and fabrics specializing in textiles writers with filmmakers a new media artists and individuals who are developing their own exciting projects probably the biggest change in the arts over the last decade would it be when James Cook University discontinued teaching and delivering visual arts in Townsville and that started in about 2008 and I believe many of the arts organizations would see the consequences of that we 're at least at umbrella we were hosting exhibitions for for graduates of visual arts every year and multiple exhibitions and that has stopped because there really aren 't that graduates coming because uni we want to have young exciting visual artists in our region and that that 's been a big change that said what do you do about it and I believe that a lot of the high schools have picked up some of that slack and that there are great teachers and visual art teachers in our in our high schools those students then go on to maybe they might have to leave Townsville if they want to pursue visual arts but often they 'll continue to do it as a hobby I think to Townsville more and more groups have started up and we 're in the early days we 're talking about say the 80s and 90s umbrella studio and purse Tucker and the Townsville art society would have been pretty much it now there are many many individual groups who have gone on to specialize and and that 's quite exciting and good you well historically umbrella has played a very significant role being the first and only contemporary art space north of Brisbane when it 's started in 86 and of course its history is started umbrella and we 've grown from strength to strength with now a director and a board of management and being a key triennial funded organization from arts Queensland and the Australia Council but that power of knowing that five artists who had a vision and stuck to that really gives you that it impact it 's that empowering optimism that individuals can make a change and they did in Townsville umbrella certainly would have launched the career of most of the artists that are practicing in Townsville and in the region and the biggest point of difference I think currently with umbrella is that we have our studio downstairs so there 's a significant lack of places for artists to actually make work and especially that now there is no prints to do at jcu and so we have acquired the sum of those presses and we 've dedicated a significant amount of our space to printmaking and to studio based activities with the workshops and so as far as developing artists and in our aim is develop artists at quite a high level not a weekend fun event but our aim is to develop artists at quite a professional level and we do that with them workshops with artists talks and bringing artists into the area to speak and well more and more umbrella is looking to expand our brand grow our brand we 've done that in a number of ways online compact prints which is an international exhibition and this year very very exciting we 've been invited to take an exhibition of Gayle mabo who is a local Tory Strait island artist and very highly respected celebrity really and she 's created almost 30 works and we will exhibit those at the Australian High Commission in Singapore that came about through our relationship with James Cook University so not only is Gail opening an exhibition and we 'll go together that 's on the 11th of June that exhibition will be up through August but she is also unveiling two major public art commissions at the jcu campus and she 'll be giving an artist talk at jcu and at the High Commission but what 's so exciting about this too is developing that relationship our local council the state government you know that Queensland and particularly Townsville has an artist 's of note that are being acknowledged in Asia and that allows us to expand our reach from Townsville and so this isn 't a very very exciting first step in exposing our artists representing our artists in rekik wit reconciliation because this is also about nate off day and for the first time the australian singapore government is acknowledging Eddie Mabo and his contribution to the history of this country with this combination of a neigh doc and ma bday celebration so it 's really really a great opportunity and I 'm very proud that our board has allowed us to take this risk and Gamble and take a big exhibition to Singapore and I really believe it will pay off for Gail and for Townsville for many years I 've been struggling to forward an agenda of an arts precinct in Townsville look funding is getting tighter and tighter this year umbrella lost a significant amount of funding from the state government as did most every visual arts organization in the state community and our local government sees the significance of what could be lost if we do not ban together pull our resources and become quite smart and sophisticated about the Arts there is a good chance we will continue to lose these key organizations and a big big opportunity Townsville is a sophisticated City if it is really truly the capital of North Queensland then we have got to embrace the Arts and create an arts economy in order to keep our arts here and to grow the arts look it 's obvious if we 're taking work into Singapore if we have compact prints show and we 've got almost 200 artists from 22 countries wanting to participate that there is a that arts can link not only Townsville to domestically to end domestic tourism but to the world and business has to also participate it 's not just about government I think when we see the land seany development with the laneways we can see clearly a smart businessman who 's aligning himself to the identity of a Melbourne laneway to Townsville and sees that there is an support and we need more of that in Townsville we 've got to have an arts precinct we just do the regional gallery can 't_''_576.83 grow in the space that it 's in and if we cannot grow as arts organization we can 't generate an increase in revenue and that I believe with funding to develop a good business case we can put forward that it is economically viable and good for the city very good for the city I guess well my final thought would be I want to acknowledge the regional gallery and Shane particularly for this opportunity to put forward my ideas and my hopes and vision for the Arts and I also want to say how wonderful it is to be able to work collaboratively with the regional gallery as well as the other arts organizations and I 'm really had a great opportunity here and thank you very much _"

    "text": "look my name 's Sarah gartrell I 'm a counselor for towns or city council and then I 'm born and bred here in townsell and very proud of that fact yeah look it was a Donna benningfield was the artist and I came to know Donna very well from attending summer exhibitions and in fact I opened one of her exhibitions for her so I got to know her and John and the family very well and I certainly humbled and surprised when she when she approached me to to be in the Percival 's and do a portrait of me and not being an art lover but but loving art and the vibrant scene we 've got here in Townsville and supporting that obviously said said yes and we went through a strong process that that included obviously meeting with Donna a number of times she actually came around to my house i SAT for her a couple of times she took a lot of photos and in fact one of the one of the portraits that she did initially was with my dog Lily a golden retriever the dog may take it away from the portrait so she went back and and did a portrait just of myself um I think I like the one with the dog better bedtime so it was a process where I also went to Donna 's house and had a look what she was putting together and I thought it was a fantastic result well I didn 't sit for too long it was who they were short short periods and as I say that they didn 't take too long it was probably more the conversation between the two of us and then when I went round to her particular residence I suppose she she she she SAT me SAT me at that stage so they 're only short periods most of it was with the photography look I I was humbled basically I you know you look around at all the portraits that were there and they were just some phenomenal artists and phenomenal people and and to be part of that was just amazing and you know I there 's a process you go through with it whether so to be in that sphere was was just just amazing and quite humble shame well I think it comes back to people basically you 're talking about in a lot of instances people who are in the in our community not only people from from down south and the Percival 's you know what a great showcase for town so you know we 've got artists and people doing portraits from people down south and bringing them up so to me it 's about the people and you can relate to that you know you go there and you see you know pictures there of the Brigadier and Sandra Harding and these leaders in our community and you can relate to it and and you 're looking at the portrait and and you 're trying to you 're interpreting a certain way that might be the same as the artists usually it 's not they 've got their own interpretation and isn 't that a fantastic process to go through and you when you go to a you know a lecture on on what the artist is trying to more dimensions for you so it 's about the people that 's about trying to capture what those people are about and relating to them and those portraits you know from from other areas of Australia normally you know those people and if you don 't you find out so it 's about the people and the relationship that you 've got to them and and trying to understand what they 're all about and peeling back those layers and saying what what 's the artist trying to capture what is this person all about I think it 's just just amazing it 's it 's fantastic absolutely fantastic that the Percival 's and the portraits that you see and I courage everyone to come along and envelope Percival and the photographic competition no that is being held in conjunction with the Percival is extremely important for Townsend we have got a vibrant creative art scene here in townsell and that needs to be nurtured and fostered having said that it gives the local artists an opportunity but it also takes Townsville and our city to queensland australia and the of these exhibitions competitions and initiatives and and we need we need more of them they are the lifeblood for townsell because we we can get people to come to townsell they can understand that we are a city that 's growing we 're maturing and we have got a great arts and cultural scene I 'm not an artist but but I thought I love the art scene I will continue to support support the arts because of I believe I understand the importance of art and culture to any city and and if you look at Richard Florida 's book the rise of the creative class and you have a read of that it gives you a strong understanding of how powerful that can be I do give my time generously and and I 'm I should be doing that all councillors should be doing that that to me is part of our role is to get out there in the community and support our artists as we know being in the hardest is a pretty tough job you know the stats I 've seen is that look make a good living out of it now that means that the majority are doing it because they love it and they 're passionate about and and that comes back to community so i 'll continue to to be involved as much as i can and i always if i can invite i always try to attend if I can 't make it as usually a prior commitment so look fully supportive not an artist love the art scene and will continue to support it and I know we 've got some grand plans for you know our tubs and and those things are bubbling along in the background and I 'm sure that if we can take that art scene to the next level here in Townsville we can make it a bigger a huge mark across Australia for our arts and cultural scene here in town and more importantly for the city foot for the the viability and the economical benefit of the city from from the art scene _"

    "text": "sustainability is one of those terms that 's actually misused a fair bit and i think it 's gets a loss a little bit in confusion about stereotypes about what it is but i 've actually thought that a lot of it comes back to the word itself so the ability to sustain yourself with what you have rather than what you think you might need for everybody sustainability means something different and everyone 's doing it for different reasons some people want to help protect the environment others it 's about their family it 's about comfort the the challenge is that we 're trying to find a way to get a lot of people to understand sustainability and to become engaged by it the reason i 've sorted out the information is because i have an interest in it so i think that 's one of the major obstacles to getting people to engage with sustainability is that they must find it interesting they must find something about it which affects their lifestyle or improves their lifestyle it 's about providing a lifestyle which is comfortable and affordable that 's the perfect place to start you can look at putting on say for instance a white roof rather than a black one because that 'll stop a lot of heat gain which means when you come home in the afternoon you don 't have to turn your aircon to 17 degrees you can set it on 25 and have the fan on and you 're saving huge amounts of running costs on air conditioning so we try to encompass five components or six components of sustainability in a lot of our designs so that crosses over between designs the types of products you choose its impact on energy its impact on water and then other items like healthy house so what are the products being used in your house and how they 're going to affect your health and then lastly one for all the boys which is technology so you know how can we encompass technology to make you make your lifestyle better and hopefully sustainable along the way so i 've been involved in a project with a local builder darren finlay called innovation house and industry environmental products and services the council and many many more in looking at how we can build houses that provide us with information on where we live we 've tried to embrace lot of these learnings and and say let 's just design a house that 's not a treehouse and it 's not a spaceship it 's just a house that everyone can afford and everyone can enjoy and then try and add sustainable aspects to it we are in a dry tropics area in towson which means we have particular climatic conditions that affect us and if you design your house well for this environment you can have a high performance house by spending nothing other than using your brain i think one of the important things is that everyone finds a way to embrace sustainability that 's what we 're hoping maybe the innovation house allows people to be able to engage with sustainability in a way that they can enjoy and have fun with and interact with townsville city council has the city solar project and that was all about uncovering energy related behaviors within or building a new one in terms of becoming energy efficient and we actually found 240 things that people in townsville can do to become energy efficient i think the biggest step we will take forward in sustainability is engaging everyone in the idea and the concept that it can be done it can be done very easily it can be done without a lot of stress it can be done without a lot of expense and you as a person can be a hell of a lot better off for enjoying sustainability and then if the final outcome is the planet 's better off because of it that 's just a byproduct of you enjoying the lifestyle that goes with it so i think the main thing that i say is to use your brain go out and learn about and engage about it and you 'll find that it 's actually quite fun working together collaborating across a community so that everyone 's interests are heard and that you can work on them together and that 's the best way forward for sustainability and it 's the only special space that we do have the ability to be able to impact on a lot of people 's lives in the future for sure you _"

    "text": "from townsville humble beginnings in 1864 to the present day the city has experienced a growth rate that rivaled other centers in the north John Melton black employed by Robert towns at Woodstock station dispatched andrew ball mark wat read and a small party of aboriginals to search for a site where a suitable port could be established balls party reached the mouth of ross creek in april 1864 setting up a camp below the rocky spur of Melton hill near the present customs house on the Strand after further exploration of the surrounding area ball returned to Woodstock station and reported discovery of a favorable site for the settlement so townsville was born and with it came the construction of some of the iconic resonances many of which are still standing today early construction of buildings in Townsville fell to two main firms tunbridge architects and local hardware merchants rooney Company the firm owes its establishment to the work and foresight of three young Irishman named Bruni with the biblical Christian names of john jacob and matthew renowned local historian and published author dr. dorothy gibson wild explains the construction of Townsville the first firm we 're not quite sure where it was that open in eighteen seventy two and they moved down further down his Flinders Street and that was the major factory for furniture money-making and also for building construction and they also had a timber mill there but it was too small so then they transferred to railway estate and it was there that so much of the timber for North Queensland houses and public buildings whatever that was milled and they would bring your logs in from all over the place including in from the west coast of America they 'd bring logs in and they would be cut into timber whatever so as a timber they had different milling machines and that was done on in that mule later on South row where state rather and in his blender Street earlier and then of course they moved into prefabrication and they were the earliest firm in North Queensland to make prefabricated buildings prior to that they all came from the south tequila from year ago so Rooney 's were a very important firm and local resident Jerry Reeves has been working as a carpenter in Townsville for over 70 years he prides himself in keeping traditional skills alive in his Garbutt workshop Jerry you were born here in town from the 1928 morning mackillop street melvin gardens tangible and you 've worked on the tools as it happened to join it for about 17 years now disabil just about as well and your dad before you it started the business you know first a febrile 1931 and you were telling me about the machinery in you move most of the machinery to this about 25 years ago Sean when you 're dead come on the lab well rigidly the old workshop we had two babies that drove the whole workshop through light shafts and the ceiling with milk feed now the Hitman machine every machine from 80 other day when I shifted out here every every machine have to be motorized it was a pretty good job but a lot of them so a lot of the machinery in the shed today is about 80 and 90 so that 's some of them be you still work on all those machines and Sean and you do all the mortise and tenon joints and everything the way that we 've done properly well the valve machinery those who say it 's it 's just as good as Evan you got the teller machine that cuts the tender machine cuts the Tenon 's you have a mortise machine because the mortising you 've got the spindle boulders that mold it for whatever shape you might want to be doing with us joinery or moldings and it 's virtually the same as what they will the new stuff is that is just not as modern but it does just as good a job but all the material we used was northern northern soft words mostly silky oak or maple the best best rule of the trade Paisley a bitter cedar which worked very hard to get at the time they cut it all out and many years before that and I 've the argues silky oak lewdly just about ever since i started my apprenticeship at fifteen i did a normal five years course and then a religion like that and table and six years or six and a half years something like that where the boys today if they 've done a scene with only do threes and they don 't live in anything we have to do it and do it properly oh you didn 't_''_344.479 we did not the job they sort of the Rivera well there 's nobody to handed down fortunately there 's nobody had handed them my youngest son is a is a fitter and Turner virtually the template General Hospital is maintenance there and my eldest boys are contact of electrician there 's nobody to follow me on what happens then I don 't know mortise and tenon joints were a key component in the construction of early buildings in Townsville today we are going to see how these joints are made using a combination of hand and electric tools first the timber is selected for the straightness of the grain and the carpenter carefully avoids sections with knots and other imperfections the timber is then marked out using a pencil and square then the whole or mortise is roughly drilled deep enough to accommodate the tenant after the holes have been drilled to the required depth the remainder of the waste material is removed using a 25 millimeter chisel after the rough work has been completed the mortars has given a final trim to ensure the tenon fits tightly now the waters is complete it is time to mark out the tenon which forms the other half of the joint once again we use the square ruler and pencil to mark the cuts you next a handsaw is used to remove the waste material from around the tenon now that the two halves of the joint have been completed it 's time to put the two halves together a perfect fit now all that remains is to glue and nail the joint for years of reliability most heritage properties in the North features some sort of decorative wood turning in their design the addition of these ornaments is said to harken back to colonial English days and the concept of share farming share farming was big business in Old England if you were lucky enough to own a manor it pay so portions of land were given to peasants to farm and in return they received a share of the crop to sell and therefore ensure survival problem was that share farming peasants weren 't always grateful for this often inequitable relationship they stayed poor as the lord of the manor grew fat and wealthy he didn 't want these workers to get any ideas about land redistribution so he ruled his miniature kingdom with an iron fist if someone broke the law on the estate the Lord would exact retribution execution was a favorite form of punishment severing heads who handed the eighth and his wives was once in vogue but the Lord wanted everyone passing by to feel his wrath so he took the head dipped it in hot tar and impaled it on a stake in some high-profile location the roof of the manor was a prime position therefore a suitable stake had to be manufactured to display the heads of the wrongdoers the ball shaped finial or acorn perhaps display more vividly the original finial and the addition of a badly behaved peasant head in architecture however no colonial property is considered complete without one or more of these wooden features in place replacement of these decorations is a fairly simple process it utilizes a straightforward measuring process and then some skillful turning on a wood laid let 's have a look at the process involved in manufacturing a set of replacement finials first accurate measurements are taken of the existing finial and transferred to a plastic template then timber is selected centered and placed between the centers on the lathe in earlier times lathes would have been powered by a foot pedal with the rotational speed being governed by the leg strength of the operator now a modern electric blade completes the task with only a little effort required by the operator once the timber is selected it is inserted in the lathe centered and the turning begins you you you you after the turning and sanding is complete the Acorn finial is ready for painting and refitting to the stairway next we move on to the remanufacturing of the roof top finial you bye with the final sand the roof top finial is properties in North Queensland suffer from exposure to the elements by utilizing traditional skills and more modern machinery replacement components can be manufactured to keep the houses in good repair today we 're going to manufacture a timber veranda bracket the first step is to trace the design of the veranda bracket onto paper and then select suitable timber once again the timber should be clear of knots and imperfections next carbon paper is used to transfer the design to the timber when the tracing is complete the carbon paper and the template is removed to reveal the timber marked up ready for cutting the cutting out of the design is now ready to begin in earlier days a manual pedal-powered scroll saw may have been used to complete the cutting out of the design now an electric scroll saw completes the cutting with ease holes are drilled to facilitate the internal cuts and the cutting out begins you once all the cutouts have been completed the bracket is ready for sanding painting and installation you _"

    "text": "oh this is a row row wewe Smith it 's a portrait of Brian piece who 's he in the role he 's an actor must be an actor in the role of Colonel Pickering now this is this just comes back to the first issue I was talking about using photography as a basis for painting but in this case the scale of the figure is so good it 's it 's a painterly scale life a life size scale and the technique of painting is very smooth there 's no evidence of the brushwork so and I said that you know a painting shouldn 't base itself on photography unless it can do something that photography cannot do this actually is an exception to it it 's it 's a very photographic image a technique it 's very smooth so there 's no sense of the texture or that all that all that all the touch of a hand yet the way that it 's been proportioned and the lighting I find quite entrancing and I keep coming back to it so it works it 's this artist which I wouldn 't normally be very sympathetic to because I want to see a little bit of them many air the paint that the paint you know that the Braille of the pain which is the magic of painting it 's not there at all it 's very smooth almost like a watercolor effect but the pose is wonderful the lighting is wonderful the placement of the figure the negative shapes are not dead and that 's a big risk when you do this you if you have dead negative shapes in the background this can kill the whole painting no matter how well the portrait is painted but this one has just it just works that 's that that 's about all I can say about it this this is the en Smith painting i was i was talking about it it 's so full of energy this I believe is painting by his daughter so doesn 't there 's a nice is that true please please nice ah nice okay I 've noticed a actually quite somebody 's been quite clever and referencing ancient themes this figure two figures it makes it quite interesting but the problem is in having the set a similar painting style to her uncle this figure is not quite anchored but I 'm intrigued by it I mean look if I 'm picking fault with paintings it doesn 't mean I don 't like the paintings I mean I I love actually getting up close and and hitting the point where are the inexplicable and the inexplicable is is I still like it even though I 'm making these criticisms because it 's just so full of energy and I love this cat which the White has a white front and against the white background is almost like a the Alice in Wonderland here the cat that 's kind of appearing out of nowhere and it 's going to disappear perhaps but there is a there is a problem of gravity in the fact that this figure is a very classical pose and are supposed to be lying and you can feel a pressure on the wrists under there so therefore there is gravity but the gravity is not reflected the rest in pushing the gestures around you know it 's so there 's a sort of a you know between the Apollonian approach depending which is classical stable gravity verticals structure and the Dionysian aspect of penning which is just enjoying the color and the riot of gesture she 's sort of somewhere awkwardly in the middle classical at Apollonian but around here it 's Dennis iam it 's really getting drunk on the pain so anyone folks just an interesting just look at this painting here by Matilda Michelle which is Calder it 's a flood subject and it shows that I think it 's a self-portrait of the artist standing in a room with her feet in water and she was a response to the floods that have been happening up in northern Queensland so not literally a flood painted down in Melbourne so its a conceptual response to North Queensland but i think it 's it 's a delicious painting very dark in tone nice buttery paint and it 's all integrated the whole pictures integrated perfectly the figure belongs to the background so there 's a nice favourite bit is actually the fifth the fish she 's holding a fish in her hand and it 's got the shiny kind of scales and he can almost feel and taste that fish that she 's holding on to now somebody told me that artists put in for this prize anticipating the art the judges taste and someone has assumed that i will be in an admirer of bill robinson and bill Robinson won the Archibald Prize once with himself as a fisherman with all these fish standing in the water so they 've pounded as artists thought maybe that would give me a positive kind of response to that well I do have a positive response to that not because of Bill Robertson but I think it 's a very good picture I don 't know much about her but it was one that I was actually considering perhaps putting up and maybe give it giving it the prize but for one reason another the Kevin Lincoln nudged its way ahead the more I looked the pictures you have to give paintings time you can 't have an painting they change paintings change the lighting changes your mood changes you might have a bad day you 're coming at a painting all look different you 've got to give them time and if you like a painting straight away you have that 's that 's a point of doubt if they know I 'll come back and see if it still looks good tomorrow and the day after and that 's why you have to go back to museums like this and revisit paintings they always give out something a little different that 's the wonderful thing about public art museums you can actually get more and more out of very good paintings that they just feed the tease you they feed themselves out to you some of the tenuous pneus is quite interesting the one here I know you know I do know about this this one here it 's a Russian a person who was briefly in Townsville and this painting here caught by the good woman but forgotten her name and she calls it these people are not in Townsville that 's the Russian one of fact that lovely joke you know but to actually Scott it 's not too bad it 's it 's it 's it 's a bit it 's a bit you know it 's got a few weaknesses in here but I really like this figure here looking back you know where the light shining on the hat and the blue shadow and then the back of the year so it 's not it 's not too bad not too bad at all but I want to bring you into this next space and just talk about a couple of pictures I 've taken my HD fancy damage but I didn 't want to talk about this one because I talked about Ian Smith 's nice painting down that Etruscan type of lot figure lying in the middle of the image this reminds me very much of our great seventeenth-century Italian pentacle Danny bellaire karachi whose work I recently saw in Italy in a couple of museums and Karachi was part of the Baroque era but he shocked his contemporaries in the critics by painting real people and particularly a in very natural poses just people off the street and he put them into his religious subjects like it might be the man knocking the nails and the you know in the cross it was the Christ being crucified but it was it was a man to stop the street and he painted a butcher a wonderful painting of a butcher shop which is in the Christchurch collection oxford university and he just used characters that were really were working in a butcher shop and and his figures he did these individual naked male figures one of them is actually in the National Gallery of Victoria it 's hanging there right now where he did this contrapposto and he got them to sit in a chair and do something smoking or whatever they were drinking from a glass or something and this paint this painting actually reminds me very much of an Ebola karate style I think it 's a bit silly and a bit of seeing I mean I think I don 't know what the point doing that is it 's like is he having got me the so it 's a bit like a portrait of the bird rather than the man and so but it 's actually quite it 's quite a it 's quite a good quite a good painting and the way it 's arranged you know with the shapes and everything is quite lively right across the whole picture but the one that intrigues me is this one is portrait by I name 's Veronica k and it 's I think it 's her husband and and I I thought about this only because the other morning I read the paper and I saw that Edward monk painting that fetched 216 million father 's the screen and Edward book was the was the epitome of the psychological landscape you know that you have the screaming figure you know which is in agony and that but the image of the psyche projects out into the sky is incredible sky and the jetty going back in the background has come you know Riven with anxiety and all about is about this art is not always about the pleasant experience you know the lovely landscape the know is that is our entree into aspects of the human condition and aspects of life that we wouldn 't normally address it it and it puts it into an aesthetic form which allows it to be palatable it 's quite interesting the Francis Bacon paints the most you know kind of confronting kind of subjects and here he imbued with sort of elegance planted a Francisco Goya painting the disasters of war I mean a horrendous thing of the others of the Spanish of the the persecution of the French by the of the Spanish by the French horrendous but yet they have a mysteriously beautiful and by putting violence into the realm of beauty it allows us to then fit it into the scheme of things of how we understand life and explain why life isn 't always the way we want it to be so when I when I saw this monk image in the paper i saw this i thought it just gives me the same feeling i think it has this intense of integration across the whole picture you know that it 's quite it dripping paint but the rest of the space has been has the certain density of a psychological kind of statement about this person and and I think it 's a really really good work of art you know it 's strong and and every time I walk past it 's looking better and better and and and I ask myself when I can 't answer all these questions I don 't know what works about last and some don 't i don 't know all the answers but but i do know it is something to do with a sense of something that it 's integrated that the poem from beginning to end that the end and the beginning makes sense and they connect up and it 's exactly the same of the painting the background the subject the composition everything makes sense it makes a kind of logic it 's quite it 's quite a violent you know done but it 's very very very very powerful like i haven 't got much to say about other other things he accepted it 's just a wonderful kind of diversity enjoy this exhibition you 've now got to stop thinking about all the stuff I 've been telling you because I 've been kind of like moving towards really kind of an ascetic standard by which I judge works of art I don 't what think that everybody should share my judgment necessarily but I try and bring a kind of a wisdom to it from long experience and no and I don 't want to compare art to sport and we were a sporting nation and that 's why we have lots of competition art competitions but I 'm looking for the marathon runner I 'm looking for the art that is going to carry its content into time and speak to another generation and if the aesthetics are right and they 're strong and all the balance is there that 's that 's the secret if someone 's got another agenda for making a work of art there are the risk of just being part of our moment moments fashion an artist should never look at what 's fashionable they should speak they should paint from their heart important but also get the aesthetic kind of rules right know what it is that make something last _"

    "text": "firstly i 'm pleased to present the 2012 2011-12 budget for the Townsville city council a budget that sees this council delivering on its promise to bring the city back in the surface our city 's financial position has vastly improved and today 's budget completely wipes out the 56 million dollar operating deficit that the council inherited after amalgamation in 2008 the last time the towns of City Council presented balance books was more than a decade ago I don 't apologize for being focused on ensuring that the council has a clear and unhindered path forward to fiscal stability our disciplined financial management over the last three years has paid off and make no mistake a lot of difficult decisions were necessary to turn around the council 's primm financial position efficiencies and ongoing savings within our organisation have certainly reap rewards our success has been echoed by the director general of the department of local government and planning in a letter this week he recognised council City Council 's strong financial position one that will further strengthen as we increase our surpluses and reduce our debt levels pride today in congratulating all of our counselors and staff who have joined me on this journey this is a terrific achievement that you have achieved you have also helped to deliver it a full year earlier than predicted in a nutshell this council has done the hard yards and rescued the city from potential bankruptcy when we look at the bigger picture we can note that the state and federal governments went into the global financial crisis three years ago with huge surpluses they have emerged with enormous deficits and in contrast this council went into the GFC paced amalgamation carrying large losses despite the biggest boom city 's boom years the city has ever seen a council and our staff have achieved what both state and federal are yet to do balance their books and end frivolous and inefficient spending this year the council 's direct operating expenses have gone down by over 9 million dollars a four percent improvement compared to 2010 2011 in spite of rising electricity costs and additional expense to operate new water and sewage plants and there is plenty more good news in question firstly how much will our residents pay this year the average general rates rise has been kept at a low one point nine eight percent across the board on general rates for owner-occupied homes well below the state CPI of three point six percent and well below the local government cost index of seven point five percent this year 's general rate rise is the second in succession at less than CPI general rates for a typical property with a valuation of 147 thousand dollars will increase by around 72 cents a week we will also return to combined rates and utility notices issued twice a year utilities will rise modestly with series going up from six hundred and thirty seven dollars to six hundred and sixty nine dollars and waist up one dollar to one hundred and ninety seven dollars or half a percent this will be offset for a majority of our residents with a return to the formal water pricing system sent on general rates or up to eight hundred dollars a year per homeowner to help keep people in their own homes there is good be cut to come in under four hundred million dollars at the 30th of jun 2012 that figure is significantly less than the half a billion dollars that was predicted during an alderman we have borrowed where necessary to fund crucial capital works for the benefit of the whole city planning ahead and spending on infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing community ensures that our city will remains strong well into the future so what 's next for Townsville City Council the last 12 months or are substantially complete our big five construction projects North Shore Boulevard Civic Theatre upgrades Flinders Street redevelopment the Townsville RSL Stadium and of course major water and sewage works their focus now shifts in coming years to our new top five priorities keeping rate rises to less than CPI Community Safety Building better local roads ongoing recovery from floods and weather events and excellence in community planning to maintain our envy of a lifestyle expended to this year invests heavily in rehabilitating and improving the essential building blocks of the city our roads our drainage water and our sewage we today release dollars to capital works for major upgrades to basic infrastructure this will lay the platform for the city 's next phase of growth in fact I can announce the biggest roadwork splits that the city has ever seen we have allocated 44.5 million dollars to Road reseals overlays and construction projects and we will be further bolstered by federal disaster recovery funding which will pump 50 million dollars into repair works in nearly every suburb for damage sustained in 2010 additional disaster funding of approximately 80 million

    "text": "[Music] michael a huge agenda today and first one uh first one off the rank was uh 22 mountain view drive shannon vale a redevelopment there that never got a chance it was knocked on the head yeah unfortunately this is another case and we 're they 're coming up more constantly and one of the reasons why we 're pushing to get the regional plan reassessed as well as and wanting to start to look at areas like this when it comes to our own plan you know blocks like this to me i personally think they are absolutely suitable for rural blocks you know it 's a 16 hectare block it 's way under the 40 hectare agriculture block it 's surrounded by properties that are already broken apart some down to 0.6 of a hectare we need housing we need housing stocks so we 're being you know unfortunately we have our hands tied you know and these things need to be changed as councillors you know we only have certain abilities and limits of power um the planning scheme is a guiding document and you know we have to be able to you know to break those planning scheme rules especially the state one there was an issue um as it was last year the year before when marieba was subdividing some land like that and they got a big slap across the hand by the state government and we 're told that 's it you can 't do it anymore it 's against the rural plan so you know it 's really important that we work with the state government um get this regional plan sorted as well and get our own plan you know fixing it as i said it 's a one size fits all shoe at the moment and that 's not the case there 's you know there 's been a couple of applications come through this year already and i know there 's more to come they 're all in the same boat they 've got these large rural blocks that aren 't big enough for cane paddocks they 're not big enough to run as a commercial farm but you know also they 're too small to run as too big for just having a residential property so as i said this block today it 's got 12 cows on it from what i saw um you know love lucky cows they 've got a great life and a fantastic paddock but you know that option that could be you know some rural blocks for houses and you know that 's stuff that we absolutely need in this shire so we need some action unfortunately red tape city as always yeah we 're having to battle through it okay and then we go to the resort complex port douglas road uh this just isn 't going nowhere well red tape city as we said here we go again you know unfortunately we have a planning scheme in place and as i said i was you know quite hard on the fact that this is only a new planning scheme you know this was only done in 2018 so you know the residents and ratepayers of the shire if they don 't believe that we 're doing the right thing by this planning scheme they should have spoke up you people need to actually acknowledge what we 're doing and participate so that we are doing what the majority wants rather than the ones that just constantly do put in submissions to um things like the painting scheme so we are stuck with the playing skin that we 've got you know it has very firm guidelines on what we can do and how we can do it and unfortunately this particular development sits well outside a lot of the provisions and the outcomes that are acquired by our planning scheme you know so to go against it we open ourselves up to lots of issues and as the planner said you know the parking you know that 's being provided is well under what the planning scheme um asks for and we could end up with cars the whole way down port douglas road you know parked on the grass areas you know where there 's not enough car parking provided so they 're things we have to look at you know you 've got the old qt resort and would you come into what that 's called now 've got oaks lagoon right next door they 've got buildings that come up to the right distance of their boundary and then they 'll suddenly have this 20 meter building right next door to their two-bedroom units or the little two-story units so yeah we have to compare those things and consider everyone and unfortunately it just didn 't fit in with that planning scheme and i certainly hope the developer can acknowledge where we 're coming from um and you know i certainly hope his dream of having a property that 's an exclusive luxury resort um doesn 't disappear completely well i 'm sure it 's going to look better than what it looks like at the moment it 's a bit of an eyesore now well unfortunately it 's been an eyesore for as long as i can remember you know the resort that was going to go in there of course when broke and it sat there with the concrete pillars for all these years um and has been nothing but an eye saw and so as i said you know when i first heard than a fairmont hotel i thought wow this is an absolute dream for a new mayor to have a quality development like this come through um but again unfortunately the red tape of the planning scheme and you know i was again quite hard in the meeting and the fact that i 've read some things on facebook over the weekend that were appalling absolutely appalling this is not the planning staff this is not close-minded idiots that don 't know what they 're doing and all the comments that were made these are very intelligent well-trained people that are assessing a planning scheme that was approved and they 're just giving the facts on that and we have to remember that and unfortunately it 's gone the way it has okay we move on to domestic violence or community housing unit development in mossman uh this is much needed it certainly isn 't something that as councilnolly said we 've been working on for quite some time um you know this the staff have done a great job in doing all the reports that were required to finally get put our party in we 've got the funding to build the facility and this is now putting out for the tenders to get the people to actually build it so hopefully in you know a short period we 'll have the facility built i believe it 's a three-bedroom unit and a two-bedroom unit and um we 'll be able to help some of these people that desperately need it at the moment you know these a lot of these ladies are shipped down to cairns and you know it 's not fair on the kids because they can 't go to the normal schools they 've got they 're not near their friends and they 're close family connections as well so they 're having to be you know it causes a lot of mental stress as well as the heartache they 're going through at the time so it 's so important we have something local that can assist and that 's just over 547 000 involved there 261 000 involved with a contract for sewerage pump station switchboard i know what a pump station is how moves moves things around and turns things on and on it 's sort of like an image it 's a thingamajig that we have to have and that 's the most important thing when it comes to sewage and all those types of things they are necessity i know they 're not pretty things that we like to talk about but they 're necessities and you know i think if the sewage wasn 't working we 'd certainly be hearing about it and that 's why we need to spend the money we do on these projects landfill waste cartridge and disposal and one of the councils i think was lisa scomazon said they just didn 't realize how much money is spent on you know getting crap away 900 000 million million bucks absolutely and this is the reason why everyone 's been pushing so hard on recycle reviews because we knew this was coming um the tip basically as we used to call it the refuge area um is full it 's as simple as that we can 't put any more rubbish there in december we have to the tip needs to be trucked somewhere else unfortunately with all the new epa rules and regulations and you know what the the government legislations are it 's impossible to open a new one um so we 're having to find alternative methods which is the one in the marieba that we 'll be using but everything has to be shipped there and that comes at a cost so you know we 're really going to be pushing hard with our message as far as the recycle reuse and you know unfortunately it does show in people 's rates bill when they see their waste bill it 's gone up quite substantially over the last couple of years because you know the state government 's been introducing these measures measures to make this happen so i really i recommend people as much as possible have a look at the document as lisa said it 's expensive to move rubbish so the less you have to put in that green bin the better you know if you can put in the compost put it in the compost if you can worthwhile take it to the scrap shack or a secondhand shop and resell it but you know clothing all those things re give them to charity shops they can be reused um claws shop at mossman well yeah i have to declare being the president not pausing clause i can 't just say them but all charity shops yeah absolutely and even if they they sometimes they 're a bit scrappy other places do take them and they cut them up and use them for rags for painters and all those things so they can be reused don 't put in the rubbish because you know that 's going to cost us all money for sure management plan wonga beach new beach cuya beach four mile beach oak beach uh lisa scomas on the deputy mayor was a little bit concerned here because once again we 'll use that phrase and not one size fits all you have to have re-vegetation but you have to do it sensibly and in all cases it 's it 's not re-vegetation yeah it it 's something that i had concerns with and i about that exact fact there 's areas that i know of that are windows as we call them that have been there since the 50s um and you know under this plan it looks like they 'll be re-vegetated yeah and talking to the staff it 's like no that 's not the case we 'll do community consultation and we wouldn 't do that to people the rest but it 's not in writing and we all know these days if it 's not in writing it doesn 't exist and so it is a concern that you know there could be areas there that are currently windows where people enjoy the view or people have access to the beach areas that could suddenly be fenced and re-vegetated and is that what the community actually wants you know so we have to make sure we get this right and i think it 's worthwhile taking it back to one more workshop just to consider some of these areas you know in particular there 's one in port douglas now on four mile beach that it was pristine green grass for uh weddings and more recently it 's been left to go back to this new uh revenge and it 's looking like quite a mess and can 't_''_618.0 be used for weddings etc and the the under this scheme it would be revegetated and to me that 's not what we want this is a good position as what little kobe is for weddings and it could be a great asset for council if they regrass it and make it look really pristine we 'll be able to use that for weddings so that 's something that i 'd be pushing for when discussing this as we go through to ensure that that area can remain a coconut plantation where it is with nice green grass be able to use it for weddings etc and you know not have it locked into this re-vegetation because it falls into the wrong zone on a map fnq rock strategic regional advisory group lisa scomazon elected to that absolutely this group has been formed as part of one of the fnq rock um groups or boards that sits under the main board that of course has done some great work on roads and gets us some wonderful prices that reduce could buy in bulk rather than each council having to buy their own and what we 're doing is we 're forming a group to discuss waste and how we can deal with this waste situation because as we just said before the price is constantly going up so is there a way that all the councils can bond together and do something together as a large group so small councils like us don 't have to suffer the burden of going out to individual contracts so it 'll be very exciting to see what this waste group comes up with and what things they look at and how they develop a process moving forward for all councils to take advantage of douglas chamber of commerce resource and performance agreement i think around about forty thousand dollars twenty one to two thousand and twenty four chamber of commerce for a while wasn 't traveling all that well but they seem to be doing kicking a few goals lately well that was the to get them some funding to really give them a kickstart and i think that we gave them 50 000 that first year and that was the intention of doing that you know the chamber you know we had one in port douglas and we had one in mossman uh the mossman unfolded quite a few years ago and it just became then the douglas chamber of commerce it was based in port and again they 're all full-time working people they 've all got their own businesses so it 's very hard for them to try and get out and do things and try and generate interest and generate you know members when they 're all working their own businesses so giving them that 50 000 last year and it allowed them to do some things with it to generate income or generate interest i should say um like having the expo and the different forums that they had in the social media trainings that they did and of course the christmas street um in uh in port douglas we had the santa in the shop and all those i think they 're great things to encourage businesses in the shire and you know i really want the chamber to be a strong lobby group for the businesses you know they should be coming to council regularly to tell us what the business is doing and what the businesses need um they need to be going to state levels as well and going to forums and you know getting that momentum so they become a good solid um body for the businesses in this shire and by giving this this this token funding i mean 20 000 realistically isn 't much if you look at the expos i think that cost about 10 000 a loan for that hopefully they 'll be able to generate some more interest get those members in it 's so important they get members you know the businesses also have to support the chamber so i think the council to do it but those businesses they need to also start supporting chamber becoming a member paying a membership fee to allow the chamber to do what they need to do to help support them an awards presentation on the 17th of november so good stuff there then we moved on to boy oh boy the rv park mossman business case and uh roy zamatara dead set against an rv park we 're hearing he did question i think you did he questioned you or the council over figures of what people spend in the shire and you sort of said well that 's not quite right well the reports that the staff have written are factual reports and they do their research now i also know myself that i 've spoken to these bodies the rv body and i 've also spoken to other mayors and councillors throughout different areas that have gone through this strategy and they absolutely confirm the figures that the income that these people bring generates jobs it generates businesses it 's absolutely worth doing and i think an rv park in mossman personally myself is going to be a godsend for mossman it would absolutely generate great jobs and great income for this little town that at the moment during the day it does really well at lunch times you know bringing these extra people in will generate business and that 's what we really want now to start getting these jobs happening and getting people back into mossman and creating that buzz of an atmosphere that is our cbd you know so looking at the process on how we go about doing it and that 's the issue it has to be the right block of land i mean the rv association has said that it needs to be within walking distance to the cbd you know these people usually bring their big rvs in that don 't normally fit into caravan parks they want somewhere that doesn 't have toilet facilities they don 't need it they 're completely self-contained all they need is a dumping pit and a hose to fill up their water tank you know and they 'll park where they do and they walk everywhere they go so it 's got to be something that 's close to town it 's going to be big enough to hold a sustainable amount of rvs as well and i think it 's important that the a report back to us with as much detail as possible if it means council you know to from my perspective if we have to purchase the right block of land you know by selling another block of land somewhere else to fund it i think that 's worthwhile to do to ensure that the europa the businesses in mosman um get this economic boost that we believe they need um so we 'll move forward it 's um you know we were there today we saw what happened um we 'll wait and see what comes next yeah another delay well it is it 's a day but you know councillors have to be sure of what they 're signing up the community for and you know they 've got to be confident in it um you know i think it 's important that they get all the information um and i 'm sure the staff will prevail and give it to them wonga beach caravan park caretakers management agreement steve madison and jackie thomas will take over as caretakers and as i understand there 's a little bit these two guys uh very much supported in this yeah absolutely it was a couple years ago we went through a process of looking at all the leases and the agreements and the wonga caravan park came to an end of its agreement and the person that was there declined to reapply um so it sat there for a while without having a proper caretaker such and there was there was lots of issues we were constantly getting complaints from uh neighbours and the police and people going in there that weren 't paying and doing all sorts of issues so we went through a process of finding some um management couple to run it and that 's turned out really well we 're getting you know lots of good comments now from everyone around that area and the caravan park itself that it 's being managed appropriately so now we 're going into a longer contract port shorts film festival you 've spoken to us at length on this before so we know you support it and it is is a great festival and so that was carried unanimously which is coming up uh ten thousand dollars in in kind uh the deputy mayor was a little bit worried about this that money was being diverted from other parts of council to provide this 10 000 because it wasn 't actually budgeted for yeah that 's right it wasn 't in our initial budgets because we didn 't know about it we 've always funded taste before in the past when they had their big festivals and you know i 'm really excited to see it come back again it 's a great opportunity for us to see some great international quality chefs that are going to come to this region and this is only just a small portion of what the whole festival is going to be and i think it was important the council was part of this festival and absolutely you know got involved and did some fun to ensure that it 's going to be a great event you know i really want these businesses to be able to do the best they can to prove themselves as i said you know we 're coming have a local group do the longest lunch for carnival this will give them the experience and the knowledge and the ability to see how they go and that 's really important you know so i understand where council scholars and was coming from it wasn 't in our budget this year but you know i know the accounting staff do wonders and you know they would have saved ten thousand dollars somewhere along the line on one of the projects that was done and they can reallocate it and reshift it around um usually november we have a budget reassessment anyway so they can bring something to us to shift those figures around but i certainly you know believe that it 's not going to increase our deficit by anything the covered relief fee reduction for port douglas market stall holders uh councillor nolan zamataro were a bit concerned about what they were suggesting is that people should not just turn up in other words if they 're not making money not turn up what you were putting forward or what the motion was put forward was to reduce so we have a two-tier level as far as the fees go there 's the the fee that covers from march through to january which is of course when it 's busier and then over the low season when it 's a little bit wet and there 's less tourists around we reduce it slightly from a discussion we had we thought that it 'd be appropriate because things are so quiet and we were getting requests as well for it to bring the low season early so just bring it forward a couple of months so that the storeholders can get a lower rate and give it make it a little bit easier for them my concern as i said in the meeting was that you know i don 't want to encourage storeholders not to come you know to me the market is a tourism event it 's a tourism asset people come here for our markets you know could you look a bit sparse well it could we get a lot of people that come up from cairns and you know from coranda all sorts of areas turn up and you know half the markets aren 't there it 's like well i won 't be coming back next time until it 's busy season again this is a waste of time so and i don 't want to encourage that so i was hoping that just by giving the reduction will at least allow these store holders the want to continue to keep coming up here and getting some reduction for the ability to do it but you know i listened to what councillors amatara and councillor noli said and you know i hope that the storeholders will take advantage of the discount rather than not turning up but for those storeholders that it just financially is not worth it you know at least they 've got that option to not come but i said i don 't want to see a sparse market where people go down there and go oh god this is why is it famous i don 't understand so it 's important that we still have a good stall good amount of stalls there and that it 's still a great near the end daintree ferry advisory committee what will they do well last time we had an issue with the fairing we had to close it for the the period whilst it was taken out of the water to um have repairs done to whatever it was a check they had to check it to answer i think it was um a lot of the locals said well how come you didn 't come to us for advice you know we 're the ones that use it on a daily basis you 've made decisions for us without even consulting us what we think is the best so we came up with the thought that we got a daintree and ferry advisory group so it 'll be a mixture of people across the board that use the ferry regular whether it be tourism groups locals representatives from the uh dangerous marketing co-op tpd ttq all these groups that you know facilitate the use of it on a daily basis you know business businesses that could be plumbing businesses the petrol business this is what the terms of reference is going on it so when issues can rise like that we 've at least got a body we can this is what 's happening this is what we need to do tell us what you think is the best thing and then a report can be drawn up by the staff giving us advice or the the daintree fair advisor group suggests that this is the best way moving forward and how to deal with this issue so it gives us you know some groundwork on consultation basically um in a direct form so that we can make decisions with the advice of the actual users rather than just making it ourselves well you 're running it now of course and uh options for council to develop retirement style living houses a councillor zamotaro says council shouldn 't be getting involved in this sort of stuff well you know council should be getting involved in this stuff i believe you know we 've been going through this argument now for way way too many years you know we 've got ladies who 've waited 20 years to get a full facility another 20 years and these ladies have to move away to other areas or pass away first before they get the reality of seeing actual suitable living for retirees you know and there 's a bit of confusion there between building a retirement village and building retirement housing which is what the suggestion that councillor scholars have put forward and why i agreed to it you know a lot of these retirement village groups have assessed it and they 've looked and said it 's too small we can 't make money out of it but the what they do is they they keep the land they don 't sell the land you know you just buy the house to live in and then you have to sell the house but they constantly buy the land and it 's a it 's a funding type stream the whole time and there 's not enough lots that can be built on that to make it a financially viable product on the constant streaming if council was to look at developing the land we could divide it ourselves we could have a and then we could choose you know 75 of it we could sell to people to buy to live and the other you know quarter we could then have um you know just rent it you know so people that can 't afford to buy can at least still rent in a retirement type area where it 's a 50s plus zone type thing so the people that are there are all in the same age bracket they 're not going to have screaming children next door et cetera they 're only going to be small easy maintained easy to clean you know and as far as the the works go we have our own gardeners we have our own maintenance crews we have our own the things that council can do as council property and the rental side of it could assist in paying for that stuff so we 're not looking at making a burden for council we 're not looking at you know using rate payer money as an expense just to cater for retirees now we 're looking at as a business option and i think these other options to see if there 's a group that can do retirement facilities such we look at it to see if we can do retirement living so we can get this happening this has been going on for way too long it needs to happen we i wanted to start the sooner we get a shovel in the ground the better and start getting appropriate living in both mossman and port douglas not just muslim as well and i think that 's what lisa had in it there 's a blocking craig lee that 'd be suitable to have you know a good amount of small one and two bedroom units for retirees um and you know offer perfect uh area for them to live in port as well you know to me it makes sense i think it 's a fantastic idea and it would be an asset for council and and like you said you 've got the gardeners you 've got all the upkeep people which normally people would have to pay for you guys have got it in-house exactly right so you know that type be an income stream for council you know i think we can get some good prices for those units as well and appropriate prices for people to to move into um i agree with councillor knowle in the sense that that is valuable land but our retirees are valuable people you know they 've put into this community for the last 20 30 years they deserve to have appropriate living and that 's what i want to offer them [Music] you _"

point across it 's not a question answer time it 's a deputation so we are live streaming so there are cameras on both sides so you will be picked up thank you so i thought for to put emotion through this unified to make moscow stop fighting with douglas and the result is a fabulous council that i 've been watching both under michael and julia 's done a great job but the issue we are here today to talk about is not about acts of handicaps what we are here to talk about is the effect the community legislation that comes to the steam end of the state government it 's a question to you uh are you on behalf of are you fighting on behalf of the people or are you supporting the state so we have seen division in-house in our community with families we have seen it through our business we 're seeing it basically a yellow star situation being put upon us now i know everyone here has different views boy particularly just put it here what 's going to happen at christmas time when you 've got these guys patrolling the patrol in the trailers are going to happen at domestic violence over christmas at the same time having to be cops for the whole of the rest of the year the businesses you are asking in this legislation all the businesses become cops and adults you 're asking jay at some so uh and if you support anastasia palestine fine you know opposes that this community doesn 't agree with what she 's saying about the punitive legislation we 've got um some emotions up here that are pretty much what rob manning did down in and we do all those things we 're not asking about that issue we 're asking about the people that are losing their jobs they 've got single moms out there who 've been thrown on the street we 've got people out there that are suffering with uh other uh conditions that they can 't get an exemption for we 've got jim here who had a stroke after her injection the other day the boy behind her and she 's suffered greatly and there are many more like out there you 've got to can i answer that it 's just his hands anyway she suffers so you know we 'd love for you to be able to talk what we want you to do is to talk to the people out there that are suffering the businesses that are suffering i 'm going to have to be quick we 've got a dark cloud moving over the shire from brisbane it 's not the style of our little community this is far north queensland_:_392.56 we all shop together together we go to the pub together we come out but we mix together we don 't discriminate against each other we do not need this level of discrimination so please think about the implications of what 's what 's happening ahead we 're not asking you to be opposed to the whole vaccine we 're just asking you to take the scorpion tail off the end of the legislation um we 've got spent outside work for nautilus for many years the other day we who suffers nautilus and and man they both suffer and and the employee suffers needles so we don 't want our shy turn into a bunch of dollars and coppers there are 8 000 nurses that have just left the medical system in queensland at the moment because they have seen the vax injuries and they are willing to lose their jobs over this at a time when there 's a major pandemic but thank you for hearing me my name is vanessa brennan most people call me ness i have two other immune conditions and unexplained sense of nervous system disorder degenerative disease among other diagnoses i 'm a local business owner and i 'm a resident of port douglas in the douglas shire having done my due diligence and research i have made an informed decision about my own medical options i 'm here today to talk to you about segregation and discrimination to be introduced in the near future make no mistake this proposal will have a detrimental effect on all of the douglas shire not just those that it seeks to exclude an inclusive society cannot discrimination on its people as part of its modus operandi i ask you this when in history has segregation and discrimination had a positive outcome on a society and when has the decision to do away with segregation and discrimination not being met with fearful and unjustified opposition apartheid the civil rights movement marriage equality the women 's suffrage movement and the abolishment of slavery and let 's not forget about the nazis where they were all vehemently opposed by a morally righteous and vocal few claiming and need for the greater good i would postulate that the same people who explain loudly that they have done the right thing and should be protected from the unvaccinated would have likely been the same people who demanded that rosa parks get up and move from her seat because they had a right to it but that didn 't make it right then and it doesn 't make it right now martin luther king jr said one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws we don 't need power to pass the buck deflect the blame and assuage the fears of the people and do what is right not because it 's popular because it 's the right thing to do injustice can never be justified and so lastly i asked you will you be cowards or will you be our heroes today thank you thank you very much all right what 's the deputation i don 't know if there 's a comment that needs to be made quite happy for councillors if they wish to say something just thank you for the deputation thank you um all right well from my perspective i absolutely do have one and for that reason i intend to move a minute this morning all right and that mayoral minute is very much not in line with what you 're saying and i absolutely believe that i am being a hero with what i 'm doing for this community that mayoral minute is that the douglas shire council notes queensland 's health 's recommendation that residents seek to be vaccinated for the protection in that of their community douglas shaw council is committed and obligated to follow any health directions made by the queensland considered those community concerns regarding the impacts and confusion over the rollout of the vaccination mandates the health and safety and well-being of this community is council 's highest priority and council will continue to work with the appropriate agencies to assist our community in navigating a way forward the last point is that douglas shah council writes to the state government and respectfully request that they acknowledge the concerns received from the business community give clarity to the businesses regarding the health directive and when implementing a public health and social media measures linked to the vaccination status they consider appropriate steps necessary to mitigate the risks for businesses when it comes to compliance and enforcement of this mandate it is extremely disappointing that this topic is creating a division in our community with what is entirely and absolutely a state government health decision and directive no different to those made for limited trading limited customers border closures and the like council opinions and letters going against the state health order made for the benefit of the majority of the state doesn 't sit well i have to say health mandates which which have been made to protect people with the hideous history of the apartheid there is absolutely no comparison then also watering down the absolute pain and suffering that actual discrimination in all forms has given so many in heartbreaking conditions when compared whilst i respect there is personal choice the douglas shire council has always been pro-vaccination and will continue to support the state government and the cairns hinterland hospital and health services in encouraging residents to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and their families i am however concerned about those within the community who claim that there is a lack of clarity and detail from the state government regarding how the new covered measures and restrictions will be enforced on december 17th their website has plenty of detail on what the mandates are and what the benefits to those will be to those businesses that are currently trading with the covert restrictions for those unsure covert19.queensland.gov dot a u click on the queensland covert 19 vaccine plans and we 'll take you to that information i most certainly do have sympathy for those that these restrictions will have serious effects on their trade and staffing and i categorically understand and appreciate their concerns around staffing and also being required to enforce government restrictions that have been publicized i wrote directly to the premier on the day these mandates were released regarding the enforcement issues and her office advised the following businesses are expected to take reasonable steps to enforce the restrictions this means businesses should display the vaccination rules of the business premises and the businesses may be asked may ask for evidence of vaccination from customers at the time of check-in if a customer cannot or refuses to provide evidence businesses can ask the person to leave the premises if the person refuses to leave the premises businesses can call the police in these cases police responses to calls for service will be prioritized according to the circumstances reported to the police for example where there is a threat to life or property these calls for service will be categorised as high priority and the police will respond accordingly the queensland police service and the office of liquor and gaming regulations will reaches 80 fully vaccinated milestone police will work closely with local businesses and the community to educate business operators and patrons on their obligations under the new public health measures and promote compliance as well as high visibility policing and compliance checks of individuals attending restricted businesses and vulnerable settings to which the public health measures apply but that was the response directly from the premier whilst these constraints may burden our businesses in the short term i believe that the advice of the chief health officer is in the long term the right way forward and the health and safety of the majority of our community between cairns and douglas as of last monday there were over 24 000 people who have not received any form of vaccination not if but when covert arrives in this region the potential effect on the hospital systems will be critical if you look at what has occurred in new south wales around 12 to 14 of those unvaccinated came in contact with this virus and needed some form of hospital care of those 3 000 of people if this is the case assistance in the sake if the same percentages follow through we have 18 icu beds in this region the maths are pretty simple the morality mortality rate is currently around 1 which means 240 people could potentially be in danger of losing their lives this also doesn 't take into account those more vulnerable in the communities that have had the full vaccination a vaccinated person will still contact contract covert and can become ill the vaccine only lets the body know what it is so confident faster and hopefully before the person becomes extremely sick evidence also suggests that vaccinated people who might be infected with coronavirus are less likely to spread it to others in comparison with a non-vaccinated person who it is believed would have a higher viral load the health directive that has publicly advised will commence on the 17th of december only limits those who they believe have a higher opportunity of transmission which are those unvaccinated from entering social areas that would not be considered a necessity or where close proximity and high transmission can occur shopping shopping and other essential services are fully recommend those that are vulnerable or have low immune systems consider wearing masks in these areas and continue using hand sanitizer where possible vaccinated people also have the lower potential of passing on the virus to a non-vaccinated to non-vaccinated people in the close proximity venues these mandates have also the intent of protecting those people who have voluntarily chosen not to have the vaccine from contracting the virus during the initial period when higher transmission rates are expected to occur the goal out of all these measures is to slow down the contract rate the slower that people come into contact with the virus the better our hospital systems and our business will be better for our hospital systems and our businesses we do not want the majority of our workforce off sick at the same time that would be even more detrimental to our businesses we also should be able to be confident that our elderly and more vulnerable community members who have done the right thing and been vaccinated are able to visit their local cafe and know that as a community we have their health and currently 90 double vaccinated new south wales is 92 percent double vaccinated tasmania 85 double vaccinated northern territory 86 double vaccinated western australia 74 double vaccinated and south australia 80 double vaccinated new south wales currently has even tighter restrictions than what is proposed for queensland with unvaccinated people unable to other business outlets such as hairdressers beauty salons massage premises there are even restrictions about visiting other people 's houses victoria has far more stringent rules on employment with many businesses now mandated to only have employees who are vaccinated and have similar restrictions in place as new south wales venues that cannot be intended by unvaccinated patrons tasmania is following suit on the 6th of december south australia will also follow suit at 90 vaccinated and northern territory have commenced mandatory vaccinating for various employment activities that involve close contact this is not a queensland initiative it is coming from multiple state governments and chief health officers around the country in order to keep all of our communities safe our biggest tourism markets outside the international market on new south wales and of course victoria the two states two states that will and truly know what this virus is about both of these markets i believe would not only expect that they are being served by a vaccinated person for their protection but more than likely demand it businesses that flaunt this i believe risk losing our current biggest market of tourism if this region goes pandemic we will risk losing the confidence in this market from our southern tourists which could take months to rebuild this is a very stressful time for all concern there is obvious fear of the unknown whether that be the virus or the vaccine and so much information is being peddled it is often hard to tell what is fact and what is a misleading opinion what i do know is that the health of the people in this community needs to come first whether you are vaccinated or not vaccinated there is a clear and present concern coming at us and we need to deal with this there is no easy answer to to the ongoing issues that this virus is bringing communities all over the world we can and we as a community the easier it that will be mandates are not optional and they are about to come along to us along with covert i ask everyone to please take a step back take a deep breath stop and appreciate what we have here in this community and remember that the person in front of you didn 't create this this issue they are only attempting to be part of the solution so please be kind i urge all counsellors to support this motion this is not a time for political division nor is it a time to add more confusion to our community this is an opportunity to show us shy that we as a united council have the best interest of the entire region first and foremost i 'll open it so many councillors wishes to object any counsellor that would like to make comment okay thank you all right um let me put my glasses on before i proceed to discuss further the wording of this motion um i 'd like to address some questions that have been presented to all councillors and i think it this i uh sent in an email yesterday asking for assistance for explanation and i know we have a council officer who 's going to help me through that apparently and i think this is important i just to show people that um what can can 't_''_1324.159 be done so that i think that 's a really good place to start if that 's okay and i appreciate that officer mr hoy here is not a uh a lawyer or anything like that he 's just trying to help us work through some of the questions of legality so i do appreciate that um so some questions that have been offered to councillors uh instead of regaining the legality of it all whether the the state can impose these mandates whether it 's legal and as far as my understanding uh yes is that illegal would you have anything further to say about this and how um it 's not a local government issue it 's a state decision and they have the power to to to to make these mandates perhaps you 'd like to talk about um the proposed public health directive the legislation is already out there um furthermore council occur you uh read something to us this morning the council 's this morning i think this is important time this has just come in like two minutes before the meeting started council occur read it to the councillors uh i think it 's important that this gets read to the public for further understanding of our situation this morning before the meeting i messaged the premier 's personal assistant and advised or asked when is the premier going to make a comment and state this is a state government directive it 's not a local government issue you know as much as we feel for all the people in our community a health directive is a health directive and you know we as local government councillors it 's in our code of conduct it 's in the um the act that we have to obey to the state government laws the comment that came back from the premier 's office is yes that message is absolutely being communicated however there are people who don 't want at risk major government advertising will be taking place and the police will be enforcing compliance from the 17th of december and that was direct from the premier 's office okay and that is after all these other councils that have only put a question they have there 's only one council that has stated they do not agree to the um the restrictions the other councils have asked for further details that is the comment that 's come back the other questions that the community are concerned about is that [Music] right human rights and discrimination whether businesses will be if they if they say no to the entry of someone whether they 'll be liable for some kind of legal case of discrimination could we have maybe some information about that if possible that you know of my opinion only but it 's a state government legislation that is proposed and so as um as evidenced by the other directives there 's a penalty if you don 't follow the state government directives so that penalty potentially would be passed on to businesses and and those that don be with the state government yeah so thank you that up that end and the other part is then uh once again i understand you 're not a lawyer so i don 't want to put put you in it but if a business does say i have this mandate on me uh you 're not allowed to enter your understanding is that that individual thing cannot bring some kind of discrimination case against the business because that is a concern of business of business here but all around everywhere through mayor certainly understand the concerns of business and we meet weekly at the moment with the queensland health compliance group certainly they don 't have all the answers at this stage i think it 's a matter of reasonableness at this stage i 'm lucky to get that out um every jurisdiction or sorry every state and territory in australia has something similar to this either in place or about to be in place the victorian one is in places south australian state government i think last week is in place so all those jurisdictions are uh in the into the current you know the cases that have been brought previously but there 's certainly a high profile case with clive palmer challenging the western australian border closures well that failed in the courts so at the end of the day legislation is legislation and courts often interpret legislation so until these things are challenged in the supreme court of queensland or other higher courts in the land they are legislation if i may i 'll just read another paragraph that was in the letter that i received after asked for advice back when this first occurred businesses that own or lease properties are able to impose conditions of entry to their premises provided any conditions that comply with other laws including anti-discriminant laws in the absence of specific laws such as a public health direction businesses and service providers should be cautious about imposing a blanket rule requiring vaccination as a condition of entry the human rights the australian human rights commission has provided some general guidance including matters to consider in relation to restricting entry to vaccinated people any businesses considering such restrictions can look at the humanrights.gov.eu and click on about cover 19 human rights cabinets vaccines and federal discrimination laws as the reasonableness of or otherwise of entry requirements is likely to be highly dependent on circumstances it would be prudent to strongly encourage any business voluntarily considering any entry restrictions to seek independent legal advice before doing so fines and restrictions only apply in cases where people are refusing to comply with a public health direction so would only be applicable in this case of a business required to restrict henry entry under the health direction okay so the law will only cover the businesses that they 've actually stated every other business cannot discriminate by that vaccine can i just say something to you through mike just in relation to that too because um i think in as in my um notice emotion that there 's so much confusion yesterday myself and my wife contacted three different departments in relation to one can we ask our staff because we 've got a cafe are they vaccinated to what if they 're not and can we restrict them from coming to work or do 't want them at work we 've got three different answers so it 's and we recorded everything because it 's just so i can 't wait for the directive to come out and put some clarity there because it 's just so confusing like two weeks out we don 't even know if we can officially ask our staff to give us the certificates councilman kuhn did you ask when the directors are going to come outside no they didn 't know they didn 't know and like respect to the human rights respect to the queensland government the health department so it 's just that confusion i think absolutely and from the telephone calls that we have had they 're still waiting for the actual health direction to come out but once the health direction comes out it will be a legal requirement for you to ask your staff if they 're vaccinated in these particular businesses and if they are not vaccinated the choice is to put them on annual leave unpaid leave um just they cannot work in the premises it 's just leaving it a be there well you just close or you 've got to find new ones or and and as as the other thing i mentioned is it 's not so much if they 're not vaccinated don 't want to be vaccinated it 's the um problems they 're going to experience when they ask can we see your because half them don 't want to do that they don 't feel that they 're baristas and they sandwich makers they 're not going to get the police and i can 't_''_1889.84 be at the door 24 7. so that that 's where we need clarity councilor kirk another question to you um it 's the state government has not asked local councils for their opinion not at all there has not been any question to local government asking for opinions the local government association of queensland sent through an email asking councils whether they would how these lockdowns of libraries and government buildings would affect council and would we like to be included in those uh particular lockdowns as far as vaccine people go within our own libraries and our the response was there was a certain three mr mayor there was a survey put out by the ldaq didn 't allow much time for consideration i 'll admit and it covered quite a few grounds and i think we responded you know with the concerns of business obviously there was a piece to do with the the libraries and council facilities so the state has although we don 't have the legislation as proposed that government museums libraries etc require vaccinated patrons only and vaccinated staff local governments left to a decision in that response i said would be best if there was a single response that was similar because the public doesn 't in my opinion doesn 't differentiate between local government museums and libraries as to state government museums and libraries so that there was a consistent um approach across the state rather than each local government having a different rule and each state facility having a different role to the local government that operates within the same local government area if you understand what i 'm trying to say that was all about consistency but the a local government and so really there was no input from local governments at any stage in the process of the yet to be seen directive on the vaccine mandates i 'll call it and the email that came through yesterday it was from the lgaq as the government asked feedback from council implementation but members need clarity regarding the impacts of the state 's plan could have on council operations in the workforce members need clarity regarding an obligation the plan will place on councils members need clarity regarding how the plan will be enforced and that was the three points that came back so it 's been very well and clearly stated to the state government what some the issues are but that doesn 't just stop us from telling the state government again the concerns of our community today through through this motion um you know so we do have an opportunity to at least express the desires of the business community yep just to put that out there through wording even though we haven 't_''_2101.28 been asked by the state government we can still offer the or comments um so if that 's the case cancer i don 't think this minute is strong enough to reflect that so that 's um you know at this stage i can 't support the marijuana for several reasons and as a council i understand the importance of keeping our community safe and yes the douglas shire council has supported the vaccine rollout encouraging the community to consider vaccination as the best way forward to protect themselves and their families but i also support pro-choice i understand the motive behind the state government ladies plan to increase vaccination what i do not agree with the mandates that will be imposed on businesses in queensland and part and particularly in our shire i look forward to seeing the borders open in december as much as anyone else i understand that yep we cannot override a mandate from the state government but we can tell them exactly how our businesses are feeling and i think that we need to support them and i don 't think this is about vaccination and who 's vaccinated who 's not it 's about the with unfairly we are going to unfairly segregate many within this community and we may see our local businesses close their door because businesses will be required to enforce the mandate that are being implemented customers will be required to show proof of covert 19 vaccination status when they check into many businesses and locations in this show that will be restricted to fully vaccinated customers only and i 'd like to put a bit out onto that one i got my second vaccination yesterday and i would not aware until i got told yesterday that i 've got to go back in six months to get a boost and if i don 't my um vaccination status won 't show up so that 's something i don 't think a lot of people know about and um so and that 's what what the cds says i don 't know i mean this is not about vaccination it 's about our community we live in the most beautiful part in this world place in the world and some of our community live here for a reason and some are to be out of the city and be in a small community with their families we all have family here and we have and we have not been touched with covert yet but it will come here one day into our community and then that is when people will have a choice to do what they want their lives small businesses have a lifeblood of our community and employs the majority of the workforce in this shower they have done it very hard in the past two years with covert with the restrictions and shut down and not being able to get stuff and the board has opened a few months ago not only have business had to deal with covert restrictions but the new mandate will bring a loss of staff and customers just when businesses are trying to rebuild for the future the drugs will be taken underneath them again with their compensation extra resources and without a clear understanding of what their obligations will be at this stage people in the show are concerned about their businesses and the mandate not the vaccine the business in the a large amount of fees and charges to be told they can only have certain people on their premises some of these businesses we have in our shire are generational businesses they 've been here for years they were the foundation of this beautiful shire the mandate i feel this is not the right approach and i strongly support the need to keep our communities safe and covered but this is not the only risk to our community the real risks to our community is economic and social problems which will occur with this mandate job losses business losses mental health and segregation is only a few this is a time when campus should be listening and supporting the public and what their issues are and not to turn their backs on them i see this narrow minute as having no substance because it does not do anything to help our community by telling the government that we do not support this mandate because of the long lasting effect it will have on our community and businesses lots of businesses choose what i believe businesses should have the right to at the moment dictating who they can put on their premises our motto to do it in others but will this change to do it in douglas but only feel vaccinated and that 's where segregations will come into just before i do pass on to you councillor scottish and um i just want clarity on the vaccination status because the documented evidence from the state government currently stands if you have two objections you are covered there is absolutely no way well i went through my rejection yesterday you 'd be sleeping the public both sides i went to the um i am this leading the public i went and got my second injection yesterday and i was told that i would have to come in within six within six months to get my boost up and you must be considered high risk if that 's the case because it 's elderly people at i 'm really happy to have those blind pulled up i don 't think we should block out the crowd outside i think honestly it 's not an easy situation for me but i do my suggestion on this before we go much further if they 're not tapping on the windows fine okay they start tapping on the windows it gets the council 's down the fire and i 'm happy to have them all done i just think they 're here they 've made an effort they 're having a public it 's a it 's a meeting you know so it has to be held you know respectively if they 're watching that it 's fine if they 're tapping then okay so please advise them just let them know no tapping whatever we 're trying to do our best here for everybody but i think that 's you know i think we should allow that council thank you matt kirsten you look like i fully support the motion i 'm in full support or restricting access to certain establishments based on your vaccination status in order to limit the spread of covert 19. and i also support the government 's stance on requiring those that work in high industry or high-risk industries to be vaccinated and look the vaccine itself has for those that remain unvaccinated so people who do not wish to be vaccinated can still make that choice and there is acknowledgment that some cannot receive the vaccination because of medical conditions in reality coverts claimed in excess of 5 million lives and had actually been available earlier these numbers would have been greatly reduced and because of the queensland government 's tough stance and restrictions queensland has not suffered the high number of covert cases other states have we have had just over 2000 cases in queensland from a population of 5.2 million so this is a small amount compared to other states some other states and i 'm aware that business owners are doing it tough but if everyone has the vaccine the strength of the severity of the voice will diminish and business owners will never have to do it tough again because of any covert related issues if governments can reach the vaccination targets they want to achieve this will not only increase the domestic visitor numbers but the doors can once again be open international visitors and that 's a market that the economy 90 of the population being vaccinated in reality businesses may have to turn one in ten people away if that 's the case right unvaccinated people that 's the statistics the other statistic is the hospital systems will not cope because it is a statistic known that one in 10 people that are unvaccinated will be hospitalized whereas vaccinated people it 's 100 people that will have to be hospitalized our hospitals will not cope with that look i agree with council okay i 'm appalled that many are opposed restrictions have liken them to pro-choice segregation and apartheid terms being abused beyond what they represented python and segregation are archaic laws that were cruelly forced on the people because of the color of their skin there 's nothing to do with this i 'm sure that if the millions that were subjected to apartheid could simply have taken a vaccine to be rid of it they would have chosen the vaccine there is no vaccine for segregation or a pathway but there is one for copic 19. and i understand look it 's been an emotionally challenging time for of other councils in that in queensland where we 're just putting our view across we 've got no no legal right or anything to oppose it it 's going to come in the restrictions but i just hope that we have some clarity so that these mainly for the businesses they know how they 're going to run how they 're going to operate we don 't want to be in trouble we don 't want to be fined people want to work if they don 't have to confront people so you know it and and when it comes down to my motion i i believe there 's going to be an amendment put forward with all the lovely words in there but i just want it to be as is to say we 're not happy we don 't know how we 're going to do it so and i don 't think it 's going to change anything but that 's how i 'd like to put it through well i mean the mayoral minute motion if it goes up that will be council 's position you wanted to suggest that you add something to the merrill minute do you understand what i 'm getting at so i know we 're coming from but you know we 've all said that we understand that the queensland government is going to introduce this and we 've gotten that safe i just want to put the point up there to say we don 't know how it 's going to work and everyone 's well yeah anyway when we get to that um we 're not on that now so but that 's what i 'm saying it you know depending on how this vote goes if this vote goes he will override any other condition because this will be council 's position and they need to reverse this and then which we can 't do on the day so i suggest counsellor mcewen that um you you make a suggestion for an amendment or addition or something like that if you want to there 's a point you want added to it yeah well basically what i have put in my notice emotions i know we 've think we well i don 't want to say it in a nice way i just say it 's going to well i will start by saying the ceo cannot lobby okay so the only thing we can do is have a letter from council yeah can i can i add some words and then i have some suggestions and that might assist councilman and cancer because that way it gives you a little time you can listen to what i have to suggest and it might cover perhaps what you 're looking for perhaps would you look is that okay that 's fine is that what was put on dnn this morning i 'd love it michael they said it 's you you 're putting this forward uh no now that 's no now that 's okay so i 'd like to say something then i like to make some perhaps suggestions okay so i 've written and rewritten my suggestions as to how to navigate this um so many times and spent countless hours on it and i always i will say that they are only suggestions how i can do um i believe there 's quite simply not a pathway that i 've found anyway that will make it acceptable to everyone i understand these are challenging times and i acknowledge the complexity of these issues and thus i will talk a fair bit but it already has been covered a lot of it um about where i 've taken my thoughts from but before i go any further i 'd also just like to thank the community for them for the input that has been given to councils over the past couple of weeks rest assured i have read all the emails and spent considerable time digesting the information given to me and this isn 't a combination this is a combination of remote emotive issues and it 's not easy as a counsellor to navigate our way through it all i will try to do my best to address the concerns of everyone although i 'm sure that 's actually an impossible task um and one broad statement i 'd like to make is that as a councillor and kind of council kurt did also chosen to be placed in the crosshairs of this situation the decisions of the state and federal governments that have come about from a global pandemic have not been of my making so it is a has been appreciated when the arguments have been presented to councillors have not been personal and have been formed to solely achieve constructive discussion and the best possible outcomes for an issue that encompasses the entire world so i thank thank everyone when they have not become personal on this issue so thank you very much and we just try to make it a discussion sorry counselor can i just interrupt you for something i 've just had something sent to me that 's just been released the queensland government will mandate covered 19 vaccinations for all workers in state and private schools child care centres and correctional facilities and airports primary anastasia palestine announced all staff must have had at least one dose of vaccination before december 17 and must be fully vaccinated by january 23rd before the start of the 22 school year so they 're starting to man date jobs as my points because essentially they have been covered by the councils that have already spoken um do we could could um brenda do you mind putting up with the mayoral minutes so we can see it please i just have some suggestions to discuss uh some wording for the merrill minute if that 's okay it 's up to the points yep that 's it okay another shot council notes where are we going sorry you 've just gone up a bit too high that 's hidden okay i 've done the shy council notes queensland 's health recommendations that residents seek to be vaccinated for their protection and out of their community i think that 's a generalized statement i i don 't think that discriminates against pro-choice uh personally i i 'm fine it 's a noting because i think that 's fine yeah recommends that yes recommends to be vaccinated um i don 't know if there 's anything in there that that councils may want to add that emphasizes it 's essentially a person 's choice to be vaccinated it 's purely just acknowledging that it happy with that okay douglas shy council is committed and obligated to follow any health direction made by the queensland government under advising the chief health officer i think we 've gone through everything that we are obligated we 're a body corporate that sits within the state of government i have a choice i have a i appreciate all the emails that have questioned the legality of this and so i 've tried to seek clarity i am firmly of the belief now that there 's nothing i can do as a counsellor it 's within our local government principles it 's in the act it 's that we have to as councillors even obey the laws that are said so i hope i have answered that question for emails that we have received i don 't know are the rest of you with that well we are obligated unfortunately i think we are whether we 're happy we 're obligated it 's just like keeping under 60 in town at the end of the day when this first came in the state government dictated to us that we restaurants that were running limited services so they can and they will if necessary mandate local councils to do things so we can 't make any statement that we will not because they could and we have to councillors have considered those community concerns regarding the impacts and confusion over the rollout of the vaccination mandate this is where i think perhaps councilman mcewen if you wanted to add any word in there that would uh that aligns with what you suggested if you 'll notice emotion because to me that point three is similar to your notes of motion yeah okay so we 're going to take the word out lobby but um well it 's informs just simply informs because we can inform them the state government of the concerns yeah and the negative effects of the yeah well i 'm i 'm happy with that if so councils have considered those community concerns regarding the impacts and confusion over the role of the vegetation mandates that the ceo the council council yeah the council informs queensland 's premier palace and the queensland government of fees so if nothing so i mean it 's an effectual way the negative effects the impending vaccination mandates will have on many small businesses employees employees and our community as well yes i 'm happy with that yeah and is there someone who says other clarity i came down below in five years okay i 'm happy with that if the restaurant so uh councillor mcewen are you going to move that change yes i will okay is there a second for that well it 's your middle minute it 's worth the change though as humanly too for a change so the motions i don 't need a second person to get it on the floor once it 's on the floor it 's a motion yeah yeah so you might want to because it 's your merrill minute well i agree to the changes so that 's not a problem so i can second that then just change that to one two three four doesn 't want to play ball okay um does five need to be there now [Music] i think it still needs to have the part that risks they need to know they can 't just put these things in without at least considering the effects of what they 're going to have on the businesses yes i agree with what they 're trying to do yes i believe that they 're doing on the right track but if there 's ways that they can make it easier for the businesses that is important if they do so yeah that 's a really important i think do you mind going back up as please brenda the health safety and wellbeing of this community is council 's highest priority and council will continue to work with the appropriate agencies to assist our community and navigate a way forward i 'm happy with that i just wonder if on this point or somewhere else um there should be a statement about council also respects a person 's personal choice something along those lines is not good wording but it could be council understands people 's personal choices however the health and safety and well-being of this community is consistent i i don 't want to put the however in choices for vaccines maybe council understands people 's personal circumstances for vaccination um i 'm sure no it 's the i 've reached choice because sometimes it is a choice or something it can be a choice it 's not necessarily a circumstance that obligates a person one by the other so i um yeah i 'll just see 0.5 again brenda please one of the things i had down was that council respectfully request the premier to take the concerns of the douglas shaw community and this council into account and reconsider the decision to introduce the mandate i don 't agree with that i said that 's fine i think it 's too late too from the work from what 's been released by the state government the wording it 's it 's going to happen it 's going to happen and you know you don 't have to agree with it i don 't believe that there is a major majority of the shire that 's businesses absolutely i can understand that people that have been affected personally by this and understand that but the general community have to stop this i think it 's important that we inform the state government that there are concerns about the business about how this is all going to to play out for them and i think that 's councillor mckeown has has highlighted that and we need to really emphasize that with the state government i think we we will do be doing that and the owners of these mandates do not be placed on the business should we put something like that that the owner is not the place in the business well they 're going to be well government 's going to bring in a mandate and it 's and the local police so unfortunately um yeah but for example if councillor mccoon was saying that you might have to even lose time policing entrance you know people 's entrance into the shop well i don 't know is the state government going to assist you in that way the response that was given by the health minister was that businesses should be checking anyway that their customers are checking in so it 's nothing new they 're saying well i hope they do that to woolies across the road because the amount of people that walk through woolies that don 't cave in it 's it 's a lot more than what our businesses in this shower have to monitor and the thing is with that it 's hard to get stuff at the moment it has been very hard and paul douglas has suffered greatly from this because we haven 't been able to get the staff when we had the increase of um tourists a few months back so all of a sudden now when you become busy during the day you have to employ another person that 's going to have to ensure that people are targeting when they come in can 't_''_3682.64 get stuck that means businesses will have to take off it 's is it can i just ask the questions covered will never be over very much it 's always tough pretending it 's not going to be there you know the staff are going to get sick they 're going to be off on sick leave if we don unfortunately because they cannot get the staff and i think that 's really sad for our community it is and it 's even sadder that you know there will possibly come a point that enough people will receive that the businesses can 't open there could be a point that we have a pandemic where this is going right and victoria and new south wales will stop coming here full stop because they 've been through it so there 's lots of multiple factors in this so what 's the right answer no one knows they 're trying to do it on a health basis that 's right and unfortunately it 's um it 's a big brother attack so we have to abide what the state government says if we agree with it or not but at the end of the day it 's our businesses and our community that will suffer because they will not be able to have a job causes a huge amount of economic problems because people have to sell the houses and it just goes on it is it 's that little and it said possibly a thousand people will need icu bets and they aren 't there for them so the hospital system will crash completely that 's right and it 's not the community 's problem that money has not been invested into our health system that is the bottom line it hasn 't been pretty wholeheartedly but the fact is they haven 't and it will be the community that will suffer so that 's why i think it 's important that we need to let the state government know that um the businesses the business community and our residents are not happy with it it doesn 't just affect the business community it affects everybody i think what is there i agree to that if there 's any other changes otherwise we 'll put it to the vote and we can move on all right that 's all there is that is now how it reads that the point one being the douglas shire council notes queensland 's health 's recommendation that residents seek to be vaccinated for the protection and that of their community douglas shire council is committed queensland government under advice from the chief health officer councillors have considered those community concerns regarding the impacts and confusion over the rollout of the vaccination mandates the council informs queensland premier palestine and the queensland government of the negative effects the impending vaccine mandates will have on many small businesses employers employees and our community as a whole the health and safety and well-being of the community as council 's highest priority and council will continue to work with the appropriate agencies to assist our community in navigating a way forward council understands people 's personal choices for vaccination douglas shire council writes to the state government respectfully request that they acknowledge the concern so the concerns received from the business community give clarity to the businesses regarding the health directive and when implementing public health and social measures linked to the vaccine status they consider appropriate steps necessary to mitigate the risks for the businesses when it comes to the compliance and enforcement of this mandate so was that the amendment to the motion was put forward to the vote and we 'll put it forward to the there councilman q and all those against councillors and the motion is passed all right let us move on to the rest of the meeting thank you so that takes us to the confirmation of the minutes from the following meetings the ordinary council meeting held tuesday 19th of october if there 's a mover please for that one there 's councilman seconded by council zamataro any comments of changes needed that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and let 's carry unanimously we have a special meeting held monday 15th november 2021 move it for that one please cancel the scommerson seconded by our second map i 'm happy to click on that one any comments and put that to the vote and that 's carried you know thank you all right now we can move on to the agenda items as listed now our first one we 've got today is the application for a permanent road closure of joining lock 204 nxt 264 765 captain cook highway kilo the recommendation is the council advises the department of resources dor that it has closure over part of old ferry road adjoining lot 204 and sb 264 765 identified by drawing cns 2105 a tactical highway kilo subject to the following conditions and conditions that must provide the necessary easement okay sorry we need to go backwards the uh we didn 't vote on the actual change of the motion so we had a peter so councilman uh put it forward i 've seconded it so we just need to vote on the change to make that motion so all those in favor of the changes to that motion which is council zamatara council and knowledge council occur council i 'm curing those against council wisconsin so that is now the motion has read and now we need to vote for their motion to be the motion um all those in favor councillors zamotaro council and only councillor councillor mcewen all those against councillors okay so now we 're finalized on that point thank you for that much appreciated all right so let 's get back to this agenda item um the applicant must provide the necessary easements to accommodate the access to the authority chief executive officer in accordance with section 257 the local government 2009 to finalize any and all matters associated with this application do you have a movement for this one please yes council i know we 've got in there council let me queue one second uh councillor nolly would like to speak to it i don 't think it 's necessary thank you anyone should speak against any comments from counsellors 5.2 on the agenda is the sage squared out the roundup reduction strategy 2021 um the council resolved to adopt low phosphates reduction strategy 2021 so remove it for that please yes councilman seconded by councillor scottism councilman tried to speak to it no we 're speaking at length about this and um let 's just get out there and spray anyone against any comments from councillors we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favour and that 's carried out asleep thank you all right so now the next item on the agenda is 5.3 which is the council grant program major grant round the current recommendation recommendation is the council approves 52 do uh or fully or part funded grant i 'd like to propose a amendment to the motion so that we can split it to take the one item out that involves the two councillors that have got a conflict so at least they can vote on the majority with us um so i believe brenda have you got the alternative there already for us um so the first amendment would be the council of approves the 43 500 for the major grant around 2021 to fully apart grant applications as listed below uh per the grant assessment pain and council officer 's recommendation so that 'll cover everything but the one item that is covered by the the two councils and the second it 's the second alternative promotion shall read the council approves 8500 for major grant round 2021 22 or fully or part grant fund applications is listed below per the grant assessment payment council officer 's recommendation which will only contain the one that has the confidence so i will move that amendment is there a seconder for that um now i don 't believe the the remaining councillors so all those in favor of the change that 's council zamatara council scholars and council occur so the amendment now changes so that is the the amendment we need to go on both the original motion was the 52 000 in total we can 't we can 't put it up do it the way you usually do it that is now the new motion is that it 's split okay so the first portion uh which is the larger amount for the bulk um you have a mover on that one on the bulb and i 'm happy to second that so that gets that on the floor okay so now we can discuss that one council and only would you like to speak to it since um very happy that everyone 's applied for these grants i i think there 'll be a [Music] an asset to the communities um what has been suggested i 'm very happy to support what i can is that okay if i say that 's right does that get in trouble sorry can we just go back up councillor mcewan didn 't vote please just for the minutes okay thank you sorry canceling uh that 's it thank you any other comments from councillors so we 're talking about all the rest of it yes right yeah i 've just got one a couple of things here that um the other day when we discussed this there 's been an edition put into the tai chi health program so um i just think that 's a bit excessive the great the grant that they 've put in for and then we can ask people to participate in in the program because i know we 've discussed about talking to them about putting the fee on so it matched and they were contributing that way but we 've gone to the full amount still with that yes through movement because the grant is applying to replicate the active games that the activate program tai chi came port and that used to be north of the river that council funds the council are asking participants for the rest of the community to contribute a five dollar fee plus 50 cent our grant funding reduced so when uh the alexandra bay sports club were applying for grant to replicate that it was considered that it would be fairer to also ask the participants there to contribute but to give them the full grant funding it just keeps their program going that little bit longer but on an equitable basis with the rest of the shower does that make sense was it what was because there was a fairly hefty cost of having someone going across the river each week to do it and sometimes there may be six people and it counter balanced itself i think from memory yeah yeah all right so yeah all right if we put that any other council 's got questions on that one so we 'll put that to the vote then all those in favor of the first motion and that 's carried unanimously okay so now we 'll talk about the second one so i 'll ask a few councillors that have got conflicts to leave all right so if we get a mover for the second one please counsellous i 'm happy questions on this one no no no thanks all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously as well all right let 's leave tesla samatara 's leaving the room for a second thank you that 's so good true just a numbering i think brenda 's wrong is aren 't they they should all be fives not sixes oh okay okay just throwing it out like that but technically they 've got to go back to five don 't they eventually like for the minutes and that i 'm pretty sure anyway it doesn 't matter that 's just a question um is i 'll be quicker than thank you all right let 's move on to 5.4 the amendment uh to fees and charges mossman pool and caravan parking activates subsidised fitness the recommendation is the council adopts the amended sections of the schedule and fees and charges for the 2021 financial year for caravan parks and campgrounds to include overnight vehicle fee storage and adopts the amended sections of the schedule and fee and charges for the 2021 financial year but activate fitness classes to include a 'm happy to move that to get it started second to please councilman through the chair uh can i just note that on page 37 um there is has been an admin um error for the active eight part class being per class it states seven dollars in the proposal um it is actually five yep and that will the motion but i just wanted to raise that thank you thank you all right so any council wish to speak against not getting comments from councillors on this one and it 's all pretty straightforward all right we 'll put that to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried all right so it takes us to 5.5 the tourist support davidson daintree annual report uh the recommendations council receives and notes for tourism uh port douglas and daintree annual report 2021 submitted in accordance with the resource and performance agreement between tourism port douglas and daintree and douglas shire council for that one please councillor nollie seconded by chancellor zamotaro thank you very much councillor nolly would you like to speak to it um i just i have demonstrated that this last year like every year have an invaluable asset under the circumstances they 've done a fantastic job and you know showing what they 've done and how they 've done it 's actually it 's quite interesting to see what they 've been capable and able to do over this period thank you to them with that we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you works progress report for the first quarter 21 22 the recommendations the council receives and notes the progress of the capital works program to 30 september 21 for the 21-22 financial year over mover please for that it 's important that we are kept up to date on these capital works i always enjoy reading about it so thank you thank you very much anyone wish to speak against then any comments from councillors uh just to scott as to how a game you did mention before that you 're getting held up with supplies not being available any major problems with that uh through them yeah some manage those on a case-by-case basis but there is significant labor and material shortages out there at the moment we 're not expecting at this stage to see any substantial overruns in terms of time most of our contracts are actually fixed price so we agree to those prior um so our exposure in terms of costs is not particularly high any other questions is that increased costing as well you have increased the costing as well if you have a surprise um through the mayor it 's always difficult to understand necessarily the market sometimes we feel that um we don 't have enough money in the market shows that we do in our budgets and vice versa look material prices um reflect in the pricing that they give for projects but wage um pricing hasn 't seemed to have crept into the construction industry there isn 't an increase in wages at this stage um i 'd be a little bit more concerned about that if it goes forward so any other questions all right that will put it to the vote all those in favor and that decision revised utility charges and associated rating matters 2122 the recommendation is revised utility charges and associated rating matters 2122 pursuant to section 94b one of the local government 2009 the council make an extraordinary decision to make a levy cleansing utility charges with effect from first january 22 and ending on 30 june 22 for the supply of waste management services by council as follows and it goes on with some extensive detail the councillors would have read have a move it for that one please i 'm happy to move that one to get it started seconded by i 'm sure councillor schumerson just got in there this is something that was uh brought up by various residents across the river um regarding the the bin charges that they 've been introduced it was a new thing we were trying and we 're just trying to refine it for them to make us a little bit more uh fair for them so we 've taken two bins off the cafes and restaurants compared to last time would you like me to answer that yeah please um yeah there motel and resort accommodation so you can see those equipment facilities yeah there was originally for each unit there was one unit charge but now it 's it for every three units or part thereof and then also for without cooking facilities every five units will park there and uh also the holiday cabins is similar change there to make it every without for those without cooking facilities for every five cabins have we had any feedback on them from the businesses north of the river how they feel about the new change or so this is for the six month period from january to june and that 'll give us another period to look at and we can certainly start assessing it for the next financial year at least it 's a start that 's a change any other comments we 'll put that to the vote though all in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you for doing that much appreciated all right so now brings us up to 5.8 which is the revised budget 2122 the recommendation is the council resolves to adopt pursuant to section section 94b at the local government 2009 the revised budget of the financial year 21 22 and the long-term financial forecasts for the financial years 2122 to the 2030 to 2031 as contained in the document title 2122 revised annual budget and set out in the pages contained therein which has got your budget statement of income expenditure financial position cash flow changes in equity long-term financial forecasts measures of financial stability budgeted sources and application of capital funding budgeted movement and deserves budgeted rates and utility charges total value of change in the rates and charges expressed as a percentage capital works program the revenue policy in the revenue statement has tabled um got in there i 'm happy to second that one councillors thomason do you wish to speak of those things that you know it 's disappointing but unfortunately that 's the way it is i would like to see some serious talks about our budget in the very future as soon as because i think that we need to start really looking at just seriously and tightening a lot of stuff up so i just think 's not lot we can do about it so but i think we do need to start maybe a bunch of talks a little bit soon absolutely you know and i do you know i think it 's appropriate to remind people that we you know shot down nearly over a million dollars off last year 's budgeted figures so you know we know that the staff do cut things back as much as we possibly can there 's always going to be expenses things are always going up as we just discussed you know building any of the works that we do all those products are going up skyrocketing because of lack of supply um you know staff wages go up electricity we 're sitting there trying to work on that and make that go down which is good but there are obviously costs that keep going up so of course council 's expenses keep going up and we have to work out whether we pass those costs on to the right payers as rake increases or we reduce services and no one wants to see reduced services no constant battle to see what we do and how we do it and i 'm sure it will be very interesting as we get into budget talks next year early next year as we head towards the new budget but you know we are still going through a drastic period as far as you know what 's happening around the world with code you know we 're no different to every other council and a lot of councils are in far worse positions on what we are and suffered a lot worse so i think you know credit to the staff here for what they 've done um there 's no other conference council nolan thank you um one may remember that myself and councillor zamatara voted against the 2021-2022 budget and is also questioned by councillors amazon one of the points that i brought up during the budget meeting was that of our operational costs the budget i believed was too lean too close to the bone and comprise unfortunately of no contingencies now councillor zamatara group me and tour credit councillor stomazol also listened and questioned some things the revised budget brings council further into death deficit and basically my experience at time if this would happen now that 's not a dig at the council staff by any means it 's just a saying that i believe that the contingencies weren 't built into our budget i questioned it and look where we are today thank you all right with that then we 'll put it to the boat all those in favor and that 's carrie thank you very much thank you 5.9 the qao final management report 2021 the recommendation is the council notes the observations contained within the financial management report observations report from the queensland audit office for the 21 22 financial years the remover for that please sure thank you seconded by councillors thomason how some kill would you like to speak to it that thing 's just explanatory it 's good that we 're all up today that 's right anyway i wish to speak against any other comments from councillors all right but that will put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously council notes the financial report for october 21. do we have a mover please for that one councillor seconded by councillor cemetary just got in there sorry yeah council scholars didn 't try to speak to them but it 's you know it is as it is and i think we just need to be very cautious going into the future and i wish to speak against any other comments from councillors so as justice thomas and said it is what it is you know it 's only you know halfway through halfway through the year yet but you know i do appreciate the staff for doing everything they can under the circumstances to keep it in line you know just started to do it early there 's still a lot of things outstanding so it is what it is um so that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously all right 5.11 which is audit committee meeting minutes the recommendation is the council receive and make the unconfirmed minutes of the audit committee held meeting held on the 25th of those place sure councilman seconded by cancer schonerson uh councilman q in any comments anyone wish to speak against any comments from councillors all right we 'll put that to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you all right so the notice of motions 6.1 is withdrawn which takes us to 6.2 which is uh councillor nolly thank you so i 'll move the following uh notice emotion the council consults with the community for the location of the port douglas splash park and water precinct two the final occasion the precinct is decided by council resolution three a business case and cost benefit analysis are conducted on proposed 50 meter lap pool and an alternative lagoon style pool for the business case and cost benefit analysis for both options are then brought to a council meeting to be publicly discussed and noted do i give my background or do we need a second up for that i 'll need a second to please to get it on the floor um that 's correct isn 't it it 's so secondary on that was noted that for the design of a pool splashback and water present was in the final stages of tender the question was put by councillors as to when the public will have an opportunity to decide upon the location of such an important costly and resource intensive infrastructure asset the answer was taken on notice and subsequently never answered it should be noted that in former councils the community has always been given the opportunity to address their opinion as to the location of such an important decision a few weeks ago council released a media statement saying that the location had been decided this declaration has had no input nor consultation from either the community or councillors the second part of this nation notice on motion deals with the question of whether it 's a 50 meter pool or a lagoon style swimming area research and community consultation for over 10 years demonstrates that the community wants needs and in this beautiful area deserves a unique tropical lagoon not a rectangular concrete pool which duplicates pools found anywhere in the world this decision is too important to get and probably possibly an operational loss and in the wrong location and if it is in the wrong location so i put it you might not in that end if in the wrong location and i saw in detriment to the amenity of products so that 's the basis of my argument um i would uh i 'll have a right reply should it be necessary absolutely well i wish to speak against it of course um joe it biggest belief you know why people are so adverse to this council actually making progress with a safe swimming precinct for port douglas for as long as i 've lived here in this region it has constantly been asked by the community they want me the dream of a fancy lagoon is wonderful you know i also dream of having a ram truck but i can 't afford one it 's that simple much like this shower cannot afford a lagoon but it just can 't_''_5878.48 we don 't have the right base if it could perhaps you know over the last past 20 years that it 's been discussed one many you know over how many oversized fancy expensive lagoon designs do we need to discuss how many more project plans need to be designed that will never get funding let alone built how much more expense do you want to burden our rate payers of this show with before we eventually do get a safe swimming precinct it was designed to have you know it was designed to have a fancy lagoon and an in on the inlet that didn 't get up lack of parking it 'll ruin the natural views we don 't want screaming children it 'll ruin the ambience of our restaurants what about the markets and so on it went you know the more recent concept of a massive fresh water lagoon behind the surf clock we don 't want it there it 's too windy it 's not enough parking how ridiculous using fresh water not to mention you know the added cost of having to rebuild the surf club at some point this council needs to be realistic in what it can afford where it is suitably suitable to be put and consultation but what about giving them a concept i 'm designed to actually consider and for something completely different let 's actually offer a design that is achievable so that it 's not another fancy and expensive document filed away like many of the other projects that have been proposed in this shower as a counsellor this has been discussed on numerous occasions and i appreciate counseling you have been against it from the start but it was discussed at the workshop point of order do not put words into scripture i have not been against you objected to it against all right and i appreciate that you have been against us and start but it was discussed at the workshop on the 18th of august 2020 again on the 6th of october 2020 once more again on the 15th of december 2020 and i have the screens here that show the location it has well and truly been discussed with us it hasn 't been decided it was then agreed by a majority of councillors to have it added to the 2021 operational plan for investigation and a development majority of councillors to add it to the 2122 operational plan to get a concept and detailed detailed design completed for the community engagement and then secure funding it was also agreed to stage it to have the splash park be stage one you know how do you get a concept design if you don 't have a location already decided yeah i understand there has been some confusion around the word splash park and i want to make it very clear that this will not be a yellow red blue bucket you know type thing now this should be a nature based water play area complemented by an adventure playground to really activate that space which currently sits unused the pool would be a paid area to assist in compensating the operating costs the survey was completed and very clearly stated do you think port douglas needs a council run swimming pool no there is nothing confusing about 628 people that responded at the great and the great majority was for the affirmative i certainly didn 't see any business case or cost benefit analysis done when it came any public consultation being done on its location either maybe if we consulted the people on that we would have found that we would have found out about that land which we cannot use for any commercial purpose but here we go again let 's not get anything done for the region you know that the majority of the community in port douglas are asking for let 's try and store something else cut it off before it 's even given the opportunity to be seen another off-leash dog park gone before it 's even started so no council and ollie i do not support this motion of you also i have no intention of making this community make and not wait for another five years to get a safe swimming area for port douglas and not only disagree with your emotion and actually contend the spirit that 's been thinking five years to make a community consultation that 's a bit of an exaggeration don 't you think council occurred um i 'll let the others speak for a reply is anyone speaking in the affirmative permit for you and all these recommendations thank you um i 'd have to say i was very surprised when i saw that location had been decided i knew nothing about the location being decided start that had not been decided in this council i don 't ever recall it being decided here and since it has been decided a lot of people a lot of the communion said to me that 's the wrong place they don 't want it there for a start or about announced so that 's that 's that 's the that 's that 's the first one number one we should be consulting about the location because i know they 're doing a lot of things or even that and i didn 't i wasn 't i was as a counselor i felt quite stupid that i didn 't know it had been decided and there had definitely hadn 't been another council resolution decided as far as pools go we know that pools cost a lot of money cost council 's money and then the local pearl cost us money now so two for a shower lagoon that was talked about behind the surf club obviously was extravagant but it was but everyone was quite excited about that you yourself were sitting beside me when philip johnson talked to us come here you were the first you know it 's something i think i think the lagoon is much more attractive to the shire than another pearl we already have a pool of moss and we don 't need another permission to cost us money but we need a lagoon that 's going to attract visitors to the show that 's my opinion you know it 's extremely disappointing newsport you know put out a newspaper or an article basically saying a splash park in reynolds park i got comments saying wrong place wrong place what 's a splash park you know they 're expecting a red and blue bucket thing in the middle of reynolds park of course they 're going to say no to it if you do it as a nature play so it 's actually activating the park so it 's got water spouts it 's got water activities happening in that get something okay one question about all this is that and he hit the rod on the head what can this council afford we 've just a business case and cost benefit analysis as conducted on the proposed the you know the pool the pool and the lagoon style pool but i think what we also need to be added into this is that we need a pretty um good rough estimate on the ongoing costs so it 's not that wouldn 't be included in that so yeah but yeah it 's nice to have all these things but you know it 's muslim fool doesn 't make us a lot of money and you know and i i did a check on all councils um far north queensland down to probably mackay and they had a look at what their population was had a look at how many swimming pools they 've got in their shower and it just to me it doesn 't make a lot of business sense for us to have two pills in the shop but you know if we could create something as or whatever we just i don 't know how cost effective is so that 's why 1.3 is so important to understand yeah we need to have a little bit more better costings and how the ongoing costs will be to have an extra thing but um well that would have been all really nice to hear before we put it into the operational plan and you agreed to it in the operational plan it says to have a concept design done yeah but before that at least have the concept design done so we can put it out to a community consultation you can 't have a concept design done if it 's in the wrong step or order of steps ask any engineer before you have a concept design you have to have a thorough understanding of where the location is because you can 't put it you can 't design something for the wrong location douglas paul zero depth watercolor you go through it ah there 's pictures of the location these are the workshops you 're the only counselor that has decided we 've had workshops but there 's never been a workshop is not a decision-making forum so we have not had a proper decision-making form as to location all i 'm saying is and it was actually a complete and utter um coincidence that something was pretty news for because i didn 't_''_6464.239 i definitely did not contact them they picked it up and i found that very interesting did actually you know where the location was or that what we were proposing i checked my notes out all the time and we had rexmill park there and there was always a question mark on it because it wasn 't completely agreed with because that 's where reynolds um [Music] that was proposed but i disagree with it yeah we spoke about reynolds park but there was also other locations that you know um i think i brought up one was don 't might be comfortable there so that 's wrong but yes discussions with that reynolds path but we still haven 't been given the full picture anything else and that 's what the concept design is for that 's right so build something there exactly the same as they did last time at the lagoon there was no discussion about the location councillors decided the location council has got the people in to design the concept and then it was put out to public consultation exactly the same process and so can i look at my notes back then too it 's um there 's a good possibility we have funding to cover this yes because you were humming and knowing whether you wanted to agree to it and as i said to you the best concept is to get the whole master plan done and once the master plan is done you do it in stages it 's silly doing an ad hoc that was the conversation we had in here that day can you agree to it i think it 's paramount that we just get a design done that we can actually put out to the community if they don 't like it fine then we can look something else but it 's been budgeted for it 's in the operational plan let 's get it designed you 're all right we have to decide upon the location you do not put a design for a location that then changes emotions that now i 'll have my uh reply thank you very much thank you thanks now essentially i had always been for a water precinct in fort douglas and please do not try to put words into my mouth by saying otherwise i voted for a lagoon i have questioned a 50 meter concrete rectangular pool yes that have a question but a water precinct i 've always since 2014 been in favor of it was myself as part of the former council who lobbied the state government through cynthia louis to assist in getting money for the splash park so i have done my job in trying to [Music] assist the community of port douglas get what they have asked so i 've always supported that 's the type of water present and i 've done my job secondly what i 'm seeking to do here is we 're going to put in a multi-million dollar asset we have to get the place right this is not months later i 'm going to change my car this is something that 's going to sit there for years and years to come let 's get it right that 's all i 'm saying a community consultation on choose a b or c as a location will not be cos expect it not be cos costly it won 't be expensive to do let 's have a look and let 's make sure we get the place right you do not design something around a location and if you haven 't you do not make a design if you haven 't got the location because the design will will be dependent upon the location okay a business case and cost birth analysis are there to say that you have been quoted as saying that a rectangular pool it will be a user pays you 're going to have to pay to go in okay which tourist will leave their beautiful to pick a resort the mirage resort pool to go to pay to go into a rectangular pool okay i 'm guessing very few tourists are going to do going to make this a use of pays let 's make it uh beautiful unique and attractive to people who are going to go into it now if it comes back that the community says i 'm happy with a 50 minute pool these are the expenses where we 're happy to wear that and reynolds park is the best place for it i will support that i will then do the best i can as a counsellor to get what the people want and all i 'm saying is let 's just make sure that we get it right what the people want it 's not that difficult it 's not going to be another five years down the track it 's not going to be a costly expense and it 's transparency and community consultation at its best finished yeah well as i said none of that happened last time so all the counselors did it um if that 's the case we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor of counseling 's motion council zamotaro councillor knowley councillors comments and all those against council i 'm going to ask a question um now that this motion has gone up we do have a tender sitting there for the concept um what is the direction of counsel that i need to do now because where um [Music] the panel is now going through those concept designs i don 't know i kept kept asking this tender went out without uh counsellors being informed there was out i 've happened to have how many workshops the motion was just passed _"

operational work advertising device over land described as lot 123 on sr 687 located at 5460 captain cook highway subject to the following approved drawings and or documents as listed below which there 's quite a fair bit there so we 'll take that as read i 'm happy to move this one do we have a second one councillor nolly thank you so firstly i 'd like to start by saying thank you to the planners for this very detailed and thorough report that extensively explains the critical details as to why this application has been recommended for an approval with the conditions that have been listed i do believe that this is ensuring our long-term economic future and it 's fantastic to see that our diligent planners have been able to balance the need for progress whilst also protecting our shire 's environmental and other concerns through conditions that meet the majority of the community 's wants along with the developers needs this remarkable project i believe will bring a new demographic of tourists to our region once completed and will inject a new sense of life to our international tourism offering it 's wonderful to see that developers are able to work alongside this council and our planning scheme to accomplish great things for the region and its ongoing future sustainability the project once completed will consist as mentioned at the wave park freshwater swimming lagoon aqua park hotel complex multiple other things as i read before um you know which it 's just a very very exciting prospect for this area and i think it 'll be a wonderful asset for the region and for the tourism so that 's what i 'll say on that one would anyone like to speak against anyone speaking for would like to speak look i think it 's fantastic set up i think it 's great i think one concern i have that we have to have maybe look at um agricultural land being undeveloped i know this is we 've ever told this is going to create employment but if we have to watch out agricultural land if we keep cutting up agricultural land we could be looking at closer to mostly military and we stand to lose a lot more jobs than what we would gain for a resort so i think in future you know we have to look at agricultural land and the significance of pace to it puts to employment in the shower not that i 'm speaking against the proposal it 's a great proposal but i 'd just like to flag that any other councillors switched to speaking against or foreign just have a question for neil um i know most of the comments i 've received in relation to this project there 's concerns about the sewage and water um i know we 've workshopped this quite a number of times and we seem to is in relation to the sewage i thought originally that it was going to be conducted on site but i believe that you have sort of preferred it to go into the sewage plant that we have could you just talk about how that why that 's a better option [Music] the main two reasons why um so to have a development of this size not being connected like this didn 't really go down too well and the thought was that if this development is going to be successful and have what financial viability isn 't a considerational council ultimately it does play into considerations of how successful development is so this uh big expensive costs or short-term compensation lots and it was thought that it would be best to and it does involve a significant capital cost than what was originally flagged up yeah i 'd just like to say thank you to staff again for such a great report to councillors it was very detailed and made our job a little bit easier to be able to answer questions from the public one thing that i think all year round tourism for us not just the designated tourism period that we normally stick by here but i think it 's great for a whole year you know it 'll fill up a gap for us for the rest of the year so well done again to the staff and thanks for norm thank you more than anything i just like to tease out a few questions perhaps get professional responses okay uh going back to that sewerage obviously the public residents of douglas are concerned about our capacity our treatment was for the treatment capacity as is can you just speak through the thoughts that officers and council has going into the future that this might have on our capacity for treatment oh yeah it 's one of the main considerations obviously is the upshot is that the existing treatment plan does have limited capacity whether this development happens now and when we say now over the next let 's say three to five years um or to service the existing population growth forecasted the sewage stream does require substantial upgrades so whether there 's development comes the planning horizon that was done a few years ago they had the treatment plan to have over equivalent persons of 21 000 ep at the moment at 16 000. um so that 's a substantial upgrade to accommodate future growth anyway of course this development represents the 648 person 's development so while it 's still substantial at 648 it can easily be absorbed in that future 5 000 ep upgrade so just to put that into context so yeah it can be accommodated okay the next one obviously and this is i think a big one on people 's mind is the water usage and our capacity going forward how this development will use the water and plans that will be put into place so we can have sustainable water usage in the shire going forward can you just speak through that please sure that was a significant issue for the assessment of the application again those comments are under the infrastructure workers code the modeling has revealed that once the development has completely come to line and completely developed it will require the output to augment cancer in approximately 1.8 meg offsets so it generally requires between 1.83 meg for the ultimate development that the developer will need to augment council 's existing storage capacity to cater for the development so there is that obligation and conditions that they have to address their demands so it 's not going to be at the cost of the rate in terms of having to make up that shortfall um yeah condition 20b provides that opportunity for the developer to monitor and measure demand and then am i correct and saying that for water usage in the show there 'll be an initial big jump and then that will come down and level off and that won 't affect the residents of the shop at all and that 's also a worst-case scenario assuming they don 't um the other questions i think that are important to douglas residents are the environmental questions you know we are on a fairly major river and also next to the coral sea what are the environmental processes that have been done so far by the developers and how our council officers content that that i mean it is um i suppose my last question goes to visual amenities one of the things that concern a lot of people is look of a development there are a couple of things i suppose that are important in this development height just before it goes on can we just swap the microphone across that people online can actually hear please that the visual amenities and things like that how there won 't be a great disturbance for lack of a better word for residents enters alike going past that type of stuff would you it is substantially set back off the main road and the tune of i think there 's around 40 odd meters up to 100 meter setback between the two east wing west wing buildings a significant landscape buff is going to be put in along that frontage of the site and keeping in mind that the development while three stories is 12 meters in height so combined with being substantially set back off the road three meters in height and also on page 87 i indicate i 've shown a cross section the road and the site drops down as you go into the site so of approximately two meters so as you go past the road it 's sitting more proud than the site and that combined with those landscape buffers the actual building setbacks i don 't have any concerns with the you know being an unacceptable visual impact over time of course you know when they get in there and start developing it 's going to be you 're going to see that that works like yeah in in the long term i think it 'll be fine okay okay that concludes my questions i 'd just like to make one comment please yeah overall i absolutely support this recommendation i support sustainable sensible development that adheres to the current planning scheme and that ultimately does not overall disturb the lifestyle that residents of douglas have chosen and and deserve to have north break i believe will be that type of development it 's a long-term benefit that complements what douglas has to offer to both locals and tourists alike as a council i 'm very content with the this development will bring with it and i 'd like to also thank obviously council staff for working through this and the developers for the work that they put into the application and the process that we 've followed it makes it more streamlined and ultimately a greater probability of successes for everyone around so thank you thank you so in closing i absolutely you know agree with council zamatara agricultural land is very very important we need to make sure that we do protect it and i think if this uh project had been put on a block of land that was different to the one that we 're looking at this could be a different outcome but the block that they 're using has been shown that it is you know a lesser valued block of agriculture and such so you know the benefits of this project i think certainly outweigh it on this occasion you know the water and sewage issues are absolutely been one of our big concerns so thank you councillor noli for asking those questions here so that at least the community got a if they 've got concerns to look at the council website it 's a 294 page document it 's got all the details it 's got all the questions and all the answers on it um so please inform yourself with that before um hitting facebook or social media with things that aren 't quite correct okay there 's lots of details there so with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carrick unanimously thank you very much right that takes us to 5.4 capital works progress for second quarter 21-22 the recommendation is the council receives and notes the progress of the capital works program to 31 december 2021 for the 21 22 financial year we 'll have a move from that one please counselor nolly i 'm happy to second that one castanoli would you like to speak to it um oh no not particularly i have no no real comments and no questions thank you very much anyone wish to speak against further comments from counsellors then questions getting a flight on this one all right so with that in favor and that 's carried unanimously four five point five takes us into the body worn camera general policy the uh recommendation is that council adopt the body-worn camera policy have a mover for that one please council zambotaro got in there a councilman q and seconded council zamatara tried to speak to i think it 's a good idea it helps protect we know what 's happening health protect we have a lot of stories about what happens out in the public and this is going to cover the cover staff and cover the public as well so i think it 's a good idea absolutely anyone wish to speak against i 'm not against it i just want to question some of the policy that saw okay okay so this is a new policy that 's correct so and we 've been wearing uh the body camera since 2016. that 's correct so i 've read the policy and um there 's just a couple of things on there that i think um i would like to see include the reason is is that this this is so just to overcome some of the issues that um people are having um there 's two things that i think that people would well i would like to see in this as well is one is that when the cameras are being worn i 'd like to see them turned on as soon as they leave the vehicle and then turn off when they get back into the vehicle i don 't believe the camera should be turned on halfway through a conversation because we it 's not all the details presented at the time and um and i would like to see officers inform people at the beginning when they are being recorded i know they don 't need to legally but i just think as a courteous thing to um the public i think people should be warned that they are being recorded at the start of the conversation just uh yeah thank you meg through you um the policy actually does um talk about uh the officers using this in that they are to use the body-worn cameras as part of them exercising their powers so from any moment that they 're exercising their powers until they stop exercising their powers those body cameras should be turned on um it in terms of them giving notice it obviously states in the policy that that is best practice to tell people that they are recording i will point out that they are always on the front of their uniforms and they do have recording lights um so they 're not concealed in it in any way i suppose the policy leaves that at the individual 's discretion because sometimes we deal with people who are affected by drugs alcohol or mental health issues and ultimately it 's leaving it in the hands of the officer in the circumstance rather than in the policy requiring it every time but it is best practice and the policy acknowledges that to tell people that they are recording and ultimately as a safety measure um it is in the office 's best interest interest often to tell people that they are recording to mitigate behaviour so the only thing is with the when the cameras are turned off and on um like to see the whole picture not that when they 're actually citing the legislation or the policy that they 're working under that the cameras are turned on i 'd just like to think it would be fair for the whole conversation to be recorded yep through through the mayor uh so that is what they do now i 'm i 'm i 'm i 'm not aware of any situations where the camera 's been turned off halfway through a conversation okay well that 's an operational issue we can discuss offline on that one with the ceo but as far as the policy goes i 'm certainly very much in support of it in this day and age you know there 's certainly circumstances that occur where video evidence is absolutely required you know everyone has different memories of different situations as counselors we often have people come to us telling us that this and this happened and then it 's completely different so having video proof they certainly can 't argue the case i do agree with you that there are circumstances if you walk up it could actually enrage the situation and become more aggressive um it 's obvious that they 're a law officer they 've got a camera on them i think you should automatically assume that you are being videotaped if that 's the case um you know just to protect the officers i wouldn 't like to enforce something that could possibly put them in a more dangerous situation so i do agree in fact it should be on for the moment they exit that vehicle to the moment they get back into the vehicle which i thought was normal common practice anyway um anyone else switched to speaker to the motion council zamato did you have any closing arguments no look that 's and i 'm taking what counselor scomazon said on what you 've just said manker whether whether informing someone they 're being filmed could enroll the situation or not but i think it might work the opposite that people know they 're being filmed and they may their behavior may change completely when they know they 're being filmed all right with that we 'll put it 's carried unanimously thank you 5.6 is our next one which is the public liability insurance the facility high and prescribed activity approvals general policy the recommendation is the council adopts the public liability insurance of facility hire and prescribed activity approvals general policy if you have a move for that one please counselor sorry cancer nolly got in the second there and sonali will pass cancellous comments and would you like to speak to it no okay with that then we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you 5.7 the financial report february 2022 recommendation is the council notes the financial report for february 2022 a mover for this one i 'm happy to move this one seconded by councillor zamotaro as always it 's a report for up-to-date until february which if you just look at it as is it looks amazing but i 'm sure it 's going to change very drastically in the next couple of months and all the bills from things start coming in um but of course thank you as always for keeping speak against no any other comments for no with that then we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.8 the debt general policy 2223 the recommendation is the council adopts the debt general policy 2223 a mover for this one please counselor sorry thank you she 's second to place councilman kieran got in there thank you councillor wisconsin tried to speak to him i know it 's just enough data on the policy has to be done anyone wish to speak against anyone who is to speak for i 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously right that takes us to 5.9 the investment general policy the recommendation is the council adopt the investment general policy and do we have a move for this one please councillors commission seconded by councillor mcewen council 's commission would drive to speak to oh good that 's great thanks anyone we should speak against anyone else wish to speak for we 'll put that to the vote then all those in favor and that 2223 the recommendation is the council adopts the revenue general policy 2223. moving for this conflicts castle nollie second goodbye council mcewen got in there anyone wish to speak against anyone else wish to speak for tonight we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 511 the reserve 's general policy and the recommendation is the council adopts the reserve 's general policy our movement for this one councillor zamotaro seconded by councillor scomason council zamatari that you wish to speak to no anyone wish to speak against anyone else wish to speak for we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.12 rates financial hardship policy the recommendation is the council adopts the rates financial hardship policy mover for this fund please anyone just wish to speak for we 'll put it to the boat then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 513 concealed leak financial assistance policy uh the recommendation is the council adopts the concealed leak financial assistance policy i move it for this one councillor leak and not know about it so i think it 's important that we have this policy in place so people aren 't spending thousands on money they don 't have any which wish to speak against anyone wish um another thing i 'd like to say this is a great policy to help the rate pays of the show with water leaks so hopefully when we get our smart meters in um we 'll have less and less need to be able to use this policy so we 'll put it to the boat then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously we have 514 next the sale of land for overdue rates or charges local government regulation 2012 s1402 recommendation is the council resolves in accordance with s140 that the local government regulations 2012 to sell the land associated with rating assessment 945 832 being lot 10 sp 212 667 to recover overview rates and charges to delegate to the chief executive officer its

further delegate authority to the chief executive officer in accordance with s257 of the local government act 2009 to determine and finalize any and all other matches associated with this resolution a mover for this one please councillor scomazon i 'm happy to second it councillor scomason do you wish to speak to him yeah can i just ask one question here it says that staff and council solicitors have been trying to pursue the rates for over 10 years is there a time limit in how long it takes to to you know do this do is there anything in a policy legislation says up to 10 years if they haven 't paid their rates or is it that we just keep going at all i 'm going to defer to it through the mayor sorry i 'll defer thank you no there is this process could have been done earlier than this but it hasn 't been in the past so this has gotten to this stage now where it 's been seen that everything else we 're not getting any response so no it can be done when three full years of rates are actually owing so from that point we can then undertake okay thanks thank you any much to speak against anyone else wish to speak for all right absolutely agree you know obviously three years um is what 's there we 've given ten so we 've certainly done everything we possibly can in our power and being generous enough to get to this point um if you don 't have any closing moments we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you all right so 5.15 internal audit plan for the year 2022 the recommendation is the council endorsed the annual internal order plan for financial year 2022. remove it for this one please councillor scomason anyone else wish to speak for with that we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously all right that finalizes our agenda items we do have a notice of motion from the councillor the council contacts australia that australia post conduct a survey into mail delivery requirements in this suburb to the council assist if necessary australia opposed to conduct a survey with any available resources and three presents a petition to australia pose that has been tabled or would be totally supposed at the 29th of march douglas shy accounts for ordinary meeting do you join me give the background okay so i 'll read the the background information just add a couple of extra words also um kuya beach is a rapidly growing suburb within douglas and currently there is no male delivery to the residents the population of beach will continue to grow as further housing developments are constructed and data suggests that kuya beach may be one of the most rapidly growing suburb suburbs the increasing population will place increasing strain on the mossman australia brand post branch if the residents are forced to travel the distance to collect their mail the current situation is not ideal as important males sometimes not been promptly attended to and some residents have had difficulty traveling to mossman this notice of motion seeks to assist residents will also be a petition i 'm not sure if you want me to present that now to council later on according to the standing order the petitions that last i 'm not too sure how you would like me to do that and the last thing i 'd just like to say is that um male delivery in any suburb is generally through a um a survey conducted by australian post i do realize very very clearly and very um i do understand that council cannot force australia post uh what has happened in kuya beach is that they have made a a request to australian posts to conduct a survey the last survey being many years ago apparently unsure exactly of the year um and should then the residents of cuba beach vote to not have male delivery to their suburbs so be it but the uh roadblock that residents have contacted me about is that australian post is not even responding about conducting this survey so this is why where i feel council may have may be able to assist the residents of kuya beach is just to have it conducted correctly in the sense that in the past apparently when the survey and this is anecdotal uh commentary that people didn 't know was happening or they got they found out about too late this type of thing so that the survey probably wasn 't um correct for for what really was requested by the residents so that 's why i 'm asking for council to assist in this in this way thank you anyone to speak against i 'd just like to add if i could um you know council has certainly been working on this for quite some time we 've got correspondence from staff that they had been contacting australia post without luck themselves um so i do fully support this i do have the guidelines here um which does actually state that the community may choose to be represented by a local politician such as a federal or state member of parliament i 'm in this situation the local mp constituents will be required to demonstrate it as a representative community etc um if councillor nolly would allow i 'd like to contact a straight post but we actually contact both the state and federal mp um and request that they start doing some work for these for your residents as well i think they may have more power than what we will yeah yeah look i don 't i don 't mind as word into that effect um it may be jumping the gun in the sense that if council contacts australia post they might respond positively already um but i as i said i don 't really have any particular objection to that um so if that 's the case can i put forward if there 's a second before it to add another comment to that that council also contacts the federal mp and the state mp and ask for assistance in um that 's the word i 'm looking for basically advocating for the residents of pune beach yep yes or just off the top line yes that 's why or perhaps so add another point to it that uh council contacts the state and federal mps and asks for assistance in advocating for the kiwi beach residence you 're happy with that recommendation and yeah yes or what i was going to suggest is just a slight amendment to that along the lines of um okay let 's just put this to the boat then and then we can come we can yeah but if we accept this my suggestion of that additional couple of words might be better okay you 're foreshadowing another okay so we 'll vote on that one since i 've put it forward all those in favor so council mckeown council scholars and council occur in cancer okay so that 's carrie so that 's now the amendment now councillor noel you wish to foreshadow another amendment to that well my wording would just be that council okay so on on four would be basically along the lines of that council um advises the state and federal mps of the intention to ask australia post to do a survey and if necessary ask their assistants do you understand that we like that straight place ourselves though we 're just talking basically we 're going to be telling the mps that we 're will need to have a second before yeah the council will advise not ask the state and federal members that council we 'll ask or request i should say perhaps a better word will request australia opposed to carry out a survey and ask for assistance if necessary to advocate for kuya beach residents okay so is there a second to support that is that [Music] so that 's now on the floor for discussion okay so nothing against your suggestion in fact i 'm just trying to make your first one better only only because i just think it 's possible that it won 't be necessary to get them involved so i 'm hoping that that uh additional that amendment essentially says let 's advise us on what we 're doing and if you need to step in to help us then we 'll coming back to you that 's kind of what i was trying to do with that and that 's why i suggest that amendment yes will my response respond to that so because i don 't agree to that so do i give an know council staff have contacted australian posts before and haven 't had any luck that within their conditions for them to do a poll there has to be proven that there is at least 220 articles per day going to that area and that can only be overridden by the the requesting of the state or federal parliament i think that could be one of the stepping blocks and i think that 's why it 's important we 'll just go straight in and get them to start advocating as well for these people because they 've waited so long yeah so did you wish to withdrawal so i can brenda can you just put up um counsel occurs motion see the thing is um council has been assisting staff have been assisting but it has it 's only been a as a conduit almost uh from what i can understand from speaking to the residents and from looking at the emails uh it hasn 't been a real concerted push by council to assist um it might not i said care yes leave it as it is so you to the original one so that 's now the one that we 'll vote on hang on yeah are you okay um i 'd like to also suggest a change as well for the motion is um [Music] that 's just withdrawn yes as withdrawal so now we 're back to my one yeah and now councillor stomason would like to foreshadow an amendment to the one that 's currently on the table which is my one no not your no not your one my one 's the one that 's on the table now okay so so it is it 's sitting here oh yeah yeah yeah absolutely all points together okay four points together okay the changes um cuya beach is not the only area in this show that do not get mail delivered your beach is another one and there are other places around the show that don 't get a whale delivery so i 'd like to add new beach as well for the residents i have tried to three four years ago tried to talk with australia poster getting delivery to your beach but they made it a bit harder so i don 't know if we can say areas of the douglas shire that don 't get uh male delivery or do we have a pacific say cutie beach and i 'd like to add your beach as well because it 's all under the same postcode it 's not it 's different postcodes sorry i need to can i speak here let 's just get this one on the table if that 's okay so we need a seconder for a new recommendation so yeah another point so now she 's just changed the first one to straight posts on behalf of kia beach and new beach residence and request that australia post conduct surveys into mail delivery requirements for these suburbs that be right yeah yeah yeah so request that australia post conducts surveys you 've got a survey at the moment into my delivery i hope that that works yep into these suburbs that 's fine in these and you have to change things in these so it 's only just you know be good for australia so let 's get this one yes castle is second in it and so we 'll vote on that one now to make that the emotions are all those in favor of that one that 's carried unanimously so that 's now the motion that 's on the table yeah now coincidentally i was involved in the survey about 25 years ago i was working part-time for australian waste and the guy from brisbane came up from australia we drove around the whole show hour the reason that cuya beach and your beach don 't have mail services because they didn 't respond nobody nobody responded to the the survey was sent we drove through winemill wongawonga responded the other suburbs didn 't respond and that 's why they 've never had mail service for all these years so whether they don 't know where your beaches i don 't know but that 's what happened and we drove around the whole shire for a few days and these suburbs did not respond i was working for david evening time delivering mail and i ended up working part-time for australia for doing that i this motion now that stands before us the council contacts australia post on behalf of cuya beach and your beach residents and requests the australia post conducts a survey into male delivery requirements in these suburbs assist if necessary australia posts to conduct the survey with the available resources and presents the petition to australia posts that has been tabled at the 29th march which that has you 're still going to do that one well yes i don 't know if you want me as to table and this yes so there 's a link in the motion that abigail sent to that petition and for the purpose of the minutes that will need to be printed wanted to be put into the minutes um i think it 's they may have to print it out and bring it in because he has to be the person who signed it to get access to it okay well all right so perhaps if he prints it out and brings it into the next meeting all right and then we can we can accept it then it can still be utilized need to take that i have to propose an amendment to the current one to take that uh line out because it 's not being presented today so is there a second uh to accept that to take out presents the petition on that one because that will have to be added to the meeting and the next one that accepting petition just thinking should we should we be changed to notes there is a petition okay i 'm quite happy to put that then but sorry brenda if we can just okay and my proposed amendment will be um notes the petition to australia posts which will be presented in a future date april presents councilman q and got in there you 're so happy to second that so everyone that 's in favor of that motion as it stands now so everyone 's in favor of that one show of hands okay so that 's carrick normalcy so that is now the motion that stands before us if everyone 's happy we 'll put that to the vote and finalize this yes i 'm happy with that i now it becomes your move in it and that i 'm not happy with the amendments okay still that change and council on the queue and seconded it so that 's been carried unanimously yes so that 's now the motion before us and that 's what we just put to the vote then which was carried unanimously it 's more difficult than that so that 's it therefore that is the last item on the agenda for today uh which closes our meeting off because that 's it so that 's 10 50 what 's 11 o 'clock on the dot there we go we 're closing the meeting for today thank you very much you _"

    "text": "[Music] man michael kerr having a look at the agenda today a very important one first off and that was the air services a helicopter pad at mowbray can you just tell us a little bit about that and it was good that it went through you you voted to go ahead with this well i believe it 's good you know it 's a really important part of the wenger trail it 's not a commercial tourism helicopter usage it 's going to be for the building of the wenger trail and then for maintenance at a later stage now the applicant went through the staff looked at all the different concerns that came in from the community consultation on that application they went and spoke to professionals in that field as far as environmental concerns go and how to deal with them and they put those conditions within the report so you know we can 't ask for more than that because you know obviously if we put conditions on it and then the council knock it back you know he can take that to court also and been fair and reasonable they 've put conditions on all these environmental concerns there 's no reason why they shouldn 't have gone through so that 's also something that sits with us but i was very happy with the fact that the staff you know did go through the environmental concerns that put conditions there that they have to abide by and of course you know we know what this show is like people will be watching them they will be making sure that they 're adhering to the conditions that are in place and if they don 't then of course council will deal with that so where exactly is this if you can explain it so as you 're going down the highway you come to a 100 kilometer area and you 'll notice there 's two very clear blocks of lands one on the right hand side one on the left-hand side this is on the left-hand side block just before you get to the actual corner where you see the yield point sign you were talking about environmental issues what were they well there 's down there especially with the dugongs of course because there is sea grass there but as the planter said you know the tides there are very large so a lot of the time these helicopters will be taking off tides will be out so they won 't be affected by that point and then they 've put height restrictions on so they have to get to a certain height before they can go across if they happen to see any they can 't go within 500 metres of it there 's different conditions have been put in place to protect them so they 're not disturbed of course your native birds and all that down there as well um a couple people have compared it to the pause and claw site which is incorrect if there 's not castle where he 's down there the paws and claws property got blocked because there was some plants there that could sustain and feed the cassowary if one happened to be there and that was the issue there with that one you know so we 're quite confident that the conditions on done and we 're happy for it to go ahead okay a development change at 24 mcrossen street now i think one of the councillors said it was an eyesore and the other one said it was horrible the balcony there so we 're getting a new shop in there or shops that 's right everyone knows mango jams of course it was an iconic restaurant for many many years as i stated in the meeting you know and people got a great love for mangoes because at some point most people that live here work there or they certainly died there um so some great memories but it 's been empty now for quite some time they did try to regenerate it but didn 't work um and so the owner has sold it of course to these new people and they 're willing to develop it so they 're going to turn into three single shops um that will come straight to the edge of the street footpath with a nice brand area so people can walk past not getting wet and for son etc looks you know new shops for the main street we don 't know what 's going into those shops yet not just yet not our safe places in mossman this is incredibly important for the people who are suffering domestic violence absolutely and this was just a condition that we had to put a governance over the block uh with the federal government please fund it and that 's now just the paperwork done for that for that to occur but it 's great isn 't it it is absolutely amazing you know it 's it 's heartbreaking to see some of these issues that happen in this shower and we have got one of the highest percentages in the state and to have somewhere here in our shire finally so that you know when they 're affected they don 't have to get dragged out to cairns where they 're away from family away from friends kids can 't get to school all those things so and that really is important that you stay in your local area when these things occur so very happy with it warner 's bridge construction project seven dollars a lot of money but gee work needed absolutely it 's a bridge that 's well being in need of some love and care and she 's finally gonna get it and that 'll make it you know a new bridge for people to absolutely have access through especially with wet seasons et cetera then we came to water and wastewater quarterly report now that you know just went through as per norm but then we heard level one water restrictions to begin tomorrow wednesday that 's correct so it does limit when you can water with irrigation systems um but you know it 's still at the slightest end so far um we hope that you know the weather is going to turn very soon and we 're going to have some rain that 's what 's expected so that limitation of having that won 't be for too long disaster management report yeah something i really want people to read you know it 's worthwhile downloading and see what this council does to prepare be ready and he 's able to do if there 's a the start to the finish as far as disaster management goes and it 's well worth the read then we went on to corporate credit card policy you fixed all that up a principal place of residence i 'm not quite sure what that was about it was just a glitch within what we 'd already passed in the planning scheme and that was just to attach a little line in there for the planning scheme because there were certain areas where you know it wasn 't quite fitting in right with the planning and the billing and the accounts and that just had to fix that up that 's been done now that 's for people who are rape who are rate payers in the shire that 's correct colleen said that the ferry had lost 171 000 now that is i guess that is of some concern but there is hope that that will be recurved in the future well exactly as everyone knows you know this is normally the busy period and of course our accounting department accounts for that being busy and getting revenue during that to this announcement now that the borders should be opening on the 17th of december and it 's really important that you know we can make the most out of that so january which is normally accounted for as a quite a month we presume we 'll be very very busy because i 'm quite sure a lot of people will be wanting to get out of melbourne and sydney new south wales victoria get up here have a holiday refresh themselves and of course they 'll be using the ferry and that should generate more income than what we anticipated so therefore hopefully they 'll catch up a bit that 'll be fantastic the christmas period council closed down 24th of december to tuesday the 4th of january council meeting dates you had that operational plans now then you came to the report from the ceo now taking part in that of course was mark stormer and we 've got to give credit to mark for that because it was a great report and he was at the helm ceo was that his at that particular time absolutely so of the council so credibly credit 's due absolutely that 's correct now he was here so he has to be acknowledged as part of that report as well and that probity uh investigation as well he came up very well in that and i pointed that in out in my editorial that uh when they looked at how he 'd handle it spot on exactly the property audit and i 'm hoping people are actually taking notice of it you know it very clearly shows that the ceo and the staff did the right thing they had a right process they had a right concerns as far as everything that they did from start to finish was done correctly and that 's extremely important you know it 's done within the legal frameworks that we have it was done within the appropriate times that we could do things you know so it 's it 's a read that 's well worth reading um i 'm still arguing at the moment with solicitors as far as releasing further data in it i believe that it is in the public interest should be in the public realm as well so i will keep you posted as that comes along the deputy mayor agrees with the elizabeth who originally brought up the motion housing shortage now council annoli actually came up with a really quite a detailed report in the fact that in three month period 48 people in total were looking for houses for one reason or another so we have a housing shortage here yet council knock knocks back development on a rural block which you did at the last meeting yeah unfortunately yeah as was stated we 're bound by different schemes different layers and different plans you know we 're it 's unfortunate that we have a lot of rural blocks that are covered under the state planning scheme as well that you know we just we 'd get a slap across the wrist if we even looked at doing it and that reverse it on us because it doesn 't sit within the plan that was approved so we are pushing very heavily to get that plan updated you know it hasn 't it 's been 10 we need to get the state plan reassessed so when things like that come up we know that we can say okay well that block is appropriate we can subdivide that one because the other blocks around it are all subdivided anyway it 's going to fit you know and that that 's something that this council should be able to do it would be the right thing to do it gives us more rural blocks that you know we can utilize for people that wish to go to a bigger property freeze up units etc in the town so that we get more employees in those places yeah it 's really important that we we do look at all aspects the retirement especially i 've always been a big push to get these retirement villages in because at least then these people are taking up units which you know is an appropriate living for a retiree they can get out to one of these retirement villages where they can live in an appropriate living condition that 's safe for them that 's easy to get around local communities and need to work in the town and not that you 're not doing something already you 've got craigslist and other places too where at least we 're getting some more housing going we certainly are we are we 're pushing as hard as we can to get these estates in and running um you know these things take time though you know we 're looking at a council that you know we have less than 300 properties you know between when we de-amalgamated in 2019 came onto the books so there hasn 't been a lot of you know property development here in the past and you know we 're feeling that now because you know if properties like across the highway for example which i was pushing when i first got in um as a counsellor you know five years six years ago um they 'd be built you know we 'd be having extra residential properties there we wouldn 't be having this issue now so we are suffering for it but we 're working as quick as we can um i know there 's another estate one done in craig lee soon um you know i 'd love to see mossben also open up more so we 've got more housing in this state there but we 're working on all those things now so you know this is temporary we shall move on we shall fix it and i will say you know this isn 't something new you know i remember you know it was only a couple of years ago we had a film being made here as a mini series the pacific and we had no accommodation you know there was nothing here everything was full you know we 've had other occasions where i 've had people come up to me and you know they 're both working full time they 've got 11 year old girl and they 're living in a tent in someone 's backyard because they couldn 't find someone to live and this is not a new thing and something that needs to be fixed this time but you know we have to be conscious that we need facilities we need to have sewage we need well so it is a slow process it 's a process we have to think through properly but we 're working on it and we want to make it happen one more meeting for the year one more meeting for the year that 's correct and then we get to christmas again who would have thought it 's come along this fast yeah easter before we know it okay nick thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "oh put that away um all right good morning and welcome to this special meeting the douglas shire council being held on the 12th of october at the mossman council chambers i hereby give notice in accordance with section 277e of the local government regulations 2012 that the special meeting of council will be restricted in numbers of public attendance because of the health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involving covert 19. the special medium council will be available to view our live stream on council 's website and will be available for others to watch the later time i 'd like to acknowledge the google yolanda people who are the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet today i 'd also like to pay respect to their elders both past present and emerging and extend that respect to any other indigenous australians who may be listening to our meeting this morning i know that all councils are present our acting ceo and we have our finance team here as well we have members in the gallery and of the media here council has takes us on to the agenda items the first one of course is the financial statements for the year ending 30 june 2021 and the recommendation is the council adopts the financial statements for the year and 30 june 2021 and the mayor and the acting chief executive officer uh be authorised to execute the management certificate and financial sustainability statements accordingly i 'm happy to move this one if there 's a second to please thank you councillor summerson springs floor thank you very much to all the staff um for these reports and of course the qtc report is here as well um and absolutely you know under the circumstance is a fantastic result you know as it says we 've caught up close to a million dollars more than what we anticipated um so we had a budget predicted of 2.23 uh deficit sorry 3.66 was the budget deficit and would come in at 2.23 so it 's a great result by the staff and what they 've done um i think mr lean if you would like to start and just have a brief say it you [Music] i would just like to say thank you to the councillors ceo and managers for your support throughout the audit and interview process i want to thank the finance team for all their hard work throughout the year managing the budget the audit process and creating the financial statements especially finance team leaders joe nicholson sandeep tut and asset accountant the financial year for 2021. i like the 2019-2020 year has been a difficult process due to the prolonged financial constraints imposed by covert 19. the financial statements have been audited by queensland audit office and reviewed by the douglas shire council audit committee and are presented for adoption today the operating results as the mayor discussed is a deficit of 2.23 million which is an improvement on the budget and deficit of 3.66 million deficit is due to the ongoing budgetary impacts of covert 19 and the reduced revenue base from which the budget transpires council officers have managed to somewhat mitigate the impact of profit 19 by identifying savings without any reduction in services with hard work this will eventually be turned around with projected surplus budget result a sorry operating budget operating result is better than budgeted due to increased revenue from fees and charges including search fees property fees and tipping fees increasing grant revenue our financial assistance grant lifted disaster grant revenue and other income including transport and main roads contract works and some additional recycling income we also have savings in expenditure particularly electricity i.t projects landfill and depreciation thank you thank you anyone like to speak against the report we 'll take it to any other comments from counsellors there just well done yeah i think we 're really lucky that do we have a good finance team and it 's uh it 's worked out quite well especially with the situation we 're in what the country 's in as well so welcome wonderful any other comments from councillors i 'd just like to say well done as well and there are some surprising things in there like even the increased revenue with the ferry in these times with all the discounts that are given and lack of people around so that 's interesting yeah then fairy wasn 't surprised month however since then it 's um it 's a bit volatile at the moment we really need a crystal ball to predict what 's going to happen but yeah it did pull in at the last minute which was unexpected and in a good fashion absolutely all right with that then we 'll put that to the vote all those in favour our next item on the agenda is the daintree ferry probity audit the recommendation is that council receive and note the property audit of a procurement and contract solutions reporting relating to the dainty ferry services presented to the douglas fire council board committee and to publish the property audit of procurement and contract solutions relating to the daintree river ferry service report onto the council 's website do you have a mover for that one councillors thomason i 'm happy to second that 's um yeah this is something that i brought to council um as a motion because i think it was very important that people the shire had an insight in exactly how things had panned out the reason i asked for this to was just to ensure that council followed correct procedures in doing tenders contracts and negotiations so i 'm happy with the probably audit i think it does give the community a clear picture on how council conducted itself in doing this i just like to say one thing is that the auditor has put in here matters for noting and i think that 's something that council needs to follow and one thing in particular that and i have said on numerous occasions is that counselors need to be involved a lot more and it 's through all processes so i think you know we are the go-to person with the community so we need to be informed in better timelines with all major things with the council but otherwise i 'm happy with how the probably order come out and um and it gives a really good timeline of what 's happened over that long time with negotiation and tendering for that very contract thank you now wish to speak against councillor zamatara through you mankind look firstly i 'm not arguing against the concept of the property order a probably order what i 'm arguing against is the way the report 's been presented i agreed to have a probe report because i assume that all key stakeholders would have been consulted and from what i 've read in this report that hasn 't happened not all key stakeholders have been consulting look there 's terminology in there such as it is understood to me that 's that 's lacking documented evidence it is understood that 's that to me is lacking um i 'd like to be a bit more specific but i can 't_''_589.279 as this document is still labeled confidential so we can 't disclose what 's in here and i i can 't see how we 're being asked to present this to past this and when the public have not seen it nobody 's you know and until my concerns are answered i can 't in good faith pass this until the public have had the opportunity to have a look at this report i think it needs to go further we need to look at this further before it we 've had concerns about it because of them issues of water so i 'd like to see the matter deferred until we can discuss it further until these concerns are answered anyone else wish to speak in the affirmative well yes i am i 'm happy with the report i was going to make comments on it but apparently we can 't now so um i just hope all the people who have received misinformation can go to this report at some point and have a look and then if they need to ask questions but i think it 's based on fact there 's thousands of documents that were viewed this is an independent person and he 's come up he 's very experienced person and he 's come up with his conclusion i think it 's good i 'll just say people read it and make a judgment from there well that 's something people can 't read yeah i know they 're confidential yeah well i 've done about passing but in time instead of just making comments they can read the facts anyone else wish to speak against um you know i 've compiled a list of a dozen or so questions that for my own clarity good governance and peace of mind before i can note and receive this report as requested by recommendation that i need to have answered so in addition to depending on the end up upon those answers i may not feel it is in the best interest of the public to vote in favor of receiving this report uh for me there 's just too many questions that yet to be unanswered um furthermore to this i find it very difficult to vote in favor report that 's not attached to this recommendation um that is to be published on the website in some future day and i don 't know the final format that it 's going to take so until that is [Music] clarified i cannot vote in favor of this recommendation thank you well i absolutely will be supporting this motion which will finally allow the community to see the process that occurred in relation to this dangerous ferry contract it was unfortunate due to the confidentiality of negotiations being put out in the public through social media on the process that occurred and most importantly i believe that this document highlights the factual reasons as to why this council took the actions it did to ensure the best result for our community in both economical and practical uh the report was compiled by local by probity it 's an independent and well-respected organisation the gentleman john lee is a highly experienced and property specialist has many years worth of specializing this area and he was assisted by wendy harris a senior property specialist who also has lots of experience in this area and also a lot of time working with the triple c so her legal ability on this report certainly did assist this property audit was conducted to ensure the community that this council 's actions during the negotiations were legal followed a correct process and that acted in the best interests of the community that it represents it wasn 't a investigation into who said what said he said she said it was based on what this council did the actions that this council did and is why council is the main person that this report is based on so i have no problems with supporting this motion with that then we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor councillors constant occurred councilman all those against canceling councillors and atari the motions carried they is that is the only two items on today 's agenda that concludes today 's meeting thank you very much for those who came and attended and we 'll close the meeting at 10 12 please _"

    "text": "[Music] michael kerr um a very quiet meeting today really and lots of unanimous decisions just how council meetings should be it was well done well spoken well thought out people at the information in front of them and they all agreed to everything so it was good okay let 's go through the agenda combined development for dual occupancy and reconfiguring down a lot one at 56 mudlow street in port douglas uh this is kind of good development isn 't it it is nathan vera i have to say does some fantastic projects in the shire and this is going to be another one the designs suit what our planners are looking for and of course the buildings will be an asset you know they 're good properties and so we 're quite happy to subdivide the land into the two blocks it fits in with the planning scheme and you know the staff give gave their blessings of course we 've given ours too the second item was infrastructure charge 5146 captain cook highway at oak beach now this was a bit of a dispute over infrastructure could you just explain what happened well under the planning scheme when people put in an application for a venue like to have a wedding venue council will calculate the amount of usage of our on our infrastructure and charge them accordingly and if you go through for that type of uh wedding catering normally would they be about 13 000 worth of infrastructure charges but if you look at the application he 's not going to be using all time it 's going to be minimal amounts you know it 's going to be a small amount of people as well and to to justified counsellors thought you know we need to charge according to what he 's actually going to be using on the land so the staff did some psalms came back to us with another figure and we find that 's appropriate unless that covers all the road usage when these guests are going to be staying at hotels so they 're going to be using water they 're going to be using sewerage and you know all those things will cover over the years so given and what is that appropriate and that was about five just over five thousand i believe from 13 down to five yes sanity prevailed well it 's a logical and that 's what we ask you know is that when these applications come in everyone 's given fair and you know just cause and the other staff looked at it realistically and we 're happy with the result uh on to item three ultra filtration cartridges uh now you 'd think that 's oh only a small little one there 253 440 dollars absolutely and anyone who 's watched the water videos would have seen the cartridges they do show them they 're like a plastic tube with little fine spaghetti in them and the water brushes through that and it takes out the bacteria now there 's only one company that actually makes those so therefore because we can 't go through a normal procurement process of asking people to attend to florida we have to have a council resolution just to ensure we 're covering our bases and that that 's what that motion was for and 's not cochise nothing to kochi might have a little business on the side there let 's move on to the smart water meters 670 000 worth um smart meters i mean this brings us into the 21st century doesn 't it i mean how fantastic it 's going to be you 'll be able to see your water usage on a daily basis using your smartphone and that 's what we want you know we do have an aging infrastructure here in douglas and quite often you find that people do get water leaks and they don 't know about them until their water bill comes in and then it 's mad panic stations because they get this extortionate bill you know and unfortunately we 've made the water it 's cost us and therefore the cost is passed on to the ratepayers having this system at least they 'll be able to see their water usage on a daily basis if they do happen to get a leak they can see it straight away and they will get notified by council as well that their water usage has place and it will be a great just a great asset for this show as far as our water consumption goes on to dog registration now this is an interesting one because uh the deputy mayor lisa scomazon was a little fearful that council officers although they had the right to go onto people 's property she wanted to make sure that they didn 't sort of open the gates uh go in while people weren 't there now dog registration obviously is very important absolutely and it 's it 's it 's legislated by the state government you know every dog after six weeks or 12 weeks old has to be registered it 's that simple and we 're the policing body for it so if there comes cases where dogs aren 't registered and they go to court the first thing you 'll be looking at is well what 's council 's process what have we done to ensure that they 've been registered you know when there 's a dog attack on the beach if council officers are investigating it it 's really hard to find a dog 's lost you know they pick a dog up on the street no microchip no tag how we 're going to find the owner so then becomes onerous and cost wise to try and find the owners so ensuring your dog 's registered covers all bases for council and it 's legislation it needs to happen it 's law so by doing this process you know and i agree with council scholars and we don 't want the right payers to think that we 're coming down on them and we 're going to be belting down cutting locks to get that 's not the case what they 'll be doing is progressively going through the estates listening out for dogs if a dog barks they know there 's a dog there you know and then they 'll look at the paperwork and say well there 's not one registered here we need to follow this up and we 'll send them a letter or we 'll follow up and visit again when they 're home so it 's going to be a gentle process we 're giving people if it 's not registered that simple do it now get it registered and you won 't get a fine when this happens do we do a chip or do we do a tag we do a tag here so you can get microchips from the vet that 's a different thing to the registration of your animal within council with council when you register you get a tag and that 's a lifelong tag we won 't issue another one unless you ask for one they used to send them out yearly so you got a different color every year so you can see waste of plastic you know and that 's the last thing we want to do so now you just get one tag if it breaks or if you lose it to what the case may be contact cancel they 'll reissue with another one now does this cost people money registering the dog does initially and then it 's a yearly basis but if you 've got your dog desexed like it should be it 's i think it 's about 30 a year right you 'll have a bit of a campaign and letting people know about it give them a bit of notice about this absolutely they 'll be advertising to say that it 's time get out there register your dog now because we 're about to do some checks okay the financial report that 's usually fairly dry when we talk about these things however in this cover time and the ferry costs that you had and the purchase of the ferry and all that we 're told by tara killeen the chief financial officer that this month august might be a bit dodgy well unfortunately everyone 's suffering at the moment the lockdowns have hit everyone you know we certainly weren 't anticipating it everyone thought we were going to have a bumper season and that 's i think what 's hurting our businesses even more is last year we knew it was going to be quiet you know that we just dealt with it this year we thought we were going to be in for a bump a year and suddenly the carpet was ripped out from underneath us we 've budgeted this we 've got staff trained we 've done all this work council is no different you know we 've allocated our budgets assuming that things were going to be going good this year so when the ferry you know quietens down we stop getting revenue from that that affects our budget and that 's what kara was saying with this report this first one being july it 's only in you know the start of the financial year so you can 't really tell much from it other than you know basically how we 've been trading but there 's lots of things still outstanding that will need to be added through it as we move forward but it 's a report we have to approve it monthly and we have done then it went on to seoul supply register that was covered pretty well and that 's just the people that supply you and that list changes from time to time now this will be of interest to people rates increase grace period extension unanimous and i guess for people who are finding it a this is an additional it 's a good news story to get the word out there that don 't stress if you haven 't got the money right now to pay it you 're not going to be charged interest on normally there 's an eight day crace period but we 're going to give you a 30-day grace period because we understand that times are tough and things out there just aren 't going to plan so you know and i i think it 's also a good sense to be able to get a story out to people that if you can 't afford to pay your rates bill contact council don 't just bury it and say i can 't afford it you 'll start getting interested that things will start happening on this side ring them up say listen i can 't afford it what can you do to help and they will assist you you know the council staff are good at that they 'll go through the process with you what they can do now the draft reconciliation action plan long overdue this one going to see with this well as i said in the meeting this is walking the walk rather than just talk from the talk and it goes through and it really stipulates all the different things the council can do to show that we are an inclusive organization as far as you know what we do with employing staff as far as what we do with um the different activities within the shire to be inclusive you know it lists everything it 's a fantastic document and i am so proud of margaret and the work that she 's done for this council and getting it to this stage and realistically this is the first stage but as margaret has said we look at this council we 're actually at the next stage so it 's not going to be too long before we get the next sign off but it 's got to go through a process and it 's got to go to reconciliation australia they 'll sign off on the first one we 'll confirm that we 're doing everything appropriately and we 'll take the second 'll determine i want to get this through as quickly as pro as possible and make sure that we 're doing the best we can for our first nations people i think it 's fantastic and i 've got to give you a wrap on this because really this council does a lot for the indigenous community and really recognizing it even the painting behind you right now is an indigenous painting so it 's great to see and everybody needs to be inclusive including the rest of the shire absolutely this is our history this is now these people have been here for millions of years you know they know this land they understand how this land works and if we 're not paying attention to how this country is supposed to work we 're just going to destroy it you know they they know this land and you know some of their history it 's just so fascinating you know and it 's worth bringing that out and making sure that everyone 's aware of what they were what they 've gone through since white men arrived here make sure that we are one united nation and they are part of us and not a separate entity yeah and it 's working well for the federal government is working that way as well and state governments but on a local level i think the douglas shire council does an incredible job uh we moved on to the black spot towers now could you just explain what went on there well i think was back in the 80s it would have been that um there 's a lot of areas that were missing out on free-to-air television and back then of course was only seven or eight seven channels that he was if that and so the federal government did a funding scheme where they put these repeater towers up where you know council could look after them and these people be able to get that free-to-air tv and these locations work well you 've got one up in um cal bay there 's one in daintree village and there 's one in shannon vale and you know over the years it 's been 30 odd years they 've haven 't_''_688.72 been upgraded by anyone but council and because television has changed so much between changing to digital you know you 've now got 22 channels you know it 's it 's too hard for council to be forking out thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep upgrading and maintaining these towers for television you know that 's the television stations and the state government 's jobs to be doing not you know council 's jobs so the one in cal bay that got to a point where it 's just completely unrepairable so we had to turn that one off and it 's been sitting there for the last uh year and a half i believe it is so that motion was to decommission that one pack it down all together it 's never going to be used the one for daintree village was giving the daintree village people notification that we hope it will last until june next year it is minimal amount of channels on it they certainly don 't get all the channels that are available and there 's certainly ways where these people where they can get a lot better reception a lot better as quality as the amount of channels they can get go out and do it now and don 't wait to the last minute the third tower of course is the one that 's in shannon vale and so we 're doing a survey on that one to find out how many residents out there are actually using that tower you know whether it 's worthwhile for council to be forking out more money to keep fixing that tower or a lot of these people are already on foxtel and sky mast and all those things already so we just want to know where we sit with that one before we make any decisions with it good stuff uh now we 've got a couple of items reef to reef that 's the the bikes you know uh having their race uh now they wanted twenty thousand or fifteen thousand you worked out twenty thousand per year over three years uh a great event for us it certainly is you know this is an event that used to be finishes on four mile beach um i love the fact that it 's a race that 's in douglas you know it finishes here in port douglas so therefore all the competitors all the spectators they hang around they have lunch they have dinner they stay in accommodation it makes it a worthwhile event for us to look after and i mean like other some other events unlike some other events that unfortunately finished in cairns and just use our roads but that 's another story of course so yeah i 'm happy with this one because we 're putting money into marketing it gives us our branding out there it gives us advertising and it allows us to do other events around it as well which is a great thing wonderland spiegeltent they wanted fifty five thousand per year over three years plus ten thousand dollars in kind uh before we get to that what 's in kind mean for those people who don 't know what that means so in kind is an expense that councils occur so if we send workers out there to put up some put bollards up um direct traffic all those sorts of things where council will incur a cost for it whether it be staff labor or you know things we may have here if they need a bit of gravel that we 've already got those sorts of things are in kind if we have to go out and purchase them that 's not in kind that would be you know classified as the cash destination or cash grant funding etc well unanimous wonderland spiegel tent will be there for uh 22 23 and 24. absolutely i love this venue it 's one of the best things that 's come to douglas it really is you know i think anyone who 's been to the speegle 10 understands that it is an absolute asset for carnival the different acts that uh knockout events bring you know it 's entertaining every time you know i know i 'll never look at popcorn again the same after the last show as a learning experience for me um but you know and it 's entertainment and that 's what we want you know that out there and be able to enjoy themselves you know and to be able to get people from not only in the shire our locals but you know tourists people from cairns people from all around this area come to port douglas they spend money in the restaurants and the bars they could see some good quality entertainment and you know go home and we have some memories of some great times they had here in port douglas and finally the mossman district show wanted 20 000 a year in kind only i mean i didn 't think that was uh too much to ask well it 's not but it still comes out of our budget even though it 's in kind it 's still a cost to cancel and comes out of our budgets that has to be allocated for what a show though oh exactly you know it 's a great show and people come from again from all around the regions you know to mossman and spend money in mossman and that 's fantastic and yeah these people they 'll come here enjoy a great day it gives people an opportunity especially the kids to have some fun outdoors which is always good rather than sitting at home playing on a playstation um which is really really important and you know and these people again more than likely will go to the daintree if they 've come here from somewhere else they 'll go to port douglas and spend money in in douglas shire and that 's really important michael kerr thank you for an old-fashioned council meeting today thank you very much and as always don 't forget if you 're going to do it you do it in douglas [Music] _"

    "text": "[Music] michael kerr the first item on the agenda today a very interesting one and a lot of debate about it building douglas committee this sounds like an amazing idea tell us about it it 's something that we 've been discussing since the new term um and it 's been stalled and hasn 't progressed because of covert and issues we 've had but after the last meeting where councillor zamotaro brought up about transparency i thought it 's important that we bring this to the forefront and make it happen so the building douglas committee which is a unofficial version of but it is official at the same time it 's quite hard to explain in short terms but it 's having another council meeting where it 's not so strict we don 't have to rely on the standing orders and the people that are involved in the matters we 're discussing have an opportunity to register come in and they get three minutes to have their say in front of the councillors so we get to get a first-hand personal experience from the people that are from the start but it gives a personalized sense to it it brings in the transparency it allows us to see the people that are actually involved in it if they wish to come in and have their say and it just makes us feel more comfortable when making these decisions and that 's what the the building douglas committee is about is being more open giving people more opportunity to come in and speak to the councillors before their matter 's been you know heard this is normal down south at council meetings i 've been to many council meetings down south where the public are invited to speak for several minutes so it 's nothing new there is is it a matter of councils like ours catching up now well it can be quite daunting you know it 's it 's scary when people come in and can be saying something that could be confronting to the counselors you know so you do open yourself up to you know these people coming in to telling you emotionally how they 're feeling as well so you know some councils 's something that we that is done in a lot of other places and it 's something we absolutely have to look at we have a very passionate shower here we have a lot of people that like to be heard they want to be heard and they 've got a right to be heard when we 're using their rate pay and money to do projects so it 's really important that you know i believe that if people have that opportunity you know it gives them more ownership of you know council as well and i think that 's really important councillor noli and zamatara didn 't seem to get it there was a lot of questions from both those councillors one of them was one of the comments they made these people haven 't_''_157.76 been trained but they don 't need to be trained they 're members of the public well we 're talking you know emotionally how this is going to affect people for example a an item could be coming in where a big resort 's being built next door to your house and of gonna be affected by that and it 'll give them this hypothetical of course gives them an opportunity to come in and have their say how it 's going to personally affect them having this big hotel built next door you know which is not something we read on a piece of paper you know that when the staff do their reports they do them very legal wise and they 're very technical and it gives you all the facts without the grey lines so this at least gives us an opportunity to bring in some personalized actual feelings and emotions of how our ratepayers will feel by the decisions we make and puts the face to that agenda item absolutely it does yeah it 's that 's really important now we had the second item a minor change development approval for retirement facility 111 to 119 port douglas road can you explain that for us well it 's just a simple change when it first went through they said they had to have footpaths in there as well i 'm looking at numerous other retirement villages of similar styles that many traffic that much traffic going through um so they asked if they could possibly have the footpaths taken out so it allows them to expand other areas and that 's what 's been approved now you deferred the next one which is infrastructure change for a limited function facility lot 5 146 captain cook highway at oak beach why was that deferred there 's more information 's required and you know the report gave us a lot of details from the staff and the factual information um but we 've just believed that there 's more to it that we need to look at before we make a formalised decision okay application to extend currency period for roll roll um one lot into 68 lots can you explain that and and let people know too that it 's uh it 's actually the block uh behind the seventh day adventist and jehovah 's witness here in moscow yeah that 's right so it 's a housing estate and mossman was approved by a previous council um their term is about to expire as far as their contract goes just put in for a renewal to last for another six years so it gives him permission that yes it 's still approved you 've got another six years before you have to actually start it it 's in amongst other land that 's uh you know how would you describe it it 's just land that is used for crops or something like that it 's just cane land at the moment yeah okay uh now run for refunding yes so it 's a group that 's um organizing a very large event um they 've come to us before and showed us their promotional videos that they 're using to get funding from state and federal as well what is it is it a bike or running or it 's a run but everyone does at the same time so this year because of cover they 're sticking to australia and to new zealand like a city debate type races all happening at the same time so you 're competing with people that are running on the other side of the country oh wow yeah so and the the reef which is well needed but when they eventually do it there 's going to be races throughout the whole world so you know you will have you 'll be timed here in australia but where possible at the same time they 'll be running in japan and you 'll be competing against them as well and so as it works its way around the world with the time zones everyone will be racing will be based on their times but you 're competing with someone who 's running in america as well the same distance so there 'll be big scoreboards at each the event showing each areas of what 's happening and what time she 's trying to be fantastic idea and it all brings back to port douglas where all the the final um event will be eventually uh for this year it 's where all the presentations and the big party will be for all the winners of the the 20 that they 're doing uh next year that 'll bring some more money into our economy as well sounds like an amazing idea river members saying 6.3 million has already gone into our douglas shire with this that 's right terrain does a wonderful job when it comes to the river restoration works and you know this is part of the thing we 're allowing them to do rather than applying for funding ourselves so much easier they know what they 're doing let them do it they 're doing a great job as you said they 've already spent 6.8 million they 've managed to raise the funds to do this work and let them do it and what is the work they do was river restoration where there 's been erosion farmers are losing property etc they do the works to regrow plants and to build it back so the stops are raining okay now when i first heard this i went oh no electric quad bikes four mile beach i 'll correct you straight away it 's electric quad bike oh sorry electric quad bike yes not bikes i don 't care as soon as i heard it i went oh no what are you doing but it 's it 's and you 've helped him out just explain it exactly he 's a gentleman that 's lived here for over 30 years he 's always enjoyed the region walking along the beach and he 's at a place now where he 's unable to get down to the beach to walk along it he 's tried various different types of wheelchairs they haven 't worked for him so he 's come up with this concept of using electric quad bike it doesn 't make a noise it 's not going fast his carer has to walk beside him so it 's not going to be hooning on the beach it is a special circumstance and it 's coming with conditions so as i said in the meeting this is not an open slather that we 're allowing quad bikes in port douglas so you know before they even start on that one i 'm nailing it on the head right here and now this is a gentleman with a disability who loves the environment loves walking the beach and he wants to be able to at least still go about why are we to stop him let 's let him do it yes that was unanimous smart meters you 've deferred yes this um we 're putting through the tender for the contractor there 's a couple other issues still that are sitting there that their staff are trying to work out at the moment before we sign off on it and we want further information on that so we 've just deferred that to the next meeting lots of uh housekeeping as well the financial report how we 're going well we 're going good i mean it 's anticipated that we 'll be you know 400 000 i believe it was under the budget that we set so that lowers the deficit of what we ran this year which is fantastic f on the staff you know they 've saved 400 000 across the board for the year um you know we 're anticipating that 's what it is once those final figures come through that 'll certainly be made public but you know the staff are certainly doing a fantastic job and you know it 's been done for covert and you know giving people relief on their um licenses and all those things in the ferry especially we dropped a lot of ferry revenue um so it 's it 's important the staff are acknowledged for the work they do order restrictions level amendments so what does that mean and how do you see us uh because we did get a little bit of rain so we 're not as bad as some years yeah luckily this year we 're tracking okay we 've still got a fair bit of water there which is great but these new restrictions at least allow us to go into warning stages so if we can foresee that it 's going to happen we can change from a zero to a one and start educating people this is happening this is coming up you need to stop using as much water start reducing it naturally before we enforce the restrictions sale of council land and i take it that you have council land you can sell and this might this might be for people who want to have maybe aged the shy we need more people here don 't we absolutely there 's some comments that uh within the operational plan thing was the council and only brought up you know these are things that we 've discussed in workshops where the staff have brought a list of vacant blocks that council owns that you know we could possibly sell if we want to use for the different infrastructure i 'm not a big one of selling land just for that i 'd like to know that if we 're selling it we 're selling someone who 's going to do something on it and something specific that will increase employment increase accommodation increa you know do something for our economy rather than just them holding on to a block of land somewhere else you know retirement absolutely it 's imperative that we start looking after our older generations you know it 's at a point we 've got older people living in two-story apartments or flats in port douglas you know there comes a point staircases are you know become too difficult we need to have appropriate proper housing they can see their last years out and comfortable safe surroundings because we 've missed the boson this before haven 't we well i think we have yeah you know there was a gentleman who wanted to put a retirement village in port douglas you know it was quite controversial because it was on the wrong side of the road a lot of people don 't believe there should be any development on that side of the highway yeah it 's going to come a point that we 're going to have to that 's land that doesn 't flood you know it wouldn 't be affected by tide inundations from cyclones etc it 's a safe place for them you know so that would have been a fantastic opportunity for a safe place for retirees to be um and live out their lives in an appropriate type of housing we 've missed that one but yeah let 's see what the future brings another interesting meeting thank you mayor kerr thank you very much don 't forget if you got to do it do it in douglas you _"

    "text": "[Music] some blocks some parcels of land don 't quite fit into residential they don 't fit into rural can you just explain what went on here it 's very frustrating in that area especially around mowbray under previous regimes of councils such as when we were cairns they were allowed to cut their blocks up into smaller sections and there are some blocks that are left over at the moment that are halfway in between they 're smaller than the 40 that they need to be under our planning scheme but you know that they 're too big just to be a rural farm like it 's for a little house a hobby type thing and so we 've got quite a few these blocks left over that are too big to be a rural house but too small to be a rural farm so you know people like this applicant have come forward and asked if they can cut it in half and turn it into two rural house blocks but unfortunately because of the way our planning scheme is and the way the state planning scheme is we were to say yes to it and override the planet so it 's homework we need to do as a council and you know i will be pushing forward with the staff to look at this and see how we can go about changing you know small parts of our planning scheme to allow these little properties that fall through the cracks and we 're certainly not talking about breaking apart our agriculture areas we don 't want that we need to retain our agricultural areas but for these small blocks that are in that little section there we certainly need to do something for them a bit of tweaking so just a bit of tweaking exactly or a permanent road closure rasmussen road cassowary uh can you explain that to me just an old road reserve that goes through a person 's property you know they 're just cleaning it up and they want to take hold of that land so they put an application in uh now trustee leases registration of terms for trustee leases uh lisa s had a few problems with this well there are what the staff are doing they 're going through um some of these old leases that we have with various different bodies and working out what they 're supposed to be doing what they 're not supposed to be doing do they even have a lease in place etc so yeah it 's really important that council does have leases on all the people that utilize our land etc and we 're in that circuit and you know they 're cleaning it up and that 's really important they 're doing that and of course this policy is now just tightening all that up revoke busking general policy um so how do you feel about busking now you have the entertainment background with the clink and what have you um what 's your thoughts on buskers well i love buskers i think buskers create a great atmosphere but if you look at port douglas and the way it is there 's really nowhere where buskers can go that 's on council land as such that they 're not going to be interfering with accommodation properties and this is the problem someone 's out playing bongos in front of a hotel etc so it was silly for us to give them permission to do it the police were going to move them on so the best place for them to go is on private land and there are different areas like the port village shopping centre for example you quite often see the buskers in there that 's on private land it 's out of council 's touch and you know that 's up to them to deal with the owners of that private land and make a deal with them to sit on it but again if they 're making a noise and disturbing the police will step in and of course move them on yeah the buskers are great in areas like cairns but they 've got big malls and there 's locations for them to go at the moment we don 't really have anything like that in the area and of course if someone 's down busking at rex mill park they 're not going to be interfering with someone so again just fall under bylaws instead 's that about fantastic it 's a body that um you know encourages council to do things for the right way for small businesses and it 's a charter they 've got to ensure that we 're doing all the appropriate things that are best for our small businesses and of course we 've agreed to that we want to become part of it and yeah we look forward to working with them to ensure that we are doing the right thing with all our small businesses tourism port douglas daintree resources performance agreement uh four hundred thousand dollars twenty one twenty two four fifty thousand dollars twenty to twenty three and five hundred thousand dollars two thousand twenty three to twenty four now there was a fair bit of discussion on this um councillor noley wanted to give them four years well that 's right you know they originally they came to us and asked us for four year term um but you know as i and i agree with the fact that that may be what they want but i 'm not going to make decisions for the before and you get suddenly these costs and where you can 't get out that because you 've got a contract for it the next term of council they can decide what they want to give tpd so we 've given them enough to cover up until they 're covered till 24th um there 's an election in 24 you know and that new council when it 's elected they can decide themselves what they want to fund the tourism body anything can happen between now and then lisa scomasson said you know council hasn 't won lotto that was a quote from her and we may be paying them too much two hundred and fifty thousand dollars they are okay with that why aren 't we paying them that and uh and why are we paying them more well there certainly used to get a lot more than that but you remember last year i had a lot of concerns with what they were doing with the money and how they were doing the marketing and why they were doing the marketing because they never had any proper documentation this last financial year to do that groundwork get a destination tourism plan in place get a brand strategy in place get an event strategy in place so you know what you 're actually advertising for and why you 're advertising who you 're advertising to you know and so you 're hitting those right markets so you know you 're going to get bang for buck for your money now they 've done that groundwork they 've done a lot of work over the last year they 've presented these documents to us so at least now we 've got confidence saying okay we give you 400 000 you 're going to be using it to hit the right markets that we actually really want and we will get the best bang for buck for a dollar you know and that 's was the important part for me to make sure that we know that the spending that we 're giving them is actually going to be for the benefit for this shire as far as our tourism goes and now to me is the right time to be that it wouldn 't be what required this year we did a lot of work with tt and q as well to ensure that the tourism has remained but now we 've got of course moving forward hopefully the international borders within 12 months time will be starting to open up and we will be in the right market because we 've done the next 12 months with the marketing overseas as well as domestically to ensure that the tourists want to come here it 's interesting too marieba council you were saying at the meeting around about 700 thousand dollars to the tourism their local tourism so we 've got to compete we do and we 're not the only ones when you consider the gold coast and sunshine coast and byron bay all these places they 'll be pumping money into their tourism so while 400 000 really isn 't a lot of money when it comes to advertising and tourism so they spread that quite thinly throughout a lot of different areas a lot of different fingers and they contribute to a lot of bigger projects so have 400 000 as far as advertising for 12 months for an international destination it 's not much you know and i really do hope now we 've got all this data and we 've got this information it can be used really smartly douglas chamber of commerce you 're helping them as well well last year of course we gave them a a grant of the fifty thousand dollars and they had to do certain work over 12 months because the way that the annual general meeting fell they didn 't actually sign the contracts till later in the year i think it was september when they signed the contract so they didn 't actually start using that or progressing through it until after september so they 've come to us and saying listen we 're still three months behind um because we started late can we just extend it again until september and so that 's what we 've done which has given them that longer period to finish what they 're required to do do you believe the chamber of commerce is doing enough you know i more but it 's a really hard one because the people you know that run the chamber they 're busy themselves at the moment they 've all got small businesses and they 're crazy busy they 're all volunteers um i believe they 've now got one part-time person who 's helping and that 's certainly you can see that through the emails that are coming out they 're very pro proactive and that they 're good at getting some details through to us now do they need a full-time person well i think most chambers do you know certainly check hands chambers got a full-time person um it would be great if they could get one but the budgets again that aren 't there unless the businesses support chamber so all the small businesses need to become members you know those memberships go to funding that body and you know the more that join it the more money they 've got they could possibly get you know a full-time person in there to you know make sure they 're interacting properly with the businesses but yeah i think they and the fact that they 're all busy themselves and they 're small businesses um there 's certainly an improvement on what it used to be you can definitely see that i 've you know there 's lots of events there 's breakfasts they have lots of meeting they 're bringing people up here they 're doing training sessions yeah and that 's what we want from them great barrier reef legacy came up next council grants now this was interesting they 're changing a project they 're changing the name of a project to wales i think can you please explain that one so they put a grant application into do a project and unfortunately because of external resources then haven 't been able to succeed in progressing with that project so they 've come back to us and said listen we don 't want to give the money back to you because we 've got lots of great projects this is another one that we 're looking at would you consider allowing us to do this project instead which involves the whales and we looked at it and funding also so we just waited up rather than taking the money back off then we 'd much rather see them do a good project and so we 've changed that so that allowed them to do it qao interim management letter and would you were talking about risk management there and councillor zamotaro said and i think the other councillors were interested as well there was information in that about the daintree ferry and they didn 't know about that now did they need to know that not really everyone knew there was a risk there was a discussion that was had with the audit committee and that the audit committee is there to formulate different issues council may happen and may come across and of course risk management 's one of those things so a report was given to the order committee and on that one of the things was the dangerous ferry now as i said at the meeting if you didn 't think the daintree failure was a risk for the council and the place we 're at something 's really wrong okay we hadn 't to go what direction we 're taking with it so of course it was a risk and it 's something that was discussed with the audit committee but nothing that wasn 't discussed with the councillors at workshops uh thank you thank you very much kerr thank you very much and don 't forget if you 're going to do it do it in douglas _"

    "text": "[Music] we live in one of the most beautiful places on earth where the rainforest meets the reef we are surrounded by a pristine environment that is teeming with unique flora and fauna for which we have a duty to protect and sustain and this goes for our water too we hope by the end of this journey you will see why every drop counts we 're incredibly proud of the quality of our drinking water a lot of hard work has gone into building infrastructure that not only supports our customers but also respects the pristine rainforest environment that our water comes from in this video we 're going to unpack the journey your water takes from the source all the way to the tap in your home and you 'll meet the people who play an active role in maintaining and supplying this essential service [Music] there are three intakes that supply water to customers within douglas shire daintree intake located at intake creek wire bill intake located at little falls creek and mossman intake located at rex creek let 's explore the journey your water takes from all begins here at rex creek which is a tributary of the mossman river and forms part of the mossman gorge flowing down from the mountains the water first ends up here at the intake it 's pretty quiet at the moment but during the wet season this whole area can be submerged by raging waters thundering through smashing against the giant boulders and creek banks before heading downstream and through the gorge we try to be here three times a week this is a water catchment area for the greater mossman area and we 've got to make sure things are clean all the infrastructure is still in good shape we have the throat which collects the water and then it 's virtually just a channel which leads down to where the actual what we call the intake screens itself which filters the water into town and this is where the real journey begins next stop the mossman water treatment plant [Music] the water treatment plant is where all water extracted at rex creek intake is treated and here is the same mains pipe we followed from the intake around australia we follow very strict national standards to ensure that our drinking water is clean and treated to the highest standards to protect public health it 's a process with many steps along the way including filtering testing and treating let 's show you what we do turbidity levels are checked at the intake in the trunk main and then at the treatment plant turbidity cloudy water is caused by silt clay and other organic and inorganic matter being churned up in the creek creating higher levels of fine particles in the water high turbidity can cause damage to filters and wear them out quicker which can be costly if there is high turbidity in the water it is passed through a hydrocyclone which spins the water very fast to throw out the fine particulate from the water to remove it from the supply being processed where turbidity is low the first stage is for the water to pass through the pre-filters which remove the larger particles in the water after pre-filtration water passes through one of the many ultrafiltration membranes or uf cartridges to filter out any smaller stages all three water treatment plants use uf cartridges to filter the water to remove any particulate and bacteria or microorganisms that remain in the water at this stage it 's an ultra filtration cartridge that filters our raw water that comes into the plant through little hollow basically straws the hollow straws that are in the cartridges they filter out any pathogens e coli remaining stability that may have got past the pre-filters [Music] before being sent to customers and to comply with drinking water legislation the water must contain a small quantity of chlorine to ensure no harmful bacteria or microorganisms are present through the long journey to customers taps to achieve this the two clear water reservoirs that supply the mossman and port douglas localities are dosed with chlorine now the drinking water is ready for the next stage of its journey located inside the treatment plant the control room is manned by the water quality team who manage the various automated control points for all three water treatment plans this includes control areas from the intakes all the way to the treated water reservoirs located throughout to ensure that supply can meet demand and any alerts that display are acted upon immediately to mitigate any impacts on supply so today we 're looking at extraction rates from the intake we have licence limits which is a legal requirement which means we can 't take out more than our licence allows us so we monitor that 24 7. since we 've been making advances in our infrastructure we 've introduced a backwash recovery plant in the past with backwashers we used to send it all to sewage with the backwash water now we 're able to recycle retreat and reuse which puts less pressure on our extraction limits at our intakes as well as the system checks and testing that occur at the treatment plans there are regular tests done by council 's environmental technical officer samples are taken from designated sites throughout the water network to check ph levels chlorine and any other parameters required to be tested some tests are done at the site and other samples are taken back to the lab for in-house testing at the douglas lab or are sent to a water has finished its cycle through the treatment plant it begins its journey to one of the many reservoirs in the region let 's follow the water to port douglas for the next stage this is the cruise road reservoir which holds 20 million litres when full that 's eight olympic swimming pools in volume this is where water is stored and restocked before continuing on its journey to customers in port douglas and craig lee this reservoir is 20 million litres and it has enough capacity to supply the town for two days now it 's time for the final journey this is the water that ends up coming all the way to your home each time you have a drink of water a shower or water the garden know that you 've got a huge team of people there ensuring your water is the cleanest and healthiest it can be douglas shire council has a commitment to providing great drinking water and is proud of the water quality and service delivered to the community we all know that water is precious and we can all play our part every drop [Music] count you _"

also means we have a responsibility to look after it here at douglas shire council we strive towards that by maintaining and running our wastewater system to a high standard [Music] [Applause] in this video we 're going to explore the journey that wastewater takes when it flows down your drain such as when you flush the toilet or have a shower you 'll see the whole process meet the unsung heroes along the way and also see what things you can do to ensure our system remains healthy and sustainable it all begins here in the home whenever wastewater goes down a drain or when a toilet flushes it goes down a series of pipes and ends up at one of our two wastewater treatment plants one in mossman which is a secondary treatment plant and one in port douglas that is a tertiary treatment plant in this video we 're going to be looking what happens to the wastewater when it goes down the drain today we are port douglas space water treatment plant the biggest wastewater treatment plant we have in the shire we have certain license requirements we have to meet so it is quite heavily treated and the final result is a environmentally sound b-class recycled water raw sewage flows into the facility through this pipe and enters the inlet works here the liquids and solids are screened for items that don 't break down naturally and those that should not be deposited into the system in the first place items like rubbish wet wipes sanitary items cotton tips earbuds toys etc are removed from the raw sewage via a step screen and deposited in bins sand and grit is then removed from the raw sewage in a vortex grit trap and grit classifier before being pumped to the sequencing batch reactor for treatment a regulated waste collection agency collects the screened waste and disposes of it appropriately elsewhere we 're at the odour control unit the main purpose of the odor control units to remove the rotten egg gas and public [Music] once the wastewater has been filtered through the inlet works it is pumped into the sequencing batch reactor or sbr the sbr consists of two basins that alternate with the receival of sewage to be treated each basin operates through a 240 minute cycle in total sewage inflows for 120 minutes and is aerated on and off aeration reduces the amount of organic matter and harmful microorganisms present in the wastewater or sludge and increases the level of dissolved oxygen that aids the bio processes maintaining a balanced environment for the microorganisms to thrive in and perform after aeration is completed the valve to the raw sewage shuts off and the liquid is left to settle for 55 minutes most solids settle at the bottom and are referred to as a sludge blanket a decanter slowly skims this liquid which we now call liquor off the top and pumps it to the equalization basin for the next phase of treatment the decant process takes 65 minutes now not all solids settle to the bottom after aeration some solids remain suspended in the liquid as they are not heavy we call these types of solids colloids in order to get these colloids to sink to the bottom of the basin we add alum to the liquid in the vicinity of the decant well the alum causes the colloids to become attracted to each other and as they stick together called flocculation they become heavier and drop to the bottom to form part of the sludge blanket now that the liquor has been decanted from the sbr what happens to all those solids in the sludge blanket the aerated sewage containing aerobic bacteria and microorganisms those that require oxygen is known as activated sludge some of this activated sludge is pumped back to the start of the sbr to be remixed with the fresh raw sewage to continue the biological breakdown process we call this return activated sludge or raz excess activated sludge in the sbr basin needs to be removed to maintain a balance in the delicate breakdown process this sludge is called waste activated sludge or was microorganism population levels in this area can indicate the health condition of the wastewater system and are closely monitored and managed are carefully monitored by the team to ensure the wastewater process is working as it should be let 's return to the liquor after it 's been decounted from the spr basin once decanted this liquor travels to the equalization basin where the liquor is held to allow any colloids still present to settle a sludge at the bottom sludge in here is pumped back to the spr to be reprocessed the liquor in the equalization basin is pumped to the tertiary filters which are full of sand that further filters the liquid once filtered through the sand the liquor then passes through a uv disinfection system to kill any bad microorganisms that may still be present the treated effluent is now clean enough to discharge into the adjoining waterway a large portion of the treated effluent is then reused on site for cleaning or supplied to local golf courses that use it for irrigation so what happens to the waste activated sludge all the excess waste sludge that is removed from the sbr is pumped to the gravity drainage deck or gdd here the sludge is fed onto a where it drains into the aerobic digesters which break the waste down further removing nutrients present in the sludge this digestion process in simple terms is composting but on a much larger scale after this we send it to the dewatering process we have a belt filter press here at port douglas wastewater treatment plant it goes through its stage of flocculation and then dewatering the dewatered sludge is taken away by contractors which is used for 100 beneficial reuse as a fertilizer to farms [Music] that 's a brief overview of what our wastewater team does to keep our community functioning and to eliminate environmental impacts but there are some things you can do to help them out too there 's only three things that should go down the toilet and that 's pee poo and toilet paper anything else that goes down the drain can block up our sewage system or kill the good bacteria needed to break down the waste and potentially lead to catastrophic situations and expensive repairs other nasties like fats oils and chemicals should never be put down the drain fats solidify once cool by blocking the pipe and potentially damaging it when chemicals are put down the pipe they have the potential to kill the bacteria that we rely on to treat the effluent which is something we really don 't want to happen just to be vigilant of what they put down their toilets because it can also damage not only the council infrastructure it 's also very damaging to their own it 's going to hurt their pocket in the end it 's up to all of us to be smart with our wastewater and protect our infrastructure let 's all do our bit to look after this special part of the world that we are lucky to call home you _"

    "text": "and this is where the real journey begins next stop the mossman water treatment plant [Music] the water treatment plant is where all water extracted at rex creek intake is treated and here is the same mains pipe we followed from the intake going into the treatment plant like all water service providers around australia we follow very strict national standards to ensure that our drinking water is clean and treated to the highest standards to protect public health it 's a process with many steps along the way including filtering testing and treating let 's show you what we do turbidity levels are checked at the intake in the trunk main and then at the treatment plant turbidity cloudy water is caused by silt clay and other organic and inorganic matter being churned up in the creek creating higher levels of fine particles in the water high turbidity can cause damage to filters and wear them out quicker which can be costly if there is high turbidity in the water it is passed through a hydrocyclone which spins the water very fast to throw out the fine particulate from where turbidity is low the first stage is for the water to pass through the pre-filters which remove the larger particles in the water after pre-filtration water passes through one of the many ultra filtration membranes or uf cartridges to filter out any smaller particulate and organics that have made it through the previous stages all three water treatment plants use uf cartridges to filter the water to remove any particulate and bacteria or microorganisms that remain in the water at this stage it 's an ultra filtration cartridge that filters our raw water that comes into the plant through little hollow basically straws the hollow straws that are in the cartridges they filter out any pathogens e coli remaining turbidity that may have got past the pre-filters [Music] before being sent to customers and to comply with drinking water legislation the water must contain a small quantity of chlorine to ensure no harmful bacteria or microorganisms are present through the long journey to customers taps to achieve this the two clear water reservoirs that supply the mossman and port douglas localities are dosed with chlorine now the drinking water inside the treatment plant the control room is manned by the water quality team who manage the various automated control points for all three water treatment plans this includes control areas from the intakes all the way to the treated water reservoirs located throughout the network water quality and reservoir levels are constantly checked to ensure that supply can meet demand and any alerts that display are acted upon immediately to mitigate any impacts on supply so today we 're looking at extraction rates from the intake we have licence limits which is a legal requirement which means we can 't take out more than our license allows us so we monitor that 24 7. since we 've been making advances in our infrastructure we 've introduced a backwash recovery plant in the past with backwashers we used to send it all to sewerage with the backwash water now we 're able to recycle retreat and reuse which puts less pressure on our extraction limits at our intakes as well as the system checks and testing that occur at the treatment plans there are regular tests done by council 's the water network to check ph levels chlorine and any other parameters required to be tested some tests are done at the site and other samples are taken back to the lab for in-house testing at the douglas lab or are sent to a nata accredited laboratory for verification testing _"

watching our meeting this morning i note that all councillors are present as well uh councillors i do have to ask conflicts of interest even though we only have one item today and that takes us on to our agenda item which is the annual report 2021 which i 'm happy to move that to start it and the second place councillor scottism so in accordance with the local government act 2009 council must publish an annual report which provides an update to the community about the douglas shire council 's finances performance and how council has delivered against the corporate and operational plans which i 'm very pleased to see come before council this morning covert 19 affected our region in ways that we 've not seen before it has broad issues that have created uncertainty to our local economy frustration to our community and brought a world of hurt to our business owners when coronavirus reached our shores last year a swift response occurred from all levels of government to help the communities pivot and the change with the changing social and economic dynamics unfortunately while we are grateful for the assistance provided by the state and federal governments it certainly does occurred over this past year the 2021 annual report details council 's efforts to continue getting on with the job and helping our community through these uncharted challenges through prudent financial management our operating position finished a 2.23 million deficit and improvement on the budgeted deficit of a 3.66 million council started work on its largest ever capital works program and by june 30 this year completed 107 projects and expended or committed 29.473 million to the market in doing so he made sure many local businesses and contractors were used to deliver important community projects global pandemic aside the year certainly had other challenges a great deal of consideration our council made the decision to purchase the daintree ferry river ferry vessel to ensure continuity of service across the river i 'll be the first to admit the acquisition wasn 't the perfect result we were looking for but the decision the decision was financially sound and it protected our community from significant economic damage the recent privity audit uh was currently redacted in places describes it as a successful outcome under the circumstances and placed council in a amazing to see how much this council has achieved over this difficult time and i believe a thank of gratitude is well deserved for the former ceo our acting ceo and all the staff that he contributed to the success in the multitude of projects listed before us this document very clearly shows the amount of work council does and i believe that its right players should be extremely proud of the council that they have each year our operating deficit will improve through smart and decisive decision making whilst i know that we can 't please everyone i do know that every councillor here has the best interest of the community first and foremost and will continue to represent this community to the best of their ability i believe that shows through the type of projects throughout this report in finishing again i 'd like to thank the staff for all the work that has been completed your counsellors are only the strategic arm of this council we give the direction advice of what the community wants here 's our staff of this council that are designated to run it is those people that have completed this incredible amount of work over what would be considered a difficult period for all concerns many of our staff had to transition to working at home and many who have families have had to deal with the restrictions and the concerns around favorite 19. congratulations to a wonderful outcome and i hope that this community takes the time to read this report and acknowledge the works that have been completed enough all right we 'll go to comments from counsellors any comments please

    "text": "[Music] mayor michael kerr a meeting today there was probably one subject that came up early and that was the rv proposal by councillor peter mckeown you brought it up earlier to see if there 's any conflict of interest and then we moved on and then towards the end we we heard his proposal he wants an rv park in mossman this is an opportunity for council to get some income from it a transfer of land can you just explain what uh you supported with peter mckeown 's proposal absolutely the original concept of staff came to us last year which that meeting the document was adjourned back then what the staff were looking at doing is getting some of our surplus land that we 've got in the shire selling that off the equivalent value of what a block of land would cost in mossman to lease to the cmca to run a rv park on it so ben rb park right and close to mossman so you know 50 rvs or so at a time would be parked there and those people would utilize the shops uh are these at the moment they detour around us because we 're this is this is his words that we 're not rv friendly do you believe that do you back him on that the information we received from the cmca which is the official body you know they 've got 80 000 members this is one of the places that they 're always getting requests why do they not have an rv facility so the cmca they 've been here nearly every year for the last couple of years to you know speak to council and city council we 're looking for an rv park you know can you assist us in supplying one and this is why this started in the first place uh we 've had lots of people emails contacting us in different ways to say that they want an rv park here and douglas shire and you know we just felt that mossman was the right place for it and that 's why staff were pushing forward with it and yeah it 's been delayed and delayed and this is obviously why councillor mcewen it forward himself to get a decision one way or another and of course it went the way it did today and of course it it brings an income as we said earlier but but also uh mossman needs an injection of of funds coming in and money for the area and all of that it would provide jobs it seemed to be a win-win situation as he put it and yet the other council has knocked it on the scone well from the information that i 've received from various different mayors throughout queensland and also through the cmca so it 's been confirmed most rvs will spend between 150 and 250 a day at their location so if you 've got 50 rvs parked in mossman or spending a minimum 150 a day that 's a lot of money being injected into this region and this is why you know we 've been so excited about looking at the concept of doing it um so it from a personal perspective of course i 'm disappointed and i 'm sure the many businesses in mossman would be disappointed as and councillor zamotaro noli and scomerson of course have gone against council mcewen 's motion that he put forward today and so it doesn 't look like it will be happening and there was no cost to the raper at all no cost at all to the right players or simply a lamb swap from one to the other lease the land to the cmca which therefore they actually get an income their council will be getting an income from the land and that 's you know one of the crazier points that i don 't understand okay let 's move on to warri park maintenance program um can you just explain that to us okay worry park is the lake uh that runs in between the lakes estate housing and ulysses avenue there 's been different uh opinions of the different residents that live around it the the people that live in the lakes estate like having a nice enclosed lake so they like the trees being there so they have the light shining in their backyards they don 't see the houses across the other side of the having a lake there and want to be able to see it so they were wanting to have trees trimmed and cut back and of course that wasn 't possible so we 've gone out with a plan because this has been going on for many many years there 's been lots of complaints going through so the staff have now had a written document that shows exactly what the position of council is this is what we 'll do to look after that park this is how we 'll treat it this is what the policy is please stop harassing our staff if you see them in the park and let them do their job quite a number of trees apparently uprooted for that but trees will be planted in their place as i understand well and that 's the thing you know some of the ufc 's uh residents we 've allegedly have removed some of the trees and cut them down um and there 's even been cases where people in the lakes estate have been planting trees that shouldn 't be there because they were the on for many years and this is to clarify exactly what the position of council is it 's a park it will be treated like a park you know there 's one stage where they 're saying we can 't clear all the dead palms all the rest of it because birds are nesting and your council needs to respect the animal and the wildlife there but we also have to remember that that is a main water flow area for water that comes down that easement from port gardens estate it fills it floods and when it floods it takes all that uh leaf and debris and that and pumps it into our drainage system blocking drains and flooding other areas so we 've got to balance that out and make sure we maintain the park properly building better regions rexmail park playground renewal and upgrade that sounds cool well the building better regions of course is a great funding scheme the state government have brought in and we 're able to apply for different things that fit into the categories that they have and these two things do in to get funding for them kuya beach reservoir connection as well absolutely really important when they built that estate there was reservoirs put there but they were never connected so the the tanks are already there if we get the funds we can actually plug them in so that 'll give us another backup system as well now that contract for water i was just a bit confused with this one battery acid water what was the go there the battery acid water yeah it was a contract the next one we have is for a new cleansing facility that 's it so the aerators so what they do is they 're modules that drop to the bottom of the tanks and um they create bubbles of course causing it all to stir up and that breaks everything down so this is a neutron yes so this is a new type of system so that you know they can actually take it back out to clean it or repair it if things go wrong with it whereas the old system 's a lot more complicated and a lot harder up ku your beach cycle way how good absolutely it 's really important we keep get working on our cycleways and this is the next stage of doing from kiwi beach to mossman of course we 've had the bridge built so the bridge is there now and now this pathway will take it through so people that hop on their bikes and safely ride to mossman financial report for december how we are traveling in the yuletide month as i said we 're halfway through the year now so we 're starting to see the figures but at this stage we 're still tracking along you know we 've gone through a hard couple of years with covered yeah this we can 't say things have been rosy we 've done everything we can to support where we could to the residents and ratepayers so we are tracking behind on what we would have liked to have been but you know we 're still functioning as a good council and that 's really important and as someone said and i love the quote because i 've said it a know because we 've actually done quite well in consideration to other councils as far as what cobot 's done to them so you know i believe we 're tracking along well people can see there 's still things happening there 's gardens are still being mowed parks and you know being looked after we 're still getting work done around the shire and yeah hopefully people look through the operation report and that 's in order that the ceo report that 's in the document as well they 'll see the amount of work that we 're actually doing in this shire it 's pretty impressive for a little shower i mean we do punch above our weight don 't we we absolutely do you know we 've got a lot of people in the show that expect a lot as well so we 've got to live up to that aim and you know i believe we certainly do you know we don 't have an endless budget we 've got to you know pull the lines here and there where we have to but certainly if there a presentable place and you know a place where people want to live and are happy to live well thank you very much just before we go uh people get their boosters absolutely really important get those boosters whilst the shot one and two you know certainly do give you protection that third booster does really bumps it up and make sure that you are absolutely covered if you do come across covered and at least you 're not going to be one of these 14 that end up in a hospital or an icu bed you 'll just have a bit of a sniffle and you know one thing i have to remind people is don 't be complacent about that you know it may only be a sniffle for you but the next person you come across and pass it on to it could be a deadly disease so it 's takes no prisoners you just don 't know whether you 're gonna be one of those 14 so absolutely get your booster shot and wear your masks do the right thing keep checking in it 's really will be able to contact you and it 's also so the businesses can continue doing what they legally have to do to make sure that you 're vaccinated entering the right properties may michael kerr thank you thank you [Music] you _"

amitaro i mean councillor mcewan has put a motion forward which heavily covers caravan parks in the bottom of his motion just clarifying with you that situation has changed at all from previously uh we had this discussion earlier on and there was a motion moved by you may occur that it 's in the public interest of council zamatara participates and votes on items free operational plan initiative continue to investigate opportunities in rv strategy and therefore a reasonable person will trust that the final decision is made in the public interest that was for the rv strategy we discussed this also councillor mcewen 's put forward he 's obviously trying to cover off on the issues that some caravan park operators have had so he has mentioned caravan parks in it as well so we 're talking about i 'm bringing it up for you that 's all right well we discussed it before we was completely i was cleared in here that i was okay to participate in this conversation but put it to a vote just for the clarity of the councillors because yes i agree when it comes to rv parks totally but i do have concerns because this has got two sections of it that involve caravan parts as well that that may so um i will put forward that i do believe that there is a conflict in that section um i think we need to put to the vote for councillors whether they agree or disagree on that can we just clarify what the conflict is then council zamatara the previous issue either my sister and her husband operate council run caravan park at port douglas so whilst we 're talking about the rv strategies i totally agree that you know that 's part of it but this this will be fulfilling an rv strategy so i think it 's very much part of what 's already been voted on in the past twice from memory or just

okay so that is a great from here that there isn 't but um yeah okay so because there is a perception and there 's a an actual okay all right no minute i 'm going to the confirmation so the ordinary

um the residents that live around the park um are aware of what they can can 't do and a maintenance schedule when the um anyone wish to speak against the motion any other comments from counsellors questions thank you just two fairly quick questions um it says in the report that by far the majority of crm are requesting the treatment of trees to rectify problems with adjacent adjacent infrastructure i just wonder what the actual infrastructure was [Music] or swimming pools and then also i i think probably the majority of councils have also received a few emails of concerns one of the questions brought up was that apparently there have been 72 trees that have been uprooted from residents and the question was whether those trees will be replaced of course i 'm not 100 on the actual number of trees that have been removed from aurora park there has been substantial instances of illegal clearing throughout the park um the intent of council is to replace trees however it will not be the remediation program we will with that then we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried 5.2 building better regions fund round 6 co contribution the recommendation is

all know that uh water sustainability and infrastructure work is hugely important in this shires in every show i 'm really happy to look uh to go forward for the rex meal playground renewal or upgrade i think the proposed structure is very interesting it 's interesting to note that green ants are endemic to this part of australia more or less to australia in this part in particular i just would like further participation as councillors and perhaps as public for the final footprint and things like that but i 'm very happy to endorse this uh recommendation thank you i have a question eventually just one more question did you actually do that now okay thank you um i just wondering about the costings of the playground it 's estimated at 1.4 million which seems like a huge amount of

because it 's not till you actually see it you know they say a picture tells a thousand words and to look through and actually see some of the progress and some of the work that this council does is just astonishing in the time that we have and i think we saved quite regularly for a small council we achieve big goals and these documents certainly do show up and do prove what we actually do so very happy to to have this uh noted i think i wish to speak against any other comments from councillors just a good read very very good read with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that is carried all right that finishes is the notice of motion yeah uh i 'm just wondering if councilman a question if he 's comfortable with the crux of this rv strategy is to boost local business and people you know eating more in cafes and locally is can that be seen as a conflict of mental catholic cure and you feel comfortable with that that 's all i 'm asking yeah and i 'm comfortable with that because of the fact that i remember we had this discussion with um one of the legal team early in our you know 10 years counsellors to say that um even though you 're in business doesn 't mean you 've got to be unless if this was something directly with my business i would i would say yes but just by having a business in the in the communities um i do not see that that 's that okay so the fact that your business liable to profit from this is not nice okay his business will not make any other game greater than any other person i just want to clarify that which you know it and it 's actually been another uh motion being put forward to the state to clarify that completely um you know the list that we have shows the difference between a prescribed conflict and a perceived conflict and you know i 'm just looking at the prescribed conflict right now which clearly states that a close associate includes a spouse a parent a child or a sibling for any matter that relates to an application or submission to council um the the councillors cannot partake in them so again on clarifying that so all right councillor mcewen if you 'd like to start the read if you just put your notice of motion forward then we 'll ask for a second or on it okay i hear what you 've noticed of my attention to move the following motion for the council meeting scheduled for tuesday 25th january 2022 that council resolves to progress with option b in the rv park business case two results to dispose of surplus parcels of land as per the strategic freehold and general policy to fund a suitable land purchase for the rv park the development of an rv park as per the strategic freehold and general policy for utilize the tourism and economic development offices and tourism port douglas daintree to develop a caravan rb and camping marketing strategy for the benefit of the whole douglas shire five work with all uh douglas shire caravan park operators to ensure that they benefit benefit from the increase of the markets strategy and six delegates authority to the the ceo under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to administer administer all matters in relation to the above i 'm happy to second that for you okay okay the background this is not the first time the rv proposal has been raised to council i wish to put this motion to the council in an effort to have this proposal even moved or defeated as this has been a long drawn out matter which we cannot seem to progress on and many hours of officers times have been spent on it first consultation was made in 2017 when the rv association which is a cmca approached to examine if there was interest in the consultation was carried out and proceeded no further two years ago the cmca again approached council to gauge if the situation has been uh may have changed this motion is to move forward with option b which was submitted to the council at the meeting 14th september 2021 which a decision was deferred to me it 's a win-win situation we can make available a facility that will benefit the whole shire currently we do not attract this type of visitor to our shire as we are not an rb friendly shire this has been confirmed by the cmca these tourists would also venture through our shire and provide additional nights accommodation blunderberg shire also saw an increase in rvs also staying in caravan parks that would accommodate due to visitors wanting to stay longer in the shire than they were allowed to stay at the rv park we must also increase the marketing to capture caravans and campers to the shire through the cooperation of the port douglas and daintree tourism association and council 's tea days the rb traveler market is the fastest growing domestic tourism sector in research australia statistics show that 2016 recorded the highest growth in domestic caravaning and camping overnight trips trips since data was first collected in 1998 total visitor knights of caravaning and camping grew by 11.7 million trips in 2016 over the previous 12 months to produce 51.6 million visitor nights the growth of 18 as at may 2021 there are 750 000 registered rvs in australia 669 000 caravans and 72 000 motorhomes and campervans having a 10 growth rate since 2015. caravans and campervans represent the two fastest growing sectors of vehicle type in australia for this reason i believe the yapi proposal will be pursued with the intention of attracting rvs caravans and campers to the douglas shire the council 's tourism economic and development officer and tourism port douglas and daintree must work in conjunction to market these untapped visitors to airshire there are three different target areas the traditional caravans the campers and the rvs we have in place of physical caravan parks and some camping areas but we need a designated rv park it is estimated that the rv travel will increase by more than of rv members more inclined to visit a town uh if it is rv friendly town has increased by 64 to 85 the cmca now has 330 rbfts which it 's rv town which you must provide designated parking in the town on solid level to the surface and short-term parking and an rv fd which is rv friendly destination which is a rvft requirements plus longer term parking rv park my motion is to have this reputation changed queensland tourism 2013 identified rv travelers on the road spend more than 700 per week while on the road in a cmca survey 2019 members indicated an average spend of 542 dollars per week when on the road with an average 105 days per year covering an average of over 10 000 kilometers the recently opened rv park in bundaberg which was 2018 visitors spent an average of 273 dollars per rv night this is equivalent to over 2.7 million dollar economic injection into their local economy um i 've just got a chart there which came from the the cm bundaberg [Music] bundaberg and england provided that information you need consultation last year as per previously presented business clean in brief 383 people responded 93 of the respondents agree in rv park would be good in mossman for the mossman economy 70 of responders preferred 50 sites over 20 72 businesses responded to the survey 71 agreed the navi park would be good for the mossman economy one was neutral 237 residents responded 93 agree in rv park and an rv park would be good for the economy three were neutral four percent disagreed or strongly disagreed five or 13 caravan park owners in the shire strongly objected to the council creating an rv park in mossman or indeed anywhere in the shire for this reason that is why i 'm suggesting that the council 's tourism and economic development officer and the port of the sanctuary children develop a marketing campaign to target caravans as well as camping and rvs rvs do not come to this region at present we are bypassed um there are some comments here from different councillors would you like me to read them tara bennett the tpdd is fully supportive of the establishment of as having a range of services rv travelers seek this travel group will provide a significant boost to economic opportunity for the small business community of mossman and surrounding port douglas the current collection of douglas shire caravan parks provide a different offering to what rv owners seek and the tpdd believes a new facility will complement and indeed add to the significant draw cards the reason currently region currently has for travelers the reason the region 's tourism recovery is going to depend on new travel markets as well as previous previously well established sectors the rv travel group will be a welcome addition to the douglas shire visit visitor mix uh mayor andrew wilcox from whitsunday regional council uh in the work in the wet sundays we have four main towns and we have three rv stays for 72 hours in two of the towns on council owned or operated land the first one built it was in collinsville this was successful we have a receipt box so the rv visitors our visitors can show what they spend in town if they want to receipts for the last town did not have a caravan park the second one was built in proserpine i don 't have the numbers but we are hugely successful the only other caravan park in town is council owned we put we put a sign up and promote our park and a lot a lot of people stay longer and move around our parks and pay when we went to 72 hours to make sure we achieved a spending town sometimes with 24 hours people just stay and move on andrew grafford the ceo of cassowary the rv park has significantly benefited the local community with 2 378 nights booked 2.4 eight average nights per stay 146.60 average spend per rv per night over 398 thousand dollars local spend a result of this within the local community peter frank 's the ceo of mareeba shire the rv community play an important part in our shires economy and council goes out its way to make sure our shy and attractive destination for them with border closes last year we saw only minimal numbers of rvs prepared to usual many of the local businesses commented to radio station association have set up their grounds to accommodate these rb travelers and many of them spend considerable amount of time there not only is this a great money owner for the association but has used benefits for the rest of the businesses in town council has recently approved the leasing of a parcel of land which we own freehold to the cmca the parcel is very close to the cbd this will be set up very short term stays two nights max at this stage so as not to compete with the rodeo association we also help and support the rv christmas in july event held in marieba annually this event sees hundreds of rvs arrive in town and this event certainly sees an injection of cash into the economy the cost to council during previous council discussions we have had officers search for various parcels of land that may be suitable council or the ratepayers have many parcels of land which have been identified as surplus the cmca states the preferable site should be within close walking vicinity to main shopping social and dining facilities my proposal owned by douglas shire the ratepayers to the equivalent value or slightly higher to dispose of that land to purchase a more suitable parcel of land that would suit this venture there would be no cost to the ratepays it 's a land swap on the books of council the rv park operator cmca has initially advised they would be interested and they are australia 's largest rb park operator and boosts the membership of over 80 000 members nationally providing suitable land can be provided cmca would lease the parcel of land at a commercial rate from council they pay the applicable rates over the property to council they will cover costs associated with the development side as follows access and roadways into and within the park is required fence or bullets to restrict assets to the main gate the main gate and signage dump point and sorry that 's a wash down tap potable water taps as required around the site one powered site including the power connection for the custodian a sheltered shed and concrete pad and required leveling landscaping and planting all infrastructure development is organized on the site but it would be expected that the development costs would be uh in the fifty two hundred thousand dollar range all vehicles that use this site must be self-contained vehicles a little note there on the planting it would be expected that the landscaping and planting of this site would be completed to a high standard to to make this an attractive area and not a vehicle parking area the cmca arranged for the custodian to be on site to manage and maintain the site there is no cost to the council rate payers it is actually an income while only small producing asset and there 's a list of attached options thank you but anyone like to speak against yeah well then salon thank you in five months time we 're going to see our budget that has gone from an operating budget deficit of 2.3 million to 2.99 basically 3 million and with long-term financial forecasts not shown a surplus until until 2029 is seven long more years our water our future water security is highly topical for good reasons millions must be spent for believe upgrading the poor douglas waste water treatment plant to accept salt water so boats may dump their waste there has to be a council priority the freehold land policy states that land sales will only proceed to fund future capital expenditure projects that 's page two of the policy it is a fast stretch of the imagination to argue that this is a capital works project when we have so much more important things to spend money on water security wastewater infrastructure upgrade road and bridge upgrades footpaths lightning and security for our community safety storm water and drainage which at the moment is quite atrocious in fort douglas not due to this council but these are some examples of true capital works projects financial sustainability sustainability is at the forefront of any council 's physician mandate and selling land assets to fund cmca 's activity i find personally quite ludicrous also i believe they would have to go to tender and not be solely offered to cmca that 's just a side point i will not support selling council land to buy other land if we want an do i believe it 's quite simple one example is to encourage the use of the current planning scheme provisions [Music] the planning scheme allows property owners to make a little bit of income themselves by using it for rv parking maybe douglas should look at using tpd or to our tito 's to really um encourage the use of such things such as hip cans just as an example allow the people of douglas to put a coin in their own pockets instead of leasing to an organization based in wycombe new south wales let 's do it in douglas the cmca has a grand total of 11 rb parks of all of australia and it doesn 't cover all the states or territories i believe there must be a good reason why other councils are not taking on this expense so go back to use it as an example hit camps they cover all of the national state and regional parks which comes out to be more than 50 000 campgrounds and campsites across australia um i just say don 't spend money or land swap for an douglas to get on with the act and put coin in their own pockets thank you thank you to speak in the affirmative for this okay well i certainly will be i believe that i congratulate councilman mcewen for bringing this forward because it was a lot of work went into it by the officers you can see that in the report itself uh this is a financial win-win situation for the residents and the businesses of mossman the amount of income that this would generate for mossman township which means the jobs that would be available in this township and you know that is one of the reasons why this council is here is to look after its residents we don 't know the land every single rate payer here does and if we can benefit them then that 's what this is about this isn 't a cost to the right players it 's a land swap you know it 's a perfect situation to be able to create a great income stream for the people who live here who then they can also spend their money here i think you know just ignoring that because i don 't want to sell a block of land it 's like we 're not changing our assets we 're just moving them across to something that will generate an income yes there are absolutely capital works that need to be done and we are certainly working towards those you know there 's been no proposals put forward to let 's sell um land that 's uh surplus to already do these you know we 're sitting here you know waiting for our budgets to you know see next year where we 're sitting and what we 're doing um doing this land soft will certainly not change our surplus or our deficit if anything it would probably assist long term because people would have more money to spend the money just goes around in circles but i absolutely support the motion that council mcewen has put forward and um i will be supporting it today elsewish to speak against it thank you i don 't wish to speak the reason i thought it was important that i did participate today not caravan park owner rate payers themselves who were concerned about the consultation the consultation did not tell them where the park would possibly be a lot that voted assumed that for some reason i don 't know where it came from the showground was going to be a spill an area of spill and that 's where it was going to go had that detail been available they would have voted differently as what a lot of the rate payers have told me they didn 't realize council assets were going to be used to supply this which is you know getting rid of land could be important to us later on when we 're trying to rebuild our infrastructure our ailing infrastructure i should add that was the only reason that i thought i should be involved in this conversation up the past to do it rate pays worry concerns about thank you now take this opportunity as the chair because i 'm still very concerned about it there 's a difference between perceived conflict and you know a conflict where you have a direct family member involved to you i really am because that 's concerning me i 've been trying to look it up always sitting here counselor you 've been trying to look up while you 're sitting there you said yes because i 'm really concerned about it you can 't vote on it you cannot you can only vote on perceived conflicts of interests all right just counsellous okay this motion needs to be resolved today to have been a waste of stuff resources and time where councillors should be focusing more important issues in the shop we currently have 13 caravan parks in the short which sharia owned by council most of caravan parks are operated by local families who employ local staff i 'd like to bring your attention to the douglas recreational vehicle strategy 2017-2020_,_2561.68 which is a well-written document aimed in assisting to improve visited experience to the region to help inform and support the increasing number of rv travelers to be able to access services and facilities and enhance the profile of the region and make this show an rv friendly shower this document document needs to be um and chamber of cur commerce our t position and the rate players association who will be working with our caravan parks for a win-win outcome the document clearly states that all commercial operators provide a range of camping options which are in close proximity to townships and locations and provides approximately 890 camping sites for rvs caravans and tanks this does not include the high camps that are popping up in our shower through the full month of the year the caravan parks and this shire are well used by visitors and this is where this council should be working with our caravan parks in proposing sites to overflow if we need example the mosfet showgrounds it states in the document that the showground has provisional approval from the queensland government to permit rbs to use this site for overnight stays not sure if this is still valid but this is why i believe that the douglas recreational vehicle strategy needs to be revised and acted on and implemented as soon as possible to open our shire for the increasing rv new movement in this country so why do this council wants to dispose of surplus parcels of land use these funds to fix our dying infrastructure like our water pricing is shy which is a claim and wasting one of the most valuable resources we have not spend that money on land for an rv park to state this motion that rvs do not come to this region is at present is incorrect and misinforming our existing caravan parks provide camping for rvs of all types example of the amount of barbies during our holiday season you can just see them all parked outside woolies doing their grocery shopping our current caravan parks provide a great service in our shower and i believe that introducing an rv park will see some of our caravan parks close their doors and staff will lose their jobs as they are not able to compete with this rv park it will provide cheaper accommodation yes an rv park has worked in other shows but they do not have 13 caravan cars and have to compete with them by allowing this motion to go through is denying our rate paid revenue and council possibly in rates as a councillor i support local businesses ratepays and residents of this shop and this council should be working with our caravan parks to capture this fast growing tourism industry by updating the rv strategy plan and implementing it as soon as possible instead of trying to recreate something we already have yeah just a couple of points um not being an rv friendly town they just don 't come here so we don 't see very many of them when the survey is being conducted i traveled around to a lot of the van parks and had a look myself and there were very few rvs in the caravan parks as we 've spoken before these people spend a couple hundred thousand dollars having all their facilities with them they do not need or they do not wish just a and car rental parks they just buy that bypass to shire completely because they don 't need the amenities that the caravan parks provide i do not believe that having an rv park would affect the caravan parks very much if anything as was seen and actually had an increase in off the top of my head i think he said it was about an additional 10 occupancy rate in their caravan parks because people who then went to bundaberg and then he could say that two or three nights in the rv parks would have another couple of nights in paying the full price at the caravan parks i i just think that we 're missing an opportunity here the way this economy is going we need every single person we can get from the bloke with a tent to the the camper vans to the rvs we don 't have a strategy with um marketing to attract those people to to this show we 're just dipping out and i just want to bring this to the point bring it to the head and let so that the the people who have um supported me on this and actually received quite a few emails since this was um announced that i was going to bring it up from people i don 't even know who who are supporting this and have referred me to used to go to before i just think if we stand still the world 's going to pass us by with this one but anyway it 's been brought up let 's put it to the boat and move on _"

    "text": "oh backups on so hmm all right good morning it 's 10 o 'clock so welcome to this ordinary meeting the douglas shire council being held on tuesday 14th december 2021 for the boston council chambers i hereby give notice that importance for section 277e of the local government regulations 2012 that the ordinary meeting of council will be restricted in numbers of public attendance because of the health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involving cobit 19. this ordinary meeting of council will be available to view via live stream on council 's website and will be available for others to watch at a later time i 'd like to acknowledge the google angie people who are the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet today i 'd also like to pay respect to their elders both past present and emerging and extend that respect to other indigenous australians who may be listening or watching our meeting this morning our attendance we know that all councillors are present and we have a minimum number of staff here and we also have a member of the media conflicts of interest councillors nothing today no deputations i did give notice of a mayoral minute um that on reflection over the weekend i 'm going to withdraw that my intention is to allow this process to happen as quickly as possible so we can keep moving forward and giving the community a project and asset that they want all right so we 'll go to the minutes to confirm the minutes from the ordinary council meeting believe it is on the 30th of november this is the one before that yes tuesday 30th of november for the mover please councillors thomason seconded by council mcewen any comments all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously and that takes us to our agenda items as listed starting off at 5.1 which is the biosecurity plan and surveillance program good morning excuse me now the recommendation is that council resolves to adopt the douglas shire biosecurity plan 22 to 26 and adopt the douglas shire council invasive plants and animal surveillance program 22 to 26. let 's have a move for this one councillors and got in there to no it 's all good good work thank you anyone wish to speak against any other comments from councillors council norway um i just want to completely accept this now probably i just wanted to really stress to the public the importance of this how difficult a job this is placed on councils individuals also it 's a very never-ending battle and thank you for the report i hope as a council we can do a little bit and the the the problems of both flora and corner in in australia but in particular our very unique and um diverse world of natural natural spaces it 's very very important so just thank you yes and i completely support this thank you any other comments at all no good totally agree with cancer knowledge such an important thing for this region up here that we keep on top of this so with that we 'll put it to the boat all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously all right texas to 5.2 on the agenda thank you very much uh naming of an unnamed road on moscon name the unnamed road of mossman george road mossman leading to douglas shire council 's gravel pit the manjul dimby road that 's how it 's pronounced correctly something like that and we have a move for that one councillor samatara seconded by our council so i think councilman got in there very quickly council zamatara would you like to speak to it oh look i think it 's a good name for a road like that it 's it 's virtually at the foot of mount demi lodi as a local people call it i think it wouldn 't be a more appropriate name we did speak to officers about uh one of the other suggestions was nobody wrote with that they were worried that to be confusing with their aged care home so i think it 's a perfect name for it anyone wish to speak against any other comments from councillors we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.3 on the agenda today we have the combined application for a boundary realignment and change of an existing 25 in crosstown street and 20 warner street port douglas the recommendation is quite extensive there the councillors have had an opportunity to go through it do we have a mover for that one i 'm happy to move it any seconder on it there 's no great major change from this and what i can read in the the documents the two properties just to cut path pre-alignment um so i 'm more than happy with the details that are in here it 's been recommended by the staff for approval so i 'm happy i noticed that you did miss helps out concern has raised the extent of the reduction sort in the car park that 's one impact on any other application the reduction that 's been allowed for this uh we 've gone by what the essence of the scheme is saying which is a combined application looking that the owner owns two properties they could have put an application in over the whole of the two properties and would have got the same result uh if they stopped at this point in time and sold have a benefit for that we weren 't prepared to go down to the you know the limit that they were seeking we thought that 's enough but it 's difficult to judge car parking in the current times because cove it hasn 't generated much parking lately in that central area of port douglas and we don 't know moving forward whether people will learn not to use cars because of the limited availability of rental cars now so whether that will change people 's movements but that was the main concern that they were wanting to go down to nine and we felt that was too much but we 're still a bit hesitant but feel that given the site at the back is so constrained this may give opportunity for that to be developed and the easement that 's there that 's unnoticed says a new access season it creates a different access easement because of the arrangement of the car parking spaces so they get access to those additional car spaces for the land at 20 warner street any other questions all right we 'll put that 's carried unanimously 5.4 in the agenda today is the reconfiguration of a lot captain cook highway craig lee stage two newport estate again it 's a very lengthy recommendation by the players i 'm sure councillors had the opportunity to go through that do you have a mover for it councilor nolly just got in there and councillor scholars in seconding councillor niley would you like to speak to it no it 's fine thank you nothing like this i think it 's fine they 're going to go up to uh four stages is that correct uh they 're going to a number of stages they haven 't indicated a final endorsed or approved master plan and that is our concern they just keep putting stages ahead to us so what they 're developing is what they propose the advice in part b is a bit stronger than previous times i think we 're a bit over not having that master plan approved and we really need some certainty for our infrastructure planning so i asked the question before i kind of realized what i was doing um uh once again more than anything for the public as opposed to the councillors um a development that kind of builds out from the center is the type of thing that 's easier for council to to look after i suppose going forward um it makes it a lot of sense than trying to try to put developments piecemeal around the area it 's an area that 's planned for development both this site and to the south of andreessen road the concern with the master planning that they 're put forward so far hasn 't had that connection through to andreessen road and seeking to have a separate access to the state highway which the state has indicated that 's not on the books we 've said it has to meet andreessen wrote it would be preferable that those next station stages do get down to there and then expand out from that so that there is that trunk connectivity but that 's up to really the developer to put a proposal to us thank you what about if i made the um the residents of millman drive them that this isn 't going to keep expanding and expanding expanding without the other trump we can 't um do more than assess the current application before us part b is really saying we want to have that master planning and we want to put conditions on when stages occur and we 're also asking that they upgrade the intersection with an auxiliary left hand turn from bjorg street to the highway so if traffic is going right or straight through that intersection that 's no obstructing traffic moving to the left which appears to be the issue in the mornings when people are going to school or mossman or into port douglas then they 're obstructing a line of traffic going left it is a highway intersection so we are constrained a bit of what we can push but i think enough 's enough with the stages so far we are trying to accommodate more housing in that area as soon as possible but we 're concerned about this ad on add-on no proposal and nature of development absolutely i mean because whilst we 're all positive about the biggest complaints from the residents already in in that estate is that the whole traffic has to go through that one little street pass plantation into the estate that 's causing a lot of duress on those residents in melbourne drive so certainly something we 'll be looking at as we move forward then would that be a condition for the next next stage we can look at that uh the millman drive does cater for a higher traffic load than is what now so we 're a bit constrained that way but we certainly are wanting them to have a connection through to the south as soon as possible and it 's also good to see majority of the blocks are between six and seven hundred square meters not small yes the applicant had asked for smaller lots but we keep getting exciting dispensations and we 're really quite firm on that size they can always go up and have a bigger lot size and seek to do dual occupancy but that 's not what they 're reporting to want thank you all right but that we 'll and that 's carried unanimously next thing on the agenda is 5.5 carnival 2022 proposed program and contractual arrangements the recommendation is the council endorses the draft program for carnival 22 and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalise the program and execute any necessary contracts if you have a mover for this one please counselor seconded by councilman councillor summerson would like to speak to you um be exciting being extended that few more days and that 's so it 's a good um it 's a good little week for the show um anyone wish to speak against first of all or any of further comments from councillors yeah i 'm very happy to support this my problem i 'll just wonder in the recommendation um it says uh delegates directed with ceo to finalize the program and i 've got no problem for the co2 buyers program i was just wondering if uh it should be considered something a lot in there with regular updates before that finalization occurs to council council um so it 's that sign up but in the meantime councils are brought along on the trip before we get there and it could well be nothing to be done except for just updates so i don 't know that 's a consideration with regular updates to councillors so you need to you 're proposing to move it or okay i 'm very happy to move something if councillors think that that 's kind of going to be a good addition i would if okay so my suggestion i 'll remove something there we go it counts on doors the count endorses the draft program for carnival 2022 um and delegates sorry if i can just ask a question where you 're thinking about so with this um we are approving a document that says for up to a budget of 170 i think of 170 000 cash and 35 in kind so anything that 's going to be outside that scope will have to come back to us anyway wouldn 't it probably but look honestly as i said it could actually be nothing really in that this does nothing but just 'm just concerned if it 's any contracts or stuff that have to be signed for bands or for equipment would they have to come back to us before the ceo can sign it and it 's in the budget not if it 's already there i 'm just thought about it in case anything else gets changed so okay so this is okay so um if if there 's any changes or things like that happen before it comes just comes to council which you probably would anyway i 'm assuming it would anyway and that 's what i was just wondering do you need to put it in there if the ceo needs to choose sign a contract that 's already in this proposal i don 't think i don 't see why i 'm just my concern is that we 're stepping into an operational area the budget is there the recommendation is there of what the amount is and i think as long as it doesn 't go over that it should be an operational you know by all means if anything has to be expanded to the program yeah maybe that that that satisfies anything major would of course come back but minor amendments being obviously if it 's swapping one violinist from another unless it 's nigel kennedy nobody cares is that does that satisfy maybe something like that i know i would have been sure that council would have been kept updated if there 's any major anyway it wouldn 't have probably um is this through a council report all through the workshops no i 'm happy just if something big comes up you probably have to be i 'm going about something very good anyway and if nothing changes it might not be anything that 's all it 's not annoying um asking the staff to do anything particularly well again for you the uh the proposal is a draft that 's a draft proposal with council focusing on the three main events so there 'll probably be a lot of changes in the back end i 'm not worried would you yeah that works so yes that that 's fine with that so i 'll put for that amendment is put the amendment to the vote all those in favor of the amendment all right so that 's carried that now becomes the motion that cancels comes in you 're happy with that instance you first put that up councilman q and you 're happy with that yes so that now becomes the motion will now put that motion to the vote all those in favor of that promotion i said you need that voted again well councillor summerson 's happy to move that again the council mckee in the second year so we 'll now put that to the vote all those in favor and that 's carriage thank you thank you all right takes us to 5.6 the australia day awards 2022. the recommendation is the council notes and endorses the australia award recipients in line with the douglas shire australia award guidelines and to delegates authority under section 257 local government act 2009 to the mayor and chief executive officer to finalise any minor amendments in relation to the ministering of the australia day awards ceremony for 2021 so remove it for this one please so it you okay so um uh amendments in relation to administering the australia awards ceremony 2022 a mover for that one council scholars in second goodbye councilman thank you councillors would like to speak to it um i think it 's a great time of the year for the people in this show and it 's a big thank you to the people that spend a lot of time doing volunteer work and extra work into our show so it is a good day and australia day so i think it 's a very exciting this year with the great nominations that we 've received anyone wish to speak against any other comments from councils yeah if i could just to say that um there were so many good nominations and it 's a shame we have to pick one from each category there are some great nominations yes couldn 't agree more probably the the best year we 've had for a long time as far as the amount of people who put forward and the quality it was put forward it was great all right so we 'll put carried unanimously thank you for on 5.7 financial report november 21 the recommendation is the council notes the financial report for november 21 uh do we have a mover for this one please i 'm sure cancel the q1 and i 'm happy to second that one let 's get it on the floor councilman kim would you like to stick to it nothing really much to say that 's not shown there um we 're plugging along it 's just going to be interesting to see how we how things change from here anyone wish to speak against any other comments from councillors there i think i suppose the only thing i can say is now that the borders are all opening up so hopefully getting a lot of our disabilities moving in the shower so it 's just to wait and see what happens i suppose but um you know i think the finance staff did an excellent job in this council so um been tracking so you know as councillors thomason said we have faith in the staff to do the best they can i 'm sure the boat all those in favor and that 's carrick universally and that is the last thing on the agenda today we have no no summations no petitions and so that closes the meeting at 10 24. thank you very much to move on the good show i just need 10 minutes _"

    "text": "[Music] you know i do feel sorry for each individual that 's got their particular issues as far as taking the vaccine the businesses that are being affected by the restrictions that are being brought in um at the end of the day i support the restrictions that are being brought in um i believe that shelf that joe as he 's called the chief health officer is making a decision that 's based on the majority of the community we don 't want high amounts of people getting the virus at the same time we have to slow it as much as possible there is absolute evidence there that shows that unvaccinated people are at more risk of catching it if there is evidence there to show that the unvaccinated people can pass it on easier than vaccinated people because their borrower loads are higher you know so by taking them out of the equation in uh tight social settings um you know he 's hoping to of course slow down the infection rate which therefore assists the hospitals and that 's that 's what it all comes down know if you go by new south wales um infection rates um it was about 14 12 14 of people that got covered ended up wanting or needing some sort of hospital assistance um of those you know a thousand of them you know roughly needed icu beds you know we don 't have that we 've got 18 beds in this region you know so do the maths where are these people going how they 're going to cope with it you yeah we that 's and that 's just the unvaccinated ones you know if you look at the vaccinated ones as well the vaccination does not stop you from getting sick okay it all it does is assist your body fight it so hopefully your body can fight it before you become too sick you know but some people that are elder even though they got the vaccine you know they could well become quite ill with it you know so it 's absolutely imperative that the chief health officer has put in the recommendations that he has and i think you know we have to remember only just starting up here you know if you look at new south wales and victoria you know they 've gone through this process and we 've seen we 've sat back having our lives everything 's been happy and normal whilst they 've gone through this hell and you know i think it 's something that we have to prepare ourselves that this is going to not be an easy ride it 's foolish to pretend that you know these things aren 't going to happen because they are you know people are gonna get sick you know employees will be sick they will be off work you know we 're complaining because you can 't employ someone who 's not vaccinated well they 're not gonna be working if they 're sick anyway and if they are sick they 're gonna be infecting people who have been vaccinated so therefore you 're going to lose more people it 's a continuous cycle you know and who knows there 's no crystal ball we don 't know what the actual answer may be but the chief health officer has 's got and he can 't be that wrong if new south wales victoria tasmania south australia northern territory are all doing the same things you know it 's it comes across as logic sense if that 's the case you had a protest today maybe 150 people maybe slightly less and uh quite orderly but you have the police here as well well we have to take all precautions you know because the staff have to protect it you know you don 't know what 's going to happen it 's a very emotive thing you know the people you know there have been people that have got quite sick from the vaccinations and you know they 've got a story to tell and you know when they tell a story other people can get angry from it and again things could roll so it 's better to be safe than sorry you know the police are absolutely they 're the ones that are going to be mandating you know this at the end of the day um so they need to be involved to need to see these at the end of the day we are a body corporate basically that sits within the state government legislation you know we are part of the state government in that respect so you know there 's only so much that we can do this is the chief health officer 's mandate got nothing to the premier can 't override him in a lot of senses once the once the ministers have agreed that this is a health emergency the chief health officer he 's got control of this um you know so us little counselors down here you know in a shy of twelve thousand people they don 't they 're not going to care and that 's the wrong words to say they do obviously care about these situations but the majority of the people is their concern the chief health officer has made that decision that call and that 's what 's going to happen the big picture the government 's mandate a little bit of confusion around it i hope in the future that we know whether businesses can be taken to court by by their staff still need to sort out yeah i mean the premier 's made it very clear in that respect that once the health order has been made um that the businesses would be protected under the health order you know um businesses that are not under the health order like unfortunately in new south wales and victoria hairdressers and beauty salons are covered under the health order as well in queensland they 're not going to be you know so a hairdresser for example can 't_''_323.28 put a sign on his door saying only vaccinated people can come here okay because that would be discriminating in that sense unless he can justify that he cannot um reduce or ex have these social distinct requirements that are needed to keep your staff safe so you know there 's things that you have to look at but i absolutely advise people to get their own legal advice on it if they 're concerned uh peter mckeon 's another one who 's look uh you know he has the temptations cafe and he 's worried about how he 's going to police this and you know i wrote to the premier back on the 9th of november when this first came out um and she responded that you know they 're expecting businesses to do the best they can okay to have the signage up to check people as they 're coming in if a person refuses to show it to them you 're not going to put your staff in danger okay you 've got to look at the situation the same as a hotel owner would with intoxicated people it 's their responsibility if someone 's intoxicated in their property to remove them you know if someone is unvaccinated and could potentially cause a risk to your customers it 's your job to have them removed that 's not your job to do it you call the police if the police are available they come if they don 't then there 's not much you can do about it and you know i certainly i understand the mandates and if you 've done the best you can and as the wording she gave to me was can do may do um you can and that 's you know i think what 's asked to the businesses to absolutely to police the fact that you know they don 't want other people in their businesses getting sick unnecessarily so you know just randomly go around to the tables checking for people 's vaccines if they won 't show it to you there 's not much you can do about it except for calling the police if the police are too busy as the premier said no letter they 've got to prioritize themselves and what 's the most important thing but i do know that she 's i got a message today saying that on the 17th they 're going to be doing a lot of advertising so businesses are fully aware of what the situation is and and people will be fully aware of what the situation is um and that um the police will be you know doing their best to enforce it to start with as well which you know it 's a police matter more so than it is a little cough cafe cafe owner yeah you did not about the concerns and basically that was the concerns of the community as a council they ask you or they tell you they have concerns and so you 've nutted out that letter as a collector which was good i thought well and that 's what i was hoping to do to get it up front at the start of the meeting so we can discuss it get it sorted get it finalized so we didn 't have to go through the whole meeting knowing that that was still coming up um and you know we successfully did it which i was very happy that we 've got a compromise and we 've found um you know points that we believe will you know we 'll cover all councillors anyway and then we can write a letter to this state just making sure they 're aware of the concerns that people in our community have and certainly the concerns of the businesses up here well you took an hour to do that it was a lot of talk now application for permanent road closure adjoining lot 204 on captain cook entrance road there um you know it just goes to a dead end which is the business itself so they 're not wanting people to go down there unnecessarily and they 're going to put a nice random turning area there and you know fix the road up so it looks like a decent road for them to use for their employers okay and then sort of some you know we had council grants we had fees and charges mossman pool and caravan park subsidise fitness activate well the activate program has been a really successful program um unfortunately the funding that we 're getting for it 's finished and we don 't want to lose it all together so we 've tried to do it with a lesser fee as possible as like one of the activities the aerobics i think in the park is five dollars you know for a session rather than having it free because we 're not having that grant funding anymore so included those fees in so that we 're able to charge people okay capital works utility charges rating matters any interesting stuff of course from people over the river we introduced this financial year putting rubbish bin collection up there and each business was allocated so many bins and you know we got some feedback from some of the business saying that the proportionate amounts of the rubbish bins they didn 't feel was fair and correct so we 've just made a couple adjustments there and that um so we 'll run that for the next six months to see how that goes and i 'll get a bit more feedback before we go to the next budget and you know if need be we can look at it further then revise budget financial reports [Music] you _"

    "text": "thank you yes [Music] all right good morning everyone and welcome to this ordinary meeting of the douglas shire council being held on tuesday 19th of october 2021 at the mossimon council chambers i hereby give notice in accordance with section 277p of the local government regulations 2012 that the ordinary meeting of council will be restricted in numbers of public attendance because of the health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involved in covert 19. this ordinary meeting of council will be available to view via live stream on council 's website and will be available for others to watch at a later time i 'd like to acknowledge the google yelanji people who are the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet today i 'd also like to pay respect to their elders both past present and emerging and extend that respect to other indigenous australians who may be listening or watching our meeting this morning i know all councils are present as is our acting ceo we have a limited number of staff here we have some members of the media and in the gallery welcome conflicts of interest counsellors i 'd like to inform the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest in item 9.3 and define the section 1 5 0 en of the local government act 2009. this declarable conflict of interest arises because a close associated mind is a shareholder of an organization related to this matter so i propose to leave and stay away from the meeting all the matters considered and voted on thank you councillors i 'm also going to declare a conflict of interest um in the matter of nine point three as defined in section one five o uh deplorable conflict of interest as item nine point three is defined in section one five o n of the local government act 2009 this declarable conflict of interest arises as i have an interest in this matter which is the process in which the reimbursement was approved i wish to participate in the decision in relation to this matter although i have a declarable conflict of interest i do not believe a reasonable person could give give a perception of bias because duties as an officer therefore i 'll choose to remain in the meeting however i will respect the decision of the meeting on whether i can remain and participate i acknowledge that eligible councillors must now determine pursuant to section 150es of the local government act 2009 whether i may participate in the decision about the matter including by voting on the matter or must leave the meeting including any area set aside for the public and stay away from the meeting while eligible councillors discuss and vote on the matter councillor scottism i 'll pass to you for that vote please okay so um before we um go too much further because it 's in a closed session how are we going to present our arguments for or against this vote because i actually believe you have prescribed conflict of interest i declare a conflict of interest and i believe that i need to explain why that you have this subscribe as opposed to declarable um so behold this warner uh do you have any suggestions about how i may discuss that if i 'd been through the chair concern if you had concerns previously i may have had time to do a little bit of research i i know i know where we because this has gone through 10 minutes ago as an email i 'm declaring my conflict of interest as a declarable conflict of interest the matter is for you to vote on if you believe i 'm in the wrong then you have the ability to report me later on i don 't want to report you down that track that 's the way it works i just want to talk things through i think that 's a much more reasonable way of doing things i mean the appropriate answer if you believe that then you should be saying no to the vote and then sorry through the chair again what i would say we vote council is vote on whether the mayor has a declarable if you don 't agree that it has a declarable you would vote for negative and then you would raise that you believe as as your obligation of a counselor that you believe that he has a prescribed um would say i 'm sorry because we know what the matter is and we need to be um delicate in the matter yes um and then they can and then the eligible counsellors can vote on that which is um yourself councillor stromzon and councilman i would suggest that way man as prescribed at the higher level wouldn 't it make more sense to go on that one first um the leap through the chair i believe that as the uh the mayor has declared his we we go through those processes i 've never been in the situation because i 'm going to clear the conflict of interest am i sorry i won 't mean by partying you 're not eligible because you 've declared the conflict um sorry okay let 's just clarify that all right so we vote on this with the knowledge okay so we 'll take a vote on the declare conflict of interest against that sorry um do we vote on does he stay in the meeting or that 's what he suspects yeah um fours are for um cancelling the current and council so that now that passes through as uh mail will stay in the meeting this discussion now do i bring up the fact that i believe he 's prescribed prescribed yeah okay so counsellors you understand exactly what a prescribed means okay so i moved has actually prescribed concept of interest and uh that would make it automatic that counsellor girl it 's a little bit hard to know the full thing because we haven 't had we can 't get advice immediately on this and how it goes so um so are you happy to be in the chair happy to talk to that foreign conflict of interest you do it includes donations gifts and loans sponsored travel or accommodation totaling more than two thousand dollars matters relating to a contract with council including panels sponsorships and unsuccessful tenders matters relating to an application or submission to council development or a grant application in the employment appointment and employment matters relating to the ceo if there 's a close associate so i move that so anyone against the uh proposed conflict of interest the big person first in favor 's i think we need to be really careful on this one would have been great to discuss a lot more exactly who would have been uh okay so that matters now sort of that now takes us on to the confirmation of the minutes for the following meeting the ordinary meeting held on tuesday 28 september 2021 but we 'll move it for that one please any comments or anything no no no put that to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried we 'll then move on to the special meeting held on tuesday 12th of october 2021 yeah special meeting held on tuesday 12th of october that 's all right a mover for that one please councillors and got in there and canceling anyone against or any comments put that to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried all right so it takes us to our gender items first one on the list 5.1 we have a material change of use for air services helicopter pad and pilots accommodation mowbray the recommendation is that council approves the development application for pilots accommodation over land described as lots 78 typ srpln416 subject to the following approved drawings and or documents which goes on with lots of conditions there regarding this for that one i 'd like to move that we deferred us not america all right is there a seconder to want to defer this matter councillor scottism um did you want to speak to why you wish to defer emails we have received regarding the gender item 5.1 it 's material change of use for air services i believe there 's been some valid points to raise that we need to investigate further for this reason i 'm going to request the matter as deferred so we can seek further community input and consider the points made in the emails and let 's not forget it 's not that long ago that important clause in a very close recently was knocked back because it was a cassowary habit pattern i would assume that the marine wildlife is as important to the environment as castillary habitat so thank you councillor um i 'll actually speak against it on this one um applicant the applicant had a period where people couldn 't make comments those comments were taken the staff have looked at those comments and there is numerous conditions in here dealing with the environmental concerns that are being raised and i think in all fairness for the applicant i don 't believe the process would be to go and get any further community consultation in matters like this if i can defer to the planners yeah through the man yeah the community consultation period ran for six weeks in this case had to be re-undertaken and there were 13 submissions received raising a number of concerns and that that period has closed and under the planning act there isn 't a process to revisit that and reconsider once and the you know i agree yes the emails that we got were concerning but i do believe that there 's conditions in here to cover these things and these conditions have been given to the planners by uh experts in that field as we were notified in the workshop when we discussed this that this isn 't just a joy flight a three year term purely for the building of the wangeti trail now the wengeri trail is an extremely important part of this shire 's future as well um you know i 'm quite sure if the operator of this facility breaches any of these environmental concerns and i can guarantee people will be watching them um then that can be dealt with in an appropriate manner so i would be um arguing against it so counselor i just got some questions to ask soon as we discuss it further the conditions that are placed regarding to the environmental concern do you think that any stronger conditions could be placed or pretty much already at the maximum for one for that site do you understand what i 'm asking yeah so to me that they look quite stringent is there anything else that could be legally imposed as a condition that 's kind of what i 'm asking through the man the the conditions that have been formulated and imposed are considered the most reasonable yeah i mean of course you could try you could impose further restrictions but you the operation and whether it 's not necessary in our view so the current set of conditions are where we stand right now and they 've been formulated through obviously through state and national um advice or policies or whatever yeah a number of different guidelines and policies and requirements have uh contributed to how they 've been formulated there 's also the state government 's conditions which have been imposed on this so the application was referred to the state for the main roads trigger but also for the proximity to the wetlands so they 've come back with their own set which are not as strict as ours they didn 't really consider you know distance to particular to marine mammals for example but yeah as far as where we stand it 's a it 's it 's uh standard practice to give particular separation distances to marine animals and we 've pulled that out of the commonwealth government 's guidelines for interactions with those because we are aware that this is dugong habitat i think that 's where your concerns largely lie i think in terms of the pausing clause knocked back from the state a number of years ago that was in relation to clearing land for a facility that wasn 't that wasn 't really a consideration for where you have a development that doesn 't require any clearing it was all about habitat destruction and non-um additional impacts noise and so forth sorry cass i 'm just gonna because we 're verging into grey area here because we actually haven 't got two movers to put it on the floor to discuss further parts of it so we can just stop the discussion there as far as the deferral goes um so kenyans has comments about deferring yeah well they weren 't they 're balanced because i 'm trying to understand yeah i want to defer these are also arguments within you can 't really discuss an item in full detail until it 's been moved by two people and brought to the floor and that is the legislation right but it goes to the ghost to the fact that i need to understand what i 'm still rather decide whether i want because not in here on this block of land as a rule zoned so what 's the difference on buildings on a rural zone here than what it was when we bought towards council last meeting about residential housing that was um on rural zoning so i just want to know what 's the two difference that we allow it here but we don 't allow in bigger blocks in residential world through the man sorry uh is rural correct okay so the last meeting we had at shannonville it was rural zoning and someone wanted to build larger blocks of residential they wanted to subdivide as a pre-lodgement inquiry yeah i believe yeah okay so it 's true through demand i guess the simple answer is it 's a completely different land use and activity the air services land use is you know something that can be accommodated within the rural zone it 's not something that you can 't put within an urban area for obvious reasons with regard to all the impacts associated with that so while it 's still impact accessible and goes out to public consultation something that can be accommodated it 's a totally different land use than um urban development in rural or the further subdivision of land that doesn 't meet their rural subdivision requirements so it 's got a substantial difference i think i 'd be writing adding that the state planning scheme also was what was blocking that it doesn 't allow us to subdivide it sorry canceling ollie um councilman keelan did you have anything in the deferral matter and we can put it to the boat to get it on the floor so we can discuss it further i 'd love to put it on for you okay so i 'm happy to move it councillor you 're gonna be the seconder yes i 'm sorry my apologies we can vote on that yes so we 'll vote for sport if we 're going to defer it okay so all those in favor of deferring councillor zamotaro you want to make more discussion you can move in alternate motion once it 's on the floor so all those for against deferring council and only councillors homeless and councillor councilman 's our counselors yeah sure i 'm happy with the conditions as we heard in the workshop there was extensive consultation from the team in relation to the dugongs and everything else that was brought up as a concern and i think the conditions in here are just massive and they have to abide by them and i think that you 've done as much as you can and i think it 's completely provable anyone else speak against come on through you may care look if you look at the environmental management points i think i think rather than assure me that that 's the way it should be what that does to me to assure me that their reasons for concern they 're they 're actually telling us there are marine mammals there dugong whales and dolphins and marine mammals on the sand flats that we should be wary or so to me that 's the opposite it doesn 't it doesn 't give me confidence that that 's going that 's going to solve the problem it 's going to be calm that tells me that there concerned about anyone wish to speak in a positive infirmity for it which i 'm happy to do as i said you know the workshop we went through the other day carried out a lot of information from the planners as far as the environmental concerns that had been raised they 've sought expert advice on them um to be able to allow this project to go ahead which you know which make it extremely difficult to go ahead and actually do the works that are required for the wenger trail without this facility and i think that it has merit in moving forward as such can i switch to speak against questions mr councillor nolan thank you so going back to the question i haven 't had before um the conditions seem reasonable for both sides for both the environmental aspect and for a development aspect um what i was wanted to ask was that um if for example it was refused with these conditions is it uh to your best understanding that this could be well um yeah uh well i don 't know perhaps the council could because uh because of what has been recommended by my staff by officers through the mayor uh yes this could certainly result in an appeal by the appeal the council would have quite a limited uh case to to defend a refusal so that 's the recommendation and through the mail i 'd just like to point out as well i mean in that areas in that area the coastline when the tide does go out it goes out a substantial way so with the helicopter facility up near the highway and on the periods of time when the tide is quite low it receives a long way out so that actual distance from marine mammal mammals and dugongs and so forth will be substantial for let 's say half the period of time anyway so i really don 't see it as being a major sticking point for this development all right counselor another one question is um after one getting trails finished um do we have an end date on this or then it is used for any other purposes through the map um no so this this it 's also for the maintenance of it if this applicant continues to get the tenders for that so trail 's so high up you need helicopter access for maintenance there 's not really any other ability to you know get machinery and so forth in there so the proposal is for a permanent facility of this nature and it can also be used for other lifting operations and other helicopter operations and that 's the applicant 's intention because there isn 't any facilities that can cater for that type of use and operation it should also probably be noted that this is not a commercial helicopter flight scenic flight operation that doesn 't that 's not part of this proposal and the applicant isn 't able to conduct that activity from from the location so was there was a mention of a three year period three construction period of the trail and then from from the time that the trail is completed ongoing maintenance requirements which i we believe could be our honor yeah they 're on i think two year contracts so i mean a dirt trail that sort of thing associated with it so after the three year construction period we 'll this permit be renewed or re-looked at reassessed in the sense if they 've been constantly in breach of what they were supposed to be doing does council have come back at the end of that three year no so the this development approval doesn 't have its own limited time frame uh the conditions as they stand will always need to be complied with if approved and there is certainly a number of compliance measures a council can take under the planning act if breaches or conditions occur uh you know resulting in fines prosecution so we definitely have a lot of recourse if that was to occur but yeah the the proposal is for a permanent development not for a limited development and that recourse wouldn 't just be limited to after three years it could happen any time correct yeah correct six months the other thing to consider is that the frequency the higher frequencies of helicopter use will will occur during construction and that 's why there 's a request and five flights in per day if they 're you know doing a lot of lifting and they need to refuel the number of times but that 's on a very big day of construction that is not you know what you 'd expect from day to day that 'll only be from time to time it 's it 's uh an extremely limited demand for helicopter lifting generally speaking so that 's just what we can expect at max and so that 's why the condition reflects that thank you all right with that then we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor councillor nollie councillor summerson councillor councillor mcewen all those against councillor zamotaro the motion thank you our next one is a material change that 's used for shops at 24 mccluster street port douglas councillors received the memorandum that came through with a couple of changes in those conditions for 3d 3e and 3f but our recommendation is the council approves the development application for material change of use for shops over land described as lot 118 on ptd 2091 subject to the below will require a mending according to comply with conditions for this decision and it goes on with the multiple conditions and assessment advice from the staff have a move for this one councillor schomerson got in there with councillor mcewen directly behind councillor did you wish to speak to us yeah i think it 's um it 's good to see new shops going in there because at the moment it 's been like that for quite a long time little balcony thing so it 'd be good to see and it 'll be good for port douglas as well because it could be the potential of three new businesses coming into the area anyone wish to speak against do you want me to read these changes but yeah everyone 's aware of them i 'll mention that yes anyone else absolutely it 's very unfortunate mangoes was a a great icon of port douglas in its day many years ago and it tried to be regenerated and unfortunately it hasn 't been able to and it sat there as an empty restaurant for many years now waiting for it and this business has decided that they wish to do that um which will give us three new shop fronts in the costume street with a nice design with undercover shade area able to walk without getting wet etcetera um so it 's certainly a positive from the boston street so i 'm happy to

holiday they need to hand their credit card to mrs clean that 's okay through the chair the recommendations came from the um internal audit that was conducted so we 've we 've basically followed what they 've suggested so they 've actually done a full thorough review of the cards um they found that we had very strong controls in place and everything was working really well but these were just a couple of tweaks that they suggested it 's mainly if there 's a long period of time that people go away and and then hr have to lock them away in their files otherwise it 'd be happening constantly the other thing that the auditors do they they do a sample of testing of staff members who are on periods of leave to ensure that there 's no activity on those cards while they 're on leave anyone wish to speak against any further comments from councillors no okay that will put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.9 principal place of residence policy uh the

're in covert so it 'll be interesting next couple of three months when they start opening up the borders it was you know good to see the comparison man absolutely anyone wish to speak against yeah miss colleen did you have anything you 'd like to add to it um through the chair yes the the porter closures are a now they 're going to open up the ferry is actually a bit behind budget um so by about 171 000 um at the end of the month however hopefully we 'll get some new traffic through we 've had a lot of movement in property so search fees are ahead of budget and there 's some development fees as well in there that are ahead of budget and a few van park future bookings as well so there 's a few positives as well as a negative and touch wood that things will start to pick up just one really good question are those search fees i had a curiosity i know i could look it up okay what is the approximate fee per property do you know off the top of your head i messaged i could look it up i 'm sure we hadn 't put that on the website through the chat i would have to go and check that actually because it was a new fee this year just i could say but i 'm not positive so i won 't_``_2693.359 i 'll find that um more than 10 percent of our amount of revenue from that yeah i 'm a bit surprised actually that it can be so much revenue can be generated here 's hoping with the announcements yesterday that the the possibilities of the board is opening on the 17th of december that we 'll be in for a busy christmas period and i would suspect we 're going to have a very busy january period uh which normally the ferry is more quieter during that period and hopefully we can recoup some of that over that period so with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you all right 5.12 the 2022 council christmas period annual shutdown 511. so the recommendation is the council resolves to nominate the closed down period for 2021 as being from midday friday 24th december 2021 and reopen on the tuesday fourth of january 2022. do a mover for this one councillor scomazon and i 'm happy to second this one council isn 't you wish to speak to him yeah we don 't have 's fine so we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously all right 5 12 council meeting dates uh the recommendation is the council resolved to hold the ordinary meeting of council in the council of administrative administrative office 6466 front street mossman on the following days dates and times for the 2022 calendar year do we have a mover for this one sure council mckinnon got in there seconded council scholars in council mckeown do you wish to speak to her no yes so it 's it 's the 12 um meetings of compulsory we have to have a meeting every month for an ordinary council meeting but we can certainly add to those as we need to all right we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously all right 5 13 the operational plan progress report for july to september the recommendation is the council notes the progress of the implementation of the operational plan 2021-2022_._2868.64 [Music] you could support that i just wonder when is that going to get a community if the tenant document 's going to be released soon just yet uh talked about aspect of it through the chair thank you councillor nollie um can i take that on notice and get back to the counsellors on that one please thank you yeah thank you that 's my other question and i will add with that you know to have a proper design to take out to the public to show where it is why it 's going to be there i think it 's very appropriate because we 've been discussing places now for as long as the show has been here really well i would say that perhaps you design choose a position you know that could be that aspect all right so with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously all right 514 report from the chief executive officer for period july to september 2021 the recommendations the council receives and notes the organisational report card and the report from the chief executive officer for the period july to september 2021. the mover please council a good report and it 's something that i think everyone in our community should read just to let you know what council is doing on a quarterly basis so um yeah it 's a good report okay you might wish to speak against further comments from councillors no i 'm not also i 'll get uh our acting ceo to have something of course this report also acknowledged when the previous ceo was in place so i need to acknowledge his work in this section of the report as well so but uh thank you um as you 've mentioned um thanks to our former ceo he had done a lot of work to get this these reports up and running talking with the staff staff have done a tremendous job over the last quarter it has been extremely busy um we 've had different staff moving within the organization so on top of their usual business we 've got training we 've got positions that aren 't being currently filled so congratulations to all the staff that just they 're exceeding expectations um and doing a fantastic job each teams is very much noticed and very much appreciated thank you and as for always i recommend people go to the website have a look at these reports and see the amount of work that this council does it 's it 's amazing um so with that we 'll put it to the vape all those in favor and that 's carried carelessly all right so that concludes that part takes us on to our notice of motion counselor nolly you put through notice of i 'll read it um as a matter of urgency council facilitates a working group to investigate and when possible implement short-term measures to address the housing shortage okay is there a seconder for that council knowledge like to speak to him yes thank you um now i 'll just start off by saying that uh i acknowledge we might get nowhere with this but i feel it 's an important first step to at least give it a go so housing shortage in douglas has reached a critical stage uh apparently the lack of houses and it 's not contained just to below levels as a leader council and having accessible resources council 's ability to bring together all stakeholders in an effort to address if at all possible the shortage in the shower at the moment and i 've drawn some information from the muscle support services but perhaps you know the poor david snyder center might have been similar housing concerns have escalated exponentially in the daca shine the past year due to an increased number of new residents arriving from outside of the shire and buying properties either as investment properties or as personal residences previously the primary concern regarding access to safe housing was the affordability concerns new trends show that their availability involves affordability affecting the housing option for shire residents a majority portion of residents accessing community support to seek housing advocacy are coming from the private market and the crisis is due to their tenancies coming to an end and not being renewed either to increase rental rates owner plans to renovate to prepare the house for market or the home selling itself some of the statistics pulled from the mossman community centre and this is year and october 14th when i sent in this uh notice of motion 48 people have been sought housing just from the muslim support services alone 23 um tendency ended for one of the above listed reasons 15 are facing pre-existing homelessness including couchsurfing surfing and living in overcrowded settings and 10 are seeking housing due to inappropriateness of current location these numbers are purely clients seeking only housing support and they do not reflect residences seeking other supports for muslim support services in which housing is a symptom of their needs for example not db victims not medical need related people or age-related needs so i repeat i don 't know if we 're going to come across any solutions but if we pull together task force of relevant people perhaps say perhaps a limited task for a number of tasks that you can include people as things come up and look at it uh see what happens what we can come up with i 'm not looking at the long term uh discussions i 'm not looking at yes infrastructural modern needs or whatever for developments i 'm what we can do in the short to medium term and i repeat we might come up with some solutions we might not let 's just pull together something and see what we can do and that 's what this is all about thank you thank you anyone wish to speak against um comments from councillors then i think i agree with council knowledge on this one that we do have a shortage and i think it 's if we get the right people on a group it may work um but it depends on what you know to provide the combination we may have to build accommodation to be able to provide it so that would be a long-term um rent is becoming unaffordable in this show for a lot of people so it 's i don 't know the discussion that we could have as community groups in this show the council that would be my suggestion of what the task force i envisage means the only way you could go about things you know uh we get someone from muscle support services some from the label centre perhaps uh the elders justice group i 'm not really sure i have the douglas was the douglas shy housing group whatever it 's called um and i repeat we might say in the end there 's nothing that can be done but so beer but let 's just make sure that we cover all our bases before that is completely decided and that 's more or less what this is i don 't i don 't expect it to be particularly um resource intent uh you know at this stage it shouldn 't be costing council much money i would uh expect this is my once against what my expectations are we use perhaps council as a meeting center to call this task force together sit down try to come up with ideas and then we go through the ideas one at a time can we do that no we can 't because enough can that happen yes it can and that 's the type of thing i 'm expecting and it might be then yes that could happen that gets outsourced to that particular organisation or whatever and until we try something we don 't know through the chain may i ask a question council knowledge just in regards to the resourcing um i think it 's a great initiative um what sort of um as in council councillors or council officers were you hoping to to be part just so i can try and gauge what what available resources team have got okay so obviously this is open for discussion and i don 't say that my idea is going to be the best idea but i was thinking a meeting at least the first one is open to all councils who would like to attend perhaps chaired by a counsellor um and then probably within our our community staff you know the staff that that would be the section of you know something along the lines of a council officer would be used for emailing reminding a there 's a meeting coming up that type of stuff uh i think that 's how it would work but i 'm obviously open for suggestions not dissimilar perhaps to the canned meetings that type of stuff at this i think it needs to be discussed further and actually formatted so that we get the best out of this because i mean we 've got you know the state government has just recently in june july i believe it was released their queensland housing and homeless package plans they 've done a lot of research into this um the fnq rock is also doing a lot of research into this um the lgaq the local queensland government association is doing a lot of research and even at the forum the work of the sorry the ljq conference that we 're going to next week there 's two workshops on these topics you know so there 's information that 's going to be getting i just the implement short-term measures to address housing shortage in douglas is a really broad statement that could possibly give people more hope than what we can actually give them yeah operational plan this year we 've got a thing on the short-term rentals which is to fits in with this maybe there 's a way we can utilize what budget funding we had within plan to make this initiative more uh to be funded in some way that way it can also be extended to get better outcomes because we can utilize other bodies that have got far bigger reach than just i 'm just concerned that we get a group of people together and they 'll sit here and they 'll go okay the reasons we 've got now housing is this this which we already know those things you know the answers will be this this and this how with our limited resources and funds can we solve that they 'll give those answers that they will find okay so i uh i left it very broad deliberately that was actually a deliberate move so that we could look at everything um look the the ideas that come to my mind immediately probably align with your ideas and sense that 's probably there 's probably going to be little to nothing that we really can do but uh there might be things that i haven 't thought of like the things that none of us here have thought of that perhaps the can brainstorm and recover and uh and as i said it might not be up to council to make the changes uh but it 's up to council to facilitate this task force to make sure that we have covered everything and that 's kind of what that 's why i 've left it so broad um it 's not about changing the planning scheme to allow more housing that 's not what this is about it 's just to make sure that we have covered absolutely everything possible and it might be you know what it might be quite a short-lived thing it might be three months worth of meetings and then we discover there 's nothing more to do that 's why i 've left it so broad it was actually a deliberate thought process because it might be a very short-lived thing and that 's that 's it essentially i don 't really think there 's much more i can add to that so i 'd be happy with it with one change and that 's to take out implement short-term measures um to invest even investigate well we don 't know whether we 'll be able to implement measures that 's the problem and when possible that 's what i 've got and where possible yeah that 's what it 's in there to investigate and when possible implement two measures and i didn 't i did actually deliberately use short term because this wasn 't this is not about this is not the long-term thing it 's not about water infrastructure which is a long-term thing about housing it 's not about changing the planning scheme which wants to be once again would be a huge long-term thing this is about it what can we do in the next couple of months probably maybe six months maximum perhaps uh and when possible and if there 's nothing that can be done and and and then i think we have done our civic duty as leaders for the double shine essentially i think it 's also it 's important that you know people know that we are working in the background already yeah yeah and this would actually probably assist in that to me to get like we were you know criticized by some people by bringing forward the infrastructure charges to get the craig lee on state you know early you know we have already have got staff working with other landholders that have got approvals already to get them online we 've got i think it 's the the second stage of craig lee 's coming up we 've got another stage in uh coming up um we are currently working with the mossman yeah but those are different things but this is what council is doing now to try and fix the long-term situation so it 's not as if we 're not doing anything we 're also currently working as far as you know watching the airbnb there 's another council has just come on board with litigation with airbnb so we 're watching that case very closely to see what happens there and if that 's successful you know we will actually be able to hopefully at some point move forward and utilize these residential properties that are in areas that are not suitable for short-term residential and bring them back be a quick fix that we can do straight away to get you know more residences available for people to actually rent so you know we are again we 're looking at different options you know to be able to grow in the future with the planning scheme because it 's it 's a it 's a hard one you know so agree with what the concept of it is and i 'm happy to support it but i think it needs to be very clearly defined to the public that you know we are doing a lot of what we 're doing already and the outcome of it will be things that we can do within our financial budget i 'd just like to say that i do support the idea of it which i 'm happy to go with mainly because we 've had some presentations here from different different industries and different groups on ideas that they want to bring into the shire and as you know the question i asked all the time is where you going to house the people that work there that do can do something out of this and i also didn 't forgot to mention we did have the delegation come through the gentleman with these uh the temporary housing donors you know you know the staff have been looking for locations that could be appropriate where they can go but you know they need surreach they need water etc so you know there 's things happening in the background absolutely so we 're certainly not doing anything and i hope that this group will bring some of those things out to the public attention then and that 's what this might that might be the sole aspect of it who knows unless we take it down instead of having a working group to facilitate a discussion with the key stakeholders in the shy community group and teachers just to be able to discuss and see exactly what the issues are in the show you know okay my thought was you have a core group and then as appropriate you might have a speaker come in and give their ideas or solutions or whatever but then you 'd have that call again i 've left it quite broad left my world running quite wide so that if we can work within it uh the recommended day or the motion to have a bit of leeway how we work within it that 's that was my thought process so i 'm sorry to ask another question but just to be clear um we will drive this is it going to be council officers councillors to get this started because i think that 's so i know so i can work with my staff of okay this has come out we need to we 're going to be facilitating this group is that is that appropriate to put in uh if you want uh so i thought that was a very valid question that would come up and i because of my motion i 'm happy to kick it off if council is happy with that work with an appropriate officer um because you know i think if i 've come up with it i should put a bit of work i 'm happy to do that uh and once again i left it um you know i 'm just i 'm happy to to do that to put in the leg would be appropriate to say that um with council and nollie um with liaison with the sick i can see you yeah if you like i 'm happy to put that in but i didn 't want to take over in case in case you wanted to work initially as a group or someone else wanted to take on the idea i or officers starting it just so we 've got some sort of idea and we can then factor that into our timeline because i 'm unsure of their workload at the moment so yeah that way i can have that discussion with the manager then i can come back to someone to say this might have to wait until the next month because and obviously because the motion is mine i have put a bit of thought into how it could possibly without trying to take it over how could possibly go ahead and a few people that who i would recommend to as a matter of urgency council possible suggests short-term measures to address the housing shortage in douglas so as a matter of urgency council facilitates a working group to investigate and where possible suggest short-term measures to address the housing shortage in douglas do i move to make that change or does the council knowledge do that since it 's a catholic yeah okay before we do that i mean i do you want to look at miss warner 's through the chair i think if we put um as per delegation under 257 of the local government act the ceo is authorised to create liaise with appropriate offices we can 't delegate down to a councillor only for the mayor or um um yeah to liaise with um relevant offices and bring back to council would you like a separate point um in there uh if everyone 's happy for me to be the counsellors keep this off put it in um somewhere forever exactly like we did well we delegate like with with the ldmg group you have um counsellor um through the chair this is not a standing order or a standing group 't need it no okay so that 's right stay away from that area okay yeah so i 'm happy for that so i second that and if that 's put to the vote that needs to be put to the votes for the amendment yes so put that to the vote and that 's carry it and then so that becomes the new motion now [Music] i 'm happy to second that one is that also you knew the second dimension original one yeah sorry so yeah because if you 're happy with that amendment so the councillors comes and becomes the second all right so if we haven 't got any other comments or questions we can put that to the vote as that then all those in favor of the motion as is and that 's carried unanimously all right so that concludes the open session of today 's meeting in the closed session 9.1 we have confidential 254 j3g local government regulation 2012 house care trustee lisa rent review lot 11 sp 20465 9.2 confidential 254j 3g local government regulations 2012 road encroachment block

    "text": "hmm um laughs okay council 's realized so all right good morning and welcome to this ordinary meeting of the douglas shire council being held on tuesday the 28th of september 2021 at the mossling council chambers i hereby give notice that in accordance with section 277 here the local government regulations 2012 that the ordinary meeting of council will be restricted to numbers of public attendance because of the health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involvement covert 19. this ordinary meeting of council will be available on livestream and on council 's website and will be available for others to watch at all over time i 'd like to acknowledge the google angie people who are the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet today and i 'd like to pay respect to their elders both past present and emerging and extend that respect to other indigenous australians who may be listening or watching our meeting this morning i know that all councillors are present we have our acting ceo here we have also some uh members of the media and we 've to watch which is wonderful thank you uh conflicts of interest i did send through a conflict of interest for myself um did i council occur and inform the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest in item 5.13 as a result of being a close associate with the manager of the sheraton raj who is mentioned in the executive summary of this item my relationship is that of a friend although i have a declarable conflict of interest i do not believe a reasonable person could have a perception of bias because the application is for funding of an event that will be open to the community via community event and involves multiple local businesses whilst mr molner came to the deputation in support of mrs patrick he is not a recipient of the funding request but representing sheridan grand mirage which is a fellow sponsor of the event uh neither mr mona nor i will have financial gain from the funding therefore i will choose to remain in the meeting however i will respect the decision of the meeting on whether i or the councillors or him to the deputy mayor just to have that discussion so i 'd like to move that in the public interest that councillor kurt participates and votes on item 5.13 request for funding taste port douglas because of the reasons stated and therefore a reasonable person would trust that a final decision is made in the public interest one second oh sorry i seconded it yep to the back thank you all right that 'll take us on to the mayoral minute item 510 rv park um back in 8th of june you declared i have had a public uh conflict of interest because my sister owns a caravan park think about rv park then you went on to move a motion to public interest council and i participate in votes on item 3.5 so is that still i still have a clear conflict of interest i don 't think we can actually advise you on that fact it 's up to yourself if you believe that you have a conflict and perceivable conflict of interest declare it and then we can as councillors vote to say yes or no i 'll declare that i haven 't proceeded a declarable conflict of interest as your sister manages the caravan park and that 's where spoken for this doesn 't relate to portugal and we have discussed on numerous occasions that the rv park and caravan parks are different projects and i think as long as your arguments um evolve around that fact so i 'm happy with that friend to catch up on that one so i 'll move um in the public interest council zamotaro participates in votes on me to reason there as well being that um and that 's thank you all right so let 's take us to the mayoral minute that we have today um the mayoral minute is that council congratulates the 20 council officers who are to be presented with recognition awards at council meeting today acknowledging the outstanding contribution in local government to their communities over the last 10 to 40 years of service at the douglas shire council the douglas shire council is blessed with not only a spectacular natural environment but a very dedicated local government team committed to doing presenting 20 council officers with recognition certificates for achieving the milestones of 10 15 20 25 and 30 and also an amazing 40 years of service to the douglas shire council

right now that takes us on to our agenda items as listed our first one today is 5.1 the pre-lodgment planning scheme variation rol one into eight blocks i think i 'm so the minutes from the meeting held on the 31st of august 21 all councils would have received a copy i 'm happy to move those we have a seconder for that one councillors commission anyone uh any changes or against any comments from councillors we 'll put that to the vote in all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you for keeping us on track brenda all right our pre-lodgement planning scheme variation in roll one into eight blocks at 22 mountain view drive shannon vale the recommendation is that with respect to the pre-lodgment inquiry lodged in relation to the redevelopment of 22 mountain view drive shannon vale being locked four on sp 134 nine the proponent be advised that council in principle is not supportive of development that is outside the framework and desired pattern of development of the 2018 douglas shire planning scheme council is not supportive of development that fragments and results in the loss of rural land council considers the development to be inconsistent with the state planning policy and regional plan council is not an opinion that there is a demonstrated need for the development that is of such benefit to the community to support a decision that is inconsistent with the planning scheme regional plan and state planning policy and two is that the above information is offered in the context of providing open and frank without prejudice comment from council in relation to the proposed users the determination of any future application is a matter for council following the detailed submissions were applicable do you have a movement for this one please counseling seconded by castle zamotaro would you like to speak to it uh just simply to say that i think it 's all summed up in the recommendation there um you know the only little addition i would say is that in my own personal opinion after water arguably the greatest sustainable resource that must be properly managed in the world is good quality agriculture then and that 's pointed out in that recommendation so i 'm happy um one question i 'd like to know is when was the last time there 's any agriculture on this land do we know no we don 't_''_1069.679 that hasn 't been provided to us the reason i 'm against this is you know we do have a housing shortage in the shire and um this block of land has no agriculture on for many many years so i know it 's outside of the state and our planning scheme and as a counselor you really can 't go against that but i just think out of we need to where these pockets of land that we can actually build on and um and i 'm not talking about mass development i 'm just talking about common sense development so um so i 'll i 'm not for this anyone else to speak to yeah i do um not that i 'm going to go against this but i do think this is another example of as lisa said we 've got to have a look at getting more properties available in the shire so i think we have to revisit our planning scheme at some point i know we can 't do it this time because we 've been told that it will just open up heaps of applications outside the scheme but i think we 've got to review this scheme sometime in the near future um firstly i want to thank the staff and note you 've done an excellent job in detail in the reasons why you 've given the recommendation for councillors that we 're not supporting with this proposal and i hope that people take the time to actually read it um that aside really clarifies the need for the final freedom plan to be updated um and for this council to start a process of amending sections of the scheme to stop these particular cases being constricted by our own planning scheme and the state government layers that have a blanket solution that one size fits all now we 're not talking about removing prime agricultural used land this is home to a dozen lucky cows okay personally i believe this is exactly the type of block that we should be looking to allowing subdivided it 's 16.23 hectares already which is well under the 40 hectare rural block size and is surrounded by properties far smaller than those that are even proposed by this applicant one of them is not even a hectare in fact it 's 0.6 hectares big you know which is across the road from this block um if flooding is an issue well i 'm sure that 's what engineers are for um and that can be developed dealt with during a development application process um i agree with council scholars and you know we 're sitting here another one where our hands are tied and we have to say no because it 's the wrong colour on a map which is extremely disappointing that 's the knowledge do you want any closing arguments with that then we 'll put it to the vote always in favor and the [Music] all right let 's go to the next one 5.2 material change of use for a resort complex is 71 to 85 port douglas road uh the recommendation is the council refuses develop an application for a material change of use resort complex overland described as lot one on sp 150468 located at 71-85 port douglas road fort douglas and the following planning grounds there 's numerous grounds we 'll take that one as read if the document is available for people to have a look at it do we have a mover for that the well-defined and articulated reasons given by the planners to refuse this d.a or not support this day i think is sufficient and quite simply i don 't think i can add anything extra to support the recommendations all there there are 18 i 'd just like to at this point also thank the staff the officers for their thorough and well presented explanations so i will be supporting the recommendation but i would also just like this opportunity to say that i encourage the applicant to continue to pursue the dreams of fairmont to bring us to this shire a beautiful renowned resort just however not in this form thank you anyone wish to speak against the motion we 'll take it to further comments saying can you councils with comments um i 'd like to make a comment i totally agree with council knowledge um i 'm not against the develop um the resort but i am against that it doesn 't report to our town plan i just hope the developer actually comes to the party and talks with the town planners and come to some arrangement or we can have something built like this in the show because i think it would be great for tourism and also for what this resort can offer so i just hope that parties can um come to some decision which will be 'd just like to comment furthermore what has been said that um you know i just think it 's too far outside that scheme that we have again but there 's just too many anomalies in this application that we can even consider outside in that anyway um and again i just hope that the developer revisits the plan and comes and talks to the planning people like it 's been offered on numerous occasions um and and comes up with something satisfactory to help we 've talked about this extensively and his way outside the town planet won 't fit in doesn 't fit in with the structure of port douglas or the show again thank you to the staff for a very detailed report which very clearly breaks down the very many conflicts that the application has with the 2018 douglas shy planning scheme i do think it 's important that this is understand some of the background here and i 'm going to ask a couple of questions of the planning stuff as well just to clarify for the community in the 2016 this uh council at which there was 613 submissions from the community regarding various areas throughout the shire those included included a majority being for the reasoning of land for a retirement village support for an entertainment precinct and a couple of variations of zones that had been suggested and then you know by residents and businesses who believe that another category would be more appropriate for them of the 613 submissions there was not one out of the 11 500 residents in this show that said they wanted the three-story maximum height changed that they wanted council to be more lenient with building setbacks on developments that they wanted council to change the design scopes of what buildings should look like or how council wanted developers to landscape their properties as such that planning scheme was approved and signed off by the then deputy premier uh and then adopted by the previous council in 2018 that very clearly shows that there was little or no interest from the community to change these things or that there may have even been some complacency possible lack of understanding or an absence of interest by the 's consultation process to read comments on social media over the weekend mentioning faceless planners who have no idea and they need to be sacked the whole council needs to be replaced with those who know what they are doing very much shows that there is a segment of the community that does not understand what the planning scheme is and how the planning scheme works the simple fact is the planners are only instilling a planning scheme that you the residents of this shire either wanted or allowed to happen if you don 't like the outcomes of what the planning scheme sorry i 'm trying to turn it off and i 'm doing the opposite if you don 't like what the planning scheme is portraying then the only ones who have the ability to change that is the resonance of this shower by contributing to consultation when council asks you to do so educate yourself to what the planning scheme is why it is there and what it does it 's a legal document and it very much directs this council on what it can do in being said you know you need to look at the matter in front of us which the staff have very clearly and very adequately put across what the issues are but you know i do wish to give some give them the opportunity to have some clarity on the statements they 've set for the public interest and one that 's come to me is you know how the definition of what ground level and how it 's worked out so i 'm gonna you know how is the ground level worked out through mecca ground level is defined in the planning scheme to be the natural ground level or the level we 're lawfully changed so in this case the the applicant has requested that we take the level as the natural ground level and they provide survey data to show what the level is in australian height datum and that definition is given to us by the queensland planning provisions so it should be across all the queensland planning schemes that 's correct so in the site coverage on blocks throughout the show berry what causes this having of site cover site coverage requirements different zones have different requirements based on the planning intent so in the tourist accommodation zone which is the zone that this proposal is over the limit is 50 site cover whereas other zones such as the center zone we 've got 80 site cover limits so that 's why you 'll see varying side cover across port douglas thank you um when assessing a planning application does it need to pass every outcome or is there a percentage that can be a pass mark as if it meets 80 wooden parts yeah so development doesn 't have to comply with every single uh outcome and it certainly doesn 't have to comply with the acceptable outcomes we we do assessments based on the whole the whole code so you look at the acceptable outcomes performance outcomes and overall outcomes in a code and if the development generally complies with with a few non-compliances then it 's something that is usually supportable and it will always uh be consistent with the strategic intent and the strategic outcomes in the higher order requirements of the you have a development that 's excessive and doesn 't comply with essentially any of the performance outcomes and purpose statements you 're not really going to comply with the strategic intent and it 's and then it 's not supportable now with the there 's many of the things that you 've said go against the plaintiffs if for example councillors chose to override this and to pass it can you you know anticipate any of the detrimental effects that would be caused on the shire by going ahead with it so with this proposal the i guess the main direct impact would be the traffic impact so the proposal includes a 45 car parking shortfall in supply on site so we would expect quite a lot of informal parking to spill out across the road verge on port douglas road in front of other premises now you 're you also might expect amenity and character uh issues occurring where you you come into port douglas and you don 't see any development of this scale you know other other larger scale developments have good setbacks uh landscaping within then this one would be quite out of character so so we 'd have quite a an amenity problem there but the main issue that you might find is if you support an application like this is that councillors would find it very hard to uphold the planning scheme for future applications and future considerations and you really need to justify reasons when you go against a planning scheme and when you don 't really have justification for it there 's a real risk there thank you and one last one was that in the report it says the building is not considered an attractive built form i mean is that an opinion or is that a guy is there a guideline that defines that no that comes out of the assessment from memory with regard to the bulk and scale and the benchmarks for bulk and scale so if the proposal is significantly assessed excessive in bulk and scale in terms of its site cover setbacks uh build form then the higher order requirement which is in the purpose statement of the zone code from memory is is that but if it doesn 't_''_1968.08 if it doesn 't comply with the lower order requirements and it also doesn 't include any architectural elements which are within the planning scheme policy for building design within our planning scheme and it 's very hard to to form the position that it is an attractive build form so within that planning scheme policy it has a tropical vernacular defined by particular tropical design attributes on buildings such as pitched roofs eaves slats breathe blip breathe sorry breezeways particular i guess maybe older style considerations coming from you know florida keys type development but that 's what the scheme intends and that 's what the scheme sets as a as a consideration for an attractive built form so that 's where that statement comes from and that would therefore answer the question that came from the gallery as far as bulk form goes massive concrete building doesn 't fit into what the presented requirements of the cleveland scene ask for correct so after reading through the application considering the responses that both the staff and the applicant have made it it certainly brings the case that i personally you know do think that the building has a lot of positive attributes and that i was extremely excited at the fact that the old eyesore that we 've seen on port douglas road was finally going to be developed by no less than a fairmont hotel for a new mayor it was a dream development coming to asshai that is in desperate need of economical drivers and even more so now with covert so it 's extremely disappointing that we are being advised by our staff that the design concept of this building sits so far out of the approved planning scheme and the councillors are being recommended to refuse it so it is with great regret that i must agree with the planners on this occasion and unfortunately with the recommendation of refusing this application myself council knowledge do you have any closing statement on that no thank you so with that we 'll put it to the votes all those in favor and that 's carried you know sleep thank you takes us to 5.3 for a domestic violence community housing unit award contract number w05436 community housing unit development in austin to mac constructions avn eight six six two eight nine nine six eight five eight four five hundred and forty seven thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars and thirty six cents exclusive with gst and then the delegates authority under section two five seven of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to negotiate finalise and execute any and all matters in relation to this contract if you have a movement for this one please hassan always seconded by council wisconsin absolutely so it 's actually a great pleasure that i moved this i identified the need for accommodation such as this during the 2016 election and during that time i expressed my shock to have learned of the desperate need in the shire for this type of accommodation after i was re-elected with the council at that time we embarked on a step-by-step process with a strategic plan that was enrolled to collect the data to build the case to work for exactly what 's required and then advocate and push to advance a project the where we are today on the cusp of the final step and i 'm very proud of this achievement i would also like to take the opportunity today to point out an operational plan initiative that i 've had including this year 's operational plan partly because of my work from the board of muslim support services i 've identified an associated need and this at the beginning of this year the initiative in this operational plan is and i quote work with the department of housing providers and stakeholders to identify gaps in social housing in the shire and advocate for an improved business model that will increase housing stock and reduce wait times now the process will be similar to that that we have followed for the domestic violence accommodation um i realized it 's not a quick fix but i think it 's something that the puppet needs to know about has possibly been overlooked and we have just ensured that at least the first steps have started thank you thank you wish to speak against any further comments from counselors counselors thanks for you man i 't have any local contractors you know why the reasoning for that all through the chair um council officers went out of their way to contact all the local builders individually it 's not something that we typically do it i build houses we only have one one local builder come to the tenders meeting um and we had no submissions from local builders it 's probably a function of a very hot building market at the moment and something that is somewhat outside of their normal procurement process i.e they were dealing with a council and it was a bit of a design and construct approach um as opposed to typically builders set their own rules for their own contractual arrangements like a masters builders contract which is generally more geared to the builder as opposed to the clients from councillors no i was just completely surprised as well there were no locals involved but if you did what you could i think it shows how hot the market is at the moment and then the time as well i think it 's six to eight months to get at the moment so they 're obviously working extremely busy and this is the ones that are available and also want to come and thank the staff as well and council annually has done a great job of scolding up the back there was also involved with council as far as that work goes to get this happening and getting it up so it 's fantastic to see getting to this stage so with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.4 contract for sewage pump station switchboard renewal project the recommendation is the council resolved to award contract wa 5324-001 sps switchboard upgrades to closed day and provide your limited trading as jm switchports abn 5401104 514 for 261 300 gst exclusive and then delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to negotiate finalise and execute any normal matters in relation to this contract do you have a movement for this one please councillor scottism i 'm happy to second that one itself pretty well anyone against the motion any you need to have unfortunately so i will put that to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously it takes us through to 5.5 the contract is 2021-065 waste cartridge and disposal the recommendation is that council resolves to award contracts 2021-065 landfill waste cartridge and disposal to fgf developments number one proprietary limited at and remondous australia politically limited trading as a spring mount waste management facility avn six zero three two three zero one nine one five two up to nine hundred thousand dollars over two years gst exclusive and then delegates authority under section 257 of the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to negotiate finalise and execute any and all matters in relation to this contract for the movement um yes i found this really interesting because i had no idea exactly how much how expensive it is to move waste and um and i think i would suggest the public to actually read this because i just don 't think we all know exactly how much it costs it 's quite expensive so um yeah that 's good anyone just excuse me i think it just might be the public interest to have um mr hoy explain uh number four so you know you can see in the report that it 's less but it 's not the recommended one and maybe why it hasn 't been recommended just a brief summary could be is that okay well i think it 's just a good exit good explanation for the public um through you mr mayor um one of the reasons that one that was disregarded in in the points accrual was the fact that it wasn 't um for that we didn 't actually know what they were cutting the waste in and that 's carried unanimously 5.6 foreshore management plans the recommendation is the council adopts the foreshore men from plans for wonga beach new york beach beach four mile beach and oak beach do we have a move for that please um so i 've been eagerly awaiting this plan so thank you miss mitchell for that um i like every aspect of this report but in particular i like the references to the legislation the that the management plan that has been presented to us is not that hot it 's it 's real it 's well done it 's a thoroughly well planned and sourced document that needs to be strictly i believe strictly adhered to and it shows interaction between between residential native title recreation open spaces conservation land uses etc etc and how they can all be intertwined successfully um the only other thing i 'd like to say is that 's interesting when you look at um what the residents say the residents of the beaches that are involved uh they all more or less say the first thing let 's say the same same type of thing you know that they they value the the unspoiled natural beauty of our beaches the peace the surrender the foreshore uh they also value the abundance of wildlife um and their vegetation space at the beach the vegetation and natural spaces that the beach provides for recreation and i think that 's just important that it doesn 't matter which beach we 're talking about the view of the residents are all very i just like to thank staff with the amount of work that 's gone into this i 'm not 100 sure if i actually agree with everything that 's in the reports i just want to know if we can defer this to another workshop so we can discuss it further i have problems some of the issues i have is the revegetation of the land and the extent of it so i 'm not too sure and as council knowledge just said that people like their views and things like that so i just don 't know if we uh what the actual issues are with our foreshores you know the people most of the people that i 've spoken to they just want their foreshores cleaned up that 's all the palm frogs taken out rubbish that 's been dumped in there to be taken out i just don 't know if the public is fully aware of the revegetation we 're talking about what type of revegetation and i know that our beaches do suffer from high tides and erosion um you know we need to look bit or is there other things that we can do to be able to stop the vet uh stop the erosion and i just don 't know if the um re-vegetating the four shorts the way that is in the plan will be the solution so that 's just what i 'd i don 't know if the other councillors are interested in taking it back to workshop to discuss even further or i 'm not going to disagree with you yeah um you know there has been a couple of points in there that i 've discussed with staff as well myself whilst the general concept of the plan i absolutely agree with there 's absolutely areas that need to be re-vegetated and it has no hesitation with that but i think a blanket without proper investigation of some of these areas as you said that residents you know may not want to be re-vegetated and you know the consultation of that you know certainly would occur before it would happen but you know this is in writing and it 's paper and so once you know two or on to different things the people will be looking at and taking that as gospel and working on it as such you know whereas we 're discussing there could be a couple issues here and there that need to be sorted so i think i do agree with you that because possibly this could come back to a workshop for one more discussion um so we can air out some of the different issues that we have um so if you 're happy to move that we defer this item i 'm happy to settle it and then we can approach the vote just to look at it at the next workshop i 'm happy to move that to defer this and move it to a workshop just once that 's all we need to do just to nut it out a bit more that 's all um so we 'll put it to the right so that should be both then all those in favor of deferring it just one more time to discuss it that 's councillors thompson councillor councilman goes against council and only councillor zamatara the that back to another workshop just to discuss it one more time thank you thank you all right 5.7 strategic regional wmmr advisory group appointment of elected member representative uh the recommendation is that council appoints the deputy mayor council alisa scottson as council elected member representative on the fnq rock regional waste management group and note the information in the attach in the attachments relating to the first meeting of the fbq regional waste management group i 'm happy to move that one and have a second to please counsel mcewen the f and q rock is uh of course the regional organization of councils it 's where [Music] and find united ways to move forward and i think this is going to be another one of those great ones as we 've done with the roads i think waste is going to be something we all need to look at in the future and um having a counsellor from the show on that board i think will be extremely useful you know bring back a lot of information to us directly so anyone against comments from councillors people and that 's that takes us to 5.8 the douglas chamber of commerce resource and performance agreement 2021-24 uh the resolution is that council resolves to contract the douglas chamber of commerce as a specialised service provider under s235b at the local government regulations 2012 for specialist business report under the terms set out in a resource and performance agreement for the following years and amounts one twenty thousand exclusive of gst in the year october 21 to 30 june 22 to ten thousand dollars exclusive gst in year one july 22 to 30 june 23 and 10 000 exclusive gst year one july 23 230 june 24 and then delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any minor amendments and execute the resource and performance agreement and i 'm happy to move that one if there 's a second dot councillor just coming quickly then um you know i 've chosen to move this as it 's has been an exciting year to see the work that the chamber has been able to achieve over the past 12 it will continue to grow throughout the shire over the next 12 months um the chamber has been offering some great events and that have been well attended and there 's been certainly very appreciative from the business community that have attended um we 've got the douglas expo the local jobs forum social media classes and of course we have the very successful christmas celebrations last year with crosstown street um and they 're achieving to to to grow their goal and getting back to being a very formidable organisation within this shire um they 've also done some fantastic lobbying work which includes meeting various ministers university groups small business councils and of course they had their meeting with the premier and mr hinchcliffe as well so i commend them on the great work that they 're doing and i appreciate that they 're they are all business owners um you know they find it hard themselves to find time to do a lot of these things so it certainly is a commitment and a challenge and i give them credit for that so i 'm happy to with counsellors also uh not just solely from so if to have possible point in the recommendation that future kpis are developed with important classes something along those lines um i 'm going to refer that the kpis the contract 's been drawn up for this challenge period yet so would it be possible for the councillors to be including the workshop for what kpis would be certainly through you michael it would be possible to workshop those we would take that as a matter of false that um suggesting and what the chamber of commerce would be suggesting um that any um kpis are negotiated with the chamber as well so council knowledge are you happy with future kpis be carried out in conjunction with cancers yeah something along those lines um yeah but as basically in the process not just presented at the end that 's kind of what i was asking yeah that 's a part of the process yeah so um councillor nolly is moving an amendment big pattern so that would probably become two as opposed to number three but that 's just a minor put that to the vote then to add that in so point over and that 's carried unanimously so then the motion will now read with three points just let 's bring the catch up so we 'll have one which is that large large point there two will be future kpis to be carried out in conjunction with councillors so rough and we just swap those two around so that two becomes three and three becomes two so that 's now the new uh resolution and canceling i guess you 'll be moving that as such uh yeah the second for that one again and that 's carried unanimously [Laughter] all right that brings us to 5.9 austin state high school authority to the chief sorry elevator authority under section 257 of the local government in 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any and all matters associated with the above i 'm happy to move that one there anyone against any comments from councillors no this is a regular thing that we do each year it 's very happy to know and that 's carrick unanimously all business case um i actually was looking at this this morning and would like to move an alternate motion to the one that 's been put there and the alternate motion would read that council notes and accepts the rb park mossman business case brings the report back to council with options for the development of an rv park by facilitating discussions between private owners of land that would be appropriate for an rv park operator or by leasing land owned by council that would be appropriate for an rv park operator and three advise council of any suitable land parcels that council could obtain to facilitate the above if none exists in the council 's register there 'd be a secondary for that so seconded by councilman um my reason for that is um i just with the original motion um i just found that i prefer to have councillors more involved in the end discussions um that you know the council delegates authority to the chief executive officer for all these things i felt it didn 't quite finish neatly and i just wanted this to be very when it gets to that point so we 've got the rv strap business case which is great um now we need to know the actual details of how we 're going to do this i think that needs to come to council any comments from councillors yeah okay so um it 's a little difficult uh as a counselor to take in this new motion um ad hoc like this just to let you know that um now i had i don 't know if i agree necessarily notes and accepts i don 't know if i actually accept the business case that was presented to us to start with um that 's the first thing now it brings the report back to council options for the development of rv park by facilitating discussion between private owners of lands i think it 's just i i find this really difficult to take it all in the implications of that actual motion in a minute um you know this is something that we 've kind of been looking at we 've been looking at something on the lines of the and what 's the difference it is a little bit different because i had my understanding was we 're going to kind of choose one of those options uh we 're going to talk about a lot of those like it just it has changed it if it hasn 't changed it leave the original motion well i 'm happy to leave the original motion then if it 's you don 't wish to have it in discussion because this says it 's going to be give an authority to the chief executive officer but aren 't we going to be looking at one of the three motions one of the three points what are the three options or combination of the three options that 's how i 've kind of understood well my concern is for example that the only option council is willing to consider is to um lease it to a private operator so we wait for another three months and that doesn 't happen so another report comes back to us that that 's not gonna happen so then we have to wait for another three to be so would it not be better for them to go out get the facts of who wants to lose it if they do if council can do it this is how council can do it and then bring the report back to cancel down with actual facts in it of how we 're going to do this council um can we i 'm just looking at that um number one um i 'd like to put notes uh take these steps out just in case not all counsellors accepts the um business case and um the second thing is and i was going to make a point about this one council to be involved in discussions between private owners and lands of rv park operators is that council 's business because at the end it will be council 's business when a private operator wants to bring an rb um association to put our bees on their property they have to meet the planning the planning code to be able to do that so that was one of the questions um one of the topics i was going know is it council 's business to be involved in private uh business between two entities where we 're not going to benefit out of it um it kind of leaves council completely out of it except for when it comes to the planning if i can respond well council is going to benefit because the whole purpose here is to look after our rate pace and for the people of moscow that will benefit through this it will be great the only other option be council goes out to expressions of interest from people who want to have an rv park and therefore we 'll be saying no you can 't if you don 't fit in no you can 't you can 't_''_3855.28 finish this way at least they can choose blocks that we know that council would approve and they can actually approach those people and say are you aware that council could approve you to do this is this something you 're interested in i think you 're preempting things there i would actually move that we defer this again then until we come back with that one more month until we actually get we need a recommendation that we can discuss and that we 're privy to more than a minute beforehand okay we might come back that yeah that 's that 's good that 's a good record that 's a good uh motion but it 's very hard to take it like take it and ball on board when it 's just been presented to us like this i would be happier to wait one more month work out the actual what the recommendation is going to be then we can fully debate and discuss it while we 're fully informed that 's what my uh practice would there be something you 're in yeah as you know i 'm all for this um but i think the process has to be done i was i was happy to move along one of those lines today but um listen if we if we do defer it and we bring it back next month we 've gotta we 've gotta move on with something uh because these things are just dragging out too long if it is we move on and get it going i know i 've been contacted by a couple of caravan park owners lately who don 't agree with this but i 've got their opinion i just think it 's great and i think we 've just got to move with them whatever whichever option we 're going to do we 're going to move exactly i said it does concern me if the original motion if we just choose one of them and that doesn 't work out we 're going to have to be back at the same date in a couple months time so i think it 's better that we actually received the actual this is what we can 't physically do this is this will happen if we choose it as you know i don 't agree with the rv strategy i don 't think it 's uh i don 't think it 's a benefit for the shire i think the figures are a little bit exaggerated on how much they do spend the night do you respect councillor the unless you 've it doesn 't cost much more to stay at the sheriff and what they 're saying that 's that 's beside the point that could i 'm not i 'm not doubting what the staff have found but i think it 's going to be a cost to rate payers and i don 't believe they i don 't believe it 's a benefit to show i mean we still will be paying to treat the series they need water there will be no security in these places it 's i don 't believe they 're a good thing for the community and getting back to i don 't understand why they 're entitled to stay for nothing when people other people have to pay and the fact that they 're saying they 're self-contained i don 't think there 's a caravan that 's made anymore that 's not self-contained they 're all self-contained they all have toilets and shells and cooking facilities so that 's not an argument they can use because everything 's self-contained i don 't know how we 're going to police there 's going 't agree with the rb strategy in the show at all and if you have a look australia-wide there 's only a handful of them australia-wide a handful virtual handful so i 'm guessing then we 're going to possibly defer this well and i would like to also um when this comes back to the next workshop i think i only need to come back from one workshop but i would like to um say to start from that because when we come back into the workshop to present this i would like as a counsellor all the information you have received regarding any correspondence you have received caravan parts to be included in the workshop because i 'd like to know exactly how they 're feeling i 've spoken to some um i 've received emails from some so i would like anything that we 've received that i think should have gone to councillors so we can have a full detail of what 's going on so that would be good that would keep councils that 's the case i think we should have four correspondence from seen through you michael that information is all contained in the consultation notes that have been presented to council at the previous workshop and i believe were attached to the business case we got some samples of surveys that were filled out in our last workshop okay if there 's anything the full details we 'll certainly continue the surveys as well what people have said in the emails for and for and against that would be great thank you all right so then uh councillor is moving to defer i 'd like to take the next to the next yeah yeah you probably don 't need to put in the words workshop but anyway just defer to the next council meeting yeah but that sucked that 's mean perfect um we 'll put that to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.11 this is the wander beach caravan park caretakers management agreement the recommendation is the council resolves to approve the appointment of steve matson excuse me and jackie thomas as caretaker managers of wonga beach caravan park for initial period of one by one year option of the enumeration as stated in the financial section of the report delegate authority in accordance with section 257 local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize all matters associated with this matter we have a movement for that one please cancel zamataro seconded by councilman amatara would like to speak to it i 've had a discussion with residents of wonga beach caravan park and they 're very happy that these this couple are taking it over they 're very happy with them as as we know there has been some problems out there and they 're very happy that these guys are going to be running it so i think it 's a great idea anyone wish to speak against any further comments from councillors no i agree council zamasura seemed to be a constant stream that we were getting complaints from there and it 's been quite for quite some time now which is fantastic so it 's obviously working we 'll put that to debate all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.12 uh fort short film is council resolved to approve the request to amend the port shorts film festivals can 't resource the performance agreement to extend the expiry date by one year from october 21 to october 22 and then delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalise four matters in relation to the above agreement i 'm happy to move that one into a second before councilman um yeah it 's a great event for shorts and unfortunately again covert has mucked them around this year but certainly i 'm sure once everything 's back to normal they will present an amazing show like they have before which is something that we should all be proud of some of those photos that go around of you know the screen and the lit palm trees and it 's just one of those instagramable moments and it 's a great product so i 'm more than happy to do so anyone we should speak against um just one comment the funding they would receive this year that 's just going to be moved to the to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously that brings us to 5.13 requests for funding taste port douglas uh the council supports taste for douglas by the way is sponsoring the 21 event with ten thousand exclusive gst cashing client cash and inclined use of market park port douglas for the purpose of holding the event and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to administer matters associated with the above if you have a mover for this one councillor molly [Music] yes um i just want a quick question um it says in the paper here that we have no budget for this do we have do we have any budget that we can put forward because my concerns are as we don 't have the budget money will need to be relocated from another council program or service which i have an issue with that i don 't believe that we should be taking money off any programs or services for this festival the reason i 'm saying this is that this is a douglas for this period of time we have a tourist body that we fund and i believe that these are these certain requests for money should be funded through tpdd so um the issue i have is that um i just don 't believe that we should be taking money out of programs services for the ratepayers of this show to find this when money 's been given to our tourist body would you like to advise you maker um yes counselor we have not uh as tastesport hasn 't happened for the previous year or two we had not preempted that they would request sponsorship and during budget deliberations didn 't put any aside we will therefore ask the finance team to do their their magic and siphon it from somewhere else it 's ten thousand dollars it 's not a vast amount of money but it has not we have a no contingency budget so we don 't have a spare piggy bank somewhere so we 'll need to come from from somewhere else yeah i came supporting this motion the main reason being is that he had as our longest lunch goes now that longest lunch is currently operated by a cam 's company and doesn 't quite fit into the bicyclists bill douglas campaigners a lot of these restaurants that are doing this status at the time it was a case you know we said can we organize something so you can prove yourself but you can do it before we hand over one of carnival 's most iconic events and i think this not only is a great event taste for douglas was always huge for fort douglas and i 'm very excited that it 's coming back again i think the 10 000 towards that event is a a good investment and i also think it 's a great opportunity to assist these businesses to show that they are able to do along this lunch as well and it will give us good prospect of looking at getting local suppliers to look after one of our most iconic carnival events so i 'm happy to i 'm guessing that tpd wouldn 't have put this into their budget either so they wouldn 't be but i suppose you could look at it as well they weren 't 100 sure that they were going to get the full funding they requested as well so i 'm assuming they would have budgeted it for what they would assume they may have got so yeah but this would have been included yeah yeah yeah so no other comments we 'll put that to the vote then all those in favour chances are mataro council and only council occur council mcewen those against council of swamison thank you that carries all right that takes us to 5.14 the coded relief fee reduction for port douglas market storeholders um councillors would be aware that last week i sent through an alternate motion because i didn 't feel that the recommendation actually fitted into what i recall the workshop was that we discussed and that motion of the alternate would be that the council offers relief to still holders of the port douglas market to recognize the current impact of favored 19 travel restrictions on small businesses by bringing forward the low shoulder fee level as for the table below the show the low shoulder price normally changes anyway or commences the table of fees are there and then delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize all matters relating to the administration of the covered relief matter above and the ability to withdraw the relief if the interstate board is open prior to the 1st of january from my recollection that was pretty much what we discussed at the workshop um to be looking for a sector to get it onto the floor at least councillors thompson look i do appreciate what you 're trying to do there but i don 't think i i believe that 's the best overall um solution that council can come up with um i would actually prefer um to support choice number three and my reasoning behind that is because it 's it 's hard to find something that 's equitable for absolutely everyone and i just feel that that might be the most equitable for the storeholders as well as uh town uh shop shops what it does is that your that they do not want to attend thus do not have to pay a fee they can not attend without any um punishment also um yeah they can decide yeah it looks like uh there 's enough people around and don 't attend this week and therefore they feel that they can pay their fee so i would i actually prefer choice number three and almost so that 's why i won 't be supporting your amendment i think my response to that would be that you know port douglas markets not just a market they 're a tourism attraction we still have tourists coming here we 're sitting on thirty-three percent thirty-five percent offenses um those people that are coming here come here to see what our tourism attractions are there 's nothing worse than you turn up to a tourism attraction and half the enclosures are empty and closed doesn 't do anything for the tourist and doesn 't do anything for the reputation of what the markets are now giving an option for for the storeholders just not to come reduces the possibility of us getting income that we still have a market that is well attended by storeholders and know tourists can go there and see what the actual market is about not half thank you that 's my concern with that that motion why i suggested what i do so would you suggest that a with your emotion you could add point number three as well well i wouldn 't one point that 's that 's you know but even with the reduction of fees then they might not feel that it 's uh sufficient i don 't know that that that 44 weeks i do know is is a big sticky but at the best times is probably the sticking point for all the margaret schools even the shops in port douglas are not opening every night because they 're not having the clientele they don 't have the staff so to penalize the market stalls it is it 's not much good then coming to a market and losing it costing you the money to come and that 's why the shops are doing it they 're not openings it 's going to sticking point i think we need one sticking point with all the markets they don 't have to come every week and i 've spoken to a few of them i 've been over the last few weeks and they 're losing money when they come on the days when there 's no one around so um you did also mention that you know this is under review at a certain time so if you wanted to add that that comes under review also or that can be changed you know as as as things become better so just i don 't like the idea of encouraging people not to come and having a hard empty mind yeah but i don 't think it will encourage people not to come i think it will uh it will actually encourage people to come because it 's only in addition to what you have um so you 're you would like to see [Music] just an addition an additional yeah so move point two to point three of my recommendation and then add 0.3 of the previous one in as 0.2 of could be the best overall um and as you said down the bottom uh you know it comes under review and well extension at any time that we want to you can come under review in three months time if you want to i appreciate what you 're saying and what the storeholders are watching it just it concerns me that i 'd hate to see the reputation the markets diminish in any way because people go there and there 's only half to schools i know that happens during the low season anyway when the rain 's there hopefully you know we 'll see some improvement with the southerners from brisbane coming up in tasmania they 're doing a lot of marketing down there as well to get people here so sorry brendan that 's not uh i haven 't uh that was just a comment it 's just a comment it 's already in the last section anyway saying that you know the ceo can reassess it if the borders are open private first of january and look this is all because of the code once the cable having this discussion this won 't be an inspection yeah i agree with that i think it 's if people are coming to the market presently and losing money to get here i think you know it gives them that way out with the 44 weeks per hour so i 'm happy with that now well hopefully with those two items in it or encourage people to make an don 't have the option to come because of financial reasons they 've got the ability to not do it so i 'm happy with that cancer schools and if you 're happy with that then we can put that to the vote to be the new motion so all those in favor of that being the new motion and that 's carried anonymously so that now is the new motion that i 'm happy to move and council scholars are you happy to second so we can put that new motion to the boat um all those in favor of that and that 's carried in there you know thank you very much for that okay 5.15 financial report august for august 2021 i 'm happy to move that one this is the second for that one council scommerson got in there i was looking the wrong direction heard you say something um the yeah the normal detailed report that we do receive from the finance team thank you very much for that um still early in the year yet so we shall wait till we get later through to find the real results you know we 're doing what we can which is great and you know appreciate everything that the finance team does to keep us on track um wish to speak against any further comments from the chancellors tonight with that we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously okay we had a late item which came through which is the recommendation of the daintree ferry advisory committee it 's just a recommendation that we approve the establishment of a dangerous career advisory committee prepare a terms of reference to provide an ongoing governance over the community management operators and then delegates authority under section 257 of the finalize any and all matters associated with the establishment of a daintree very advisory group i 'm happy to move that one there 's a seconder for that councillor i will look that way eventually i promise we 've discussed this in workshops uh prior and um this was a something that was recommended after the closure of the ferry um a year or two ago for maintenance that um and the daintree ferry advisory committee was formed to give further detailed information to advice to councillors from the users of the ferry um to keep us more up-to-date with information so when we make decisions regarding different things with the ferry we can get advice from this committee so i 'm happy with that um anyone wish to speak against it i 'd like councillors look i did send a request in to defer this issue for another time because it was a late issue we only got the information yesterday quite late so i don 't think the reporter and i 'm not but there wasn 't time to probably complete the report but it doesn 't really who will they be picked i know that the deputy mayor has been suggested but we don 't have any on the advisory group who will be an advisor group and that you know what their expertise will be council owners very i think we have our own professionals that can fulfill that role anyway but i 'd like to see this report come back with how the committee will be decided what input they 'll have can i comment on that thank you um look it 's not a bad uh question really it 's a valid question i think um my i wanted what i would like what i wanted to do i was kind of happy to overall support this but i would i was looking for a funeral additions and perhaps councillor zamatara can have an addition as well to to to ease his mind god what one of us you know maybe it approved the establishment of the danger fair authority committee to be finalized after um i don 't know but in a sense that 's something that we work out how it comes step um something along those lines maybe you know [Music] approve this advisor committee [Music] if i may perhaps you know 2.2 prepare a terms of reference to provide and governance over the community management operations and bring that terms of reference back to council for approval absolutely that was actually one of the things i wanted to support but that 's not quite what council zamatara wants he wants to know how that advisory committee is going to be formulated sorry great question um that 's what the terms of brexit so the terms of reference will be how the committee is formed so whether it will be one councillor um management um county external two councillors so that 's that 's how the yeah so as an advisory body as well so the members will be decided through the terms of reference um how often whether it 's four five six times a year where they meet so that 's detailed in terms of reference um all right so it 's because it 's such a it can be such a lengthy document to to get ready it what the reference will look like um and then that 's when you bring that back to council once the the committee has since approval has been done okay so what one thing also that i wanted to add and this will then not be found i 'm guessing in the terms of reference was that i 'm very happy to to have one council member as what is it named as on the committee on the advisory committee but i what i would like is that other councils are allowed to attend the meetings as observers i think um and so that all councils will be invited to all meetings um should they wish to attend and i think that 's important and through the chair that 's already one of the in the draft terms of references that have been going through okay um that 's good dan so council thanks i just um just to clarify you 're saying he 'll come back to council with the committee before it 's selected for the council to make decisions correct i 'll bring it back to a workshop the meeting um is how the membership is to what the membership is to hold how many how we 'll do that process we 'll discuss that through that that whole process taking you through um whether it 's a change of commerce of the owners over north of the river what make up whether it 's four ten traditional owner groups so you will work through that whole process this is just about getting the the approval to establish a dangerous ferry advisory committee because we really don 't have what their role is going to be what weight they 'll have you know will they be involved in the operation of the ferry or the running times of the fair we don 't we don 't have that in this report and that 's what we need to clarify before this short term and i think at the end of the day this is an advisory committee we 're still the decision makers so what they will do we bring things to us to decide whether we wish to go ahead i mean they could turn around and know financially that 's impossible you couldn 't do it so we couldn 't prove that but there could be ideas being regular users on a daily basis they could make suggestions to us and it 's actually well that 's going to be a good idea that 'll speed things up so we can approve things like that but where the decisions committee has no delegation so nothing can be delegated down to an advisory so depending on whether they 're talking about if the ferry 's going to come out for you know the every couple of years when it has to it might be that they have recommendations to come about how council officers approach that with consultation with the community um about notice it 's it 's all those sorts of things that 's what the advisory to be on that advisory um committee as well well that way as long as we have a say in here what 's going on and i get to know how what what they 're absolutely what their role actually is which will be the chance of reference so of a dangerous ferry advisory committee prepare a terms of reference to provide the ongoing governments over committee management operations and that the terms of reference be brought back to the future council meeting for approval and delegates so you 're happy to know that then as an amendment yes um we have a second for that thing everyone 's happy with that we 've put that to the boat to be the new motion so we 'll put that to the boat then that 's carried in so that now becomes the new motion um i 'm happy with that i 've moved it originally uh councillor scomason you 're happy with that you seconded it originally so that now becomes the new notion because no one wishes to speak against that then we can put that to the vote so all those in favor and that 's carry unanimously all right the two late items after that were withdrawn so that takes us through to the notices of motion um i 'd like to give my attention notice i 'll attempt to move the following motion that the to itself develop retirement style living houses at both the properties in wassman land parcel sp 259098 and in craigslea land parcels sp 323468 c2251 and cc252251 i 'm happy to second that um so um in 2016 the council approved a salvation army um facility and there is that block uh 2.849 hectares which is owned by the council near there so what at the moment council councillors are sorry council staff are looking at options of putting some type of retirement uh facility there i just would like council to have a look at it and just see if it 's an option that we can do because i think it 's important that we get this moving because we have an aging population in the shire and i think it 's sad that our asian population once they the family home is too big for them and they want to go into a supported or a more safe environment to be able to live and i just think that we need to start working on something for these people and a lot of our aging population is 's really sad that we can 't offer them anything where they 've got to either go to maribor or cairns away from the family and um and i just think that council we should be able to do a little bit more and not look at trying to make huge profits but make it a reasonable sensible development so people can afford to either buy themselves a little home or unit in there or rent so that 's what i just wanted to do anyone wish to speak against [Music] retirement villages uh and i i agree with council 's common to an extent that we do but we 've already approved one in port douglas that is going to provide houses um in it you state that expression of interest were put out and people weren 't really interested well they weren 't interested because they sort of told they 're not going to make money they wouldn 't get a return on their investment and that 's the worry that i have with ratepay being lumbered with that burden of losing you know good investment of a [Music] it 's not a council business and if it 's going to cost rate payers money i don 't believe we should be getting involved in it and it 's not these guys don 't because they can 't need these guys i 'm talking to guys that are experts in the field guys that do this for a living that have come and said to us they can 't make money out of that small parcel of land with a retirement village i also sort of think we 've got to start looking at you know the shy we 've got some critical infrastructure that needs repairing badly i mean they can 't though shy will exist without a retirement religious weight without a water supply we 've just spent thousands of dollars on fixing a water main up coral sea drive and one beside it 's done so it 's got to be fixed as well and if you speak to the managers there 's a lot of money to be spent on critical infrastructure it 's got to be fixed as soon as we can so a way but if we 're going to lose money on it we don 't have the money we need that money now to be um looking at the infrastructure that needs repairing immediately well the reason i 've supported this because one it 's not a retirement village in the sense of what they propose and they 're proposing something where they own the land and you just buy the house and resell them all the rest of it totally different this is retirement it 's purely for council to subdivide that block build a multitude of little one and two bedroom units and sell half of them off to people who want to teach the first and whatever the case may be for rental properties um you know so it 's in the sense council developing the site themselves and i agree with council we 've gone to these people they keep coming back saying there 's no money in it to run a retirement facility okay so why can 't council at least look at this and go well let 's create retirement giving and sell the make some money for council out of it you know since there 's not a retirement facility and such as retirement living units which is very different and i think that you know we can 't wait another five years so i agree with there 's a report came through the document that they 're still asking people continue down that track let 's see if we can find someone at the same time i think it 's great to at least look at this see if it 's possible and so that keeps failing we have as a council have an option that we can provide this suitable living for these people that desperately need it can you just respond to council um um i understand council san matara what you 're saying about the funding for water and stuff like that um the retirement village that they 're building in port douglas at the moment that 's not going to be our elderly people in washington particularly not going to be able to live somewhere like that that 's going to be way too expensive but you know and budget time next budget to be able to discuss a lot of things and and i 'm not saying to use our funds that we allocate for you know the um water sewage and all of that but we need to with the extra time that we will have in future budget discussions we may be able to look at a better and more practical on how we spend our budget in this shower so it 's it 's not taking money away from sewage or anything let 's just look at the big picture instead of just going down one track of what somebody else can offer us the initial outlay for a development like this yes millions we 're not talking houses in the subdivision and that 's basically what what elise is asking for is to provide a report so we can have a look at that and we might just say we can 't do it yeah if we can 't afford it we can 't afford it but let 's just give it a go just see that 's the wrong thing look i and i 've just got some ideas and points i 'd like to discuss if you have to keep making it even perhaps even a better motion okay um right now the piece of land of mossman has always been earmarked for development to this type of purpose um and so i 've got no big problem with that i have a concern about looking at council freehold land and port douglas it 's a little it 's it 's a different nature and i believe it 's way too valuable for this concept to be developed upon um now when we look back at the expansion expressions of interest that was for the mossman land the mage and we dissected the expression of the interest the major reasons why there was little interest was because the block was not big enough to put enough houses on to be profitable now that the block of land of port douglas is even smaller quite significantly smaller i think it just it 'd be a waste of time even looking at it for that plus i really think we need to have land policy by memory says something on the lines of you can only use counter freehold land for capital works that type of stuff if you know if you want to sell it or such a while have to have a look into that okay so i would be very happy to have a look at business cases uh for the blocks and mossman i think we 're um back up along the tree i strongly think we 're back at the long long tree to look at craig league it 's too small plus i believe it uh it 's it 's not the best use of that land okay for council so that 's the first thing um now if we 're going to go down the track of approving this emotion all i would like to suggest is to have somewhere in your motion maybe a second point that the report any report must include referencing to but not limited limited to it and i 'll just a sec brenda okay because there 's a few things here the asset management framework okay the corporate plan the corporate sustainability general policy council 's role of regional economic development general policy and the strategic freehold land general policy because we need to reference that in this report to see if it 's going to be a good use of council resources so would you be uh happy to include a second point that says that those okay i 'll re-read them out if you like them brenda so so the report must include referencing but not limited to the following you have a look if you 're happy to counsel um must include must include referencing must include referencing two but not limited to okay the asset management framework because it talks about any assets that counts all right um the corporate plan shortage that 's okay the long-term financial plan because that looks so you know in the next 10 years the asset and service management general policy general policy the corporate sustainability general policy council 's role in regional economic development general policy and these are important because if it doesn 't work within these policies it 's not going to work essentially original economic and freehold land so that would be a point too and then enhance good governance in the report that 's all sorry um um yeah as i seconded it yeah i will also agree to that thing that had it um the report must include referencing to but i certainly would hope that my core things will come back to counsellors for a sensible decision to be made if it looks at the recommendation because you know for people that are sitting there listening that may be retiree looking for somewhere to live at the moment now you can understand why we have so much difficulty finding places because these are all the types of documents that we need to decipher through so that 's why we have a council here to look at these things and make rational decisions around them so that if they 're included in the report remember policies are uh formulated from legislation just remember that also legislation is bigger than just the council council are you firm on looking at the land parcels in craig lab because i think it 's a waste of time but uh i suppose if we have these passes of land there as well um i suppose there 's not going to be any extra to have a look at them just to see if they 're suitable for there oh it 's a very valuable piece of land that could be and we have one already in port douglas being developed this one in mossman has been earmarked that land has been careful i strongly believe that that land is valuable and i think our retirees are just as valuable and i believe that you know that land there would be absolutely suitable if we can 't go across this highway where retirement village should be um that is the next best option and i know there are absolutely people screaming out for this facility to be made in port douglas and we 're not talking about the one that is being built where the old pool was you know the price range of those is you know luxury it 's certainly not going to be for your normal residents that need to move into retirement properties it 's looking at that and looking at appropriate and sensible housing in both areas not just mossman so we 'll just get a report on it comes back to all the properties so if um lisa and i both agree to that alternative motions so we will put that to the vote to become the motion always in favor of that and that 's carrick 's now on inaudible with that we 'll put it to the boat then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously as well that concludes today 's meeting thank you very much for attending the time is 11 49 and we shall now close the meeting thank you _"

does anyone wish to speak against it all right any other comments we 'll put that to the vote then all those in favor council only invader and that 's carrick unanimously 5.3 contractual matter ultra resolves in accordance with section 235 of the local government regulations 2012 to accept the single source quotation from tech proprietary limited abn 60609-331-084 and the amount of hundred and

something that has to be done anyone wish to speak against any other comments from councils wonderful this is the same as normal this is the only company that does provide these certain ones and that 's why it comes before us all right so we 'll put that to the votes all those in favour thank 5.4 contract 202023 smart water meters the recommendation from staff excuse me is the council resolves to

a movement for this one please max mcewen seconder councillor scottism councilman and trying to speak to it all i 'd like to say is that i think it 's um great that we 're going to get these smart meters in i think everyone in the room has probably had excess water bills taken out before so hopefully this to speak against any other comments from counselors no i have to absolutely agree with you this is something that 's long overdue and i look forward to seeing them get put in um and hopefully it will take away this burden that of water the community will have the ability to have constant 24 hour access to their own water bills and they 'll be able to see if there is any leaks and it 's going to be a great thing for the shire so we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor councillor nolan invader thank you and that 's carried unanimously thank you 5.5 approved inspection program dog registration the recommendation is that council approves a systematic approved inspection program to be carried out from the 20th september 2021 for a period of not more than six months from that date to ensure compliance with registration requirements of the animal management cats and dogs act 2008. i 'm happy to move that one is there a seconder for that councilman as the report says you know this is a standard practice of councils there 's been at least half a dozen councils in this area that have gone through this process recently um i think it 's extremely important for the staff when they do come across either dogs that have been claimed have been vicious or dogs trapped easily and registration is part of the laws in queensland and therefore we are the policing agent we do need to ensure that those and all these animals are registered appropriately anyone wish to speak against it um well i just got one thing to say i think it 's a good idea what they 're trying to do and it 's part of um registration within shires the only issue i have and i know it 's a um it 's in the act but i just what i 'd like to see is a program of exactly what areas you 're going to look at so people are prepared to know that you 're coming to look at their properties because what i have an issue is is compliance officers going into a property when no one 's home and having access to their property i know it 's in the act and they 're able to do it but i just think that we could probably be a lot more proactive with the community by giving them full warning that they 're coming out to their think that we get into a bit of trouble with um we go to a property in no one 's home and we don 't have a look in the backyard so i just want to i think we can be a lot more proactive with this and let the community know exactly what we 're going to do and how we can do it in a friendly matter manner because people do get a little bit hot on the collar when you know they know you 've been there and they haven 't been home and it 's just invasion of privacy and i will pass over to miss roberts because she can reiterate what advice she gave me as well uh yes thank you through you mega council scholars on our intention is not in most instances to actually enter people 's properties despite the fact that it does give us that ability under the act um dogs generally by barking so a rattle of a gate or a knock on the front door is probably going to tell us everything we need to know staff do have if the data is telling us if we can hear a dog 's there and the data is telling us there 's a doc registered there then that 's a tick and move on and obviously for officer safety which is obviously paramount we don 't want people just wandering around in people 's backyards i think the challenge with giving people um exactly where we 're going to be and when is the dogs will get moved dogs will get hidden and that kind of goes against what the program 's about so that 's my only concern about that um but when you know obviously that gives us all these things we have to let people know what we 're doing this will have to be rigorously advertised once the if it 's approved today um and and that 's their notice that we 're coming so um i i hope that answers your query um our intent is not to be snooping around in people 's backyards it 's to find dogs that are currently registered and i think that 's that 's really inappropriate that we something that we 're going to be cutting locks and padlocks to get into people 's properties it 'll be simply a case of going property to property and you as you said you 'll hear a dog barking if there 's a boat there and if there 's not a dog registered that property straight away you know okay need to make better enquiries on this property yes and it 's you know it will be done in uh an appropriate manner it 's certainly not going to be a rough and tackle and just break down your doors to get your dog i suppose if we do a good media release on that absolutely like a promotion for registering your dog now yes before we start this process as well yeah yeah so just to give a little bit more background the last approved inspection program that cairns regional council ran which was in 2019 they got a huge influx as soon as they advertised of people who hadn 't who had forgotten impacts to re-register and also new registrations so we we expect that we might see 're picking up just all the others in the program i will bring up one of the other comments that was brought up as the council doesn 't issue tags anymore and we do issue tags still they 're just a lifetime tag now so if you haven 't received one you don 't have a tag and you want one for your animal contact front desk and you will be reissued a new one but we just don 't want to be reissuing plastic tags every year just for the fact of doing it you know it just goes against the plastic policy so if you don 't have a tag you don 't contact front desk and they can get you a new one counselor knowledge did you have anything on that one a couple of questions uh and i look for uh the clarity of the understanding of the public that they have yes go ahead excellent thank you um so essentially this power to end into people um premises already exist is that correct we 're just uh essentially we 're having a council resolution to less correct miss robert through you make her yes counselor nolly that 's correct um a number of different acts um provide this power and it 's the power to enter a property without consent um so it 's not the power to force entry um [Music] and essentially it has to be done by council resolution it has to be approved by council resolution okay great so that was the second part of my question we actually need this council resolution um to finish off the project is that correct yes that 's correct thank you any other questions thank you wonderful and just to finish off i will add that it was actually in the 2122 operational plan that was approved by councillors to to do this process as well so with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor councillor knowley yeah and that 's carried unanimously thank you very much all right 5.6 the financial report for july 21 the recommendation is the council notes the financial report for july 2021 do we have a move for that one council scotland seconded to him wonderful anyone wish to speak against any further comments from councillors no yes it 's just the first one for the start of this financial year so what 's up um did you want to add anything to it excuse me um through you mercur probably just an item tonight is the um performance of the ferry because obviously the town 's um really dropped off with all the lockdowns so the ferry had done quite well um in july but it 's going to swing pretty badly this month we can see that already so just a heads up on that one yeah that 's awesome thank you thank you um that will put it to the votes all those in favor council only thank you thank you and let 's carry unanimously 5.7 rupture the sole specialized supplier register the recommendation is the council resolves to approve the attached list of sole suppliers and or specialized suppliers and the s235 amd the local government regulations 2012 for the supply of equipment and services for a period of two years and then delegates authority under section 257 officer to enter into contracts negotiate finalize and execute any and all matters associated with in relation to sole suppliers subject to council 's normal procurement policies and practices have a movement for that one please i 'm sure councilman seconded by councillors commission council mcewen try to have any comments okay anyone wish to speak against comments from um just one couple of comments here this report that we were given um this was approved in uh may 21. some of the um things on here have inspired do they so by bringing this back now um it 's basically um reinvigorating for another two years but i usually bring this report every six months yeah 12 months because we add and delete some suppliers we have i have i started through them i have gone out to each department and had them review this and they 've given me any that are in highlighted in yellow and are added and you can see them with the red editions there any thing wanted to be removed have been struck out so they 're the only changes that um that they 're passed to be removed yeah yeah there 's been some instances where you know they 're no longer the other provider or the appropriate provider that sort of thing so was there anything in particular well the tpdd one hasn 't been updated because we 've passed that one through recently yeah so the whole register 's brought back so right don 't continue it 's really just the the items that are in yellow and red [Music] carried unanimously thank you all right so then we move to 5.8 which is rates interest grace period extension and there 's the council resolved to endorse the extension of the interest grace period to 30 days for the current rates levy is due on the 26th of august 2021 which i 'm happy to move that one there a seconder for it councillor scomason um again this is exactly what it says it 's just a grace period it 's normally eight days i believe and we 're extending that to 30 days so it gives people just an extra month if they are finding it difficult at the um hopefully that 'll assist them in still being able to get their rates paid before any interest starts accruing and by all means though if anyone is having hassles with their paying their rates it 's so important that you do contact staff and allow the staff to give you the opportunity to to work out a payment plan or you know do something with them rather than just let it be um anyone to speak against any comments from councillors [Music] the only thing i 'd like to say is that shane we didn 't bring us to a previous meeting because people most people would have paid their rates by now so just bad timing maybe next year well i will certainly keep in mind for the next one because that 's unfortunate something that came up after that all right we 'll put that to the votes all those in favor council thank you thank you and that 's carrick unanimously 5.9 the draft reconciliation action plan uh the recommendation is that council approves the draft reconciliation plan the wrap to submit to the reconciliation australia please councillor scottish in the second goodbye councilman q and councillor scottism would you like to talk to um i would just like to say thank you and well done to margaret and lisa and team this is a really good document and um and it really shows the effort that we are trying to move forward with indigenous people in this show so i really want to say thank you really good well done job thank you anyone wish to speak against and we 'll go to comments from counsellors any other comments from any counsellors customer uh thank you i just was just closing and reiterating that this is long overdue it 's fantastic document it actually working the walk rather than just talking the talk and you know that 's what we wanted uh from this and we 're just so excited to see this happen and you know as we spoke about i can 't wait to get to the next stage and the following stage and you know actually just be completed and have a full wrap for this region would be amazing so with in favor councillor nolly and that 's carried unanimously thank you 5.10 the review of black spot towers in the douglas shire the recommendation is the council resolves to formally decommission the alexander range television tower broadcast equipment decommissioned the daintree village television tower on the 30th of june 2022 made by all daintree village residents of the towers decommissioning 's planned for the 30th of june 2022 conduct a survey of the shannon vale and cassowary residents to ascertain how many residents access television channels from the south mossman television tower and bring the survey results back to council to be workshopped anyone wish to speak against then we 'll go to comments from cancers [Music] nothing thank you all right yes as the report says this was a federally funded uh program originally that was put through to give people television access and so surely they 've walked away from it and left it in council 's hands and the equipment is now at an age and a cost where it 's just not beneficial to the rate payers to be looking at constantly repairing it when we access television from so if anyone is concerned please have a look at the document of course contact staff if they 've got any issues but of course we look forward to that survey being carried out and seeing the results of that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor councillor nolan and that 's carrick unanimously excuse me all right so that takes us through to the 5.11 resource and performance agreement right to read from the triple r the recommendation is that council sponsors the reef to reconcile event with a resource and performance agreement over three years for a twenty thousand dollars gst exclusive and ten thousand in-kind support per year or b fifteen thousand and ten the gst exclusive and ten thousand kind support per year and then delegates authority under section two five seven the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any and all matters associated with the agreement okay the movement for that one please i 'm happy to move that one seconded by council of zamatara um i 'll just start the reef to to run here um and was very very popular with the locals um had a very big attendance from douglas as well as cairns it was certainly missed when it stopped and it is also an event that utilizes douglas you know so it 's something that starts and finishes in douglas and it is a very to me is a very good event something that 's well worth spending money on um with that anyone wish to speak against it i 've got a few questions to ask okay there 's no one against them we 'll go to comments yes um first a couple of questions um we 've got budget allocated for this uh through me yes we have interests okay and i see that they 're going through two other shows do we know they have provided funding as well or it 's just this show that 's providing funding uh i 'll need to take that question on those yeah we 'll get back to you but i would like to comment yeah i would hate to think that um um that we 're we the only shy doing it when other children have been accessed and promoted as well so um i just think with the great pace of the shire um the planning should be split three ways that 's going to happen that 's all yeah thanks for the question through mayor traditionally this event is very well supported by both the kanda regional council the kansai board and things like that other part of the iron man group um they do have a long history of me this next one in 2022 will be the 10-year anniversary of the event but certainly i 'll get back to you any other comments from counselors counselor knowing no nothing so i 'm assuming from this we need to choose option a or option b um i will add just from councillor scommerson 's comments that one of the big issues that douglas has always had with the cams iron man is funding something that they don 't finish here bulk of the money that is spent by these patrons is the people where it finishes the race and you know we will be race finishing here in douglas and that 's i think why burton 's put on us to contribute towards it as well so we need to look at a or b um i 'll start with council response sanitary sorry what 's your thoughts about that i don 't see there 's much difference in either with five thousand dollars i 'd like to ask mr smith what do you find appropriate that we should be putting through into it thanks for the question terrorist were you there um as far as branding and positioning on raceware promotional materials and things of this nature and our ability to negotiate to include different things in the race program and on the website i would think that the 20 000 amount for that sponsorship is appropriate to be seen as one of the principal supporters that as you say for the five thousand dollar amount um we do get a little bit more um representation on the base gear and things of that nature um and particularly um with the potential more getting trail being part of our tourism offer and our anything that we can do to improve our standing with the event would be seen as beneficial for our promotional efforts um and the event does also finish at four mile as well um and we can also negotiate some extra activities down there at german park and things of this stuff that if we have a little bit more um say as a primary sponsor actually beneficial with the showers with what you 're saying yeah yeah so end of race activities those types of things is that that 's your question you know i wondered why there was two options so close so again through you man um we had a workshop a couple of yeah yeah and we sort of discussed that it would be good to have a second auction you know just to sort of find out what we could negotiate and that that was what was presented to me from the group well i 'm more than happy to kick it off i 'm quite happy with option a for the 20 000 to get the best bang for buck for this one advertising little bit more i think for five thousand dollars so we will need to move then to amend the motion um so the movement to amend the motion is to make it a 20 000 which i 'm happy to move that one if there 's a seconder for that i 'm sure councilman um all those in favor of amending the emotion to be 20 000. councillor noli okay so that 's carried so that now is the new motion so the motion sits that um this council sponsors the reef and reef to read and triple r event with the resource performance agreement over three years the twenty thousand dollars gst exclusive and ten thousand dollars in kind support per year delegates authority under section two five seven local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any and all matters associated with the agreement which again i 'm happy to move that i actually and the seconder for that one council zamatara again so therefore that 's how it sits all those in favor counselor knowledge and that 's now carried as that then thank resource and performance agreement a wonderland entertainment ledger the recommendation is that council resolve to enter into a three-year resource and performance agreement with wonderland entertainment and leisure departure limited for 55 000 exclusive of gst plus 10 000 inclined per annum to provide the wonderland spiegel tent for the 2022 2023 and 2024 port douglas carnival subject to the conditions contained within this report and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer who finalized any and what matters associated with this agreement for that one please councillor seconded by councilman house 's sponsor would you like to speak to um i think the carnival especially the wonderland um is a great thing for this show every year because a lot of locals go to it and um and i think it 's that little bit extra for the shire and so i support this um because i think it 's something not just for our visitors but for our locals as well anyone wish to speak against okay we 'll open up the comments from counsellors any comments at all the wonderland spiegel tent has been an absolute asset to carnevale for the past years that has been there um it is highly visited by both locals and tourists which is you know the whole intention of it you know a lot of people go down and have dinner afterwards and drinks around afterwards and before it and so it certainly gets its value for money for the right players and couldn 't think of anything better to have there at the moment i know she 's got great intentions of growing the tent as well and you know doing other things with it which is fantastic so that will put it to the votes for those in favor councillor knowley indicator and that 's carried unanimously okay 5.13 the resource and performance agreement for mossman and district show society the recommendation is the council enters into a resource and performance agreement with the mossman district show society for the term of three years to 30 july 2024 and to the value of twenty thousand dollars exclusive gst per annum in kind and delegates authority under section 257 the local and all markets in relation to the agreement have a movement for that one please councillor zamotaro seconded by councilman councillor would you like to speak to him oh look i think it 's the national shows the integral part of mostly society always has been for a long time and it 's proven this year with how many people turned up they just got a question from this golden pokemon um the 20 000 in kind support since it 's been determined and constantly present the muslim district show society is that the um twenty thousand dollars they find that said that 's enough that that 's um through you may um that 20 000 amount was negotiated a couple of years ago um and we understand based on the requests that they 've had for different income work that it 's more than enough to cover the worst they 've had in the past council knowledge you have any comments okay yeah i couldn 't agree more council zamatara it 's a fantastic event for mossman it 's certainly well visited um and i think it 's absolutely with um i do know the performance agreement used to be 15 500 back in july 19. did that go up for last years so that 's gone up consistently and now it 's 20 000. um so are we sorry are we cemented in with twenty thousand if next year they say we need it 's got to be more is that is that going to come back to council resolution would have to come back to us but certainly that 's just i think 20 000 is a good starting point and we can certainly work with them to grow the show absolutely so also my profile would say that you know it 's not just for the douglas for mossman it 's for the shore plus you get lot of a lot of people come up from keynes and that 's right links absolutely and i think it 's great to have this money in the shop we 're not giving it to someone outside the show so we should need to support this really strongly so well done it 's actually a 3d media it 's we 'll put it to the vote for all those in favor councillor molly and that 's carried unanimously and that completes today 's agenda thank you very much everyone for attending and we will close the meeting at 10 37 am thank you _"

the rates and utility charges levied in the financial year compared to the rate 's utility charges levied in the previous budget the revenue statement and the revenue policy adopted by council resolution on 27th april 21 is table to be adopted second at least councillor scottism and i think i 'd like to start again by thanking you miss colleen and your team of course uh joe and sandeep for the work that you 've completed on what has again been an extremely difficult budget for our shower no one would have predicted covert 19 and no one certainly would have ever predicted the ongoing effects these viruses had on all economies around the world unfortunately douglas is certainly not immune to these ongoing economic circumstances and an incredible amount of time and effort has gone into these budget supports to ensure we can get the best outcome for our ratepayers the acknowledgment of that work to your whole team is paramount i 'll start by saying that this but this is a budget of reality whilst i know i would certainly absolutely prefer to have seen a lot more things that i know residents and rutgers are asking for the simple fact is that this financial year we as a council also need to recover we need to recover from the shortfall and revenues that occurred whilst helping businesses and heightened code of 19 period upon reflection i certainly have no regrets in doing so and i 'm proud this council was able to assist where we could now though is the time to bring the direction back to making this this council and the region sustainable for the long-term future i believe this is a responsible budget that continues to deliver transparency sensible investment and renewals as well as strengthening the shy 's economy for its future last year covert 19 lockdowns and restrictions depleted our local economy we must learn from this if we don 't it was a wasted experience and could well occur again where we 'll be at the end of this period will be determined by the tough decisions this council makes now to set ourselves up for the future in the 2021 financial year this council budgeted to deliver its biggest capital works program bringing over 33 million dollars worth of projects for a small council this is an achievement well worth noting this budget currently has a further 16 million dollars going to capital works with items such as a million dollar lee estate online so we can increase our housing availability eight million dollars in civil works including the cycleway from kuya to moscon replacement of manchester bridge replacement of warner bridge and roads and footpaths and pep side renewals you 'll commenced works on the mauston port douglas sports master plan furthered the indigenous signage program put 450 000 into parks and gardens and most importantly over 4 million into further future briefing of water and wastewater with renewals upgrades and improvements as further ground funding does become available more projects can be added to this list we will continue with sensible policy and investment to build our resistance to the outside influences by continuing to grow our rate base diversifying our industries and exploring revenue raising opportunities this council continues to have an important role to play in keeping our local economy moving whilst we are gaining an elusive surplus gaining towards the elusive surplus goal we can 't lose sight of ensuring that our communities are well sustainable as well council 's financial position is now expected to be pushed back to a 2.35 million operating deficit and increase to 2.8 across the board better than the 3.3 increase that was originally forecasted meanwhile about 36 of people living in units known as residential building units will see a reduction in their rates bill you will also see through our new categories that if you live in your household unit your rates will now be lower than those with holiday homes or rental properties the new categories achieve a more equitable equitable distribution of rates closer in line with community expectations under our new categories people who live locally in their house or unit have a fairer assessment of their bills than ever before there will be winners and losers in these new categories that the playing field is certainly becoming more even and further rate assessments will be made this financial year to further improve the fairness and balance of the rating properties i do appreciate that some may be critical of this minimum increase of 2.8 being more than cpi which was the goal and i 'll be the first to apologize for that but no one foresaw of the way with the effects of profit enough revenue to be able to offer the current service levels plus more in this shine we are persisting at looking for ways to create jobs alleviate housing shortages repair infrastructure and ensure our economy becomes stronger unfortunately we are still facing uncharted territories but we continue our commitment to getting the shire back on track through growth and diversity rather than cutbacks and reductions so i wish to speak against linoleum so i will speed against this country today i believe it is a precarious budget that stretches the boundaries beyond comfort and beyond improvements and therefore being beyond critters is not really responsible a 3.6 million deficit is going to take us seven years to fall back according to the long-term financial forecast look at the comparison of the amalgamation debt service which was 4.1 million and that took a year less in comparison other notable comparisons between these two budgets was the revenue for the 14-15 budget the amalgamation budget was 33.7 million this year 's budget of regular revenue is 47.5 million nearly 14 million dollars more yet the difference in capital growth is only about difference where is the money going this year 's budget for operational expenditure is forty five thousand dollars short of 50 minutes compared to 39 million only seven years ago eleven million dollars difference in a few years but for the most part in just the last two budgets last year 's proposed one a deficit will occur in budgets and that 's not in contention and covert happened what is concerning is how it has been handled with the amount of revenue that this shine has today and historical evidence evidence there 's proof that there can be less space to get the same result in a smart budget if you continue to increase rates as is happening here the deficit should decrease more quickly than what has been presented to us in a successful proven budget there 's either rate rises or more done about cutting operation budget and bringing that under control one will be able to decrease the difference more quickly the deficit needs to be better addressed but there needs to be a better plan together and get out of it faster the longer it budget the right continue to increase a value for money decreases where are the promises now as a counsellor i continuously get clear messages from the community that council should exercise financial and operational constraint focus on critical infrastructure in the community and ultimately drive a smart approach across organisations with the large multi-million dollar deficit this organisation now has council needs to exercise great operational restraint to avoid cost blowouts it is undoubtedly a challenge for greater rigour and prudence to the commitments investments that council do must be implemented the 2021 2082 budget is neither here nor there in my rights it doesn 't tackle the deficit question aggressively enough nor does it bring value for money consuming the amount of revenue coming in comparison anyone else wish to speak um positive just in relation to the grants and subsidies um we know why that 10 million difference is there because we haven 't finished a few projects but i just noticed in there that we 've got um 4.5 million penciled in for next year where normally on the long term area we have 1.1 is there something do we have funds already being promised to us and if we do can you just um through the man yes although there will be some carry forward capital grant funding from this year that doesn 't wash out until we know what 's completely finished and can be carried forward and that 's actually usually around september so you will see in um around november when we do a requires budget there 'll be a carry forward project so there 'll be an increase probably the work 's been conducted and also an increase that carried forward funding um the four uh five or four point six million that we 're having there at the moment we only ever put in new funding that is guaranteed and being approved and we do have um some funding in there we 've got some um roads to recovery funding we 've got funding for the queue to mostly cycleway funding for warner bridge and each bridge there was some local local community growing infrastructure funding to work for clean plan funding um that was going towards smart meters i think and we 've also got um some north queensland recovering resilience funding for some water security and disaster response so there are a few buckets there that we i guarantee we 've been approved officially so that 's why we maybe we might get some more we don 't know but generally i 'm i 'm happy with the um especially since we 've you know we 're moving forward with the sports master plan the smart meters program the raw water but resealing has always been a contentious issue here because they say to me previously probably two or three councils ago they had a program in place that would have had every road in their shower sealed if it was continued on but for someone who stopped maybe winning and um that 's great so it 's good to see some of these projects coming forward thank you anyone else wish to speak against come on look i have an issue with uh my initial operational expenditure 50 million dollars it 's increased something like 11 million over the last six or so years i find it hard as to where this operating expenses have been used we 're talking 50 million dollars deficit of 3.6 million so i 'd like to i don 't know where it 's coming from i don 't know where it 's being spent 50 million dollars i mean theoretically one way to achieve the get through our deficit quickly by raising the rates that 's not an option increase operational expenditure um um no one likes that rate rise at all that 's just part of life and um but to be able to be able to deliver to our rate pays we do have a rise with the environment that we are in at the moment we haven 't it 's been very hard for this council to be able to make any sleep so um yes there are options that council samatara has brought up that we could probably look at i don 't know do we when does the budget have to be finalized now so and we have to actually communicate that to the public before we go out with our rates which go out in july budget up before the end of june because we have staff who need direction on what they can spend from the first of july so it 's um you know optimal yeah yeah that 's a shame because you know uh councillor zamatara has brought up some valid points unfortunately it should have been brought up in the workshop we could have discussed it a bit further it would have been a perfect opportunity so um so but i do agree with a couple of points that the other two um counselors have said but it 's a shame that we 've left it to the last minute we could have discussed it further in the workshop so at this stage um i support her budget for this year thank you um just fine comments down below to vote one of the main goals that i had myself personally was better services you know i don 't recall the last time i actually received a phone call saying when 's the grass and the park can be cut since this council has been in place that was a regular clearance services now critical infrastructure we 're at a point now where we have to do it if this work had been done in previous councils we wouldn 't be at the point where we are now where it desperately needs to get done and we 're having to do it it 's that simple and these things cost money as far as our deficit goes we 've gone from 3.6 to 2.3 in one year because 1.3 million dollars has been knocked off that deficit in one year i think that 's a pretty amazing feat i think you know considering what we 're only raising it by a small amount and the work that we are still doing for this community you know to knock it down by that is just amazing and the last thing i 'll say is that we are not alone okay i was having dinner with the executive director of qtc for local governments on sunday night and we are not alone every council is in the same position every council is having problems with their ratios so you know the fact that we council i think that is absolutely amazing the staff need to be absolutely congratulated on it so with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favour council mckeown council scombs and councillor kerr all those against councillor [Music] i do believe that 's the last agenda item for today so we will close the meeting at 1023 thank you very much _"

    "text": "um so all right that 's 10 o 'clock good morning and welcome to this special meeting the douglas shire council being held on tuesday the 8th of june 2021 at the mossman council chambers i hereby give notice that in accordance with section 2778 the local government regulations 2012 that the special meeting of council will be restricted in numbers of public attendance because of health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involved in 2019 this special meeting of council will be available to view via live stream on council 's website and will be available for others to watch at a later time i 'd like to acknowledge the google angie people who are the traditional custodians in the land of which we meet today i 'd also like to pay respect to their elders both past present and emerging and extend that respect to other indigenous australians who may be listening or watching our meeting this morning i know that all councillors are present of course our ceo is here governance officer and of course we 've got the staff that are required for no confidence of interests well i believe that council cemetery may potentially have a declarable conflict of interest and that in the public interests that of course you have a sibling that runs a similar operation that could be affected financially and the public could be confused by this type of operation i believe there 's appropriately discussed by councillors whether you should vote on this matter today our governance officer um well from the documents um in the quick guide i believe it 's just a declarable interest i don 't believe it 's prescribed the council server doesn 't get any financial gain from it at all it 's a siblings operation so it 's just something that the public could be needed to be aware of within the decisions that are made today um [Music] when we spoke about this and it specifically states that this is for mossman there 's no indication my sister and her husband counsel my own caravans so there 's nothing but no and nothing to indicate that will have any effect on any of fort douglas and that 's what he meetings that uh anything that has to do with tropical bridge kevin parker had declared conflict of interest and left the room this has got no no bearing on port douglas at all and my one of my interests at the local home council owned and run caravan park would suffer greatly from this decision and also rate payers having to spend well my own maximum amount of substantial amount of money for virtually no return is what bothers me about it this is a this is a budgetary matter that i think i need to be involved in like i said it has no effect on port douglas whatsoever in my view thank you okay yeah i just want to throw into the discussion conversation but this is a strategy i 'm not talking about you know going ahead with him in particular for that reason i think he uh counselors yeah i agree i don 't see why cancer should leave the room it 's only just um one of our strategies to put on our operational plan and um so i want to see it issued oh because one of the the main points that i 'm going to bring up in relation to the rv is that we 've been told by the rv association it does not affect caravan parks so i 'm happy for councillor totally agree you we 'll just put it to the votes so all councillors that believe the council is uncharted today to be able to discuss and vote on the matter and um the possibility of supposed to agree for interstate here and that 's all right let 's go to the agenda items listed in the open session 3.1 the daintree ferry revenue general policy how the council adopts the dainty ferry revenue general policy like that remover please councillor um the only thing i 'd like to say is that it 's just a general update of our revenue uh bankruptcy revenue and i 'm happy to see that we are able to keep the four million dollars in there so that 's why i wish to speak against the policy any further comments and councils on that with that then we can put it to the know 3.2 the dainty ferry fees and charges 21 22 the recommendation is the council adopts the dangerous scheduler fees and charges for the 21 22 financial year and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to negotiate fees and charges where circumstances weren 't and to make minor administrative amendments to the schedule if i could remove the police council seconded by councilman the council of scotland again we 'd like to speak to that um i just think this is a fair increase um it 's still with the um the locals it 's a two yearly pass for local so it 's not a great big burden um compared to other ferry operations within queensland and australia it 's still quite reasonable what we 're charging to go across the danger river i think i wish to speak against the motion any further comments from councillors okay that will put it to the vote for those in favor [Music] all right thank you 3.3 the operational plan for 2021-22 the recommendation is that the sequential section one seven called 22 2022 as presented and the council require quarterly updates from chief executive officer regarding the implementation of the operational plan for the 21 22 financial year removal for that one i 'm happy to move it second advice council wisconsin got in there i 'm extremely proud to present this second operational plan for this term and i believe that it contains a lot of positive initiatives that our community will be proud of i 'm in particular continuing work at building the relationships between council and our first nations people and our continuing work to make our show more all ability accessible um continuing to build on a presentation of our shire with the oil pump strategy to assist in ensuring that this multi-million dollar asset is preserved uh further improvements of course with moss and pool parts and open spaces of course they 'll continue to get improvements um and many will be pleased to see there is a gravel growth seal program and a drainage strategy to continue to improve drainage solutions footpaths street lighting cctv sports and recreation and strategy also gained further benefits economic our future there 's so much more that what could be mentioned but i do urge people to download it and actually have a look at if it is passed today can i wish to speak against it any comments from councillors well i 'd just like to say that you know we had quite a good discussion about our operational plan and i think we 've um come out with a pretty positive um program for our shower yep agree none of the comments and we 'll put it to develop all those in favor and that 's karen all right we have two other items such things that are part of the we want to have part of the operational plan and we need to vote on them because there 's been some differences in discussions the first one we have is the 3.4 operational plan 2021-22 initiative for doctors aquatic precinct the recommendation is the council add support that was aquatic precinct initiative to the operational plan 2021-22 has detailed in this report and i 'm happy to move this one for a second for it councilman this motion which i think is you know to me as lupus that 's sitting outside this council 's main document and we 're having to debate that it 's a necessity not only is it a necessity it 's an imperative part of this council 's projects moving forward i think it 's also a slap in the face for the many residents that have contributed to the multiple consultations that occurred over many years clearly demonstrating to not only this council but also cairns regional council and we 're under their aim that a safe water alternative is not just required is without any doubt awarded for the tourist village in port douglas from the inclusion of a water lagoon in the port douglas waterfront plan in 2009 to the most recent pool splash park consultation has been clearly determined that an alternative safe water hearing was needed in fact in 2011 the port douglas master plan advisory committee who worked with council recommended that the swimming lagoon should be complemented in the short term or completed in the short term as or as soon as possible not 's master plan november 2009. and yet here we are in 2021 to do with nothing which is quite frankly up in the disgrace from one argument to another not that location this location not that designed to this design it 's no wonder the rate payers of this china 's faith and decision makers who are supposed to be leading their shire in 2011 the total number of responses received by council that was specific to wanting a lagoon is 466 a total of 71 percent of responses were supportive overall we 're going to be constructed in port douglas in 2019 of the total number of responses received by council that were specific to wanting on the balloon 234 total of 81 for responses of the responses were supportive overall for a lagoon to be constructed in port douglas in 2020 the total number of responses received by council that were specific to wanting a call of 628 responses 68 percent of the responses were supported with the pool and 86 were supported with a splash park to be constructed in port douglas there is absolutely no denying port douglas and these delaying tactics using location and types it needs to come to me it 's it 's it 's why we were elected to make some of the hard calls but we have the best information available to us the staff has spent countless hours going through the various locations types facilities costs involved with the councils it 's time that we now get this project to a shovel ready place start looking for funding and start getting construction only 18 months ago this council moved to go forward with a 50 million dollar lagoon pipeline and whilst it may have looked amazing and i even i believe it was it was a lagoon that this shark would never afford long term for that matter with the rate base that we have we cannot afford any type of free lagoon a user pay aquatic facility where some type of cost recovery is in place is the smart direct and sensible approach for this shire and its size it 's time that this council stops wasting time and proceeds on the necessary required and wanted piece of infrastructure than coming up with excuses to stop port douglas from becoming its tourism potential so i fully support the initiative being added to the operational plan and i 'd request that councillors respect the public consultations that have occurred and do the same but then i 'd like to speak against council zamtari thank you mr mayor i look i 'm i 'm a bit torn at this i 'm fully in favor of a splash park i would love [Music] where it should go i think it should where we were talking about originally putting the splash by the um lagoon i think it 's a perfect place to do it as that that doesn 't really get to use that area and i think that would be the perfect place to be perfect to use that area behind the armed surf club as far as pools go and i mean you said that yourself lagoon was going to be something you could never afford but swimming pearls are something that cost councils money and it 's common knowledge they cost a lot of money to council two of money that we would be great players would be losing i think we 're getting with splash park we can bring people here and people come you know the surrounding area people would support the surrounding businesses but people i don 't think i i don 't i don 't think we don 't need a bill we have one in washington that 's already costing rate payers i won 't mention any amounts for quite a lot of money as far as the consultation goes i just wonder if it would have been different if the public would have known how much it was going to cost to have a pool of council runway whether we go back to them with that and say well this is how much it 's going to cost council to have two pills in the card right place and to have two i think that would change the outcome of the consultation thank you anyone else we wish to speak in the positive for the motion yeah i do i just think it 's like you say it 's been discussed for a we start to do some of these projects and and stop talking about i 'm i 'm all for it speaking the thank you so i 've already spoken about this idea in this form uh i believe now i know it is untenable unnecessary regardless countless products and beautiful resort pools that are open to locals give our consumer opportunities and places to cool down the pool which at this very moment has undergone upgrades and costly upgrades actually and more beautification and has plans for a lot more money to be spent on it is progressing well and for a shy decide one pool is only valuable operational balancing act they 're actually physical possible um muslims feel more centralized rather than important and we just simply cannot afford to grow just last week again i heard about another council shutting down one of those rules because they just can 't afford it so my proposal just to continue to look up what we have and prove a compact to the max um and yeah just be sensible about the whole thing let 's not get emotional about threw a million dollars at us for a splash car wonderful let 's get on with that that 's been requested by the public and we have the finest splash pass a relatively little life compared to apartment uh the muslim pool and the quite free single centre combined with a lovely satisfaction park in port numbers along with full mortgage and all that desires to get back this one i 've spent quite a few hours talking to people about this looking at other council around queensland and and i 'm a little bit you know it 's one of these things that dewey or don 't we but it keeps coming back to costs you know the mossman i believe the most mature we don 't use it potential i think there 's so much more we can do with the mossman pearl i think the biggest killer that i can see with this is the maintenance we do it costs a lot of money to maintain the mossman pool and one of the biggest killers for all pills um was that the law was brought in that the pills and that is really expensive so you know we 've got lost and pill which we don 't use to the full potential and it costs a lot of money to maintain that do we want to duplicate that in port douglas if we can come up with a solution that will you know that 's not going to cost us money fantastic but i am for a splash park and i just believe that that is something unique to this show that we don 't have and it 's um not only benefit the tourists that come to this show but also the locals it 'd be a great thing for the locals here is it splash park looking at the one that 's similar to cairns muddies it 's a splash park with all the equipment play equipment and things like that and that 's something that we haven 't got in this shower and i think that we could benefit from having something in here um i still with port douglas i still don 't believe port douglas identified exactly knows where port douglas is what type of tourists are we trying to attract into port douglas you talk to some it 's a high ending end users high-end users do not use public pools and most women do not have children that they travel with so resorts have pools there 's some resorts in port douglas that allow public to utilize their pools i just it 's a cost factor that keeps uh questioning do we need two pearls splash park fine um play equipment with the splash pads like muddies and cans i think it 's something unique for this show and i think it 'll be really good for this show but it 's just that second pool i don 't know can we is it a wishlist thing what i don 't know have we got champagne tate 's gonna be a budget i don 't know i don 't believe that we this show i can have two pills it 's a great idea i know it 's a great idea but it 's the ongoing costs that 's what keeps you know and i don 't believe this great to accommodate for tourists i know tourists bring a lot money a lot of money in this um shire but will they use a public pool we 're talking about the cost of the money you know our biggest industry is tourism our tourism bodies and our tourists have been calling out now for that many years they need a safe swimming alternative because you 're talking about a population of fifteen thousand when portland 's full could get to three thousand mossman very different markets you 've got you know of two very different communities port douglas will not come to mossman pool they want something in port douglas most of the tourists won 't travel to the pool here unless we go strong on this public transport idea from here even then i doubt it they want a safe place where they can take their kids burn energy and know that they 're secure you know the big boom of accommodation that we had was all self-catered in port douglas which brought lots of families still is bringing lots of families and one of the biggest complaints is you know they 're not going to let their kids go running down to the beach whilst they go out for lunch a local call where it 's fenced off different scenario you know i do believe that it 's absolutely warranted you know it 's been shown in all the consultation in the 20 years i 've been living in port douglas they have been saying they want their pool i believe cost wise it will pay for itself i do believe that you know we 're not talking a major facility we 're talking you know an entertainment with pool is going to be the community 's pool for the local communities this will be the tourist place you know the concept they 've thought of was having the splash park the pool the adventure playground all in one area so it draws the tourists to that location you know i think one of the initial designs had a super slide in it as well yeah so it draws them into to use it i absolutely believe that we would be doing complete injustice to port douglas if know the the years of work that 's gone even the fort douglas master plan back then stated we need to have a safe swimming watch out here and i think it 's worth at least getting the shovel ready designs done you know and get it to a point that we can start looking for funding and you know this whole thing is going to be looking at doing a detailed report which will come back with costs as well you know we 're looking at different avenues for revenue streams within tourism at the moment as well which could come into play having this done doesn 't mean we have to build it this year but at least we 've got the shovel river designs done so that if money comes up state government wants to fund us the federal government wants to fund it we can at least move forward with something and have a whole design ready to go rather than just throw a slash park in and two years later say oh actually we should have put the pool in where we 're going to design concept we know where everything 's going to go it goes full on with the splash park and we can get to the pool when it 's needed and when we can financially afford it but i think it 's it 's absolutely worthwhile so i 'm going to put it to the vote you know something like that well understanding orders you had your opportunity to put your argument across what i would like to say is that um i 'm wondering whether these should have both and flash parts should have been separated because i don 't want to vote against the splash park because i think that 's an essential something we need a central item that we need in port douglas but for me though i 'm not i 'm not going to vote for appeal because the reasons i 've stayed so in this i 'm going to have to vote but i don 't want to splash pastor i don 't want to do that plan yeah if you wanted to move this an alternative motion you could move an alternative motion prepared i think it should be a general pull plan ready for everything go ahead with the splash park you know we get to have to say when we do things this is the design concept you know can be two years down the track it may be splash park can be the priority as it says in the report because um one thing i 'd like to say is that if we do pass this today and we have um staff work on the reports and everything like costings and all that um i 'm happy to have to support this today on one reason only is that that when we get all the costings and the design and all that i want it all into public consultation so the ratepayers of this shire not tourists the ratepayers of this shower will say yes or no because i know this is only going into design but at the end of the day i think when people find out how much it 's going to cost i don 't think we 'll have that much support it actually does state in towards funding an aquatic precinct that includes a splash park ensure community engagement the splash park is transformed right so so there will be community engagement okay all right put it to the vote then all those in favor counts on a cure council of scotland council occur all those against and finally cancels all right 3.5 operational plan 2021-22 initiative continue to investigate opportunities in rv strategy the recommendation is the council adds the initiative to continue invest to investigate opportunities in the rv strategy to the operational plan 2122 as detailed in this report for that council mcewen seconded by councillors huntington [Music] councilman would like to speak to this yeah i 'd like it in the plan i 'd just like a lot more information about it i 've been doing a lot of research yourself with different rv parks throughout queensland and the rv council and i 've had discussions with locals just briefly whether they thought it would be a positive thing so um i believe it would be so i 'm happy for it to be in the plane thank you anyone against cancer once again uh this is not the type of thing the council should be spending money on money to get into if my private sector wants to go down his line for all means i can but i don 't support council um overwhelming evidence to support the economic benefits that navi heart brings to the community as council the people of our community rely on us to make decisions in the best interest of their livelihoods we have an opportunity here to bring a whole new economy to mossman that will increase not in its economy but more importantly will ensure future employment growth in 2016 june a discussion paper was presented to this council which stated back then that the popularity of rvs continues to grow in december 2015 it was reported by the caravan industry association of australia that caravan camper vans remain the fastest growing vehicle type in australia by registration for the sixth year running this not only has continued to grow covet 19 created a absolute boom in the rv market like has never been seen before currently there are six month waits for well we 're currently the gap in the middle between cairns the caters for harveys mareeba the covers covers for harvey 's cook towns are caters for rvs and i believe it 's time that douglas does now too i 'll stress that we 're not talking about caravan parks these are rv parks they 're very different in a lot of ways the campervan of motorhome club of australia has twice now been into council and presented and given verified data that on a minimum an rv will spend upwards of 260 per night this has been verified now by other councils who have already gone through this process these people will spend thousands and thousands of dollars on their vehicles um want to come here if they have the opportunity and if there is an availability of an rv suitable car and they would come here it is time that we did the groundwork required to start preparing for a market that will bring employment and multiple benefits to mossman and we are not saying that cancer has to spend thousands of dollars it 's offering a block them to use and that 's a big difference it 's not an expense if we were to find a block of land it is an asset purchase which we can sell another block somewhere else so it 's just a bit from one asset to another we will continue to own the block of land it will be our asset and they 'll use it to make money and generate a revenue stream for the ship anyone else to speak against us thank you look what you 've just said about the land council block land is not what the information that we received earlier we were talking with the information mercy we 're going to purchase a block of land specifically for this purpose and it 's a substantial amount and that 's only for the um purchase of the land that doesn 't include what it would cost then to put the infrastructure in the support this that 's a completely different scenario what you 're telling us completely different to what information were given earlier about this i don 't support any great pay should be don 't support it i don 't think it gives a return to the shops but a limited return for this amount of money being spent i think is shouldn 't be a burden on the right place if i may just ask councillors and a charity purchase a block of land is it an expense for you or is that an asset sorry councilman curran a little bit more information if this would be great um i do think we do need uh being part of this shire um to what extent i don 't know i think it 's something that we should trial for a period of time because you know if we get two vehicles a week that 's just not going to be beneficial to anyone if we get 20 a week then we can start looking at something that we can accommodate more vehicles i think it 's something that we need to trial and ensure because we don 't know we would hope we 'd get the rvs utilize uh counter land to see how it goes and let 's take baby steps week hey let 's go let 's get what we need to do it but i i would like to see this trial for a 12-month period and so if it 's to put on the operational plan to do that so be it but um i just think we need to take a baby step this is an unknown for this shower um my concerns are if we do get a hundred people hundred beans in mossman in a week can my mossman cope for that are we set up to be able to cope with that amount of people you know like our restaurants of bowls club you know 100 people 's cover night are we able to cope with this so i 'd like to i think we have benefits with this here i don 't want to see jeopardizing any other current businesses already operating show caravan parks but i know some of the caravan parks can 't take the big rvs because of um the carry-ons they have with their cars and boats and all the rest of it so i think it 's something property that we have to be able to see how this goes thank you very much _"

    "text": "[Music] michael kerr grant funding forty nine thousand two hundred and twenty seven dollars regional arts development uh fund uh paid it part of the state government also part of what uh council gives as well um your thoughts on what that achieves well it certainly does some great things for arts around the shire people can look around and see other projects that have been done and the type of work that it 's very professionally done and the applicants that applied those 12 groups or individuals within it and they 've got some fantastic projects which will come out shortly and people will see you know them at work and doing things in our community which you know that 's what the writer is always about so you know and as you said it 's funded by both state and local so it 's a mixture to get the total amount of fifty thousand dollars there and yeah it 's been distributed to the people that we could distribute it to which is great zigzag road and cape tribulation bloomfield road pavement culvert upgrade uh urgently needed well it 's quite dangerous and slippy up there and these works will again make it more accessible so people can get through there even after heavy rain events mowbray road 349 you deferred that what 's that about well it 's a subdivision there they want to break it into two lots and there 's some questions that were asked and we just thought that it 's better to do this one at a workshop and we can get the facts before we make a decision that could be the wrong decision so we 've got to make the right decisions and we need more information change of use for a limited function facility 5146 captain cook highway some other councillors were concerned that if there 's any breaches council does act absolutely i think it 's important that you know we make these decisions and we make them right and with this particular property you know there could be noise complaints there are neighbors close by but you know we are desperate for wedding facilities and that 's something that this one is offering a boutique style wedding facility have been put in place you know there 's lots of conditions that were made by the staff the residents should be fined that are situated around them you know if they breach those conditions then we will be coming down hard on them so the residents around them need to be assured that we will be monitoring it permanent closure road adjoining lot one stewart street danger that 's the big barrier it certainly isn 't like you know council mcewen said at the meeting there 's lots of properties up there that you know have moved over the years when there wasn 't such such strict regulations and this particular building has got its veranda that 's actually within road reserve you know so to fix that we just need to put this through to allow them to do work on their um veranda area and it does become their usage area but you know it 's very important the council you know is covered for liabilities if someone happens to trip or fall of course insurance they 'll look at it straight away well that 's council protected and that 's what that motion was all about now we go to um the permanent road closure lot to esplanade port douglas 's highly controversial development and we 've discussed it in in depth you and i and and others but now we discover that there are water infrastructure problems there please explain so what the staff have come forward and said of course the main tank is up on murphy 's murphy street hill up in the hill there 's like such hill and to get water down to that area because it 's becoming busier with all those hotels that are there infrastructure is going to have piping is going to have to be put through and of course that goes through road reserves so staff are concerned if we lose that reserve we 're going to lose the possibility of being able to put that future infrastructure in down that road area so they 're put through that they don 't wish for the sale of the land from the state government to this private developer they 'd prefer that it stays with the state is as i said in the meeting is the normal process you know the developer has a right to put a form c in and what council job is to say okay he 's putting a form c in we 've approved it to go to the state government so it opens it up for discussion and that gives us the opportunity to then put in objections the same as anyone else can put an objection in and that is the correct process to follow yeah and that is all i 've been asking for the whole time is you know when people come to douglas shire they want to do developments we need to follow a strict legal procedure that is in place and give everyone their fair chance and their fair go before jumping to conclusions and you know making decisions that may not be in the best interest and you know this is the proper procedure working forward you know and i know there was concerns that you know some of the people from protect our paradise didn 't think the staff were doing the right thing staff or the procedure and this just shows that the procedure does work and if they give counsel their due respect these guys are professional staff members you know let them do their job and you know the right outcomes do come through pardon the pun but is this development now dead in the water well as far as i know i did read something on newsport that he was looking at changing the development i haven 't heard anything yet i said we don 't get involved with planning you know until the planners bring it to us so what his planners and our planners have done i 'm not quite sure at this point but i did read on newsport of course that he had was in discussions and he was looking at changing his building so i 'm hoping he does he 's a great developer you know he comes up with some great ideas and let 's find something that 's suitable for this region and let him get some development happening in the shire douglas shire economic development strategy 2021-24 councillor zamotaro was concerned about that but aren 't we already a friendly shy for rvs well we do have an rv policy in place and this is just sticking it into stone basically and saying that we are rv friendly and we are going to look at different things that we can do to make us more rb friendly now if that 's going to be an rv park then of course they will come back to councils but this at least allows us to do rv friendly items like the the dump pits and things like that around the shire to ensure that we 've got facilities that rv users want and need that we don 't have the jobs and we don 't have the jobs that pay money for them and that 's the big issue hospitality is usually part-time or casual you know and that 's not paying a wage to send two kids to school and feed them roof them all the rest of it and we are quite expensive place to live it is douglas is an expensive place to be so by encouraging an older group that they 're self-funded or they 're they 're semi-retired all those sorts of things that allows them to come here but they still want services they want doctors they want to go out for meals they want to do all things and that creates more jobs for the younger people below and that 's you know we 've got to create those jobs first to get those young ones here and by doing this philosophy of getting older ones to come here creating those jobs by their needs that 's what 's that 's happened how we believe we 're going to get there you mentioned the nbn speeds need to be up to speed so to speak uh particularly for film companies because the internet has not always been our greatest strength absolutely in douglas it 's always been you know a headache especially when we had adsl but one great thing is the nbn has released in port douglas their business packages at city prices so if you have got one of the big hotels you can get nbn cable direct to your property and you can get get and that 's really important that 's something that 's come through all these types of works that you know we need to have good internet connectivity in this region for these businesses you know and as i used for example you know netflix was a great one i stood there and i watched them filming a scene they sent that scene directly through to their editing department via the internet you know and that 's hd quality it 's high quality stuff so it needs lots of bandwidth um the editors looked at it see what they could do with it yep that works okay that scene 's done if it didn 't work they said okay do it again and they re-filmed it and then sent it again to them so for these new digital era you know of filmmakers they need that high speed internet so if we 're going to continue to get them here we 've got to make sure we 've got those facilities and that 's where that group that um the council abigail brought the questions about you know it 's need and make sure councillors are online when they 're you know advocating to state and to other bodies that to make sure these are the things we need and we 're asking for the correct things grand fondo festival before we get talking about how much you 're giving to them uh just give us an outline of what the grand fondo is about well the grand fondo is going to be a bike race or it 's a fun day as well so you know whilst it 's a race it 's also open to non-competitors so if you 're good riders you 'll have the opportunity to ride captain cook highway which you know a lot of people would like to do safely you know it is only a half day closure it 's not a full day closure like the iron man is and you know it 's gonna be based here in port douglas so the start and the finish line will be here in port douglas and therefore you know we 're going to get the revenues from this one it 's going to activities as well there 's going to be races up and down wall street you know sprints and those sorts of things um and it 's going to be a really good revenue maker for port douglas and i think that 's really important you know that we absolutely want them here in port douglas to spend their money in portugal stay in port douglas do it in douglas so 50 000 first year second year third year 50 000 each year absolutely that 's a commitment the council has made of course they 're getting funding from other bodies as well but to absolutely ensure that they have a good chance of getting these other fundings from the different bodies you know we 're showing we 're committed to it and you know we really want this event to succeed the ceo 's report interesting that something came out of that that you guys are just like us hard to find creative absolutely you know it is getting harder and harder people are busy you know there 's lots of work going on and you know council like everyone do these jobs and if they 're not available or they 're too busy we have to wait the same as everyone else does and so that 's something that has come through and you know we 're hoping that as we go through these things will get done but you know as i said we have to wait like everyone else does and finally lisa skomazon the deputy mayor put forward a motion to investigate the handling of the daintree ferry contract as we know council were over a barrel you paid 4.5 million dollars of ratepay money basically and the deputy mayor wants an investigation you seconded that absolutely i think this is really important there 's been lots of slanderous incorrect and wrong innuendos out there about everything that 's gone on and i think it 's really important for not only the staff and the ceo you know but for the public to know exactly what 's happened and this needs to be a documented thing you know we should be you know never ever in this position again so if we 've got something for it happens when you do this this is how it happens when you do that this is the right way to do it you know we can only better what we 've been doing but i really want you know this factual information to be available to the public so they can see the whole process from start to finish so they 've got a clear correct picture of the whole transaction rather than just reading it on social media and it 's just wrong this will be truly independent truly independent so as we 've said in the meeting we will actually use our auditor to find a probity auditor so it 's completely at arm 's length from any of the staff here of course as a ceo said he has to sign the check at the end of the day so he has to partake in that part but the choosing of the probity order will be done by the chair of our auditing group and what will be the length of that like the investigation from when to when of the negotiations well for me personally we want it from just prior to the two ferry contract being signed right through well that 's a big one absolutely you know it 's really important because yeah there 's lots of um concern out there and you know you 've read it quite often why didn 't the ceo sign the contract there wasn 't a contract to sign it 's that simple and this sort of detail needs to come out you know so that it shows the people that you know the council staff did the right thing counselors have done the right thing and they can be comfortable with the decisions that we 've made me michael kerr thank you thank you you _"

    "text": "thank you uh so all right good afternoon everyone i can see from my faithful clock that sits here in front of me it 's 3 30 so we may as well get started welcome to this special meeting of the douglas shire council being held on thursday 20th of may 2021 at the mossman council chambers i hereby give notice that in accordance with section 2778 the local government regulations 2012 that the special meeting of council will be restricted in numbers of public attendance because of the health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involving trade of 19. this special meeting of council will be available to you via live stream on council 's website and will be available for others to watch at a later time i would like to acknowledge the google angie people who are the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet today and would also like to pay respect to their elders both past present and emerging and extend that respect to other indigenous australians who may be listening or watching our meeting this afternoon start with attendance course our ceo and our staff are here media team and we have some members of the gallery any conflicts of interest to be noted councillors that moves us on to the agenda items is listed 3.1 which is the 2021-051 daintree river ferry service contract and that is the council resolves to enter into contracts 2021051 daintree river ferry service contract with divers den investments prior to limited abn 11627-245-649 and then also the council delegates authority under section 257 local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to negotiate finalise and execute any and all matters associated with the contract is the remover to start this off please councillor scottism seconded by councilman councillors collinson would like to speak to the motion uh at this moment thank you so i 'll be speaking against this recommendation so the recommendation today is to pass over a local family company in favor of awarding a contract to a non-local company now this the non-recommended company will bring with them an unparalleled local knowledge of the ferry the river dredging and navigating this water system and their proven support system to our local contractors what is happening to do it in douglas what has happened to election promises as this decision is linked to tuesday 's meeting of two days ago i will reintegrate from three former locations so that means three formal council meetings i had offered a better solution to the recommendation that was passed now uh we have bought a ferry for millions and to and and we should be but sorry we have now bought a fair thought we should be in a different situation we should be in a situation of taking substantial revenue which equates to the easing of the burden of late payers we would be using a fairy predominantly running solar power and not buying a 15 year old diesel fairing above all above all that purchase on tuesday was done without so-called community consultation and transparency i mean how many ratepayers knew that was about to happen before tuesday so now we have been asked to go into a contract with non-locals and i will not in any way shape or form support that recommendation thank you guys anyone wishes to to support the um the recommendation of the officers um just purely on a business case of of the savings that we 're going to have the experience of the other operator i understand it 's not a local but i think this as we 've gone through the last 12 months this is extremely important um bit of infrastructure in the shire and i think the work that 's in the report and the discussions we 've had about it it 's um that 's where i 'm heading thank you can you wish to speak in the negative council zamatara thank you mancus for you look i 've just got a couple of things to say i 'm pretty much along the same lines as council and noli but i 'm i 'm sort of wondering why we 're sitting here even discussing not awarding this to a local company it doesn 't make much sense considering we 've had to do it douglas campaigns to order this company company who knows the river knows the operation of the ferry knows the ferry itself would be a painless quite a bit i mean i think we should be giving back on this company would have 100 local employment 100 local employment and i think we need to be going with the local company to support what we 've been all our election promises were about thank you i mean basically all i want to add is i think that i 'm speaking in the affirmative of this because this company in prada which is diverse then a tourism based company it 's a customer focused experienced in the region they 're experienced in transport you know they 've got significant asset backing you know and financially i think it 's a far better um option and you know short term and long term financially for the shire so that 's all i 'm going to say to a councillors commission would you like to close off in their remarks since you opened it yes i will um i will support the work that the officers have done on this ferry tender what i 'm looking at is value for money for our great payers we had to fork we really didn 't have any other options council knowledge nobody is saying we have better solutions what they were they weren 't tangled three formal meetings so beginning of the minutes yeah there are motions that 's fine well the only other option we had you know what the outcome of that was google advise so i 'm looking at value for money this is nothing against um the other tenderer i think they would have done just as good of a job a little bit value for money here for our rate payers we 've already had to pay a considerable amount of money for the ferry and that was our cheapest option at the time and i 'll dispute that and uh so i 'm quite happy to support this recommendation thank you so we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor of carrying the motion council mcewen councillor sconson councillor curb all those against council and all the councillors amatara the motions passed there 's the only agenda item that we have today so that concludes the meeting at 3 37 thank you _"

    "text": "thank you just wait for the gallery to be seated would just be going into discussions first before you look at moving a change to this relationship thank you everyone all right so 3.1 daintree river ferry options may 21. the recommendation the council one purchases the current daintree river ferry for the agreed amount as the confidential report provided to councillors two delegates authority under section 257 local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to determine and finalize all matters associated with the purchase of the ferry and associated key infrastructure components now i 'm happy to move that one to start with there 's a second one cancellous thomason so we have it onto the floor um procedurally is it best to choose to discussions first i 'm guessing before we make an option decision sure we 'll do that we 'll just have discussions first and then we can decide on an option but two um but i i 'm i 'd like to start by saying that i 'm disappointed about the proposal in front of us and it would much rather be preferable solution but i can 't all i can say is that i believe the staff have recommended the best option from a list of choices and as we are still in confidential negotiations with the contractor further details cannot be expanded at this point i believe that the staff have tried to give as much of an explanation as possible in this report and i 'd like to assure the community that when negotiations are completed in the interest of transparency further details will be forthcoming saddens me that what is the end result has come to and in many ways i must wonder how much the consistent negative political backlash from a loud minority group has played into this result this council its staff and us councillors consistently follow the laws that control what we can do and how we can do it we have consistently supported the community in attempting to protect its best interests in all the decisions that we 've been making that may be different to what a contractor may have wanted but that is where negotiations can take part and if there 's good compromise can be the norm and it can be obtained something that has unfortunately failed with the negotiations between council and this contractor i know that my decisions around this have always been about good governance getting the market value for our ratepayers and ensuring the best possible service outcomes for the users i will continue to support a ferry service as declared after the consultation and i will continue to direct this council in the best of its ability to progress for a two-ferry system unfortunately for now though it does appear that the relationship between council and the current contract there is no longer in a space that will be able to continue and i believe that is in the best interest of rate payers to support the staff 's decision and purchase the daintree ferry for the proposed amount it is the only option available to this council that will guarantee that a full service will continue without interruption from july july 1. and i believe in the long term uh it will put this council in a much better position to be able to negotiate very anyone like to speak against the motion yes councilwoman thank you so let us be very clear about what is happening here today this is not a great outcome for the shine it 's a uh last beep i toast to make sure there 's a way to cross the danger bearings the date will be july onwards and also be very clear from where and how this all started it started in april last year over a year ago from america a mayoral minute that contained no cost medical analysis no risk management no backup plans no thought process as to what could occur everything that a proper report would have contained in july of this year we should have before us a two free solution one of them solar costs are daintree the public should be very aware that this is not what is happening here today we would have had a ferry it would have been bringing in revenue two ferries that would be bringing in revenue in this cashed up tourist market at the moment so why is this happening i 'm going to summarize from new douglas in 2018 a community consultation was held with the goal soliciting ideas as to how the ferry service might be improved with the preferred option clearly being a dual ferry service faced in this consultation a tender for improved service was released in 2019 the tender had an open scope and asked the market how best to improve the wait time to experience the current arrangement due peak times council received tenders from four companies and at the ordinary council meeting in december 3 2019 cyril was announced as preferred tenderer now remember nanny turned the document package generally it 's quite it 's common that a contract is included and submitted with the final documents so the december 2019 meeting when council 's awarded a tender it was under the recommendation from the report from the staff so you 're going to suppose like you can imagine my surprise to hear of the mayoral minute of april 2020 when i walked back into council after being elected for my third term so why am i talking about the solar fairing because it 's all rolled together the cross the daintree using the existing ferry and adding a solar one the tender was won by the contractors who by owning the existing ferry probably for obvious reasons would be able to provide a great solution that 's important because it 's a confusing aspect for the public as i said this is just going to get us across the river on the first of july it doesn 't involve the new bigger solar fairing so we have we could have we could have had the opportunity to uh sign it anywhere from the end of december 2019 anywhere in december sorry anywhere in 2020 until the merrill minute uh we also had a solution uh presented to us in january of 2021 this year in a closed meeting with if the recommendation of council zamatara myself had been followed we wouldn 't be sitting here today we had another opportunity in may of this year once again in the close of uh meeting where 's councillor cemetery myself we had been listened to we wouldn 't be sitting here today so i 've demonstrated that over a year would result in my opinion a better option than what we are facing today so i 'm not at all happy with what has not the recommendation but what has led us to this recommendation thank you anyone else like to speak in the affirmative please for the motion in for the motion yeah sure thank you all right we 've found ourselves in a precarious position here it is essential that we guarantee the supply of access across the daintree river this contract is the second largest contract the douglas shire have this has not been an easy process and this is evident from the number of discussions workshop and special meetings we 've conducted over the last 12 months in relation to the negotiations i believe we have been very fair and reasonable with what we have offered but this is not the opinion of everyone involved we have to be financially sensible with the shire and rates money and sorry but i do not believe that that we were what we were offered was acceptable while we may be paying an inflated price it is essential to again in the future and take ownership of this important piece of infrastructure to ensure the continued service i 've been in contact with past some past counsellors who have been involved previously with ferry dealings and most of them have agreed that it should have been in council control many years ago there is a business case to show that having control of the ferry and not paying exorbitant fees and commissions make commercial sense however we must plan for the future events and take into account um events like the ultimate replayment and surveys and repairs and maintenance along the way it 's sort of like a short-term pain for a long-term gain and that 's where i sit and i support the purchase thank you councilman can i wish to speak against the motion council sanitary ah thank you for you may kurt we 're sitting here today because third of december 2019 council resolved the water two ferry contract with syrian enterprises this was after a public consultation that overwhelmed me was in support of the two-ferry solution it is obviously the waiting time for the never finalized i found that out after the 2020 election and if we jump ahead to the april 2020 there was a mayor amendment put forward that this contract would not advance until council went back to public consultation as to whether a bridge or a ferry was a preferred option and yet again the predictable outcome one of the two ferry solution was a preferred option not a bridge and this consultation process dragged on till you know in december 2020 i 've i 've never had before this had heard any complaints about syrian enterprises ability to run this ferry in a professional manner and that was the only and they prepared to do that in the same vein once a new contract was awarded but apparently uh i 've found out also something i found out that on april 30th the contract for the tooth fairy solution had expired something where i wasn 't aware of um if it wasn 't_''_656.399 for the mayoral minute we could quite possibly go across two ferries in the first of july this year but as it stands now there 's 's going to be a very operating on the 1st of july we don 't have a clue about that and there are options offered by siren in january that should have been accepted options that would not have had the financial impacts on rate payers that we 're being asked to choose today options that would have ensured a ferry would definitely be operating on the first of july i mean this should never be allowed to get to this stage it should have been settled in december 2019 you know the public are asking me constantly people in the public are asking me well how much has this cost us how much does this cost rate pays and not just how much is going to cost now to buy because of what 's happened how much is this since the mirror from here a minute to now how much does it cost rate payers you know how much is the consultation the legal fees staff time the ceo 's time they 're questions that need to be answered they 're going to be made public is what i on what it costs to be entered rate payers of the shop i think there 's only one option on the table today that can ensure that we have a ferry in the water on the 1st of july and i don 't see that we should have a financial burden on the ratepayers in the shire well yeah i 'm just i just don 't know how it got to this stage i know we should have been settled 18 months ago that 's yes thank you okay i cannot express enough how disappointed i am that we have been left with little option but to outlie such an exorbitant amount of rate-paced money and such an essential service should we choose to go down another path the potential flow and effect to the residents and the workers north of the river and the tourists that visit the danke would be qualified the ferry itself has been surveyed by two independent companies and we have been given the market value of the ferry unfortunately this is not what we were paying for the council attempted to enter into good a mutually acceptable position as councillors our role is to provide not only the central services which live in southern ferry is but to act in the best interest and the best value for money for the rate pays and residents the upside of all of this is now the ferry will be a council asset and i believe that it should be from this day forward remain a council asset so that we aren 't put into this position for a third time the council staff has worked tirelessly on to ensure that this decision will have a minimal impact on the rate payers and i cannot applaud them enough for their efforts i 'd also like to say as well is that we were presented with a lot of options not a lot we were presented with some options and my belief is after reading numerous pages and pages the contract and the options that were presented with that we would have been in a worse financial situation than what we 're going into now we can work through what we 're going through now because we 'll in this period of time has said that syrian is not a good operator or they don 't provide a good service but we have to be responsible for the value of money for the shire and for our rate and after numerous reading numerous documents i cannot see any other further but to go to it the option that 1b because in the long term effect if we go into another contract it 's going to be a work worth a lot more than what we 're going to have to pay for this asset and i just think it needs to stop this is a second time that this has gone through because the council does not own a vital part of infrastructure to ensure that the people and the tourists can get across north of the river so time has come i don 't care if it 's one third or two thirds but let 's just get one ferry so that we 're responsible for the operation of that to get people to and from because they deserve to have a former transport and if we government that 's their responsibility thank you thank you council scottish and so i 'll have a right of reply before we move any further prior to the last election i was very clear whilst campaigning that i was not happy with the previous crossing consultation i didn 't believe that it was transparent and using the statement that there 'll be no discussion of a bridge nor did it involve all of those who 'd be affected the larger part of the douglas shire community to me transparency is to put it all on the table and let the community fairly decide on their choice and in that more recent consultation they did and it clearly showed that it wasn 't one in 20 people wanting a bridge as stated it was one in three people and those members of our community absolutely deserve the opportunity to at least have their say in this debate and that hadn 't occurred i also said that i wasn 't happy about the details of the contract being locked in a closed session and that no one in this community was allowed ferry would bring even after negotiations were complete information i believe should have been prudent for the public to be aware of as after all it 's their community and their money that we 're using i then had a great doubt and the ability to provide a hybrid solid diesel ferry has tended as well as concerns about the ability in gaining the permits required to run a second ferry the community also has a right to answer about these concerns so let me be very clear when i say that the biggest community consultation was conducted in this shire last year and it was called a local government election where 55 of our community voted for me as their mayor and the agenda that i had provided it was absolutely my elected duty to walk into this office and use the tools available to me as the elected mayor to complete the promises that i had made during that election and whilst a minority group has criticized me for using a merrill minute it is a tool i can use it was legal and it most certainly was in proceeding with to finally brought this continuing ferry bridge fiasco to the forefront of this community and as an election commitment it would have been deceitful for me to not have completed the commitments that i 'd made during the election once and for all you can now actually say that everyone has had the opportunity to have a say and on this occasion the majority of our community chose a ferry system regardless of the costs and even with a bridge on the table that is honest transparent democracy but sadly over the past year that democracy has been dragged through the mud by various members of this community that clearly don 't care about fairness balanced decision making and more importantly the democracy sadly though i have no doubt in my mind that the contractors involved in these negotiations have also been directly influenced and possibly affected by this constant negativity slander and incorrect opinion pieces that have been consistently spread about sectors of this council and i believe that is absolutely reflected in this income you know we have been very clearly shown by the staff contract could not be completed before the election okay so to bring it up again is appalling right no one has ever criticized cyron for the work that they 've done in the past this has been about negotiations between both parties right you know as for the option you know two of that we 've been advised again by solicitors that we cannot proceed with a chief ferry contract because it has expired you know to do so would put this council in extreme danger so repeat from what i said before we only have one option and that is the option to purchase this ferry so to me what i believe is the right thing is that we move a motion which i will do the purchase of the current daintree river ferry for the agreed amount as for the confidential reports provided to the councillors and that we add option 1b to that if i could get a second uh for that amendment please councillor scomason so moved by council occur second by councillors cumbersome you wrong let 's break now the correct procedures does that need a vote for the amendment is that in which option you 've got a mover in a second earth so we 'll just put it right all those in there for those in favor councilman council scholars and council occur all those against council and early council zamotaro so now that becomes the effective motion that we 'll be on the recommendation is to purchase the current dangerous ferry for the green amount as per for the confidential report provided to council as option 1b i 'm happy to move that secondary all those in favor councilman fion councillous government council occur all those against council and only councillor zamatara promotion passes that concludes the only option that we have on today 's agenda all caught up thank you and that closes meeting today at 406. thank you very much for attending _"

    "text": "[Music] michael uh the meeting today april 27th a request for minor change to prawn farm development what was that about well as we want he 's growing his business and you know he 's preparing for future you know expansion and that 's what that was about turning that road into a proper driveway for him sealing it off and making it a more accessible place way to get into his business so that 's what that one was about okay the second one on the agenda was an interesting one and it got quite a bit of discussion and that was change of use for a function center to be using uh well playing music and what have you now they put forward that it would only be five decibels now this is down on tressai 's road at mowbray is that the port lakeside retreat there it is it 's the large big white buildings and you 've got to remember that five decibels is a five decibel increase from the distance not from the venue itself so by wherever they have their entertainment which you know 're allowed to have so by time that noise travels to the boundary where sensitive areas are it can 't_''_76.479 be more than five decibels louder than what is already there so that 's what the way that works so it 's a good outcome because we 're desperate for wedding venues we 've certainly been looking for them it is a beautiful spot you know people will see it of course in dive club they used it a lot for the mayor 's house um in the dive club movies which they 'll people get to see in adults glory in that um it 's a beautiful wedding venue and i think you know it 's certainly going to be a great asset to the shire adding it to our wedding venue list and talking of diet club you have seen some episodes of diet club tell us what that 's like i certainly have i saw i was lucky enough to go down to the gold coast and saw the first three episodes of their red carpet and i tell you it is amazing the shire shines it good you got to concentrate on looking in the background to see the extras which are all the locals and the different scenes because you 're so engrossed in the actual show itself because it 's a great storyline but areas like um even mossman with the skate park they 're filmed there at nighttime and it just looks stunning it looks like somewhere out of a los angeles scene with the way it 's been lit so really exciting um can 't_''_144.959 wait for it to come to air channel 10 in september i believe is the date they 've said it 's going to be fantastic for this region because it 's also going to be netflix 160 or 169 countries around the world will see it on netflix and it showcases this region absolutely beautifully we move on then to a variation of liquor licence for turtle rock cafe cake tribulation now you had a lone protester here in council today a silent protest for something that 's going to be mighty loud um we 'll we 'll hear from that lady in a moment in reaction that and what council decided today about that well as i said my concern which i said at the meeting was that we can guide liquor licensing to put conditions on it but there 's no guarantee you know and personally i know i certainly have lived in quiet areas like that and noise does travel quite dramatically in the bush areas and i don 't want the residents that are up there being put out if this happens to be abused you know there is no policing structure so that if there 's noise complaints completes can be there in 10 minutes and sorted out over the river you know so we have to look forward to what the people are saying up there and personally i didn 't feel it 's the right thing to have loud amplified music you know at night time up there and i think you know people will agree that we don 't want to set a precedent there 's four or five other liquor licensed areas up there as well if they all start doing the same thing um it could be have the final say you guys didn 't get the thumbs up absolutely it 's a liquor licensing decision they 're the ones that look at the facts they look at the acoustic report that was sent with the application and they 'll make a decision and you know they 'll be the ones that um get the you know told off by the locals if that 's the case and they approve it yeah but you guys didn 't support it no we don 't we think it 's you know having it the way it is is more suitable for the area up there and i don 't think you can 't get complaints from the locals doing it the way we 're doing it through port douglas queensland fire emergency services this has a bit of a story connected to it many people remember a few years ago now there 's a fallout with the members in the coast guard and they wanted to split from the coast guard and form their own group which is one of the other rescue groups and so that building being at the time and they 're still you know choosing froze about who owned what and who was signing for what so council put the lease for the building they were using into the cupas and so we 've just kept it there at the moment until all this is sorted and once it 's all signed off and they 're operating under their new brand name completely then of course we 'll renegotiate a list with them okay now infrastructure we 've you had a fair bit of housekeeping going on here but infrastructure revised list of projects how 's the infrastructure going it 's getting on we 've put a lot of work on this year people remember it was one of the biggest capital works budgets in douglas 's history and of course with the covert funding rounds that we 've had from the state and federal there 's been a lot more added to it so there 's a lot of work getting done and yeah the staff are really pressed to be able to get it all done and completed in the time frame especially time periods so they take priority over the ones that we 're just funding ourselves but they 're getting through the list which is great to see and you know people will certainly notice there 's lots of work going on capital works project more uh housekeeping there water and waste water revenue financial reports operational reports and what have you um and then you had a petition uh introduced by peter mckeown that 's correct yeah peter brought forward a petition and it 's always good when you know you get to hear from the people and what they 're saying and that 's been accepted so now the staff will look through the details of that and they 'll come back to us with some further information that 's about it for that look uh on behalf of everybody uh from fabi fm and also from the shire very sorry for your loss with your dad can you just tell us a little bit about your dad you know he is an amazing man he came out here when he was about uh 10 or 11 years old in a in an old f or air force hangar actually because the bombs were dropping so he was actually born inside a hangar um brothers sisters i think there 's five of them all together they all moved out here at 10 pound ponds and settled in cessnock originally before moving to melbourne where he of course met my mum in sunshine at one of the balls one of the dancers they they went to back then and you know within a week he asked her to marry him and because she said don 't be stupid as they do back then and um he slowly but surely won her over and of course my brother and sister the three kids and yeah we moved to them up here about three years ago so they could spend some time up here where it 's a bit warmer away from melbourne and you know he 's absolutely enjoyed his time up here he loved it but his health was deteriorating especially at the last 12 months and he ended up back in hospital again about two weeks two or three unfortunately passed away last week and i have to commend the staff at the mossman hospital you know i 've had small dealings with them before but going through something like this they are the most wonderful human beings i 've ever come across in my life and most been stuff the nurses at muslim hospital are amazing i just i cannot speak high enough about them they took us all in we 're a part of the family um you know they looked after mum whenever she was in there and they 're just wonderful people so yeah we 're very grateful for what they did for dad and he 's in a better place now and we 've got his service this afternoon and you know we 're looking forward with all the family being there to get together and discuss all the great times we had with him because he was a musician as well so played the keyboard you know united settlers clubs had his own bands and yeah we 're used to playing some people may remember the ballet ballroom down in melbourne um it one stage but um yes a very talented man as far as his music was concerned and you know we 've also got that musical from him my sister of course is singer and i 'm with the theater and yeah he 'll certainly not be forgotten how 's your mum handling it she 's doing really well you know she 's the matriarch of the family and she always holds it tough and you know she 's always concerned about what other people are doing rather than herself so but she 's holding it well together and we 're just all surrounding her and supporting her and you know making sure that she 's doing doing all right we 're thinking of you at this time and uh you know i hope everything goes well with the commemoration of his life this afternoon just one final question i 've had a lot of people asking me how is the ferry contract going what 's happening there can you just bring us up today absolutely and i understand people are concerned about this but it 's certainly something we 've it right for everyone and the council staff are absolutely still discussing with cyron you know we are getting very very close and we 'll certainly have some answers very soon but there is no fear at this point that we will not be here without a ferry we 're just making sure the negotiations are completed appropriately michael kerr thank you thank you _"

limited number of living still [Music] [Music] [Music] is there any indication the evening sessions will only be carried out on the weekends so i think that 's when they will be your opposition that 's during the great days no it wasn 't yet if we have complaints you know that our bodies can go like [Music] there is also the environment protection act noise regulation still applied so there was someone that 's affected that the noise sensitive place those provisions of the act will still apply that 's important because noise is a very difficult thing to understand sometimes so certainly economists are now at an elevated place and the fire decides it 's different to what was being measured at that most sensitive there 's really two provisions there to protect the humanity of the area that makes sense although there 's five decimals of the founding there 's also environment protection at school it puts in place provisions so that that noise sensitive basement could get dwelling you know i understand that i 'm just saying five decibels like whispered very quietly how they 're be seen but it is a very large property so the boundary is quite some distance from where the noise is generated and [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] um people are relaxing [Music] but just the maximum employees and figure 10 was that put up by the applicant or is that something like those the [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah thank you um so because we have an opportunity to um and also the environmental protection act ability do you think there would be any um advantage in putting in like a year-long getting the [Music] is this is the second time this came here the first time a lot more open for them and this police test controls on it they are trying to get certainly the trial and the fact that they are successful in achieving these goals because if they 're not um to do so so then you want yes it 's in an area where at least lists are available so there are noise complaints that connection can be taken so i 'm happy with all right we come to the recommendation has tribulation also described as block fluorine rp 733 one egg at once subject to the

't think there 's any conflict of interest here but that one um cat 's knowledge do we should speak to it no that 's very good i hope this gets resolved anyone against any comments from counselors um

in the 2021 year anyone wish to speak against any further questions or comments from councillors yeah just one question um i will call the user page or cost recovery i was just wondering uh without dumb fees how close are we to kind of cost recovery all that it 's pretty broad question i 'll be getting there i 'm recovering things because uh and that 's just my reasoning that the public tends to be in councils the cost it is it takes to properly manage waste essentially uh through there couldn 't we 're actually still working on them for the current year but it will form part of our budget documentation if you um actually specify that yeah um just how we process what goes into adapting things like they 're just so they 'll probably have a better understanding of what those people are also getting something in the education process is always as well yeah great all right with that revenue general policy now the council adopts the revenue policy 21-22 let 's have a move for that one

predictions any comments regarding the minutes so business being attended 20 minutes last minutes sorry chris has all our business been attended to from the last minute yeah there 's nothing else there 's nothing in to our agenda items 5.1 which is the first first one financial report for october 2020 that council notes the financial report for the period ended 31st of october 2020. i could have a mover please council thomason seconded by councillors amatara councillor scumerson would you like to speak to that at all i 'm just another good reporter thank you very much anyone against the motion any further comments at all um probably the only items to note were the ferry had now fallen behind as we 've predicted it would from the original cobra budget because look down and brought us staying close to bit longer the interest fell further behind they 'll both be addressed in the revised budget um there was some timing of invoicing for revenue and the um landslides are doing well so it 's a little bit of a positive story there a bit of time and differences for materials and services and there were some permanent savings which again have been factored into our provider budget and some permanent savings in employee benefits and a little bit of time in different support thank you thank you for that we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor all right 5.2 uh the revised budget 2021 the recommendation of course is the council resolves to adopt pursuant to section 169 170 of the local government regulations 2012. the revised budget for the financial year 2021 and the long-term financial forecast for the financial years 2021-2930 as contained in the document titled 2021 revised annual budget and set out in the pages contained there in which the list from 1 to 11. if i could have a mover please i 'm happy to move that one and a second at least councillor 's cumbersome congratulations um miss colleen on that report um it 's an amazing effort i mean we 've gone from adding quite a few things and we 've actually reduced slightly so slightly the operating result but i 'm still adding those extra things in so it 's an amazing effort by all the staff and i congratulate everyone on the efforts that they 've done anyone like to speak against the motion any other further comments from to clarification first one is just clarification on uh contracted costs for the data ferry is and what extra costs a day okay um so when we use a priority lane we incur an additional cost for the additional labor or involved for that so but also when we have um natural disasters we we will incur an additional cost above the normal and because of covert and has been very quiet that lane hasn 't been on is yeah and we also haven 't oh it has a couple of times but not the usual that we would have over the peak period and also we haven 't had any um any flooding of disasters so far where we 've had to so that 's that 's a saving that we 've identified today right okay compared to budget yeah okay um the other thing is as well um employing employee benefits new positions i think with the situation we are in at the moment um we have positions within council if i 'm not correct that are vacant no i believe they 're all being filled now they you like me to talk to those couple of positions and why they 're there because i can give a bit technician and things like that it 's just that i think with you know our budget at the moment and covert i think we need to be a little bit mindful of putting new positions on yeah we 've been very cautious um local laws i think have been absolutely swamped yeah and um which i know you guys have contact on the public about issues in that area and that is a junior indigenous identified position the other um the other position the admin for records rates and governance is about business continuity and look into the future the records position hasn 't got any better at all so it 's really quite dangerous because it 's a very important area to have that knowledge and additional governance and rates we 're looking at reviewing the rates model and that may actually however go with that might actually incur a little bit more administrative work too thank you so much thank you councillor nolan yeah thank you very by saying um i suppose we 've been fortunate this year and covert in the sense that we start at this point this current financial year the beneficiary i suppose of good work in the past so that that that 's really great um the first question i have relating to if you don 't mind speaking through miss colleen it 's about the couple of works grants and subs uh grants and subsidies um of course it 's kind of done in a few different sections i was just wondering how in total how much how yeah how much is the total of our grants and subsidies that we 've received so far sorry no no that 's okay that 's okay um [Music] so we 've got um i 've only i can 't i can 't talk to what we 've received to now but okay so what can you talk about okay yeah so if you have a look at um that the summary in table two yeah okay that 's got our capital grants and subsidies on capital revenue there 17.6 so that 's that be more than what we normally get on a normal year wouldn 't it uh this year because of october we get money given extra money federal governments i wouldn 't say so necessarily the years that we have disasters we tend to get a lot more yeah drfa funding so you know that could vary quite a lot yeah given the season where we 're coming up against but um i know we had um quite a lot from last year that sort of carried over into that um you can see on table one there 's the drfa asset restoration work that was done and um and that was more than fully funded and that 's just the timing of when the funding hits so it really does depend on what happens in that area um then on uh page 14 the materials and services for page 14 of the agenda there 's a very fifty nine thousand dollar okay uh fifty nine thousand dollars uh what does that refer to what expenses is so that that 's um that 's what we think what 's what we do with the ferry consultation okay thank you um then the next question i have is there are two expenses that relate to the golf club in this report one is 8155 are they because one 's in the capital budget one 's in the operational budget yes so the 8 000 is just general maintenance and small repairs that can be capitalized and the other work is the initial work to get the the golf club up to um complying thank you um and then the next question i have is uh just a bit of a question about our liquidity at the moment how is it trending uh so look there 's a cash flow a decrease of 5.6 million is predicted and next year is looking like it 's going to be quite a tough year so we 'll be looking um you know as it stands at the moment the way the liquidity looks um we do have to hold three months worth of operational income at all times per the queensland treasury and qao and um we 're closely watching our recovery with rates and that too much as things look at the moment there is um it is going to be tight for next year and if we want to do more than just renewals we need to really source what additional grant funding we 're working very hard to to go out for any funds that we can and i think we 're also looking at other ways it means other assets perhaps that we can um look at for the future what we want to do with and how we can raise additional funds for next year so we 're already sort of looking forward ahead for that because it is it 's probably an issue for most organizations i think for you thank you and i suppose the last question is uh relates to those the ratios and in particular the operating surplus ratio um now the modelling shows that we basically got eight years on the eighth year we 're going to return to that balance budget and just for the puppet this ratio shows whether a house or a council in general has the ability to cover operating costs years before we hit that balanced budget yeah what is the model revenue based on is it based on what we have in the past has ever as a revenue plus extra grants and things like that or we don 't count any additional grants but we can 't_''_1450.559 you know until something 's obviously in writing so yes it is very much modeled on on the past the revenue side of things and how do we get the extra revenue what 's that multiply because each year it 's increasing in the model yep yeah yeah um okay so we just have um you know in our long-term model we have a percentage increase for everything from materials and services for rates for everything okay thank you very much that 's the end of my question thank you thank you this shows why it 's so important that we continue to grow the show and rather than just putting rates up all the time by increasing the rate basically we 've got more people paying to share the burden um because it will be hard times ahead but we got fantastic grant writers here who 've been quite successful in the grants so it 's you know good in that respect with that i 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried thank you 5.3 capital works progress report for the first quarter 2021 the recommendation is the council receives and notes the progress of the capital works program 2 30 september 2020 for the 2021 financial year if i have a movement please for that one councillors thomason seconded by councilman kieran got in there that 's anyone against the motion any further comments from

council staff will develop kpis for the allocated funding that will focus on the shire and delegates authority under section 257 the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any and all matters associated with the above has a move on that one please council of scottism seconded i 'm happy to second that one would you like to speak today um yeah i 've got a couple of questions with this i was a bit surprised that this has come through after our discussions last time um i think it 's a great idea that we 're getting the opportunity for a new mac um newspaper in this show because it 's being sorely missed especially through the local from the elderly because that 's the only source really of local news is this a one one off funding because my question was why do we have kpis on one um through the chair um we decided to put a uh performance and resource agreement around this funding um due to the proceeding funding that we 're providing we need to get some kpis and the reach the distribution and also the the number of community groups it would we 've done with sort of an indication and recommendation around our performance and resource agreement so in other words is this money that we are going to put forward to help community groups to do advertising paper um through chair so part of the um island of commitment i suppose is that in return that they will support not-for-profit groups with free advertising and low-cost advertising so it 's a bit of an essentially i suppose for them to provide that service okay thank you anyone wish to speak against this look i 'm as councillor ollie i 'm surprised that it 's gone come this far i didn 't think it was when we had discussions there was discussions about um council supporting i didn 't realize that there was any discussion about councillor financing starting a small business a business uh i don 't think it 's on the onus it 's on the right page to um be you know financing someone to start a business and if you read the letter that we got in our agenda it 's you know to start up complete knows a paper already has computer and camera and software that software that 's needed to start to run a newspaper he also goes on to say that even with rio tinto who 's um i have to say aggressive total about 80 billion dollars a bit bigger budget than the douglas shire council they only committed to advertising didn 't put any money towards starting a paper i i don 't see how this is on this onus is on the rate payer to supply this business to um support this business i know i understand supporting is the wrong word i know we have to support the bids and i agree it 's a great idea to have a printed media in the in uh but you know this could also be seen flagged as a conflict of interest with council financing a media outlet i don 't sort of want to be part of that where we look like we 're financing a media outlet you know i 'm in favor and this has been flagged to me already since the agenda become public being flagged to you know council supporting this to get favorable stories put in i just it 's not up to the right pay to pay for it i don 't agree with them i agree with having a newspaper great but not counsel not rate pays money it 's not a great pay ten thousand dollars yeah um i just like i was surprised when i saw that as well because i thought the discussion that we had with the gentleman that day was to give support morally and to advertise i understood that there was not going to be a request for for funding to start the thing i fully support it 's going to be fantastic and and i 'm sure council will support it advertising out my business and other businesses will as as well but um i was not aware of having to put some money up to get it started i agree i don 't think it should be something that we just donate to a new business in town and also the conflict of interest people have brought that to my attention that you know maybe i 'm not in favor of not with the information that we 've been given so far true man i also like that i mean council even committing to advertising with the paper that 's a lot of money you know if you know advertising the newspapers you know anything between 500 and a thousand dollars to get a full page ad so that 's a huge contribution council already committing to advertising council or not thank you i 'm going to speak against this recommendation for a number of reasons and i suppose they 've already been summarized already uh firstly at council if we look at our for example our community grants program i believe this was to be applied through that correct channel most likely i 'm guessing it would not be recommended or supported as it would not appear to fit within the guidelines the applicant 's not from the shire and we have rejected projects in the past for not being shy residents the printing will not be done here despite the fact that shy does have small printing businesses the primary objective is that the guidelines and then the grant guidelines also says that for council 's grant funding an applicant is ineligible to call business as a political organization but then the recommendation the body of the gender report then goes on to say that council staff will develop kpis well i just find it a little bit contradictory that a camp that our council can dictate what can and cannot be published in independent videos secondly a business asks for ten thousand dollars and give it to him because why it 's the benefit of the show but at this moment i think we could have a hundred businesses using the same argument where does this all start and stop we just looked at the revised budget and the modelling shows that we 've got eight years of a hard slog in front of us there 's no guarantee that this is not just money being thrown away having rio tinto vacuum lethal is very different to here where any hard-earned advertising space will be scarce and i will also say in direct competition to existing media outlets such as the radar it and my last and third or third and last argument relates to pro probity and essentially what i would think should be a type of tender process should council decide to allocate any funds towards a media organization the tender process uh has been omitted and in my opinion i believe it 's been error so if council decides to support the media out there then i believe it must be done through a gender process i can 't go directly to one individual person dictate a kpi for a proposed media outlet and then hand over rate payers money there has to be an open and transparent contender process first so a type of procurement um i believe that councillors cannot support this recommendation having a printed media like my fellow councillors in the show is actually one thing i do support but not through this process through a public tender i have to be the one way of doing it not just because one individual council approached one media journalist so in the best interest of property i believe that we cannot get part of this recommendation couple of things there okay so this report for me i took as an out of brown grant application pretty much because that 's with this council has given businesses that make profit start-up funds before in the past and this to me and if you did go through the business plan that was sent to councillors which was confidential of course it did state what the breakdowns were of where the money was going to um as far as councillor zamatari mentioned something about the equipment now he has stated that he is going to continue operating the paper up there so the equipment would be required up there he needs to obviously purchase stuff for down here it 's going to be operated from him now the initial conversation as councilman brought it up is i contacted this person being the editor of the cape weekly and i asked him what would be needed to get a paper back in douglas shire because it 's desperately being asked for i had people contact me on regular basis saying that is just totally disheartening that they can 't even don 't like the paper i 've had businesses such as real estate agents contact and say it 's fantastic initiative that he 'd been in contact with them he was talking to them you know a great way of getting this community back on a national platform having a paper and a digital version to be able to sell properties etc in this area you know i believe that a local paper is an absolute necessity for this region i believe that this council would get its money back tenfold as far as goodwill i believe that you know the community will be grateful for us utilizing this money to assist in starting up a paper i agree that if you know this has happened because he approached us he came and said i 'm willing to put my money up as well to set this up you know there 's no guarantees council is not giving any guarantee of how much fun we can give in future what information has been given to him is being based on what the previous spend was with the previous paper that the risk factor there so i 'm very much in support of this council kickstarting a local paper because i know the community wanted and i know i certainly will be supporting it for those reasons i don 't believe that you know not having not having a paper i think it 's just it 's crazy for small regional communities and it 's with other communities are suffering as well from the same way so you know the opportunity is here for us to assist in getting our local paper back to our community and i highly support us so with that i 'll put it to a vote then all those in favor of this recommendation myself all those against council mckeown council councillor nolly councillor all right so we go to 5.9 which is the port douglas sports complex and coronation path master plan final plans the recommendation is the council adopted the final fort douglas sports complex and coronation park master plan notes the small change in location and approves the site for the proposed disability accessible mentees blocked coronation park funded by the district show as part of the show society 's grant application and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to administer all matters associated with the above if i could have a mover please councillors thomason seconded by council mcewen councillors thomason would like to speak today um well what i 'd like to say is that this is a very detailed report and there 's been a lot of work and money going into this and i think staff have to be commended on that the amount of time that they 've used on this i just hope that i eventually get to see it it 's a lot of work responding to this and staff need to be proud of what they 've done and anyone wish to speak against all right okay councillors come outside um just a question from miss kerr and we need to discuss earlier the public all the users of both their both the establishments are happy with the master plan they 've all gone through it with you and they 're all happy they 're as well and now they are happy and i think the muscle sharks issue could be probably alleviated a bit with a lot better lighting i think that 's one of the issues the lighting is not up to scratch as it is um [Music] um [Music] um facility here that 's just being retained and one of the other areas that there 's been a change to also was the um cassowary path about having that um about the lighting infrastructure getting upgraded out of cassowary is being the focus because if there was new infrastructure being built out of port douglas to accommodate the um uh the software club would be obviously very exclusive of managing it as well and it 's understood obviously that showtime there 's a lot of traffic over the fields and stuff that 's been in it as well so that they can use parking as well within the arena um also along the sidejack street as well but it was suggested as well by the consultants that um that maybe a a drop-off service parking school or something like that somebody 's until this master plan comes into action is that correct any other comments from councillors councilman thank you um thanks for this um skirt uh i just for the for the interest of the public i wouldn 't mind giving a little bit of brief history about all these um suppose one of the great things from dm album one of the great things from gear amalgamation is that we took uh grass of what we can control and it was very obvious from uh the beginning of 2014 that our spotting clubs and the facilities are a little bit of disarray so i suppose this is a combination so far of at least six years of work of one trying to fix up leases and make it that make the future accessible for this club trying to bring up the standard sporting facilities and trying to grow future sports and grow the present sports that we have and so by uh i suppose one of the past counsellors councillor carrier is is [Music] quite responsible for this in some ways it was his um ideas about growing two different happening and from that i suppose we came to visit it became obvious that we needed a really overarching master plan and so yeah this is a combination of a lot of hard work and i 'm glad miss curt and finally get it there um it will bring in i think uh the future of sport or sporting recreations i think it 's the recreation facilities as well i find that very important for me as a counselor it 's really really important that these fields are open not only to members of sport and clubs but you know something going on frisbees are used to use as an example in the afternoon if they want to on these fields and i think that 's really important um as a ex solo player i do believe that we can get for example as one example big teams here to do their postseason trainings i do believe that with improved facilities and we can really grow the future also of professional sports visiting the area so i 'm quite excited about all this and i 'm glad to support this believe it 's a fantastic effort from everyone and also on top of abby 's comments i think the sports tour could be a big thing in the future with all this as it progresses okay thank you very much and and yes certainly a big thank you to you for the work that 's gone into this because it is an incredible document it 's been banted around it 's fantastic to have a direction that we can go as we move forward now so we know what 's going to actually be put into those areas and we can start planning accordingly so with that uh we 'll put it to label those in favor and let 's carry it all right 5.10 the new lease of mossman horse riding club incorporated uh the recommendation is the council agrees to surrender the existing lease to mossman only incorporated offer a trustee lease to mossman horse riding club incorporated overlock 378

there 's a little amount of disruption as possible and they 're kept informed yeah yeah yeah through the check uh yeah the timing is unfortunate uh we had hoped to commence a project earlier um however due to uh budget constraints we didn 't know the true cost of the project until he went out to quote so now that we have those quotes back we identified that our budget was slightly short and we 've identified other funding mechanism so yeah we did want to complete the project or start the project earlier um and unfortunately they 've had to delay yeah and then we 'll just get it done yes

would 5.13 corporate credit card policy that council adopts the corporate credit card policy can we have a mover councilman mcewen and the seconder councillors and mataro anyone wish to speak for the motion i just have a couple questions yeah um just a couple of changes there from um the usual review from annually to periodically um what sort of is that going to be more or less or sorry excuse me and if so is there is there a reason for it to be yeah through that through the chair excuse me um yeah we changed that because it is done more regularly the um the team leader financial accounting actually reviews them every time they go through so it 's actually changed the wording slightly and in relation to the increases is is that just simply to be able to cover the increased costs that they 're using they 're occurring now compared to previously yeah basically um it 's just to update to the actual um actual balances that we because we 've done a credit card review and we also did the procurement policy review and lifted slightly to the 5 000 threshold so it was just to really bring them in line with what we actually want to happen and some of them have actually gone down because we actually had a lower limit for the coordinator and team leader uh so continue with the corporate credit card policy um have you got anyone to speak against the motion let 's i 'll take the motion to the vote all in favor yep carry it now 5.14 financial report february 2021 that council notes the financial report for the period ended 28th of february 2021. and we have a mover council mckeown and the secondary i 'll second it all right anyone wish to speak for the right uh miss kell here the variation there in the capital revenue capital grants and subsidies is a negative 11.8 plus million dollars can you just give us some information on that through the chair um so you 'll see that the actual budget for the whole year to date which is the second last column is actually that total 17.6 million so we 're actually reporting against the year-to-date budget um the capital works the majority of the capital works budget revenue and expenditure only comes into the budget at revised budget each year after the um audit has finished and we 've got the carry forward figures etc so this is actually recording the revenue that we 've received against the budget for the whole year we can only recognize the capital revenue as it 's earned so that is when the works are actually performed so you can see that the revenue is approximately 32 of the total for the year that 's budgeted you can also see the expenditures only at about 30 as at the end of february so that doesn 't take into account um 's an extra seven million that were actually committed um not all of the capital works are funded some of it has some of the fun some of the works are self-funded so that 's why you 'll see that you know total spend is 33.7 million and the revenue for the top for the year was budgeted at 17.6 million um so yeah the majority of the capital works uh hasn 't been performed hasn 't been completed yet so that 's why the revenue isn 't taken into account yet does that answer your question yep no that 's fine actually on top of that there 's there 's about 7.25 million that 's disaster recovery projects that hasn 't been completed yet and that may that 's for the zigzag and cape tribulation roads and i think that may excuse me both sides revenue and expenditure may carry into the next financial year so that 's that 's quite a large portion of that difference there any other question thank you okay anyone wish to speak against the motion let 's take the motion to the boat the council resolves to delegate under section 257 of the local government act 2006 the exercise of the powers contained within the delegations register council to the chief executive officer furthermore these powers must be exercised subject to the limitations contained in the delegations register act as listed can we have a move take the motion to the vote all in favor 5.16 counsellor 's administrative support policy that council adopts adopted the council history support policy as presented can we have a movement council and a secondary council on mckeown anyone wish to speak promotion i have a question ah thank you um so i 'm happy to support it not a problem the question relates to what 's both about in the comments section and also actually in the policy itself and it says that um administrative support staff cannot help with the council 's re-election or other campaigning tasks um my question essentially states that if council uh facebook reposts only one councillor 's posts can that be seen as assisting in reelection because we few of us have counsellor facebook pages and only one gets reposted if content is important then i believe that that should get rewritten and reposted as a media so this question is to be thought about and perhaps discussed further about what that actually means um the circumstances i need to have a lot more information on the specifics because there 's a range of activity that can occur there are differences for mayor versus councillors it 's the type of material that 's supposed to be well i would i would need to have some more specifics about that because we need to evaluate each case yeah well then perhaps if there 's a difference between a mayor and counselor there might have been wording changed in the policy itself thing because it 's under counsellor and a mayor is a councillor just so just they might have to be flagged for further um discussion or further look at looking into it i 'm happy to look into it more i just need more specific examples of yep what type of material you 're talking about yes and that can be done in a different situation so do we want looked at my uh question doesn 't relate to the policy the policy itself is fine yeah it 's just what that means specifically outside so the policy itself is fine okay okay anyone uh wish to speak against the motion i will take promotion to the vote all in favor okay item number six notice of motion counselor nolly gave her knows of her intention to remove the following motion at the ordinary council meeting on the 30th of march 2021 repel of decision for application for permanent road closure over esplanade adjacent to loft lot 2 rp 743864 douglas one that the recommendation of item 5.7 application for permanent road closure over esplanade adjacent to lot 2 rp 724386 for douglas resolve ordinary council meeting held on the 15th of december 2020 be repelled one delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2006 to the chief executive officer to execute a form part c as road manager advising the department of natural resources mines and energy that council cannot authorize proposed permanent road closure over the esplanade in fort douglas adjourning lot 2 on rp an application under land act 1994 in relation to this matter and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalise any and all that associated with the application second point is to inform dnrme that if part c assessment process has already been expedited the council delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to immediately advise the department of natural resources mines and energy that council is not supported on the road closure and 0.3 when dnrme formally seeks views from council and the public as outlined in the 15th december 2020 report council will provide objections to the proposed road closure council knowledge has put forward the notice of motion would you like to move that notion yes thank you and can i have a second up councillor zamatara okay anyone wants to speak for the motion yeah thank you thank you very much um steph yeah thanks i just like to explain how uh this has come about at the at that time of the meeting in december uh a counsellor for the information um that pertains to this request at the moment that request back in december last year that request seemed straightforward enough but now i as accounts i 've become aware that 's associated with the da that would for me require much more information this da and i will need to be more highly briefed by the council staff the planners as to what that da means so it appears that it could be a idea that needs much discussion amongst councils and public the other thing is that um i was unaware of that even though that part of the road would be closed it would still actually be used as a road and it could have it could possibly have a high detrimental effect to their company park and now that this information has come forward i have my concerns and that is why i 've watched this board as an open culture thank you okay anyone else want to speak to the motion now the background in the report was very clear the council has received an application of mock 2 and a proposed closure reserve situated adjacent to the property for development purposes and it 's very that is a completely different matter that will happen after the planners have gone through the date and the ga is fortunate now i have questions regarding you know the legal ramifications of reversing this announcement um the state has been invited yes you know i 'm quite sure the progress further because of that um yeah so just because i was a little unsure myself about actually reversing that 's why i have left this a bit open and we can obviously discuss that it 's quite easy to um simply take out the first part of that uh that uh notice and just leave the um points two and three we can take out point one if if um council staff think that that 's impossible to actually take four that 's not a problem so there 's no legal problems i don 't believe uh if we just leave in point two and three as for um during the meeting of december it definitely wasn 't clear to myself of a i don 't know about the other councillors how they feel about it so thank you i assumed it was to preserve the park and preserve the surrounding area the thought of developing this magnitude unamazingly against so i think we should have been given more information to start the magnitude of this development before we might ask the pastors we did believing that as a result of the uh meeting on the 15th of december council agreed through a resolution for the uh ceo to execute the form c to submit to to give to the applicant to submit to dnrmd to submit the application now within that form c that the ceo has executed council have at no time committed themselves to approving the development or the road closure with this uh with the application being submitted that only gave the applicant permission to submit the application to close the road however within the form c um there 's a box where it 's where the ceo has checked and states that council will comment this through the public consultation period and during this comment this public consultation recommendations for use to approve regarding the total or part road closure of that proposal so at the moment council is not improving the development of the site all we have done all the all the road closure all council has committed to to the applicant to submit the application thank you chair uh yes thank you look this is very clear i understand that but this um i think should be made very well aware for the public that the desire of this notice of motion is to uh is to uh to put on like well to to notify dnrme that we are actually against the road closure so we we we can possibly take out point one take that out on my of my notice of motion this is a suggestion to to talk about once counselors and essentially leave points to and thread that it says that we inform that if it 's being expedited that we give authority to the ceo to advise them one that we are not supporting the road closure and two when eventually does come back to us that we will emotion in the sense that i would like the as i said the desire of this nice emotion is to show the public today and down in the future that we are not supportive now that further information has become apparent to us that 's why it 's important to support this node 's emotion today and not just let it go down the track to when it finally comes back for councils for councils and comments so if it makes it easier i 'm very happy to um to take out i suppose uh point one of my notice of motion and just leave them points two and three if that makes um makes it easier for for everything yes again this is based on the assumption of what a development application will approve we are not talking about the property as far as development application goes what we are talking about today is along the side of the boundaries of which was a quarry and they have applied for a road closure which is not about the this is actually about more information coming to light to councillors that i 'm uh took from that um medium back in the 15th of december and as it might seem as this i 'm just repeating but i just highlighted some comments from that meeting week in the background council has received an application from the owner of lot 2 on rp adjacent to the esmenard in port douglas with respect to the proposal to permanently close the road the smart situated adjacent to the property for development purposes it doesn 't really reflect on what develop what development we 're looking at that 's a different matter and secondly in the comments uh once the application has been received has received council consent by way of an executed part c form the applicant would then be able to lodge a full application for consideration by dnrme after which they would then seek views from the public as well as council that part road closure is intended to be used by the applicant for development purposes and council officers comments will be provided in a future council report to be presented during dnr me 's advert advertisement period this is opinion about the proposed closure a public notice is required so basically that 's what i made my decision on then and this is not in relation to the new d8 that 's a different matter and so i 'm sticking with what we said in december can i just ask a couple questions what happens if the uh um the da application is not approved through the chair um and just to reinforce what rob said earlier is that the application the development application currently on foot can 't_''_3201.28 be considered properly made until the consent of the state government is provided so that application cannot formally progress until the state gives their consent for that road uh there 's plenty of opportunity and i appreciate what council knowley and the message she wants to get out from the council but from a planning position and planning advice i 'd be recommending council let this motion or let this process continue on the path that it 's doing because there will be plenty of opportunities formal opportunity to for council to respond to that notice to close the road closure application having considered what council 's resolution is and the community and so forth then if they continue on with that then they provide that consent to the developer and then the application is then considered properly made and then we start the assessment process um formally we 've already started the assessment process and just on that in terms of what that development represents we will be having further workshops with council most likely prior to the formal application being properly made to make sure council is fully aware of what is being put forward as per that workshop that we held a couple of weeks ago where we said there will be further workshops on this on this development so from a planning point of view and planning advice i 'd be saying i 'd be recommending that just let the process continue there will be opportunity to formally respond in line with that process probably not too far away two months two weeks oh two weeks thank you look um i 'm very happy to let the process continue and that 's what point two of informed again army that we will be speaking against it and it 's very important to get that message up there so i move uh an amendment and that is to delete point one so we we just have points two and three so the process continues the normal process will continue but we will be just alerting the nre that we when it does continue the normal process we will be speaking against it and i think that 's an important message to get out there so if um council zamatara allows that okay we need a seconder for that one council 's inventory um can i am able to comment on that or add something to that um because i still believe that this has been based on a completely different subject which is the the result of the ga this isn 't about procrastination is so you need to move you need to vote on whether the amended motion out becomes a substantive motion and then you can vote on the motion uh sorry question chad did you want to add something before we voted on that like to um i can understand where council knowley 's coming with this because at the time of the resolution um i would i assumed that that little block that was pink highlighted was going to probably stop any road continuing through that bush for future developments um as i 've asked a question about the da application if it 's not approved um the state government 's given up that bit of land for whatever montreal can 't get back but the other thing i think that i 'd like to add to this is um so it stops a lot of the confusion when we 're not given all the information is that i 'd like councillors um receive regular updates about da 's especially accessible code ones where the public the general public does not have the uh able to speak against the um to the development so i understand that with this road closure that uh when it comes back from state government is that the um people can put their case forward against the road um but i think that this probably will be a before this i think council should have been told exactly what was going on and i to be honest if i had known that information before we had voted on this i don 't think i would have voted the way i did only on the development so yeah i understand that yeah yeah and this particular road closure the applicant has submitted his application yeah and it 's in the due course of being assessed by dnr the understanding as well that if even if council doesn 't support the application being made in the first instance it doesn 't prevent that applicant having a natural justice to go and seek a road closure anyway where the council was supportive or not of that application being made so that 's fine i think that 's a really important point the council needs to understand and i think you 've got to let that natural justice prevail and follow through the process yeah and effectively keep that position until such time as you can formally then respond right i appreciate council knowledge what message she wants to say but i for a couple of weeks and wait for that to happen um and just one other point i 'd like to make in relation to code accessible applications you know we have received a number of submissions that you 'd be aware people can certainly still put those submissions to council they still have a voice and we can still consider the content of those submissions that are made the only difference is for code accessible applications is that they don 't have appeal rights than to appeal council 's decision and take it to a court so submissions that are received that hold valid planning grounds will be given every consideration like any other impact accessible application and will be addressed in the reports coming to council um it just means that they won 't have appeal rights so i just want to make that point very clear as well as that doesn 't trigger public notification we don 't put their hand up so you whatever you say we don 't listen to we still take that on board consider it and those grounds will be reported to from what you were saying i was just trying to work out um well i think it 's um i think if we 've given um a little bit more regular updates on what is happening with that the especially the major deal i don 't want to know every house that 's been built in the shop but on major da 's like this have submitted um i think it would have made it clear to everybody at the time exactly what this was about i know it 's just about a road closure but it is associated with this d.a no and and what happened was is that with this one the project team they uh who on behalf of governor they didn 't see this as an issue when they first lodged or were about preparing to lodge the application prior to christmas it was only because it kind of came up at the last minute that we said well hang on this isn 't typical road infrastructure you 're going to need the owner 's consent for this land so that kind of caught them by 't notice that we know that we would have been acting this months ago if we knew that was the case so hence why there was a little bit of urgency to and it is a long process to go through and get the ownership from the state government so hence why they wanted to action that before christmas and get it in as soon as possible so we didn 't have an issue with that and we were him of that because it is a long process but that by no means uh weakens council 's position if it holds that against the uh when it goes to assessor the a or the great part down the track it certainly doesn 't weaken your position or undermine your position through consenting to make that road closure application it 's it 's purely processed right at this stage so just from a governance perspective we need to determine what the motion is that we 're considering and you um put forward an alternative motion and you have a mover and a second order so you need to vote on whether if that fails then you go back to the substantive motion and vote on that well so well i 'm and that is the reasoning is that uh i appreciate the office officer 's comments for to allow the process to continue that new motion allows the process to continue it just emphasizes um what counsellors desire and even in the you know even in the words of the staff it caught them by surprise i think it 's caught a few councillors by surprise also very simple and the amended motion allows the process to continue with a flag next to it that 's what that does that 's all it does do we have a certificate oh yeah yeah okay um so we 're changing the nation you know how you can go on whether it 's this is the most okay so pega um on the new motion you 're voting to consider this to consider the market consider that so you need to get three um you need to get a majority so that this is the motion that you can then vote on and if now you need to vote for the motion okay so can we have a movement for the motion uh yeah castanoli the seconder zamotaro and uh we 'll vote on the motion uh all in favor councillors um nolly councillors and myself and against the motion is councilman and then michael so the motion is imperative sorry um no source code three to two okay um we 're now going to a closed session can we have a mover counselor secondary cancel mcqueen _"

resolves to declare there are no infrastructure charges for developing north of the daintree river and resolves to set first one march 2021 as the commencement date for the douglas shire council infrastructure charges executive officer in accordance with the local government act 2009 and the planning act 2016 to finalize any and all matters associated with the implementation of the douglas shire council infrastructure charges resolution number two 2021. if i can have a movement please councillor scomazon seconded by councilman mcewen councillor scomason would you like to speak to it at all i 've just got a couple of questions that 's all um in the tables you 've got two colored columns is the new pricing the yellow column yeah through the through the mayor it 's the um it 's not the cap charge i don 't have the column in front of me but it 's the um it 's not the maximum cap charge it 's the proposal no it 's the charge on the green column the green card yeah the one on the right is the maximum stage okay so for the most part i 'm actually okay with this i have concerns with point number two of the recommendation uh that is the result and clearly no infrastructure charges for development north of the danger further essentially my concern is what is this in the report sorry in the report it correctly states by the beginning that infrastructure charges have significant influence on the ability for council to maintain excuse me and plan for future needs and it 's important that the changes be balanced fair and equitable it 's this whole um idea of fair and equitable that has me concerned about this recommendation number two that is a whole underpinning argument of equity and fairness and for that reason i find it hard to accept this with that point in so basically you 're saying we 're it 's we 're recommending that we take a charge away and it goes berlin becomes that of the whole of the shire which i believe is not correct um what i would be very willing to do is that if there is an infrastructure charge for a development north of the river if you look at each in each and individual case such as what we did for the nursing home so if someone wants to come up and make a request i 'm happy no infrastructure charge for any development worth the river i don 't believe it 's actually fair for the rest of the shire as ray page should not be forced to burden this loss of income because it 's not so much costing council but it 's a loss of income so if that number two is uh deleted i 'd be happy to support this otherwise i cannot support it as it is that 's good i almost like to speak in favor of the motion as it is okay anyone else which uh to make some comments towards it just another comment um it 's i can understand what um counselor knowley 's saying because when we look through the two columns what the maximum and what we 're going to charge we aren 't charging the maximum to all the different categories except for one and that 's our high impact rule and it says that we see notes but there 's no notes that i could see um that um we 've only got notes on uh rule activities [Music] the nature one looks like the rural activities the two categories yeah it 's just saying that we won 't be charging for rural activities because they can take place basically as of right in rural areas yeah but the high impact rule we do yeah a high impact rule yeah we charge from the full maximum yeah um i don 't know if i could just respond to councillor um nollies and quarries it was basically on that fairness and equity purpose um principle that we 're not proposing to charge charges north of the daintree river because there are the limited services that council offers up there unlike other areas of the shire where we 've got particular water sewer regional and district parks sporting fields and those kind of things so with limited service and facilities up there it was considered basically equitable equitable and reasonable not to levy infrastructure charges when they don 't get those traditional services so all those items would be discounted from water sewer and open space would come off that charge anyway which only really leaves the traffic component of the charge to any applicable infrastructure charge that the whole area is state controlled road up to the ferry right through mossman through port douglas then how reasonable is it as well to retain that transport charge when it 's all state controlled roads that typically be using and also development opportunities out there is very limited there 's a desire to have some more self-containment up there and promote development in suitable locations which is quite limited up there so the opportunity to provide some of that self-containment up there would be promoted by the adoption of item two in terms of waiving the charges the charges at the end of the day would be very limited in terms of what the actual applicable charge would be because you 're only like i said you 're only leaving transport charge um but when you think about that further with the extent of state controlled roads how reasonable is it to then charge a transport charge um so for those reasons at offices level we 've come up with the idea of saying well let 's just not apply charges they 'll be minuscule anyway but for some self-containment up there in appropriate locations then let 's do away with it and give it some incentive thank you uh thank you mr beck and as you said uh the charging will probably be quite limited anyway but the nature of these there are still charges that will still be uh forfeited by council and therefore the burden the rest of the rate payers um the knight of the beast if you want to develop there you 'll have a certain amount of charge like you will have anywhere and for that reason i 'd like to move an amendment to the um motion and that is true delete point two thank you now is there a second that said that um okay so that recommendation to take uh i think two hours there 's no second though so the motion stands as is um council zomtaro you want to comment to it man i 'm just wondering if we can further investigate council and all these um and get some gold figures that we just take everyone catholic state we take every development on its individual merit example i can 't think of really any new development in the last several years that has gone up there that would attract charges but nonetheless it also provides unless it 's clear in your policy it 's quite hard or difficult to maintain consistency in terms of how those charges are calculated in saying that there are a number of charges uh just above the footnotes that we 've pointed out to uh council scumbers on a minute ago there is a whole number of range of uses that a flag that can be calculated down the track so whether we slot development north of the daintree river in that amended table you know we could we could do that um it 's not as clear as what we 'd like it to be but um that could happen does that have to be included in this report well we could probably cover it under um item four of the resolution which just says delegate everything to the um to the ceo to finalize the adoption of that so we could make an amendment to that through item four point two in we 'll take it out because otherwise that 's no it would need to be um taken out if we 're going to do that in the table yeah that will make it clearer to the yeah the applicants applicants here if we pass this as with point two and then that 's going to play out before you pass that point if someone else then wishes to move an amendment if that 's the case to remove two of the three you 're heading so councillor zamotaro and is there a second at this time to remove point two councillor nolan yeah and that will cover or it will be which will be what we achieve the world achievement you know taking each and every hand on its individual man um anyone should speak against that [Music] in it can can i just ask one more question then so in the body of the report uh 3.2 d would that have to be um i 'm just kind of looking for the page would that have to be taken out in the sorry looking for the just clean that up yeah yeah so that will pop out yeah okay so we now have a new resolution now we 'll need a mover for did you wish to speak to it at all i think we 've covered everything i want you to speak against it now with the comments for it okay we 'll put the new resolution to the boats all those in favor and that 's carrying right thank you mr ben 5.2 uh support of the port douglas grand fondo festival the recommendation is the council resolves to provide a letter of support to connect sport australia to accompany their funding application for the port douglas grand fondo festival to the regional and state tourism bodies delegates authority under section 257 of the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any minor amendments in relation to the latter support of the fort douglas grand convert estimate the removal for that one councilor nollie seconded by council of zamatara council of knowledge to speak to it um yes i absolutely support this event not a concern there i suppose um my support sufficient and should we be backing our words so that they can achieve better uh and a possibly better outcome in seeking um funding by funding them ourselves to a certain extent i mean we fund events left right and center in fact event extending the event calendar is actually an identified strategy for economic development um and has been identified for many years as an extension of the events calendar uh you know just a few months ago we funded a um an event for two years or fifteen thousand dollars and one year of ten uh at that same meeting a few months ago we had another one-off event that we funded for ten thousand dollars and i would like to bring up the conversation as if we should support this one with some kind of funding also um thank you i wish to speak against this um this one i just want to put my comments across to this one let me just start off with um so i find myself really torn with this request because you know one i find it a really good past history and the animosity this is created in closing this highway and once i obviously understand the proposed three plus million dollar economic benefits put forward that an event like this could bring to douglas i also unfortunately the fact is there are members of the community out there the spectrum of this event will also be very much negatively affected by agreeing to support this so i believe that this decision cannot be made like things certainly cannot be made just purely on financial gain the friday saturday event you know so import douglas fantastic i do have concerns though with the port douglas sports complex possibly a conflict there with the football it is going to be during finals time and you know will the local community prefer having a local home final or this event now the community needs to also discuss that part of it the main event on sunday however that 's the one that 's you know coming back with this issue and it sounds really exciting i 'm not against the event absolutely i understand that but it 's another closure of in total between 5 30 and 1 30 okay and this is the only major arterial through to our shine you know um the closure of the highways you know has a negative view for many people in douglas you know and i think from past history experience you know people have been very negative about this and it not only affects douglas it also affects future warfare know there 's been people from there have made comment um absolutely i give credit to the organizer who 's been out there talking to the businesses and this 41 businesses have signed a support letter um but realistically there 's 1300 businesses in douglas you know so the ratio there we have to also look at in really a realistic style the issues that are created for those that are not involved in this event um that do not gain a direct benefit from the event also have an absolute disadvantage and they have to be considered we can 't just write them off you know i know that the there has been in the past a big issue as far the in the document that says that you know there 's support from um the transport companies but you 're looking at 27 out of the 36 flights that morning from kansas airport will be affected by this you know so up was it 15 of those flights um between that are out of cairns between nine and three will all need to take the long route around so that 's a lot of our visitors that have been put out so they 're things that i think we 've also need to consider um over the years there 's been a lot of disdain as i said about the community about the closure of the highway from the other event and i do realize this one is far more beneficial to douglas you know it absolutely is in the surrounds but i think the community needs to be taken on a journey with this event and they have not been us here and i think the community absolutely needs to be able to give us to have the opportunity to give us counsellors feedback and regarding this event and the benefits and they know the benefits of it they will come around but i think without doing that first there 'll be a lot of animosity of just a the highlight will be the closure of the highway before they see the benefits of all the other things you know um i i appreciate the the tourism findings want to support this absolutely the economic benefits of this that will generate are fantastic but there 's also 11 000 local residents in this show which we represent and i believe that you know they need to have an opportunity for feedback to their counsellors you know prior to us putting them into another event such as this um the comment that the emergency services will have uninterrupted access on the highway during this event i find that you 're going to have bicycles going in both directions and an emergency vehicle trying to get through even if it 's an emergency they 'll be wanting to go at a fair speed so i can 't see how the coalition of those two will come and if this event does competitors or whatever it was i read you know that 's just going to become harder so it 's more than likely that part will dissipate and disappear from this section of it i am also concerned about businesses such as heartless creek i am led to believe that discussions are currently occurring with them but in this there 's no actual confirmed status you know that businesses that will have compulsory closure you know over this period will be compensated and that 's something we also need to you know take an undertaking to understand you know this is a business and this will be affected in that respect um i said this is a worthy event and i do believe that it has merit and i do believe that it just deserves the prior consideration but i know he 's under time constraints as far as satellite application goes my personal preference would be defer to the next meeting and let the get it out to the public so the public can have feedback on them but because of those time constraints i would like to recommend that that we do provide an in-principle support for the event um but i 'd like to add a second point that if the funding is successful that a finalized agenda of the event is brought back to this council for approval so we know exactly what the event is and what it 's going to do to our people and also give the community time to get back to us we 'll get time to sort out some of these other issues that i think are a concern and we can possibly all move forward with this event which as i said i believe would be a good event so on that i would like to propose that that um point two is added if funding is successful at a finalized scope of the event is brought back to council for an approval resolution and also that the mayor is included in point three for the letter of principal support is there anyone that wishes to second that come on cancel on the q1 yeah i think that just gives it a clearer direction um we 'll put it to so the second point i don 't understand how that 's going to work so let 's say they are successful in getting funding then we come back to a council resolution we say no what happens then it doesn 't make sense you can 't have that you can so they they go ahead get funding from ttmq or whoever are successful we come back here and then we have a look at the finalized scope and say actually no what happens there you can 't have it you can 't have something like that in in a recommendation it doesn 't make any sense at all any other comments regarding that well on that what councilman is saying so if they do get successful funding and it does come back what happens to the funding then without think of it backwards well the fact is the funding at the moment the case is he needs to get a letter of support of support to get the application okay but i still have concerns and you know from my perspective i 'd be unlikely to support the recommendation as that the community has had the opportunity yet to give feedback on this event and the highway closure i believe they deserve to have that you know once this becomes public the community could see what a great event is and give them an opportunity to give feedback to councillors saying yes absolutely we support it so when the funding comes through absolutely we can say okay this is what they intend on doing fantastic we can lock it in let 's go ahead over the next month we could be inundated with people saying that we do not want this event we do not want another higher enclosure now if we 've written a new support letter we have no back out we have no option to say that we no longer agree with this event councillor norwood if that is your argument council occur why is this even come to a meeting at the moment why can we have brought it in a month later and in the meantime uh done what you 've suggested as i said council knowing my preference would be defer this but we _''_1793.919 this application for the funding side of it my preference would be just to defer it so with that i 'd ask if we put that to evoke the um suggested recommendation all those in favor council mckeown council occur all those against councillors thomason councillor knowledge council zamasu fails so the original motion now stands so we 'll put to [Music] um what i 'm finding really hard here at the moment is that this is a little bit of information about the funding that they have that they 've actually got to go and get it 's the same thing happening again it 's not here for us to know this it 's not here anywhere about the funding that they 've got to go get the funding so we 're making another decision on the hop again without getting all the information that 's all i 've got to say it just happens keeps happening over and over again well this i 've got that information because i asked answer the knowledge yeah thank you question and i meant to actually ask this question beforehand i 'm the actual dates in september with the um uh potential final series on especially football a successful cross football club um have had well have they but have any of the uh sports ground news has been spoken to about this date and potential clashing and whatever um through the mayor um i 'll pass on to renee for that but uh for the exact date but those details can be changed at any point at this moment in time the funding is there ttnq and teq are both very excited about this event cycling australia has the general manager of queensland has emailed this morning to say oh my god how exciting would this be um as as the report states that um the the draft event strategy from tourism port douglas and dametry includes the necessity of um closing that highway or considering closing that highway to allow these events to come the date has been very carefully chosen for that time it is the week before the school holidays the september school holidays and for the first time all states have the same holidays it is a until the holidays start before coming bringing their families up the the picking of that date is because um cycling adventure tourism people tend to be quite well off and they tend to bring one and a half people with them when they come up so if you 're bringing your family up here to do a cycling event you 're not going home the next day so the week before the school holidays gives us a really great opportunity whether we use the sports ground obviously as plan a but that is of course we would not i don 't think council would even um consider displacing the football final to do that but renee has these correct we 've just been given the draw just recently but there 's certainly no intention to try and stop my name and go again especially if you know the finals and things like that and obviously that brings in its own um you know sports dollars as well so it 's those are the finer details that we can work with the clubs alongside with the event as well so you 'll say the afl club but all the clubs that may be involved to get a positive outcome and an equitable and a happy outcome for everyone you believe this is absolutely absolutely thank you we wouldn 't allow them to use the sports ground if it wasn 't going to because the the local clubs have the the booking store and thank you miss golden yeah i hope i agree but i just need to hear it basically as well thank you can you just have a comment guys um i 've had a few items there that i was going to bring up most of it 's been covered but like i 'm fully supportive of this event um all compared to the other one that we got every year which is absolutely disaster to this shower um without going into this now but if we do move with this motion because i i agree with you that the first thing people are going to say is i know the road again but having been in the transport game and the hospitality game with the other event that more benefits even with the transport thing it 's a disaster the other one but this does give a little bit of i know you 're talking about your flight tonight um but i think the benefit will be more than the um than the losses but in saying that if we do move with this i think the pr people are going to have to do a very good exercise in making sure that they 're aware that you know that it 's not going to be another another full day and that the support of business that um that they have um is there so thank you councilman here councillor zamatara yeah i i i fully support this event and let 's face it the last year or so hasn 't been very good economically in the douglas shire and i think any opportunity injects 3.8 million in the economy it 's something that we need to steam ahead with any issue and it 's a very thorough report and the fact is as councilman said the road 's not closed all day it 's closed from five 's had people incensed about that it 's closed all day for the only close half a day i don 't think it 's going to cause anywhere near the drones the other one 3.8 million in the local economy something we can 't absolutely totally agree with you yeah but i wanted to make sure these points come out and they are there for discussion before we make it made a decision on this because they are things that people will be concerned about and they have things that people will come back at us for so if there 's no further comments we will put it to debate all those in favor and that is right here let 's move on to 5.3 local roads and community infrastructure program uh the recommendation is the council resolves to endorse the following process and fund the phase two of the local roads and community infrastructure program um crosston and owen street intersection upgrade 140 000 feet beach access upgrades to four mile beach 170 000 c mossman pool shades 90 000 d pop-up engagement container trailer 80 000 can he the chief executive officer under section 257 the local government act 2009 to administer the above matters if we could have a move on that one please count councillor san mateo got in there and councillor [Music] and are anyone against any further comments at all yes i had councillors across the street and owen street um the upgrade with that that 's fine i think that has to be done and that 's it the only issue i the only thing i have a um i think the 80 000 pop-up engagement container trailer um i think that 's something that we could put on at a later date because you know 80 000 i 'm sure we can put that into something um if you can explain to us through the mayor uh exactly where the pop-up engagement container is just for the public that 's all through the chair the um the pop-up engagement container is um about a um converting a container or a trailer into um some activating some spaces around the around the shower where we can uh provide some staff and engaging projects area we can provide some staff there we can also provide a um as a social enterprise for hiring out or passing it out to um to social enterprises such as um you know pop-up coffee shops or food vans and then providing it through um through some not-for-profit organizations as well yeah i just i just think at this time within budget constraints i think that 's something that we could utilize that eighty thousand dollars better and that 's something we 're looking um in the future when we 've got that you know extra money in the budget it is sorry um this is funding though isn 't it this is 100 funding that 's correct 100 funding right okay so that 's not our money it 's not and i think from the memory the concept of it was when we do engagement we can set it up and have a full display of designs and all the rest of it for community engagement purposes as well and it gives people somewhere to actually go for um when we 're doing the consultation sorry councillor nolan amazon i it 's 100 funding absolutely but is there somewhere else that maybe would be better to look for eight thousand dollars in 100 funding is my question is that more or less kind of what you 're getting over also um yeah i don 't just like the idea you can 't_''_2496.8 do the ideas right it 's just that you think we can do other things in the show experience the other being like any other funding there 's certain criteria that these things have to fit into and hence why this was through the chair yes the reason why we chose that is um because it will be shovel ready by the time we submit the um the projects we do go through the capital works program every every time there 's a funding around that that takes place and that this was one of the projects that is ready to be um on shovel ready if you like yeah okay any further comments on that one they will put it to the vote though all those in favor and let 's carry me on the the recommendation is the council endorses the 2020 revised version of the drinking water quality management plan for douglas shire council over mover please councillors cumminson seconded by councilman got in there councillor would you like to speak to this no it 's pretty all i can say is that another detailed report from and uh probably 30 minutes i won 't get back but it 's great reading and it 's very exciting that 's all i 've got to say about yes it is a very very deep very thank you very much and said it 's mindful to get through but yeah it 's very very detailed it 's got some very good information here with that we 'll put it to divide all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously all right yeah 5.5 contract w0504002 donovan range pavement upgrade the recommendation is the council resolves to award contract w05040-02 donovan range paper upgrade to ga construct proprietary limited for two million six hundred and seventeen thousand three hundred and twenty and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the and all matters in relation to this contract this is the remover for this one we have no mover for it would anyone like to propose an amendment for that moment of four hundred thousand four hundred and three thousand dollars less than the tenant that 's been accepted and if i can speak on them the more i read this report it 's a para report the more even more i 'm convinced the tender should be awarded to a douglas shaw company the business profile score means it 's locality of the tandra knowledge of the region who better than the douglas shire based company fits that criteria and on the economic side by employing a local company we 'll have 100 local suppliers 100 local contractors and quite possibly 100 local labor at end of the day local businesses will prosper because the money will stay in the shire look a few other points on page 138 report states the majority of the budget is externally funded and there is no opportunity to reallocate the funding the report also states that there are similar projects funded by the surplus can be reallocated these trades i mean if we 're predicting shortfalls and there 's no indication of how big a shortfall is predicting because we 'd better have an extra 400 thousand dollars to spend so it 's not bruce putting further pressure on their budget even their corporate plan united states council or part of industry to build diverse diversify and promote the douglas economy council will design and deliver infrastructure strategies and services support the local economy and businesses that that 's that 's that 's in the body of our report and that 's telling me that a local company is more suitable to take this job and i 'm not saying this and i 've worked with a lot of these people local people i 've been in the construction which the last 40 years and i know they 're quite capable of doing these sort of jobs and i think we have to start giving work to local companies as much as we can to keep the economy going and love the shire we 've just spoken about getting streak on injecting look i i can 't see kansas city council sitting there too often discussing or probably ever discussing giving a job to a douglas shy company was four hundred thousand dollars dearer than a dance company i can 't see that ever happening anyone wishes to speak against the amendment we 'll put the amendment to the vote and make that the new motion and then we can discuss further if you like so we 'll put it to the vote to change the amendment to speak against it so therefore we 'll put it to the vote that this becomes the new motion all those in favour let 's carry unanimously all right so as this is the new motion council is anyone else wish to speak towards this motion um i just totally agree with samatara i believe um it 's the price difference i think that makes it you know 400 000 is a big difference between um a local contractor to a contractor that 's been awarded the position when all the offers that were put in was comparative and conforming so um it doesn 't job as they 're competitive and conforming so i think that we should give it to the local guy because it 's gonna keep that money in the shop any other comments from councillors customer cure yeah first of all um i 'd like to thank the council officers for giving the explanation they did um very thorough process you go through to pick a tender and i can see where you come from with with this um you know it 's your job it 's your reputation that 's at stake if it fails so you 've always got to make sure you 're safe but i think as elected people in the shire sometimes we 've got to put our heads on the block and if it if we stuff up well we 've got to take the consequences as councillors who have gone against your recommendation but um i completely think that it should should be a local local um contractor i 've spoken to a lot of not in relation to this one but a lot of builders and contractors in the shire since we deferred going to them and saying we would like you to put a tender in for this even that might be a bit bigger than what you 're used to just to get the experience but what they 're saying is a lot of times they do that but they 're just not getting over the line and they 're saying well how are we going to get the experience if we 're not given a chance so i 'm happy this time put my head on the block and go for the local local company and i do believe the council will be overseeing the the progress so i 'm quite happy for it look everyone 's summed up pretty well there 's nothing in the report that uh that gives me shivers to not support the emotion by councillor zamotaro um perhaps their score wasn 't quite as high but it 's still sufficient that i feel confident that they can do the job so i 'm happy with the amendment thank you um i i also would like to commend the staff for a very detailed report which to thank you mr hahn for the report and i understand that the recommendation has been given based on the procurement and the vendor process that we counselors or those before us have set the guidelines to um i know that you as a professional staff member have completed your job with absolute certainty based on the considerations that are normally required through these processes and make it clear that the recommendation is one that we wouldn 't in a normal circumstance happily accept however for the benefit of the community many councillors sitting here made public commitment last year that due to the economic effects of covert 19 that we would look to create as much work as possible for our communities people to assist our region and rebuilding from the economic effects that occasion 19 brought to this community we are not in normal circumstances currently and for that reason as councillors we can and should at times make alterations to recommendations that we believe that the community would want us to do which may differ from the professional recommendations that we would normally agree to i do benefits to our local community on this particular contract and i say that as i do believe that this should be should should not represent the norm moving forward out of ways some of the is outweighs some of the risks involved in this project and so for those reasons you know i 'm happy to support an alternative recommendation to the one the staff proposed um do you require any further clarification as far as the recommendation yes all right okay so as the recommendation stands we 'll not do that i thought we did sorry so we need a mover for the actual recommendation as it stands now okay so all right so that 's there we 've had the discussions um we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carrick honestly thank you mr han 5.6 capital works progress report for the second quarter 2020 2021 um the recommendation is that council receives and notes the progress of the capital works program to 31 december 2020 for the 2021 financial year if i could have a mover please for that one knowledge do you wish to speak to it no thank you for the report and yeah it 's all there thank you can i wish to speak against no any further comments i 've just got a couple of little comments um i just have some explanation um number nine alexandra range fifteen hundred and thirty four dollars um just let me know what that was for what what did we do with alex is through the through the man the alexandra range project is an investigation on the uh susceptibility of the landslides okay yep right and the other one as well through the man um standby generator for the daintree fairy house for 7808 dollars um our number page 151 number 17. um through the mayor as the report indicates there 's 155

council 's best practice position for determining the 1.1 aep storm type inundation for the year 2100 having regards to a hd sea level rise if i could have a mover please cancel a summerslam goodbye that 's the knowledge got in on that one council wisconsin would you like to speak to this um well i 've had a very interesting um just to see what is proposed maybe for the future so it 's a good report just obviously with the findings of these most recent study will also feed into are more prone to uh flooding storm surge in because of the natural disasters so it 's and it 's going to be a lot more accurate than the study that we 've got at the moment so it 's going to be a lot more efficient use of resources getting to those targeted people at the appropriate time it 's through email and i think that 's something that this this report is something we have to concentrate on when we 're looking at future development reports like this will be guiding us as far as how we do it and what we do there how long ago was the last one done 2012 2013. yeah has it changed a lot it was quite a conservative um investigation yeah so the upshot of that was it resulted in quite higher floor levels and and flood levels so um that led to effective frustration both internally with us but also in the industry in terms of identifying what those levels are these latest levels are a lot more realistic i 'm sure they 'll be embraced but just one question coastal building we would refer to these maps to advise you than against it or yeah we 'd be looking at these findings to inform those decisions yeah where we 've got the current study say one level we 'd be inclined to rely on this study yeah to determine that thank you all right we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's one thank you very much all right 5.3 safe places emergency accommodation funding agreement the council the recommendation is that council resolves to enter into a funding agreement with the australian government under the safe place emergency accommodation grant to construct emergency emergency accommodation in the douglas shire enter into a headless arrangement with domestic violence service provider to manage and maintain the buildings for the period of 15 years commit the property to operating as an emergency or crisis accommodation for the minimum of 15 years and delegate authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to administer the above matches type of mover please councillor noli thank you very much seconded love to speak on this one it 's one of your passions thank you very much yeah absolutely i would have been upset if i couldn 't move it actually thank you um yeah look um okay thank you for the report i 'd just like to give a little bit of a background from my point of view when i became a counsellor in 2014 one of the things that i did was obviously getting involved in the community access network group and i was actually quite shocked to hear about the amount of domestic violence happening in our community i will say i was completely ignorant of the amount that there was and probably a lot of the community doesn 't realize just how much domestic violence occurs here i have been personally very lucky and probably that was why i never really realized so from 2014 it became i suppose something that i decided um i would i would like and collaboratively all the councils never never had a problem with it to uh really you know try to tackle um so it became quite a regular did the steps we did the processes and i suppose today we 're really at the final hurdle aren 't we really guys so um i have to thank obviously fellow councillors and obviously the staff for carrying out the instructions or supposed initiatives that have come in the previous year 's operational plans to come to this so we 're very happy that today is um yeah there basically thank you thank you anyone wish to speak against it any further comments from councillors regarding the motion this is great great asset for this show absolutely i agree totally with councillor nolly this has been something that i think is very hidden a lot of people don 't know how big it is in this shire and having a facility like this is just going to be an asset for us um with that we 'll put it to the votes sorry yes just a question to mr program mr golding um would this enter a lisa graham the domestic violence service provider they 'll be in control of the building council any arrangement with a service provider but is access community housing who run similar community housing everywhere and they 're very happy to take on the tenancy side of this in partnership with the specialist domestic violence counselling type servers to look up to the counseling side so the idea is that we don 't run a property council apart from football fields etc you know it 's not our our area of expertise to run that kind of tenancy changeover so yeah we wouldn 't be looking at handing over as much as possible that 's that falls on the shoulders of these organizations running for professional organizations exactly yeah so from council 's perspective it will just be the landlord that owns the property itself and would do maintenance etc on the building if there 's any faults like any normal landlord through the chair yes that 's correct all right with that then i said we 'll put it to the boat all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you up to the 5.4 application for temporary road closure of a part of unnamed road adjoining lots one to six on recommendation is the council delegates authority under section 257 of local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to execute a form part c as road manager advising the department of natural resources and mines and energy dnr that council cannot the council cannot authorize proposed temporary road closure over part of an unnamed road reserve adjoining lots one six on sea two two five four identified in the locality map attached to this report andreessen 's very probably however he 'd requested dnrme to consider an application under the land act in relation to this matter advises dnrme that it has no objections to the proposed application for a temporary road closure over unnamed road reserve adjoining lock one to six on c2254 andreessen 's road craig league and then delegates authority to the chief executive officer in accordance with section 257 of the local government act 2009 to finalize all matters associated with the supplication of a mover please counselor seconded by councillor nolly seconded yeah council 's cumbersome would you like to speak to it um the only question i have with this is um so it close it 's a state road three months they don 't need that access on that part of the road to to get to their cane fields uh we don 't believe so and um that 'll be all in consideration anyone wish to speak against any other questions or comments from councillors that then we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and let 's carry you know carried unanimously okay we 've got 5.5 applications for permanent road closure joining lock 204 on sp six five kilalone the recommendation is the council delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to execute a form part c as road manager advising the department of natural resources and mines and energy dnrme the council cannot authorize proposed permanent road closure over part of an unnamed road reserve adjoining lot 204 on sb 264765 identified by the locality map attached to this report captain cook highway kilo however it requested an rme to consider an application under the land act in relation to this matter advises dnr and me that road closure over unnamed road reserve adjoining lot 204 on sp 264 765 captain cook highway kilo subject to the following condition the applicant must provide the necessary easements to accommodate access to the aircraft beacon and storm water discharge where necessary delegates authority to the chief executive officer in accordance with section 257 of the local government act 2009 to finalize any and all matters associated with this application carbon mover please anyone we should move capsules commercial seconded by i 'm happy to second it to get it on council scholars did you wish to speak to this yeah i 've got a couple of questions um the application that was received was that receiving the corn pump the land owner of the corn plant to close the road for the chair please i received okay so the other question is so how do they get access into the corn plant is there another access um the um the proposal will be that uh those two allotments which are separate now will be um and therefore that indicates any need for access to separate developments however we would have access to the other um discharge stormwater discharge into the previous way which must be accessed at all times the reason why we believe the reason why that they wish to close out because of higher security reasons these people they were down the gold coast and about 12 hours right so this is the same road that we bought it um canceled um a couple of months about about renaming it so are we going to go ahead with that with that little tiny piece of row that 's going to be left to rename that one or we just through the chair i believe so that will still be the case that road when we named old ferry we decided to name our furry road wasn 't for that section it was for the whole road yes that 's correct it 's correct it i can 't understand why the same applicant wanted to rename the road and now must have closed the road i don 't support that i think we should leave it off because it was historic the reason we didn 't name it noticed i don 't know that historical part but um prior to this after occasion of the report being prepared all council departments are asked to comment on the proposal and we did not receive any adverse comments back and we only found out this morning basically that that was about five months ago now that information has not been sent to the title office or gnrnp to put on all the mapping systems of the uh using the council and we 'll address that situation now so it doesn 't happen in the future if council does not wish to uh perform a signed performance that is the end of the story uh the applicant cannot make applications to dnr to close work any further confidence good question thank you so just to understand if we uh approve this recommendation the row gets closed and no sign goes up is that correct i have no name to name that row is that correct does it happen uh if cancel approve of uh ceo execute the form c yeah um we 'll go ahead and public comment yeah and um road which faces the number um on captain cook highway that little section right there is probably about 60 meters but we 'll still be named that okay any other comments from councillors uh through the chair just just a question um when you talk about reasons for biosecurity is it because people have access to that that they 're worried about do you think according to the applicants um there are trucks to think that 's the uh tip road and they fly their trucks down there and have to get down there before they can turn around and come back again there 's no other businesses down there there 's no reason for anyone else to need to drive down that road is there so i can understand where they 're coming from that mistake because it 's also security councillor nolan thank you so if um it is closed then they have the capacity to put in a barrier i 'd like to stop would be approximately on this map it couldn 't be closer to the captain cook highway than those yellow lines on six four know that there 's residents just north of this road that are constantly complaining about dust and dirt coming off that road also um so that 's something that should be considered any other comments from councillors with that we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor of the motion that 's councilman councillor all those against councillor scholarson councillor nali councilman we have the contract w05040-02 donovan range pavement upgrade now the recommendation is council resolves to award contract w05040-02 donovan range paper upgrade to geo construct prohibitory limited for two million six hundred and seventies at two million six hundred seventy eight thousand three hundred and twenty three dollars ninety five cents let 's throw that 95 delegates authority under section 257 the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to negotiate finalise and execute any and all matters in relation to this contract hover please would you like to speak to um i suppose a lot less to speak to a little more along the lines of questions where it 's time thank you i think i wish to speak against the that 's actually and three thousand dollars less than what the tender the successful tender has been um and i know that the report does say that you know geo construct they 've identified the methodology i would assume that um the other company the local company would have all their ducks in a row and have all their contractors ready they would have had contractors ready that were capable of doing you know carrying out the job i find it hard that in this time the way we 're going at the moment and especially promoting do it in douglas we 're giving this job to a cairns company when there 's a company local company that 's going to employ all local use local products employ local contractors for four hundred and three thousand dollars less i find it hard to understand why they 're not lower they went away to tender i think if i may put in a turn that these are now very public and public are seeing these as well and questions are coming back to us regarding the percentages and i think it they work and how they can fluctuate to giving a decision that may not be clear as far as what the recommendations through them through the share um the we undertake a weighted scoring system and it 's um shown in the report um price only contributes 40 to the weighting um and a number of other factors are considered including the local component um from a local component it is difficult for us to assess a a local to be substantively different from someone who is effectively only an hour down the road in cairns when you look at it in a context that we get people from cairns we get people from queensland we sometimes get people from uh australia-wide doing projects and we need to be able to score them across that of course the person who 's local generally gets the score highest but when when they 're competing against someone who 's in perhaps brisbane um the scoring mechanism doesn 't allow it it doesn 't make a large large difference overall it 's a score out of 100 and it 's a couple of first rank tender and the tender that you 're referring to approximately 10 points overall we look at all of the criteria in this case the same thing um we look at all the criteria and in the case that you 're in um talking about the um the local tender didn 't basically didn 't provide us sufficient information in their tender documentation across some of those other criteria so as a consequence look they get a lower score you can 't necessarily be the cheapest price and perform not as well you know any other criteria it just doesn 't work like that the criteria also states the tender was comparative and conforming as well yeah it 's a conforming tender but there 's a level of documentation we have a number of criteria in there as well that we 're comfortable the contractor that we 're selecting or recommending for selection can do the project to do the project well for us this is just generalized observation and this is not a not a comment about um the report this report specifically it 's um i 'd difficult it is also from council 's point of view this is the only information we 're given and four hundred thousand dollars is not peanuts it 's it 's not you know even four thousand dollars which you might say oh yeah that sounds okay that sounds like a lot of to my ears um and i repeat no criticism at all but given that graph it 's very difficult for me to put my hand on my heart and say give it to someone i do realize that now down the road a lot but it is still something that 's not in the shop and i find it very very difficult with this information to not give the contract to the cheapest which by the way is on the show so this is the problem i 'm facing at the moment with this decision so as counselors we have three options the first is we accept the motion as it stands the second is that we can move to an alternate supplier or third you know we could defer this and request further information from staff so be able to assist us in our decision making councillor nolan so i was wondering about the deferment my question on that is that um how much then does that become like a closed session and that was my concern because can it come back in another report with more information how much can we discuss uh how much in depth can can be put into report so that it gives confidence also to the public that counsellors are yeah if it has to be slightly more expensive okay but it 's going to be proven that it 's a that is the correct choice so my question is yes maybe defer it but will it make a difference in the end is there a council that would like to move an alternate motion then could i just say something before we go to that it 's um i 've received so many phone calls in relation to this this one i also have other questions not questions but i 've been asked a lot of other questions about the one we did at kilaloo recently now this is nothing as elected members of council and with the information that that we have it 's very hard for me to sit down with someone say okay this is why you know this is why it would have gone somewhere else without knowing all the details it may be that it ends up there but when people are questioning me on why does council do this and yet all we have is this information it 's very hard to come out with an exact reason that 's where my concern is is just being able to explain to people like we have the percentages it could be that and and not just that tenders of a few tenders that we 've done and maybe the people who put it in just aren 't experienced enough and there we go um but i would like to be able to somehow workshop or or do something so we 've got a bit more information that i can confidently sit down in in front of someone and and like this is not the tender these are the contractors that are saying it 's a and then and like a few have said they said we know that they will not use local contractors for these jobs so yeah there 's no real benefit to them as a rate payer also unfortunately this is one of the fallouts from belkara yeah these laws were changed by the state governments these contracts used to be in a closed session which means there was a confidentiality with the suppliers you know to allow us to be able to get full details of everything unfortunately you know the contracts that are put in with these suppliers they 're entitled to their confidentiality when they 're doing things um and so not everything can be put in the public domain now because of that and this is something that all councils are currently working through and it 's certainly something that we 're feeding back to the lgaq about you know but in the meantime we 're stuck with this situation we have to continue the process thomason yeah the information that we 've received regarding this i don 't believe is enough for us to make a decision doesn 't give us any information whatsoever normally we used to get something that showed the weighting of what peop between the different companies uh this map here means nothing to me so i could make a decision from that the other things that i have concerned about and it 's a lack of information again is that this the company states that they can um that they 're a cancer-based contractor and they 'll be utilizing subcontractors from the w shire and a lot of phone calls i have um the possibility of that is very very slim the other problem i have is the economics of the shower you know that they 'll use hotels accommodation cafes well where they 're going to be doing the road there 's no local cafe for a while so accommodation so you know we promote do it in douglas bill douglas by douglas and four hundred thousand dollars to me i know it 's a grant money but four hundred thousand is a huge difference and i believe that the leftover money could be utilized somewhere else in the shower so why the other contractors that have submitted their tendon couldn 't conform to what you 're expecting so so i think i think it 's best at this point we know where we 're all coming from the same direction um is it a case we wish to move to defer this or is this the case that we wish to move an alternate motion look sorry man one of the one of the problems i have with this also is that these jobs they 're concreting jobs as well they 're just not people that are you know cowboys and trauma every poor is inspected by an engineer as a direct cancel engineer so they can 't get away with not doing it right you know i mean it 's ever every poor is inspected by gasoline this deal has to be correct everything has to be every board is inspected by councilman that 's why i assume that 's what i would like to see this a local company take this on a lot of you guys have had the experience in this type of work as well how to submit they probably don 't submit the right form you know uh applications how they should application problem not the right way they probably don 't submit the right penalties can 't answer pretend the questions you ask them but i think they are you saying you 'd like to move forward a recommendation to resolve toward the contract to the mossman emcee group that 's correct yes well we 'll move that motion now that council zamatara 's put about so is there a second that wishes to agree to the motion of resolving to award the contract to mse group queensland particularly before we move that can i discuss that please because council okay so counselor zomtown would you like to say anything further to that recommendation since you 've moved it i don 't think i 've said it i want to see local companies getting employed and local contractors getting employed it 's been a hard year for everybody i think we need to be some as a council that we 're employing and keeping employment local and giving as much work council work know continue to economy growing in moscow in the douglas shot sorry okay would anyone like to speak against that okay so in theory i i i would like to support the mc group but i also don 't want to go the opposite direction and jump to a conclusion without having information so that 's all so i would much prefer to defer this get all the information because that might be the wrong the recommendation might be correct that might be the wrong way to go if we don 't have the information so as much as i 'd like to eventually maybe give it to a douglas shire business i don 't want to also not do my job not investigate not have the information by going down this amendment immediately so i won 't support that i 'm sorry not immediately okay so we 'll put that motion of the change to the vote for those who wish for the change to happen all those in favor of the change to happen councillor scholars and council zamatara all those against council me queue and council on a motion to defer it so that councils can request further information um if i can have a second on that please counseling cue if anyone um against deferring it with that motion okay so we 'll put that to the vote then in the fact of shall we change the motion to defer it that 's right or do we just defer it just just just referring uh so if we defer and come back to another council meeting will we come back with more information same information will be in the report but we 'll give you as a counsellor a chance to send an email through to staff personally requesting an information i believe that is correct uh yes i know i 'd suggest it or you bring it to a workshop or discussion and i 've actually suggested that that 's a standard process coming forward okay thank you all right so all those in favor of deferring it that 's council mcewen council wisconsin councillor nola councillor all those against councillors amatara thank you all right 5.7 the financial report for december 2020 if i that seconded by councillor scott um again you know these reports are very thorough they carry everything all the information that we need to know um i absolutely encourage people to get online and look at these reports and have a look and see what cancer is doing and where they 're up to you financially anyone like to speak against it any further comments from counselors then uh through the chair um the only thing i would like to um set up the ferry did very well in december i had a lot of custom through and um as of november we 're about 80 000 behind the revised budget and that 's been pulled back into about 40 000 so that was really good news we just hope that january has also been um a good month for ferry it 's good to see a lot of locals and domestic travelers getting around can i just ask one question you know the bus fairy travel refund how much longer is that we had a date on that yeah that ended in at the end of december no on for those in favor and that 's carrick announced 5.8 uh five big complaints about the public official policy the recommendation adopts the complaints about the public official policy as per section 48a of the crime and corruption act 2001 and delegates authority to the manager of governance under section 257 of local government 2009 to incorporate any administrative changes required to the policy following the review by the crime and corruption commission if i can have a movement please get counseling seconded by councillor scotland i think it 's all pretty straightforward we 've been through it thank you to speak against some questions will you please cancel out just [Music] uh just a couple of things i want to clarify i probably don 't understand page 77 the policy application top if their ground suspected a complaint may involve corrupt comments what that means counselor is that if if any council of staff anyone has any um suspicions or concerns with corrupt behaviour okay the first point of quality that doesn 't employ it 's not it doesn 't apply to council so that 's pretty much just suspicious reasons that it goes through the triple c the ceo will consult with the triple c when preparing any policy about how council will deal with a complaint that may involve corrupt conduct of the ceo yes again through you mr man this is and i questioned that when i um sent the policy through that 's the the template that you also give us every other council is word for word yes the policies i understand it 's possible i don 't understand how does that work i don 't have to see the ceo well if you if we were to get a complaint about seago the ceo can actually bring up to triple c and say hey let 's not go complain about me then they step away that 's the way the triple c deal with it is very public servant interesting manner it doesn 't read like that that 's the way it 's written it yes yes so i 'm waiting for a review from them um they see that we 've um reviewed it and updated it for any staff again it and we just make new changes it 's like he 's sending himself to the world mr stoneman i was just going to comment for you mayor that that looks like it 's about preparing any policy i 've stepped right away from this and i 've completely delegated everything to the manager of governance so while i 'm in this chair anything will go through the manager of governance whether or not that 's yeah [Music] any complaint against uh ceo you determine whether it 's worthy of a complaint is that correct if a complaint comes in through a member of the public a council or a staff or through the ceo itself um under the policy i aim to report it through to the triple c um the determination um they will they will look at it and they let us know whether it is corrupt behaviour under defined under the corruption act if it 's not then it will be referred through um not a different policy but a different procedure if it is corrupt behavior the triple c come in and take over that if on the nature of the complaint it will go through the processes of dealing with the complaint about a staff member and that we 're third and i have now have that people have the delegation and authority to engage a third party so it takes it out of um hr hands or managers and a third party will coordinate with so does this policy dictate that you make the decision whether it needs to go further as well no i have to we 're obligated to send that straight through the triple sec there 's a there 's guidelines under the common commission act to appoint you whether you pretty much if in doubt report um and the ceo also if a complaint comes direct to him about him he can refer that straight to triple c through the map so um the ira that 's counseling accountability so yeah so at the moment if you put a complaint in the ira and they take it to their um triple c that 's that 's under a different yeah from a ceo to a counselor and you 're in council contributes a maximum 12 superannuation contribution to superannuation funds or schemes complying with the commonwealth superannuation legislation for elected members who wish to participate as per section 2v6 of the local government act 2009 provides for councillors who make voluntary superannuation contributions for at least six percent to receive 12 contributions on those payments provides for those councillors who do not wish to make voluntary contributions to receive the standard superannuation guarantee payment of 9.5 and provides that that where a councillor chooses to make a voluntary contribution that this can be contributed from pre-tax or post-tax i 'd to speak against i just want to comment that this isn 't a a new thing this is just a document or a policy in case anyone 's wondering that you know just enforces what 's already in place so with that we 'll put it to the boat all those in favor and it 's carried thank you all right 5.10 water and wastewater quarterly report for the period ending 31st of december 2020. the recommendation it is recommended for the quarterly report of the water and west water and noted mover against the motion all right another wonderful report of documents of information to keep us up to date thank you very much and again i urge the people out there to actually have a look at these things and see what 's going on interesting with that i will put to we did a presentation to the community health seniors group um on the 5th of november are we do we do any presentation with the school students to talk to them about their water wise and things like that certainly through the chair uh we certainly do with developing our portfolio i guess of educational material to better present these concepts to the school children so we 've developed a video for water and wastewater at the moment and other materials and also state government provided materials so that 's part of the one of our operational plan objectives is to care and present at the schools because that 's where we will get the best impact for that mortalised message it 's a daintree village school and did a tour through the treatment plan last today we 're engaging with the skills to get out there they have proportions in their curriculum when they talk about the environment and water and waste and things like that so we 're targeting to get to the schools thank you it 's actually so it 's a bit of a story it 's actually interesting that you should bring that up both of you because um this year i am teaching permanently a couple of days a week at the primary school and the first june i 'm teaching science and the first unit is resources earth 's resources and water it 's obviously one of the big ones and um so it might hit you up in a tour or something and definitely that the video that 's just worked well well with the great i 'd like to see that made public because people only impressed the council takes you know days to repair stuff i need you know 30 minutes 15 minutes 10 minutes see if we can somehow make it and they 'll put it on our website if it 's not on there something that goes into the ceo report for those other graphs all right yeah absolutely as you said it 's in the operational plan that we um do do a creation of an education for water and you know i 'm really looking forward to that coming out uh we 'll put that onto the boat all those in the paper you want to have something just a question yes sorry are there any local talk through the chair that 's that we don 't have a direct policy or plan at the moment to be persuading households to be doing that i think that sort of broader planning and i don 't know if there 's a voluntary thing or a contribution or there might be a bigger plan around that but at the moment we don 't we 're not pushing that concept and something that we can look into definitely we 've spoken about it before uh it 's helps but yeah move forward and come back to a workshop or something and discuss it further that 's i do like to see a policy like that the series lines before you see how much water comes down it 's a lot more i remember when i purchased my place that just stopped doing that and they said the reason they stopped it is because up here that the amount of time that we have between rainfall the tanks were emptying and was defeating the purpose um you know when there was plenty of water they were full they just didn 't hold enough to sustain a lengthy time so it 's certainly something worth talking in the workshop to see if it 's worthwhile any other questions on that okay we 'll put that one to the vote all those in favor and that 's carrie 5.11 the operational plan progress report for period october to december uh the recommendations the council notes the progress of the implementation of the operational plan 2020 in 2021 i 'm happy to move that one i have the second the policeman another very detailed plan of um what we 've been doing um again i don 't know how many times i can say this i urge the people and just see what we 're doing and how we 're doing it in the progress that we 're making we 've certainly had some wonderful achievements already with the employment of the indigenous liaison officer who has been employed which is part of it we 've got the thank you very consultation has been completed now um there are great things in here and i honestly i urge people to have a look at it if anyone would like to speak against it if anyone other comments for counsellors no further comments from councillors regarding all right we 'll put that to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried 5.12 the ceo report for the period october to december 2020 the recommendation is the council receives and notes the organizational report card and the report from the chief chief executive officer for the period october to december 2020. if i have a move please for that one [Music] council zamatara seconded by that council mcewen any further comments from any counsellors just another good report again very detailed and i think you know the community happening mr storm would you like an opportunity to say anything no i just want to thank mr stormer for the work that 's in here you know again it 's very detailed it covers off a lot of information and really does highlight the amount of work that council staff do and they need to be commended for the efforts they put in so that will put that to the vote all those in favor and that 's carrying you honestly and i believe that closes the meeting today the time is 10 56 thank you very much everyone for attending _"

give notice that in accordance with section 2770 the local government regulations 2012 that the ordinary meeting of council has been restricted to the public because of health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involving coping 19. today we have made availability for eight members of the public attending which will allow us to still remain within the restrictions we have been given so that we are abiding by the chief health office health chief health officers directive of the number of people in a space this size i have this week spoken with our state representative to ask when this restriction can be lifted and i 'm awaiting your response this ordinary meeting of council will be available to view via live stream council 's website and will be available for others to watch at a later time i 'd like to acknowledge the google energy people who are the traditional custodians of the to pay respect to their elders by past present and emerging and extend that respect for indigenous australians who may be listening or watching our meeting this morning i know that all councillors are present and of course we have our ceo a limited amount of staff in the room we also have a limited members of the public in our gallery and representatives of the news media are present today as well councillors conflicts of interest please counselor norman thank you um so in item 5.2 uh material change abuse of a retirement village um i would like to state that i counsel abigail knowledge from the meeting that i 've perceived declarable conflict of interest as a result have the same surname in front of the applicants although i have a perceived declarable conflict of interest that i do not believe a reasonable person to have a perception of bias simply because the better relationships therefore i suggest to remain in the meeting however i will respect the decision of the meeting on whether i can rely on participating in the decision um just before voting on whether someone does not mean you have a personal relationship mayors and councillors know a large number of people in the community some indicators that you might replace person with a relationship include if you live with them or don 't you have an intimate relationship with them no if you call them your close friend or include them in a wedding party no if you regularly meet the person for meals or social activities no if other people regularly see you together in public no if your finances are connected no if we have an ongoing legal dispute with the person or other personal reasons for strongholds so this is just an example so but anyway i 'll zoom out to you guys thank you councillor nolly um i 'm gonna put this one to a vote but i will say beforehand i appreciate where you 're coming from with your comments um but i also have to look at this from other perspectives as well and i 'm sure that in some cases you know there has been public meeting or meetings that we 've had here with workshops with you your uncle who is your uncle um can we just put this to the vibe please now well sorry but i 've got an email here that states in this example it may be that i vote against the pool because i am against my relation and that 's something you wrote no no you 're containing that completely out of context um i find that actually quite offensive but i actually incorrect that it is out of context i was given an example of anywhere that people have that 's very very low so it 's very very large um so the motion uh has to be that we either allow councilman knowledge to stay in the room to vote or if i can just outside of wording on this please because there is correct word under the new legislation that went through on the 12th of october there is correct writing that we have to use and that 's why we 're just looking for the wording from that word with emotion stating that the council can decide do not [Music] well i think we should stay in the room so the motion will be put through that um to allow cancelling only to stay in the room to vote all those in favor councilman mcewen councillor sanatari all those against councillors and councils occurred if i can answer the government 's officer since we have choo choo [Music] here 's the costume boxing all right there are no number minutes confirmation of the minutes that the minutes of the ordinary meeting held on tuesday 24th november 2020 be confirmed councilman second deadline thanks to zantara anyone against any comments or changes all those in favor of the vote and that 's passed parentheses all right let 's go on to agenda items 5.1 the dangery river crossing community consultations um with discussions this morning um which just simply adds to the end of it that the ceo comes back to the councillors with the key points of the contract before it 's signed um so the motion would read that the council resumes contract negotiations 2019-84084 dangery ferry contract 2021 and requests that the ceos to bring back a report to councillors with key final behind that well if i can have a seconder on that please councillor mcewen anyone against that change all those in favor and that 's now carried to be the motion all right so i 'm happy to now support this motion uh which will allow staff to continue negotiations for two ferry crossing scenario across the daintree river i do however have restrictions and have reservations uh whilst i have the utmost confidence in the ceo and the staff in completing this contract i want to make sure that i and other councillors are comfortable with what conditions key performance indicators and penalties for failure to deliver in the contract before signing the residents of the shire over to a major contract such as this i 'm a lot more comfortable in moving forward now that i have confirmation through our community consultation that a majority of ratepayers and residents have had the opportunity to consider the options and the cost implications to this council and therefore themselves as rate players allowing us to move forward on one of the largest contracts that this council enters this amended motion to see further details of what the contract contains prior to its execution by the ceo on the 3rd december 2019 the previous council passed a closed session motion that would allow the ceo to enter into negotiations for an approved supplier to provide a tooth fairy contract for the residents of ishtar the motion was passed in a closed session of council with no members and public being able to see the costs to this council possible costs to the rate payers possible fare increases and no ability for this information to ever be made public under the state laws that govern close sessions of council on the 28th of may 2020 i put forward a to the council as a mayoral requesting the negotiations on the ferry contract be suspended while further community consultation occurred that would represent a broader range of the community and consultations provided the community with the costs involved with both the two ferry system compared to the possibility options of a bridge these results were then to be brought back to an ordinary council meeting so further discussions could be had on this can remember living in this region there has been debate over a ritual ferry scenario as early back as the event traffic solution study in 2002 when queuing had been an issue at this location it included reports showing there was a lack of infrastructure on the northern banks to allow a local access approach and it even mentioned buses traversing on the wrong side of the road complaints or complaints that are still present to stay looking through the various papers and reports that have been prepared perhaps many of the items that were in the report such as this one had been introduced the discussions of a bridge may never have occurred but many of these items didn 't progress and much of the changes that have occurred have been through a coroner report or attempted beautifications of the gateway entrance rather than any attempt to increase the speed of getting cars across the river i think for many the crux hit when the ferry was taken out of service for maintenance and the threat of a weaker road closures exacerbated a long drawn-out issue of access problems conducted some very thorough consultation with user groups and locals in the river river crossing area to gain knowledge of the issues in the river crossing and ghd were employed to conduct and produce a very thorough danke river traffic assessment traffic modelling report which was able to confirm the when house and mines of the traffic congestion and most importantly at the time what the future would hold for this crossing there was strong evidence from both that there were definite issues and there would be further issues in the future unless an alternative river crossing scenario was introduced the ghd report very clearly showed that the best option to reduce queuing times was a bridge constructed bridge construction followed by a tooth fairy scenario the do nothing often could not be considered as the traffic study confirmed that traffic was only growing and the issues would progressively become worse in the future as a bridge was not up for discussion with previous council at the time the two ferry solution application had the best solution available for the price of it and the motion with no consideration or been given any consideration of their preference for crossing this recent public consultation has now let the community know that the two ferry system has large financial implications the council will reduce over a million dollars in revenue each year that it currently accounts for and uses in its budgets that is a million dollars that we need to make up with other methods be that through either rate increases ferry crossing price increases or cutting back in services none which are palatable but discussions that myself and these councillors will need to look at when considering the next budget of this council these are major financial consequences i 've heard people say that this consultation was a waste of time but quite frankly the consultation results clearly show that every third person you spoke to was in favor of the bridge every third person in this show never had an opportunity to have their son previously under the previous council a third of our community 's opinion obviously didn 't count under this council everyone 's opinion is important everyone 's opinions be considered and the community consultation will to nearly 35 is an extreme difference and shows that the previous consultation was flawed in this area i believe that this council has achieved a great result with 3409 compliance surveying responses these responses showed similar results across the board as such this argument can now formally be put to bed we have an answer and the majority of the community has now spoken for the direction that they would like to go and that is a toothberry system i will say that this has been an emotional ride for many with unfortunately some misconstrued ideals being promoted in some cases straight out lies whether the majority of the community chose a ferry or a bridge the protection of our rainforest the national park and the animals that reside there were always going to be paramount and solutions to many of these concerns would need to be found to finish i 'd like to say thank you to the staff for the exception on consultation period and the community for participating in the survey your patience while we complete this process and for being part of the solution is just a second they 're of the actual amendment please so if i can have a second just to move the motion if anyone would like to speak against it all right any other comments of the new motion about going into the ferry contract and then coming to go against the contract yes to go against the new process yes so no one wants to speak against it so i 'll open it up to councillors to have their comments okay if the council would like to say anything yes i would okay just a couple of points uh i supported the the mayoral minute put forward in april uh to temporarily suspend negotiations for a tooth fairy service to explore the option of a bridge crossing i didn 't believe it was coming back to council to vote on a few points i 'd like to make on the results um i was very impressed with the responses from the public um three and a half thousand replies this time compares to 117 with the first so-called consultation while not surprised at the 6633 response i have some pro bridge group out there as there was a pro ferry group i believe it would have been a bit closer there were some untrues banded around during the consultation period plans for an industrial estate over the river the mcdonald 's changes proposed to the planning scheme and the funding of the bridge even though a lot of time was placed into the planning of the consultation process uh there were still some problems some issues that were brought up to me were there was confusion over the one card per household not one one person per vote a lot of people say they did not receive the cards a lot of people say they did not receive the information brochure that was sent out as well even though i received both stating the financial that information stating the financial implications a lot of people are still unaware of the financial burden that comes with two two ferries the loss of one million dollars plus income to general revenue the increase or possible increase of rates to about 2.75 additional costs with the extra dredging additional costs to tourists on to the tourists which they believe may put them out of range for the average person to be able to travel to cape tribulation while reading the submissions lodged both for the bridge and for the two ferries i do believe that in these modern times there are solutions that we could overcome most of these problems i know this is not the first time the bridge has been discussed and i 'm sure it 's not the last while this is not the result i was looking forward forward i 'm looking for i will move forward as the wishes of the majority as to endeavor to find the solutions to these long outstanding issues that is one of the reasons why i would not support that initial motion this morning but i 'm happy to move forward uh we 've got two new councillors here that have not seen that the contract and before i could make a decision on probably the biggest contract that the shire is going to issue i just need to know more information about it thank you who would like to go we had a mayor we went to consultation because from you maker said you wanted the public to decide on what they wanted now there was an overwhelming majority that supported the ferry option to me that proves that douglas show a resident 's favor protecting the environment that that that 's an indication they didn 't want to bridge in there there 's always been a belief that abridging the oldest rainforest on the planet will spell disaster for the environment and that 's a belief that i share as well in the conversations i had during the consultation that was the reason people voted in favor of the ferry service they 're concerned about the danger to the environment but you know at the end of the day there 's no doubting what option people preferred it was a whopping 66 to 33 percent wanting a ferry service and as well as that there 's a petition been signed worldwide in excess of 30 000 signatures that that you know concerned about well i don 't know struck about the daintree rainforest and look in contrast to something say so it was disappointing that people had signs erected around the shire and support the ferry service the signs were stolen or destroyed that to me disappointing and illegal as well but at the end of the day there 's no question of the ferry service a prepared option so we can carry on now finalize the contract and move on to council business thank you thank you thank you a huge thank you to the 392 people who responded to the survey to the 31 000 people who signed a petition against the bridge to the other petition i saw where there was about another ten thousand sign against the bridge of idea and a big thank you to everyone who spoke to me or contacted me about this your time and input has been appreciated um so and what i 've been saying from the beginning has been unequivocally verified no reach backed by the survey opinion submitted i have not read one single valid truly immediate argument to build a bridge firstly there will be a substantial loss of revenue through ferry um toll after a of building the bridge maintaining the bridge and having depreciation costs per bridge one would imagine a very heavy increase in rates should we go with the bridge option the fairing is also a source of jobs and having two prairies that bring even more full-time employment environmentally the ferry solar solution is far superior to us to a bridge the bridge has a number of environmental concerns associated with it and the new ferry will be 70 solar housing a bridge will not magically increase prosperity in china there will not be a convention center built off of the river as an example not a factory these are just examples emergency services will not be um assisted with a bridge the medical helicopter is faster than any road surfaces and the police and fibrogrades phone ahead at any time of the day to have the fairy red and waiting to cross a bridge is not flood proof the north will still have days of being cut off and this is just like north queensland the ferry is part of the tourism experience and very marketable a bridge may change by and not a stop and spend in the shire so a bridge may possibly lose tourism revenue revenue a bridge will also be undermining the philosophy behind the creation of the danger world heritage listing and will not help our eco-destination accreditations which currently are a huge drawcard and our tourism point of difference to other parts of queensland additionally i would like to say that there are two pieces of information from the survey that need teasing out naturally over this time there 's been a lot of informal conversation with me as well as the formal submissions this includes people who have told me that they voted for the bridge naturally i asked them why why in your opinion is a bridge better at least 50 of those answers were because they thought the ferry cost us money instead of providing a revenue and that a bridge would lower our rates instead of probably increasing them when i explained the whole situation they changed their minds so all that percentage of people who voted for a bridge maybe they could be hard the second thing i 'll or revenue raising it appears that um insufficient information to the local people i can believe that the cost to cross the river would increase for locals instead of the very account that we have which basically for a two-year card is placed for nothing now let 's take a step back to the merrill minute that brought us to this huge sleep and time-wasting experience and it was time-wise and i 'll explain why i 've been telling you that the results what the results would be from the beginning and why did i know it was going to be like this but unsurprisingly for the last four years i 've been listening to the whole cross section of the show not just a few i 've been involved in understanding tourism and our plot of difference in douglas worked with tpd and how the fairy plays and promotions shy i 've been learning the importance of eco accreditation improving my knowledge and the environment and impacts of the space and going forward i have a good understanding about revenue rising and profit and loss for council budgets i of douglas want so i will now use the words that i have heard vented around the media now councils are fully informed well i was always fully informed as a fully informed genuine and savvy counsellor i always knew what the results were going to be thank you thank you councillor nollie councillors cumbersome okay um when um i 'm just a little bit confused here how this has gone ahead because um i was under this understanding that we were going to resume the report was going to come back to the meeting for further discussion resolution which it 's not going to happen it 's also statistics in the public assessment report which also communicated to the public who attended the constant consultation and the dse media report saying that with all the information was going to come back to be discussed so we 're not going to do that we 're going straight back into negotiations if this is the case as a council i have not been given the right to voice my opinion on the outcome of this report and i 've not been i have received from the community in this open meeting this has not been open and transparent transparent and now the motion 's changed this morning without any consultation the assumption is that counsellors support the two on the report and the two fairies is not that 's your assumption that we are now going to go in and support this report that 's been done for the two ferry solution this the concept of the two ferry solution is um we are going to get a bigger ferry which will operate most of the time and the current ferry will be used in peak times i would have thought that to have a backup ferry or a mutant form of four emergencies would have been a requirement of the current contract so it 's not so this is why we 've now gone back out to a two ferry solution through this whole process and i respect the people that have voted um my main concern through this whole process was the cost to the rate payers of this show i didn 't care if we got a bridge with one it was the costings to the people of this show this is a very important decision to make as a counsellor and it 's imperative that the correct decision is made through so to at least impact the rate payers that will alternately foot the bill you know we 've had petitions that went out 30 thousand people as council um samatara said but how many of those people that fill that petition are actually reporters of this shire who will foot the bill at the end of the day the previous council which is three and present in this room we 're privy to the new ferrari contract from the beginning and are fully aware of the details that are in the contract as for myself and councilman mcewen have not been brought up to speak on anything to do with the contract and as such i feel blinded and i 'm required to make a decision when not having the full facts of the implications for this shower prior to any contract being signed we must ensure that any and all necessary permits are in place ferry channel and additional dredging permits why would we enter into a contract or even start to negotiate a contract if we 're going to lose the current income and expect the ratepayers of this shower to make up the balance with increased rates and ticket prices we have many families and businesses in the shire who have done it tough through covert and some are beginning to recover and expect a rate rise to make up the loss of this is outrageous this seems to be very expensive contract for this show and i do not believe this is the right way forward we have so many options that have not been looked at to help the ratepayers of this show the current contract will cease on the 30th of june 21 and it is the council 's responsibility to ensure the continuation of the ferry service by whatever means necessary i feel we will be entering uncharted territory before before i will not support this recommendation but as the recommendation has changed i will support for the ceo to continue negotiations but i expect councilman q and i us before any for anything further is done we need to understand that the ratepayers of this shire have to pay for the tourist industry in this shire for many years and we need we just can 't_''_1872.32 people just can 't afford it anymore and that 's it so i think we have so many more options we 've had so many reports done over many many years in this shower recommendations put to council or what to do and we 've not taken we 've taken probably hardly anything north um priority lane all these things that for safety reasons and to help the right place of this show and we have not done it um thank you councillors thomas and i appreciate where you 're coming through with that um this will do a point that no one ever argued that the bridge concept wasn 't going to be expensive you know but it had to be out there for people to make an educated decision on which like so many people were saying that one of which and as i said a third of the community out there for them to see an approximate what those costs were going to be to make a decision whether they were still supporting the bridge compared to a ferry so i think that was really important for those details about that we can all meet people on the street and say which what did you choose and talk them into believing in what we believe by telling them our points of view and that 's quite easy to do and you know councillor not you mentioned that you were fully up on everything we had numerous community consultation days that you weren 't there to listen to the people 's comments at those meetings you know so there was lots of people that had different arguments and i think it 's very important that we are aware of everyone 's perspectives not just you know on the street you know those meetings are very important with that though uh we 'll put this motion to the boat um all those in favor and that 's carrick another switch foreign uh we 're ready to keep going so 5.2 the 119 for douglas road the recommendation is that council approves the material change of use development application for retirement facility overland described as locked 3 rp 729991 subject to the following approved drawings and or documents and the document goes on i can have a mover please councillors thomason seconded by councillor mcnewman councillor would you like to talk about it all um i think it 's a great idea it 's little bit forward for out shy moving forward and um and i think the real estate and the sheriff enrollment 's doing really well and there 's people that want to live up here so a retirement village um like this is a great idea thank you and i wish to speak against the motions any other comments from counsellors just myself um as we 've heard many times we 've had people in here telling us about the demographics of the shire and this is one area where i believe that we have been short and i think it 'll be a great success thank you i guess clearly there 's been a lot of work going for this sort of housing type um i am sad to see the destruction of a perfectly good pool that was there but i know we 're currently working on a solution for that issue and the benefits of this development far outweigh that as this critical stage of our economical development 19 happens because developments such as this we have seen are needed so that we 'll put it to debate all those in favor and that 's very unanimously thank you let 's change staff and we 'll get counsellor knowledge we 're not changing stuff we 're stuff right so the next one the minor change to development approval for the secret van of the lebanon warner street uh the recommendations council approves the minor change to development approval for material change of use shop over land described as lock 37 on ptd 2091 subject to the following conditions which are in the document but to have a move for that please councillor knowley seconded by councilman got in there anyone against any further comments yes thank you on the 29th of september the original report i it was too onerous so i 'm very happy that they have been given an extension thank you thank you um we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor [Music] okay thank you all right so 5.4 application should change mcuc short-term accommodation auxiliary facilities at 20 water street fort douglas uh the recommendation is that council approves the amendment to the existing development permit for a material change of use a short-term accommodation motel with auxiliary uses for food and drink outlet bar overland previously described as lock one and rp seven one eight eight nine six part of block one on sp two six seven eight three eight and these means b and c on sp one five four five seven nine and currently describes lot one on sp sp316373 and easement b on c on sp one five four five seven nine whereby the conditions which are here in that i 'm happy to move this one if i 'm not second up cancel some of them as i said i 'm happy to move this which is a minor amendment to an original that the amendment is within the planning scheme and not only is it 's only a small change from the original approval that was moved at the time by councillor lloyd and councillor nolly back in december 2019 and was carried unanimously by councils unfortunately then i don 't recall it being called a high-rise building but anyway this change will allow them to put in a pergola covered plunge pool with disability access which really is common sense to be some smart water conscious these days um i 'd like to thank the planning staff for their logical thinking again for providing a detailed report which clearly shows why they have recommended for councillors to approve this change which ensures compliance with the planning act 2016 and satisfies the benchmarks of the 2018 douglas shire planning scheme anyone like to speak against the motion i think any further comments questions second thank you council um if we didn 't approve the recommendation today uh it would not actually change the capacity of the american hotel with it no it doesn 't change the number of rooms anything like that is over just over a year ago was there anything this nature was any indication that something like this would ever come back to council did they want to do this originally uh and it was suggested by the planners not to or was any indication they had an inquiry originally before the application that 's lodged to put a pool or some facility on the roof area yeah and it was a much deeper pool so hence it had a much higher impact i had concerns with them because they had not put in all abilities access and have really pushed them to consider that hence the lift well is where it is situated on the boundaries so that has to go up to that height and you need a covering on that lift world to ensure good safe access they still have one step and and will need to look at some ramping to get a better abilities access to the pool area there was concern that it didn 't have any sort of outdoor recreation truly outdoor so they have sort of married this in it 's traveler that doesn 't have baggage that doesn 't really want to hang around the pool as we normally do so it 's a different model of accommodation short-term accommodation than what we 're used to in effect it 's trying to utilize some of that roof area it 's not really intended to expand much further than that given that they 'll put some solar on the back part and you know it 's a small area so they had looked at it but it was too difficult originally and we also had concerns on the ground floor about the maneuverability of vehicles because of the slope nature of that so we had a lot of technical engineering concerns without even looking at height for that first application hence it came in we had a lot of discussions about the ground floor that was resolved and that seemed to put aside the poor consideration are there any planning um obligations to have a cover over a pool so could they put the plunger in and not necessarily have to cover they could yes whenever we see a pool we people from south of anywhere i think you have a pool and you all like it we sort of say in the wet season it gets really hot um so you really need to have a cover we would recommend you know in any instance of some shade over pool areas some people do it by landscaping they can have palm trees that then have some shade over the pool but you know i don 't know many people will sit in the sun in a pool up here so it 's trying to explain to developers that any pool should have at least some covering or some shade on it it 's a bit like a bath otherwise and not very pleasant and doesn 't give people that protection and early you just said that a deeper pool would have had greater implications what what did you mean like on the whole building it would be on the whole building structure so they 'd have to go down and consume some level of area and reduce that area beneath that have a lot more plant equipment so it 's of shafts of vegetation that go through the stories and we were very pedantic at having individual balconies meeting that minimum size area for each unit so they have their own private balconies so this is a separate little area that i have and um it would add uh the convenience of the gold without about four meters high is that correct i think just under oh i 'd say it 's probably at the most it might be three three and a half you 've got a few steps up because it has the poor base of it there so you know it 's not a deep pool in any sort of sense and they 've tried to minimize it they 've tried to minimize where it is in the structure and marrying it into that uh if when they first put it they didn 't have the lift well as either going up and i said well you just can 't talk to me if you 're going to do that you know you have to have an all-abilities access to these communal areas and many years ago just a standard that we have thank you thank you 5.5 cycle network local government grant program 2021 yet stage 2 constructions [Applause] good morning thank you all right so our recommendation is for council to resolve to enter into a funding agreement with the state of queensland represented by the department of transport and main roads and the cycle network local government grants program for the qa2 mossman stage 2 construction contribute 50 towards the total project of cost of the project and to be allocated in the 21 22 budget and delegate authority under section 257 of the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to administer the apartheid matters if i could have a movement for that for this council zamantaran seconded by councillor just coming quickly there councillors avatara would like to speak to this oh through you may curse i think it 's a great idea it 's it 's um heading in the right direction the developing cycle way so i want to talk about enhanced tourism i 'd like to like us to see port douglas moss and port douglas develop over to do that anyone wish to speak against the motion any further comments by counsellors back to the vote for those in favor let 's carry you know okay swap sides again we 're going for 5.6 which is the douglas hockey association incorporated trustee permanent part of lot 92 sr 8 1 the recommendation is the council offer a trustee permit to the douglas hockey association incorporated over part of the lost 92 crown plan sr-81 muslims the term of one year from the date of execution maintained the external permit area utilizing the terms and conditions of the standard terms and edition document registered under dealings number seven one seven nine four zero one six four and also the state 's mandatory terms document registered under number seven one one nine three two nine three three police payments to be five hundred dollars per annum plus gst and of course delegates authority under section 257 the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to determine and finds any matters associated with the exemption of the trustee opponent if i can have a movement please for that i think it 's pretty straightforward it 's the the other thing i 'd like to ask is that is the hockey being looked after in the um new sports plan or coronation department they are yeah there 's definitely i 'm pretty much to speak against this motion any comments it 's just a question um october one year is there any reason why it 's just one year does it just bring in line with anything or um all those in favor the same stuff again all right so 5.7 we have the application for a permanent road closure over esplanade and jason to lock to rp 7248 three eight six four doubles and this is to delegate authority under 257 local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to execute a form part c as road manager advising the department of natural resources and minds and energy the council cannot authorize proposed permit road closure over the estimate in port douglas joining lot two on rp seven two four three eight six as were attached however it requests the uh dnr to consider an application under the authority under to section 257 local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalise any oral matters associated with this application i could have a mover on that one please i 'm happy to move that myself anyone seconded councilman thank you and this as the report states it 's just purely effective council can 't_``_3011.92 do it so we are giving permission so that the applicant can go to the states so um anyone wish to speak against the motion no but i do have a couple of questions um i understand absolutely what this report is about but i 'm just thinking about going forward i 'm guessing that this means that the adjacent land owner eventually wants to buy that piece of land has that been indicated or can he even make an application to buy that piece of land once it 's no longer a road is that how that can work through the chair um actual proposal in depth uh if then you approve it and purchase the land off then yes that part of the road so he automatically gets that piece something that we should be alarmed about i mean it 's on the hill we have had landslides that type of thing um any other comments from councillors with that we 'll put to the vote all those in favor and that 's like thank you good morning all right so we 've got financial report november 2020 the recommendation is the council notice the financial report the period ended 30th november 2020. if i can have a mover please councillor something seconded by council zamataro alpha thomason um no not really it 's just another good report done every month from finance it 's very informative so thank you anyone wishes to speak against the motion any other comments from councilwood council questions thank you um just one question really quick i think it just mentions that the depreciation is 227 000 under budget um so for my understanding is that uh eventually going to catch up before the end of the financial year or is that just because in the end we discovered that we didn 't need to budget that extra 2027 do you understand your question the end of the year it is based on when items are actually capitalized throughout the year so as they completed in process then the depreciation processes so it should catch up [Music] that 's it thank you any other comments that that will prove to vote then all those in favor and that is carrick you know thank you right so the next thing on the list is 5.9 tourism court douglas daintree annual and quarterly reports for nothing the recommendation of courses the council receives and notes the tourism court double state treaty annual report for 2019 2020 submitted in accordance with the resource and performance agreement between tpd and the douglas style council and receives and notes the tpd 's july to september quarterly activity report 22 2020 to 2021. if i could have a mover for that please councillor knowledge second by councillor zamatara council knowledge speaks the motion yes thank you um i cannot praise enough his organisation and i will continue to advocate for full funding to reinstate in next year and an unprecedented four-year contract awards to them in these uncertain times so tourism as a super as always a super strong board they now brought back their founding father and he worked smartly with his team douglas as the shire has received the highest consumer sentiment breaking rating breaking ranking in the world through destination think and douglas is the first shy to achieve eco destination certification tpd the and double shot has developed a great barrier with drive this is just a couple of things that have occurred over the last year um also in their report they highlight that this destination was traveling on par for the 2018-19 year for the first six months of that financial year and improved over the summer until covert 19 decimated occupancy and room rate so tptd has been doing and has has been doing has continued to do an excellent job so well done thank you no much to speak against the motion any further comments from councillors okay i will say yes it 's a fantastic report that they 've put together for us um you know and yes they were definitely traveling on par um but as we all know our crisis so what we 're trying to do is to build better and bigger and to do with our strategies uh with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carrick thank you good morning good morning right so 5.10 contract 2021-048 kilo transfer station resource recovery center the recommendation is the council resolves to award contract number 2021-05 kilo transfer station resource recovery center to environment builders property limited for the cost of uh 1 million 29 360 exclusives of gst and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to negotiate finalize and execute any and all matters in relation to this contract i can have a mover for that one please counsellous commission second advice councilman q1 councillor scotland did you wish to mention this thank you anyone speaking against the motion any comments from councillors councillor nolan that 's a question again thank you um i suppose uh where i 'm coming from with this question is reassurance there 's only one douglas uh submission the rest are fairly local and i given us some information but obviously we 're not the panelists counsellors that we cannot uh that the staff cannot recall submission um as the number one uh and you can 't just work through the whole process if you don 't find as much as possible without obviously the same things as you 're allowed to say if you could just speak through the reasoning why you decided really number one what my mind is that 's basically what i 'm asking please who the man um the process with the five tenders that we had now three out of the five were local um cans based yeah um pricing [Music] tender submission uh in program what was it work health and safety methodology of their works and their experience um bryants have been around since 1984 as a builder and they have been local they have nominated that they will use 75 of their contractors as local subcontractors um and that was part of the reason why they got a score i think 16 out of 20 for their uh local business um and the other percentage of say the um contract went to bronze question man when you say local subbies do you mean double shires local or cantaloupe that 's how they have nominated them in their tender submission as douglas douglas of course procurement is quite extreme and you know the regards to a great job in ensuring that we do as local as much as we possibly can there 's no other questions or comments we 'll put that onto the vote for those in favor and that 's way thank you all right 5.11 good morning [Music] amendment declaration of syrian water service area within douglas shire the recommendation is that council resolves to declare that the douglas shire council is the service provider for the provision of reticulated water and sewage services within douglas shire declare the revised maps attached to indicate that the surface areas within the coloured boundary relevant area for reticulated water and surrounding that think it 's fairly obvious that we double show our council up to be the provider for our articulate water and sewage i hope so i 'm not sure why we 're even actually from councillors would like to vote all those in favor and that 's carrick last on the list today 5.12 contractual water ultra filtration cartridges for water quality the recommendation is the council results in accordance with section 235 of the local government regulations 2012 to accept the single source quotation from tech type limited for an amount of 262 thousand four hundred and thirty dollars excluding gst for purchase of 52 of the quash cartridges targa 118072 pm50 is the model and that seeks council approval to award a contract for the purchase of the crushed cartridges from active tech provider unlimited and of course iii delegates authority and the chief executive officer in accordance with the local government act 2009 to negotiate finalise and execute any and more matters in relation to this contract or agreement i can have a movement please on that one councilman mcewen seconded by council of scottism council mcewen did you wish to speak to it all no well it 's a process and we 've only got one person we can buy it from so anyone to speak against the motion no um in the table three um we 've got other costs details and tba what costs for those social media that 'll be costs uh three chair uh that will be costs associated with the installation all right and giving them functionality just project costs do you know off the top that would be no i don 't uh but it 'll be within that budget there okay [Music] and that concludes today 's session there 's no closed sessions and the time is in live in mode two that we 're closing the meeting thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you so we had uh okay [Music] okay so we 're back into open session um just through the record council scholars and moved to go back into open cancelling a few and seconded that and it was the analysis decision to get back into open so 5.15 uh the motion reads that council zamatara has not engaged in open appropriate conduct however has offered to apologize that the fence was taken on the day and will attend further media training um if i have a mover please on that council thomason seconded by councilman mcewen all those in favor and that 's carriage all right 6.1 notice to repeal motion muslim golf course [Music] and of course this one is to repeal the resolution 5.7-2 of the ordinary meeting 20th of july 2020 which uh resolved the council after the purchase approves trustee permit there 's a lot of detail here so i 'll take this one as read um it 's for the most club not taking it on and going to section 3 being approved and management agreement please simple for lock 263 sr540 got 20 12 months with an option to extend into a management agreement up to a further two years to manage operations of the mossman golf course with the terms and conditions listed

government 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any and all matters associated with the above matter okay mover please uh anyone against the motion any other counsellors like to make comment questions thank you okay so a lot of stuff by saying about that my overall desire which is obviously simply [Music] until um uh you know basically like to to strengthen my understanding that this is the absolute best way that they are capable of dealing with this that they are not they have the expertise i would like to see their business cases possible and also what i would like to see to give me more confidence is um the financials from the combines club to understand how it actually uh had their troubles forthcoming please i 'm sure we can take that on notice obviously i actually asked this information i wasn 't going to bring it up i actually asked this information during our workshop on the 6th of october so you know i have actually asked before well we can certainly organize to get that information for councillors okay are you moving emotionally to change this motion then or well i i i find it i find it um difficult to feel i feel uneasy unless i can get this information i want this to succeed absolutely i hope and if i have this information i would feel much more easy making my uh decision because um you know it 's uh if i if i have then i have all the information i 'm being responsible as my job as a counsellor yeah through the chair um the club i spoke to the club in relation to the financial information from the boston golf club incorporated and they 're happy to give a deputation to the councillors um three months after um operating the process uh they believe that they the combined clubs in relation to an mou to make sure that the operations continue without disruption yes have they got a business case put together that we can have a look at through the chair they 've got a business case they 've got financial projections and they 're happy to provide that reputation to council at a later date okay but is it a later date then too late wouldn 't it be much more uh logical to provide us with this information to put me at ease about how this is all going forward before this starts i think councilman i mean we 've gone through this and the fact is that the combined club needs to get rid of it because doesn 't want didn 't want it but they are financially assisting as well as assisting work-wise with the new project um i believe that from the details the staff have gotten in investigations they 've done that we are in quite a safe place to move forward with this at the end of the day we are still going to own block of land you know worst case scenarios we can run it ourselves so subdivided so whatever the case may be in years to come but i have confidence from the committee that they are quite capable of running this golf club a lot of the financial issues they had were based upon the previous debts that were involved that are being paid out so it 's quite obvious you 've had discussions you have information all i 'm asking is some more information from myself as a counselor you have been the same workshops i have no i haven 't you 've obviously got more information i 've been to one workshop this has been taught and spoken about and i 've asked that information hasn 't been are you putting through emotional cancer and i wanted to change it okay all right thank you then i will i would like to defer until we have a business case and the financials on the commands club so basically i 'm deferring um this recommendation and some more information is there a second one we don 't have a second of the motion to the original one any further comments from counsellors with that we 'll put it to debates all those in favor of the motion and that 's carrying on the slip 6.2 our last one on the agenda we 'll wait for councillor and mckeown to come back okay 6.2 notice of repeal motion request for funding from port shorts film festival the recommendation is to repeal resolution 5.2-2 of the ordinary meeting on the 30th of june 2020 which resolved to provide a one-off funding of nine thousand dollars for port shorts for a live broadcast of the event to um to become to provide one-off funding of nine thousand dollars for court shorts for the purpose of a three-month campaign presenting the port shorts film festival on the digital platform template and delegate authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalise any minor amendments in relation to the funding of the port shorts film festival if i can have a move for that please counsellous commission seconded by the councillor mcewan just got in there council scotland would you uh explanatory the only thing i 'm not being technical savvy like i am um can you just give me a quick upload at number two about what they 're actually going to do over a three month period um as is my understanding it 's presented on a digital platform so it remains there for a three month period and within that time with each broadcast we have opportunities for our own advertising for um tpd advertising to queue advertising so it 's across the board it 's both sponsorship and payment to provide it on the platform okay yeah great fantastic anyone wish to speak against the motion any comments from the councillors yes i 'd just like to ask questions look i didn 't make it to the port shorts how successful was that between yep through the chair thanks for the question councillor um it was from an organizational point of view from their point of view and i can only speak from what i 've garnered from my discussions with another incredibly pleased given the covert situation the event ran really smoothly there were no numbers-wise i can 't give you the exact numbers through the gate it was um very popular though it was i think i meant the numbers of the actual family films it was a long program that went from about 4 30 in the afternoon to approximately 9 30 at night with a few intermissions and it was the best of the first programming so i think it was made up of two main parts and the second part would be the one that 's actually presented on the digital platform as is my understanding and was there a junior section with all known one day that didn 't happen this year through the chair again yes there was and music video too i believe but i can uh if needed i can get that information for you yeah i respect it was a great night from what i heard they sold out of tickets so they they 've got to pull up and see what they can get for covert um being the best of the shows that they showed were all the good ones and brought back you of the great ones of course there 's a fantastic part for john rumley as well showing what a few of the ones he 'd made so really good all right with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carrick unanimously thank you very much that concludes today 's meeting at 11 29 thank you very much for attending _"

    "text": "is [Music] so oh [Music] okay good morning everyone and welcome to this ordinary meeting with the shy council being held on tuesday 27th october 2012 that the ordinary region of council will be close to the public because of health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involvement of 19. the ordinary meeting council will be available to view by a large team on council 's website and will be available for others to watch at a later time i 'd like to acknowledge the cable energy people who are the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet today we 'd also like to pay respect to their elders but past present and merging and extend that respect to other indigenous australians who may be listening for watching this morning senator councillors [Music] [Music] i 'm elected board member of the muslim delta club incorporated i will be dealing with this conflict of interest by leaving the meeting while this medic is discussing very well thank you very much um i also account for the current [Music] although i have declarable conflict of interest i perception of bias because the fmp rock is a committee that represents local government therefore i will choose to remain in the meeting however i will respect the decision of the meeting on whether i can remain participate in this decision and therefore a reasonable personal trust decisions today a confirmation of the minutes uh for the ordinary meeting tuesday 29th september please all those the special meeting friday the 9th of october 2020 now we all right the contender items as listed it 's running 5.1 now the recommendation is that council adopt the interim longevity this report is something that people have been wondering waiting on for impact and look if i have a choice now someone asked me today could they quad bikes on the beach my answer would be no longer it 's been tradition for decades and decades and people have done it i think this is going out hopefully these this will stop people because i still get the complaints every day about cars driving when the beach is against the report any other comments from councils regarding this report i 'll have some questions first thing it says um in the important reports most of the actions containing this intervention plan will be funded by the queensland government racist assistant right i 'm just wondering is is is that okay within the grand guidelines to use the money for that grant for something like this it doesn 't have to be more specific again through their court council normally the grant application was put in place with this interim cultural management plan in mind so a number of the actions that will be funded from that grant were already determined when we put so we 're intending uh perhaps to issue fines if we find a consistent person breaching these things is that regulative framework worked within queensland laws is that how that works or we we made our own within the queensland plain words and how that works so we all have the authority one last cases and we will definitely produce yes the local laws are made under the local government they are law for all intensive purposes under the state um government no there are obviously different areas that are about this plan is that we 've had support from the police in terms of what is their responsibility and what is council 's responsibility and we want to manage this together okay um the other question i have is that i read how that the turtle nesting is going to be monitored i suppose is there a similar type monitoring we 're going to look at other environmental um um [Music] management plans for our four main beaches and then have a more generic plan that colors the beaches all the way through to the canyons boundaries as part of that there 's also the ability to acknowledge that it 's privileged by right to use on the beach and that 's what 's going to happen and there 's probably some trade-off consumer environmental values there but the intent for the future plans at the other locations is to ensure that certainly those values are protected at those beaches so there 's some beaches towards cairns which have um vehicles driving on them at the moment intent continues to restrict any vehicle access to those uh beaches and favorable [Music] and we intend to work with general rangers and [Music] yes thank you very much it covers the ongoing issues as well this has been a contentious in various opinions um i think it 's a smart and sensible approach towards this and you know i certainly hope that the community will get the client as well so then sorry i realized um this is definitely at the moment a one year proposal to see how things go um are there any intentions uh to bring back to councils in the council but maybe [Music] um obviously that 's the intent is that there will be some reporting council about um this is intended it 's not absolutely exhausting it 's intended to be an insurance plan as it 's called um a more thorough plan to be developed through the root assist grant program um and we would expect that some of the outcomes from this insurance plan would be addressed in a more resourcing plan all right with that uh we 'll put it to the note of all those in favor and let 's carry planning skill policy [Music] um [Music] and it 's great to see these you know all the councils any further comments okay 5.3 water and west with a quarterly report engine september 2020 the recommendations that it recommended period if i could have [Music] anyone wish to speak against the motion any further comments from the answers regarding this report all right it 's a very detailed reward thank you very much thank you 5.4 monthly financial reports september 2020 the recommendation is the financial report of the period of 2020 that 's happening on us but it 's something very early in the year and also let 's see what happens as we move forward any other questions or comments from councillors names would you like to say something um for you i think it 's all it 's all pretty self-explanatory um um we were 77 000 ahead with the ferry at the end of august that 's dropped down um now to 38 thousands but coming back in and um and we 're just having a look at our stats to where we 're up to today low even though we like these unfortunately a lot of those were international tourists usually so i 'm really very closely with that area that we 'll be able to embrace that revising the issues that continues to fall and continuously high budget we 've actually got a government preferred breakfast um cpa that 's 0.5 above the rba race so well that funds are all back in operating account to check that and so they 're probably the high risk areas i guess um it would be nice to have a crystal ball unfortunately [Music] [Music] um please [Music] [Music] um 5.6 boston state high school annual presentation 2020 request a sponsorship the recommendation is that council provide muslim state advice will be 500. against the exclusive cash has uh gold sponsored on the 18th november 2020 and delegates section 257 [Music] um i am technically employed by the department of education not even one high school i don 't know what worked in school yes is um i 'm very happy with this but i do have just one very quick question um mr farrelly um because of can 't make this an ongoing thing like a three-year term or something like that is that is that correct because otherwise i suggest you just make it like a pretty good term or something like that believe it through the chant that is correct because i remember doing this last year okay 5.7 the department of affordable committee the recommendation is the council appoint dr martin mcfady as the independent [Music] um um um is this is pretty um all right 5.8 is the christmas period shut down the recommendations the council resolves to nominate a close-out period between 20 has been in the closed business thursday 24th december 2020 should start [Music] [Music] 5.9 of the investigation policy the recommendation is in accordance with s150 ae the local [Music] uh um through the chair um um been with the changes of legislation from the shelter so it relates to um anything to do with a council advisor which we don 't have in our council in parts of the code um [Music] still has the control over those things you know i understand that [Music] h2 of the hearing means a counselor who is the subject of suspected inappropriate conduct at that paragraph must be told the case against and including any evidence and be provided an opportunity to put their case in light into the investigation report provided to the councillors as part of the leading agenda um so that all comes that just means everything comes to council meeting incomplete before the everything comes to the council has completed the agenda so the next page very first paragraph says just a mayor or a counsellor with any recommendation accompanying their assessors or form the opinion that the client should be governed in a way other than under this policy the mayor will house my requester manual placed on the agenda of the next does that mean that we have to is thank you [Music] now the next page under the completion of investigation the investigation behavior essentially i must provide a report to the council meeting with the appropriate bits and pieces as the dot points there and so my understanding is that those drop points do not include an opinion of the guilt or the but there 's no opinion given about what the client did by the councillors would have separated um through the freedom that would be interpreted investigators [Music] doesn 't give the investigator the authority to give an opinion about what the uh yeah about whether what the um correct finding will be the correct finding would be found by the councillors and then that would if i understand that the recommendation will be on what the finding is let 's go to the chair so the recommendation will come through from the investigator um if council fear not i think the council 's did not agree with their recommendations [Music] um um any other comments and cancels 5.1 which was the annual report um and which that was recommended that you had s182 the government regulation council adopted the

council chambers here you 've noticed that in accordance with section the local government regulations 2012 that the special meeting of council will be closed the public because of health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involving david 19 and for those that are requiring this is a state requirement of course it 's not just being made by council [Music] um of course this meeting will be viewed by a live stream on council 's website which will also be available at a later date to watch and it 's also being recorded on audio and that can also be posted to council 's website video issues through power outages etc all right i 'd like to acknowledge the cooking allowance people who are the traditional custodians of the land and which we meet today i 'd also like to pay respect to their elders where the past you may be listening to watching our meeting this morning now that all councillors are here of course we have a ceo and a finance staff there 's no conflicts of interest because there 's only one item today which is the financial statements um so we can move on to the writing which is 3.1 uh the financial statements of june 2020 uh the recommendation of courses the council adopts the financial statements the year ended june 2020 and the mayor and chief executive officer be authorised to execute the management sustainability statements accordingly i 'm quite happy to move this one if i can have a second please that 's wisconsin um all the documents are here of course to be reviewed by the public though of course thank you to the ceo of course and um as some people have said it 's quite a hostile environment as far as financials are concerned and i think that will continue throughout the next couple of years [Music] yes thank you i 'd just like to ask a few very basic type of questions maybe i suppose uh the later on um and i think it 's just important to understand the first question that i have i 'd like you to explain a little bit further really about i suppose the impact and how it has affected this council both through lost revenue and house expenditure would you mind just perhaps look into that a little bit please questions i just wanted to thank the ceo of management normal publisher council staff who assisted with the awards and the special thank you to the finance and corporate services team we 've been a great deal of work and team nicholson and sandingtop for managing the order process and preparation of financial statements they worked tirelessly for months under additional constraints due to cover 19. we 're very pleased with the outcome of the audit council 's issues and there are only two recommendations for the current year which has been already being actioned and will be finalized before the commencement of the next quarter the external launches maintain audit office qao have known that frame to address the risks presented by altered working arrangements in place like 19. and digitalisation the final qao management level will be taken at the next transformation and to answer questions questions the final operating result for 2020 is 828 353 the deficit varies from the revised budget of 86 915 um surplus due to the impact of the growth of 19. the variation from budget equation to two percent of the operational revenue the impact on the operating results due to code 19 is approximately 1.3 million dollars his impact was primarily due to lost revenue restrictions on travel and council financial relations we 'll continue to monitor the impacts of 2019 closely i prepared a summary that was shared with the councillors to go through some of the major impacts over 19 the largest impact was on the fees and charges and the biggest of those was the in-house very revenue the revenue of lobster reduction in travel not including the labor of fees was 606 000 and the revenue loss due to our labor fees was 1000 other impacts and other measures taken by council which and the measures of relief are outlined in the focus over the notes with as we refunded some licensing activities there was a loss of um revenue for the pullman band park we lost um so on page 24 of our gender is 0.6 the employee benefit there seems to be a big difference between one after you mind just going through that and why that has occurred yeah so in 2019 there were a number of unknown positions so that was um um there were some additional positions um but um there was also a um [Music] so once again you look one year to the next seems to be a big variance could you just work through that why why that happened yeah so if you look at it also at note 11 yeah it 's just about where our cache was actually held at a point in time so you can see we 've got a lot in note 10 as cash bank on hand rather than internal deposit and notice these terms and cultures that are greater than three months so they need to be investments rather than um cash with cash equivalents so um we 've basically been moving so we 've actually um recently pulled the majority back into our operating account because we get a better interest rate on that deposits but um thank you that 's that 's for my questions i 'd just like to thank ms lee and your team um [Music] can get back to the community with relief in you know like businesses and in theory and things like that so it 's not as bad as what we 've been going to end up at the end of the day so look absolutely in comparison to some other councils i think that they 've done very well and hopefully that will continue to picture and i think from the answers of your questions that council knowledge and asking the shows staff are adapting very well to fix the situations as we move forward so with that we 'll put it to the vote for those in favor of the motion and that 's carried out and that is the end of our meeting at 9 10. thank you very much _"

september 2012 that an ordinary meeting council will be closed to the public health covered because of health and safety reasons associated i would like to acknowledge there could be atlantic people who are the traditional custodians of the land and which we mean today i would also like to pay respect to their orders for past present and mercy and extend our respect to other indigenous australians we may be visiting for watching our meeting this morning before we move on i think it 's important to recognise that this month the community lost a true hero and the pioneer of the great area of conservation command was left a legacy that would no doubt live on forever mr john romney aged 70 suffered a stroke earlier this month and passed away a few days later the fourth douglas face conservationist who for more than three decades dedicated his life to sacramento great barrier reef originally wanted to see the great diary when he arrived at what that was since then john had been on a constant journey investigating documenting preserving the great barrier reef it was through this work research and understanding the belief that has resulted in the great protections and conservations we have today john 's list of selfless participation in communities committees meetings lobbying and appearing in countless documentaries happening but most importantly he was a leader and a trusted voice in all regional related matters john 's most recent passion was his joint venture with dr dean since 2016 the foundation has brought together many of the best scientific minds educators and multimedia specialists already successful in raising over a million dollars in the last four years gpr legacy has now launched concert plans for the world 's first living coral biomanc project which will see hard coral species stored and kept alive in the state of our bodies of importance ensuring their survival for generations to come this project catches closer to reality each month and i 'm sure john will be watching for this project as it comes to employees i 'd like to offer updates from top condolences to john 's white linda his family and friends and ask that you 've joined me in event science and remember and acknowledge the life of them and one that you surely practices thank you he 's a i 'd also like to acknowledge those national police statements as well also pay tribute to those officers who lost their lives protecting the rights of others unfortunately so we 'll go on to attendances and apologies and that 's all cancelled here across the ceos here our media and of course here um in relation to the 1999 agenda i declare that i have a material personal interest in this matter as defined by local government act 2009 section 175b as follows gregory kuhn owner by the fixed moscow and states to gain benefit will suffer a lot depending on the upcoming council 's consideration of this matter my relationship to greg is he is my son i will be dealing with this material personal interest by leaving the meeting [Music] [Music] will receive [Music] delegates authority under section 2579 [Music] minutes tuesday 25th august 2018 captain seconded canceled that was in favor okay so move on to the agenda items um the first one is 5.1 the recommendations this council agrees to develop an application for material changes this shock has described prop 3791 subject to obamacare drawings for documents three months within one year the reason behind that is i don 't want to make the habit of having traders [Music] [Music] um okay so obviously this is your reasoning just but off the top of my head i would be thinking perhaps three months might be a little bit difficult to carry out with things perhaps a little bit about more information from our offices about if they think that three months is a sufficient time for someone to do this type of thing if that 's is [Music] [Music] his application [Music] um three months is probably [Music] very temporary i think the original recommendation of one year was soon as the officer who made the recommendation as as kendrick um kind of increases the [Music] if you look at the area that was taken into account still was not things um the planning process if it does [Music] move to three months still has to go through a process where he has i think it 's quite wrong again [Music] to change the conditions so that adds to the three months so in fact at least probably four months um um stop um look um my feeling is that in the report it was acknowledged this one year was already temporary one year isn 't a long time uh i believe that three months doesn 't give this person enough time and i agree that they don 't want um [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] is [Music] 257 molly um in this shower this period of time and uh last year was a success and i can 't see what success again this year especially the local tourism [Music] 5.3 trust me to see [Music] [Music] improvement is not required by the business to demonstrate predictions on businesses and activities [Music] the implemented measures should be site specific and relevant to appearances [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

to please councillor i 'm very pleased to meet this motion of course lost council was in caretaker mode over the election period as we all know covered 19 struck throwing this region as well as this

have a look at that online and check out everything that was done over the 40 days 49 it 's just absolutely brilliant um with that we 'll put it to the votes all those in favor and that 's carried now this one okay 5.4 called the running tide resource and performance agreement uh of course that is the council enters into a three-year resource and performance agreement with port douglas artistic inc for the call of the running tide with fifteen thousand ten thousand years exclusive in year two with in-kind support including you support douglas community hall moscon shirehole and park event for the pre-event workshops and also delegates authority to the chief executive officer under section 257 of the local government 2009 to administer matches associated with the above if i could have a mover for that please thanks second up yeah i think this is a great um event for the community i 've just got one question as well with it is that um i agree with the uh i support the funding that they 're asking for the only thing is with covert 19 if the if we 're in the same situation next year when they want to hold the event is it possible that we can defer the funding until they can actually be able to show their uh when they can do their event should we look to advice on the staff for that one chair i think we 've been um anyone like to speak against the motion not against but i 'd like to have some discussion please okay then any other um the resource agreement um we 'll call the running guide fantastic uh event last year the organizers themselves are very very capable i 'd just like to bring up a discussion point about the quantity of money provided historically council has had kind of capped our agreements at about ten thousand dollars um and i just wanted to talk about whether that should be also thought about for this um event as well they have received quite a lot of money for that um and if it 's it 's still it will still support a lot through in-kind through money as well and i 'm just wondering if perhaps we should really think about our budget very wisely in these difficult times whereas if we say 10 000 from this event over three years it would actually possibly go to another event resource and another event just like to bring up that as a consideration for counsellors please understand that i absolutely support this event it 's just i 'm just wondering if that is the correct amount that we should be looking at so are you looking to to i would put the motion forward to change it if it 's the only way to continue the discussion otherwise we just discuss this amongst ourselves and see what the feeling is for the other i mean if no support or no discussion then i won 't get the motion forward but i just like to discuss it so it 's up to you how you want to do it now we 're sticking to the standing orders with any other council like to speak to that something else i thought we discussed it pretty thoroughly at the time and um you know they 're after the 15 each and we reduce one back to five um i just thought we came to a consensus center oh we 've got to watch our dollars but um i thought we 'd been through this okay so council and i 'll let you guys put a motion up for it i think we can take it to a vote from what i 'm hearing for the other councillors no not particularly i wanted to discuss it it obviously doesn 't the workshop that 's one yeah okay let of course it 's discussion with that they 'll take it to the vote then all those invited the motion that 's carried unanimously [Music] okay 5.5 in-kind assistance post-covert 19 event strategy the recommendation is that uh council provide in-kind support for use of venues and wave application fees for events as part of a post code 19 economic and event recovery strategy to the amount of eight thousand two hundred and sixteen dollars for knockout events for the wonderland under the stars and two thousand five hundred and eight plus fifteen hundred dollar security bond for festival amusements mini fund fair uh two delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 the chief executive officer to finalize any minor amendments in relation to these applications if i could have a mover please for that one i cancel the knowledge any other comments i think it 's a great idea you know we didn 't get a mossman show this year because of cobot and i think this is a little bit of a bonus for the community put it to the vape all those in favor and that 's carried meaninglessly we have 5.6 funding support for the better together conference 2022 the recommendations council to resolve to provide one off funding of ten thousand dollars cashing in kind assistance of waiving and entire fees for sugar for the better together conference to be held in february 2022 and delegates authority under section 257 the local government act 2009 for the chief executive officer to finalise any minor amendments in relation to the funding and in-kind support for the better together conference i 'm happy to move this one if i can have a secondary please councillor swimmerson they said i 'm very happy to move this motion um one thing the report doesn 't mention is that it 'll also be a joint venture with kansas regional council they 'll also contribute into this um so it 'll be good to see us working together for an event which will have more than 400 people utilizing accommodation of businesses in both areas over the two-week period this conference will also coincide with the hot and steamy conference as the report says it states by encouraging attracting these types of events to double-shot the region can enhance its appeal as a conference destination as well as providing positive outcomes for the broader lgbtiq community the conference will be held also during traditionally low slow times of the year and given the event will be held during traditional wet season i think it 's a certainly a bonus to the area anyone like to speak against the motion any comments from councillors please i think it 's a great um a great um event for this community and i think with the funding of ten thousand dollars to uh promote our region is um money-wise with that i 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carriage money okay 5.7 naming of an unnamed road off captain cook highway another recommendation is the cap that council resolves to name the road of captain highway leading to gold coast marine agriculture the knoll herbs herbs road i can have a mover please depends on the cuban proposals that put forward and i just think and i can 't see any real issue with naming it as requesting anyone wish to speak against the motion so _"

    "text": "if everyone 's happy with that so you have you know that 's so the whole period is eight but we that we don 't take comments until people have actually had time to die there will always be comments i didn 't know i wasn 't given enough time take six weeks okay everyone 's happy that we 'll go back into standing orders um counselor knowledge did you wish to speak against the motion you did speak before regarding the deferment yes thank you very much yeah i have a few concerns about the the public consultation as written there and they 're quite similar to councillor zamataras first of all is it clearly states in the first first page that basically we 're going out to public consultation but when it comes back to council that information can be disregarded by counsellors so we can then vote whatever the hell we want sorry for that yes i apologize whatever we want um so this is his concern it begs the question why go to consultation if it comes back under counsellor 's discretion so that 's my community meetings that they are there 's a restriction on rsv rsvp um that it means that the well-organized public will probably are respectfully in attend but as we know most of the public i 'd like that uh and also in the public meetings the point is that there 's only five speakers may be allowed and they are decided by the special counsel so is that really full and transparent uh democratic process happening uh we spoke about the consultation time i was i was unhappy with that with the gazette no longer being around i think there 's the ability of many residents to not be informed in time and then provide that feedback but we were explaining about that um so yeah so for for these reasons i have a little concern about the consultation process as it is i understand we 're going to go back out to consultation and that is fine i accept that i 'm just wondering if we have to we have to as uh councillor mcewan said get this right why don 't we just calm it down take out report by and bring it out as one document can uh council mckeown just said it yourself thank you thank you councillor nolan just response to that um edu state councillor zamotaro the whole purpose of having council 's final decision as it states in there is because there are lots and lots of different stakeholders and that will give us the choice of saying you live here you get more percentage you don 't live here you know we can wait at ourselves we are the councillors that make the decision based on the information that comes back to us and how we vote in this room is how it ends up through the waiting process which i think is extremely important in this whole the rsvp you know i myself was disappointed because of the small amount of people that can go to the meetings but we 're in copenhagen we can 't working about that so we 've changed to have as many meetings as necessary so if someone 's that desperate to speak they can certainly make time to go to another meeting and they can as well so i 'm more than happy with the consultation in the form that it is with the amendment that we 're making to have a six-week period after two-week period so with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor of the motion council mckeown mr scotland council occur all those against councillor noli councillor zamatara the motions passed [Music] we 'll then go on to 5.9 just type this catch up okay 5.9 proposed amended schedule of fees and charges 20 20 21 recommendation is the council one adopts the amended section of the schedule fees and charges for the 2021 financial year for the cemetery services caravan parks and campgrounds and flagstaff hill and two delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to negotiate fees and charges where circumstances warrant and to make minor administrative amendments to the schedule i can have a mover please for this councillors seconded by council mcewen councillors thomason just wish to speak to it no it 's all good explains itself quite well thank you anyone against motion i just have a question thank you um i 'll just want to uh do you have um on you uh killing the loss of the revenue because we 're not increasing the fees and for the flagstaff here that we 'll put the motion to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.10 the financial report july 2020 the council notes the financial report for the period ending 31st of july 2020. um if i could have an uber please i 'm happy to move that and second is well we 've got the attached reports thank you very much mrs clean and your team for the information um it 's all very self-explanatory we 're getting used to these very detailed reports now that cover a lot of the areas and it 's very easy to read it 's just fantastic i think i wish to speak against the motion any other questions from counsellors guardian councillor nolan thank you um i 'll just uh what 's in the report says the daintree ferry revenue currently 31.1 000 ahead of budget it 's july by 50 for the private impact um what 's that sorry just i 'll just talk me through this was that reduction in the original budget that we uh that we um voted for back in june is that is that where the reduction was like that was it yes because we already knew about the code yeah yeah through the mayor yes um you know we had to make assumptions and it was quite early in the piece obviously when we were doing the budget and we budgeted monthly and at this stage we had um estimated in that the budget that was approved um that the daintree ferry revenue would drop by 50 for july 50 for august and i think 25 for september um so we are slightly ahead based on our 50 but september may not be as we thought it would be and it will open and everything fine so um it 'll be interesting to see how it plays out thank you i thought it was during the budget option sure thank you that was my question thank you any other comments or the vote then all those in favor and let 's carry unanimously 5.11 uh 2021 internal audit plan uh the recommendation is that council endorsed the strategic internal order plane financial year 2020 2022 i 'm just going to double check to make sure that 's correct is it 2020 to 2022. um and the annual internal water plan for the financial year 2021 has presented okay the movement police councillor nollie seconded by councillor zantara okay 5.12 operational plan progress report for period april to june 2020 the recommendation is the council notes the progress of the implementation of the operational plan 2019 to 2020. if i could have a mover for that one please i 'll get good um feedback from these reports because they 're you know um very readable for the people and um well done again thank you anyone wish to speak against the motion any comments from councillors thank you um i 'd probably just like to bring up one major thing it 's um it 's about theme form which talks about inclusive engagement planning and partnerships and in particular goals goal two future of our communities and we will ensure balanced and private planning decisions points two and three so they talk about developing a mossman 2025 master plan and strategy and point three develop a thirty year danger community plan um i 'd just like to talk about i think the importance of those um so i 'm going to kind of speak about these plans they haven 't happened or haven 't really started and why i believe that these plans are really important to occur before the ferry bridge debate and um we could continue with one of the options of personal danger fairy without first finishing these plans the dangers that council and douglas will face because lack of planning strategies and due diligence could i 'm not going to spend a huge amount of time on development this morning i just want to start the discussion and ponder questions that perhaps haven 't_''_695.04 been asked up until now um so one strategy that we would be looking at in douglas but specifically muscle endangering in these strategy plans would be increasing the tourist dollar because the most increased tourist dollars comes with tourism on their multi-day stays and these people who spend money on accommodation food experiences this generates employment in the shire which is a multiple effect out throughout the supply chain the least valuable tourist is a day tripper or worse still one that just passes through looks at the vehicle the wind doesn 't drive by so these strategies i suppose one of their their ideas would be to to decrease the day tripper and get them multiple day stays now uh what we don 't want is what the type of situation that happens up and down the highway from brisbane to uh to cairns is that you have a highway and then people drive past the towns and cities that you know needs to stop in now we don 't stop anymore so we need to look at visitation it 's an important distinction from traffic so increasing traffic in mossman and if we pull out this discussion at the moment just for the moment is not increasing visitation two separate things okay and i think we really really need to look effect because i am concerned that a bridge will just increase through traffic because what we 're going to do is we 're going to create a hub and camp and cook down and we can have these bypasses now this can all be worked out for a cva a cost benefit analysis for those who do not know what a cba is it 's a type of economic analysis that evaluates and determines two or more options uh in the best interest of the community it can compare all types of things building costs congestion costs environmental costs and it can all also compare different types of benefits time saving financial jobs environmental social well-being and you can also look at through traffic compared to visitation monetary spending in the shire when traffic conditions change so i would just like to say that these two strategies for most men in daintree are very very important to me to happen i believe before we go any further about the bridging ferry debate thank you because my job as a council is to look after the entire shy and make sure just pointing out that thank you thank you councillor any other councillors like to speak towards it go for the positive first sorry if you 're going for them no no boys sorry man i just like to make a comment i 've received some very good feedback that i think was finished from there it was initially from the previous council couple years ago the bilingual signed signing in the welcome countryside have been really well accepted and i 'm glad to see that in progress and that 's all the comment i wanted to make about that i 've had some really good feedback on that thank you council zamatara cancer commerce and sorry i agree with um council linole and some of the stuff she has just said and it 's true and as i 've always pointed out that um we have a lot of day trippers that come through mossman because we 've really got nothing here for muslim for them to stop and see so that 's i think it 's important that we need to look at um different um avenues where we one thing about the cobra 19 mosman 's done very well out of coba daunting in especially a lot of the smaller businesses and which is really positive for the shire and it really shows that yeah we can provide the service that these day trips want it would be great to have people to stay more than one night here double night but unfortunately mossman doesn 't really have much to offer them on that side so i think that 's something we should look forward to as a council to try and get the day trippers in the multi-nature business here in mossman and i think north of the river they have their uh plan well there but unfortunately some of the businesses are closed because they 're covered at this stage so i just think that 's something we should look in our future plans on from osmium absolutely could be agreed more especially i mean we 've got the streetscape in this operational plan to look for mossman exciting operators so that 's good to see i know we 've got a local group that 's and an indigenous operations building we 've got of course botanical gardens we 've got the bio mill um i believe they 're talking about possibly looking at tours again so the more things that we can do in moscow to create the reason for people to stop the better that 's absolutely balanced so it 's the actual operational plan you know of course he got kicked by code of 19 which you know may produce some of the projects but for a small council we certainly battled through a lot of these and this ceo and the staff need to be commended for everything that we did get done in a financial year so with that i 'll put it to the boats all those in favor and that 's carried you know honestly okay so that ends our open session so we have got time to read them two items _"

    "text": "yes all right so that 's 10 o 'clock so good morning everyone and welcome to this special meeting of douglas shire council being held on monday 10th of august 2020 at the moscon council chambers i hereby give notice that in accordance with section 277e of the local government regulations 2012 that the special meeting of council will be closed to the public because of health and safety reasons associated with the public health emergency involving covert 19. for those that are inquiring this is a state requirement and it 's not a decision that has been made by council we only have a small room here unlike some other councils that have larger chambers and due to that it only allows us to safely have less than 20 people in the room at one time appropriately socially distanced between councillors required staff and media that feels there are limitations we cannot be complacent about this virus whilst it may not be in the forefront and present with us today there is nothing to say it won 't be here tomorrow next week or next month it is following future the special meeting of council will be available to view via live stream on council 's website and will be available for others to watch at a later time i 'd like to acknowledge the cookie yolanji people who are the traditional custodians on the land on which we meet today i 'd also like to pay respects to their elders both past present and emerging and extend that respect to other indigenous australians who may be listening or watching our meeting this morning i see all councillors are present thank you very much there and we 've got our ceo here and of course thank you to staff um and there 's no apologies for today any conflicts of interest that would like to be brought forward so we 'll go on to the agenda items as listed starting from 3.1 lot 83 sr 596 cape tribulation road sale of land the recommendation is the council resolves to delegate its power to pursuant to section 257 and 262 the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to sell lot 83 sr 596 cape tribulation wrote to sale price of 725 000 exclusive gst the purchase price council paid for the land in october 2019. authorised as the chief executive officer to delegate the exercise of the powers contained in the attachment to instruments of delegation to councils legal services to act on behalf of council for all sale negotiations and then to enter the sale of contract on behalf of council in regards to this sale and to delegate authority 100 section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any and all associated matters with this purchase i 'm happy to move this if we can have a secondary police council of scottism um i 'm happy to move this motion because it will allow two very accomplished organizations with the assistance and approval of jaba bina to complete some very exciting environmental projects on this block of land this block of land while contentious in its purchase by council to many late last year has highlighted the need for further consultation within the wider on their want for the environmental projects that this council involves itself in at who fund these projects for me this is another situation of a win-win for our shire important and exciting environmental works can occur in this pristine area of the daintree and the money originally used to purchase this block of land returned in full to the ratepayers now with the clean slate this council can look forward towards the community consultation that it has planned and get an absolute reading on how what where and how much our rate payers wish to use of their money in this arena with that would anyone like to speak against the motion council zamatara ah thank you sri maker look i 'd just like to make some points council purchased lot 83 agreed to purchase on third of october 2019 and it was uh i just agreed to add it was an anonymous decision by the previous council and the decision to purchase a lot of 83 was made i suppose in part because a resolution by council department of qantas and purchasing land also their carbon footprint was criticized by some and the majority of the main reason for that criticism was this would prompt the council to make a decision to buy land locally and we were successful in buying lot 83 and the decision was guided to an extent by council 's own corporate plan namely if you look at theme 3 titled leading environmental stewardship and in that the goals that include were protect our sense of environment plan for the impact of climate change we will implement programs that reduce and offset our environmental footprint we will recognize the contribution that traditional owners make to the protection of the environment the reason we 've been asked to consider selling this land are all initiatives that were discussed by councillors the reason for buying by industry in the first place you know these points include all the say in the report the nature reserve conduct nursery operations engage with traditional owners conduct range of training and learning activities with double winner and they 're things that resonate with their own corporate plan in the last two election campaigns i 've clearly stated my commitment to the preservation and environment my commitment reducing council 's carbon footprint so i 'm my commitment by by agreeing to bilateral history i 'll not be agreeing with satellite 83 as this is a perfect opportunity in my overview for financial gain or trading in carbon credits and for one showing links to showing leading environmental stewardship which i think is part of our corporate plan which we agreed to we all agreed that thank you thank you council zamataru um any other councillors like to speak to this uh yeah i just think i 'm in in repeating some of the words that you said that it 's a win-win for for everyone we 're giving the parceling to a corporation that 's going to um put some employment back in for the local general winner group we 're also handing it over to a corporation that 's going to specialise and specialises in this area and the ratepayers get their money back it would be at least weekly that someone comes in my shop and asked me to sit down and ask what we 're going to do with the block i don 't think it was a popular decision so i areas of the parks gardens roads etc like that would probably be more beneficial so i do support it thank you councilman if there 's no further comments then with cancer knowledge thank you so i 'll be obviously speaking again selling this because i think we haven 't actually explored all the different possibilities quite yet there will be three parts to my argument as to why i believe this recommendation in my opinion is not the best outcome for this gland i will argue that this proposal does not fulfill the strategies policies aims commitments and yes promises made by this council i will also argue that this does not assist the people of douglas to the fullest extent possible for eco-tourism promotion of the shire i will also demonstrate how in my opinion accepting this recommendation will actually not be consultative on revenue raising possibilities for this piece of land we haven 't actually explored that very well yet firstly how this recommendation does not meet our strategies policies and aims let 's look at the douglas shy council sustainability strategy at the moment we 're still an update which will come later in this year in the new strategy i am having the assumption that the preamble the aims and the attitude would expect to be very similar now i 'm going to just read a little bit of an extract from the current strategy that we use at the moment the corporate sustainability strategy recognises council 's commitment to the protection of the natural environment and the importance of developing and integrating sustainable for a suitable sustainable environmental practices across council operations now there are six uh strategies or principles one preserve and restore the natural environment two utilize resources efficiently and i 'm going to add to that this means the best possible outcome three protect and enhance the biodiversity four monitor and reduce council 's environmental footprint this is our strategy strength number five strengthen council 's resilience to climate change and six display strong environmental leadership furthermore in an extract from the plan it is stated that climate change is a change in the pattern of weather and related changes in ocean land services and ice sheets occurring over a period of mitigation of climate change by monitoring and reducing its environmental footprint it 's there in black and white it also says in this strategy the council will do this by calculating a carbon footprint baseline calculating a carbon footprint will then help council to quantify the impact that our operations have in the natural environment and will provide a benchmark for future reductions in addition it will help council to identify and prioritize effective opportunities to reduce its environmental impact it 's written into our strategies it 's written into our corporate plan as councillor um democrat said theme three our corporate plan says and that 's the another four years says we are leading environmental stewardship goal 2 says we will implement programs that reduce and offset our environmental footprint okay we 're not doing this if we sell this land that 's the first part of my argument secondly i believe we will be ignoring a huge opportunity for revenue opportunity for council a little a little bit of extra history added to what councillors in the car had said the land was purchased by unanimous decision now was first discussed dfn was always part of that discussion don 't think that they have they 're gonna come to lightnings okay uh and utfn always talked about being able to have some kind of input into the cost of the land so the recovery of the land cost was always part of the equation and that was something that made me very excited about being able to purchase this land the original letter from qtfm or the original i should say statement in general from qtfn said they would like to resolve we would like to contribute financially in whole or in part to the purchase and rehabilitation of blood 83 in the understanding this is part of a revolving fund to replicate lot 83 uh acquisition and other private sites and others and possibly out elsewhere the offer do not preclude council using part of the land and so council does not have to sell to make or receive a benefit we 're at five minutes cancel and knowledge thank you thank you um um i i appreciate that this is a as you said it was me to continue thank you now unfortunately we haven 't actually explored the idea that there might be a possibility to rehabilitate the land and have a revenue raiser carbon credits we haven 't explored voicing there is actually a way to make money and near the council if we sell the land we cannot look at the possibility of making revenue lastly i 'd like to talk about the environment and douglas council 's uh stewardship and how it 's one of the five pillars of our corporate plan in short i believe but i mean everyone believes that douglas is the environment and its environment is what makes stanford special and unique i 'm going to read out a few media releases from this council over the last couple of two years an eco-tourism wave could help council shire businesses and tourism operators happen to rapidly growing international markets this is from 2018. douglas shiner julia loy said the tourism industry needs to commit to the highest possible environmental standards to make the most of this international visitors want more authentic and sustainable travel travel experiences she said now we have a real chance to members across the globe and draw more birds and visitors in eco accreditation is a clear and recognizable brand that shows the world we practice leading environmental standards dpdp executive officer tara banner said that global tourism wholesalers report an increase in demand for sustainable and authentic experiences used in their clients these sellers are now actively looking for the eco accreditation brand now as we all know in december of last year just a few not that many months ago the douglas region had became the world 's first destination to be awarded the ecotourism australia eco destination certificate um the eco destination certification through its rigorous auditing process process sets the douglas shy and its unique natural experiences apart from everywhere else to become certified you have to meet a minimum of 80 or 100 criteria and you have to keep that criteria going and part of that criteria is continued initiatives and carbon reduction but don 't just take my word for it just a few days ago the queensland treasury corporation this was on thursday of last week said parks and other protected areas was not sustainable it harmed conservation efforts efforts and cost tourism sector potential visitors worth up to 3.3 billion dollars a year in queensland and create 8 000 new jobs this is private from the queensland treasure crossing in terms of rebuilding queensland 's economy and particularly the tourism industry our biggest asset is our national parks our beaches our coastline the outback and places such as cape york the daintree and limited so the experts say that ecotourism is worth billions and worth and worth looking after furthermore to to uh sum up i would say that actually uh i believe we are we are um we 're contradicting a receiving motion put forward by councillor kerr the rescind motion said that no further action occurs in the land until the completion of the ferry computation and the council community carbon position consultation both of these are proposed in the 2021 operational plan now this has not happened so we are putting forward we have been put a recommendation in front of us that actually contradicts a recent motion and actually contradicts our own plan states very clearly following following community consultation on council 's desired position for managing this carbon footprint and outcomes from the dainty ferry then we consider options for the land including revenue generate activities and potential sale to interested parties if we accept this recommendation we actually i believe possibly enrich our own council resolutions i think this is a question that must be discussed thank you very much nate thank you councillor nolan just in response to some of those things there was a motion part of that that actually said that we can build the land as well after we did other steps um and just regarding your comments regarding the sustainability strategy the sustainability policy the environmental policy and there 's two other ones that come to mind that this council rules under if you have a look at the consultation section you 'll see that there was no public consultation done on any of those documents it was all internal and that 's one of my big concerns and this is why we 're going out to the public consultation later this year to get to the vote then um all those in favor of the motion council mckeown councillor wisconsin council occur all those against councillor nollie council zamotaro promotion passes [Music] 3.2 trustee lease to public safety business agency on behalf of the kimberley rural fire brigade block 85 sb 219631 forest creek road the recommendation is the council offer a trustee lease to the public safety business agency on behalf of the kimberley rural fire service over part of lot 85 sb 219631 forest creek road for the term of 10 years from the date of execution utilizing the terms and conditions of the standard terms and conditions document registers under the dealing number 717940164 and also the state 's mandatory terms document registered under number seven one one nine three two nine three three leads payments to be 150 dollars per annum plus gst with annual cpi increases as release pay your reasonable costs associated with the launch of the lease and documents of the title office and delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to determine and finalize any matters associated a mover please seconded by councillor scummerson councillor nolly would you like to make any comments please no i think it 's a good good recommendation anyone against the recommendation any other comments from councillors you 're too quick i think you 're about to ask okay so 3.3 requests for negotiated decision notice for daintree water bottling facility if i could have a mover on this one please i 'm happy to councillornali i 'm happy to second that one thank you councillor noli um i just i 've got some questions i wouldn 't mind working through please um now i 'm sorry i will apologize if this question has been asked another for me so if i if i repeat something i might just think um i suppose it does talk about the uh the two conditions in here um the condition that talks about 17 heavy vehicle movements now my understanding is that the the applicant wishes to go from seven round trips a week to ten round trips a week that 's correct isn 't it so uh in total it 's it 's only back to the okay so so so i would assume that that means that the extra water that they can move out out is actually not that much more in total uh per year it 's approximately half as much again so if we then go back to the condition that talks about um is it condition five it talks about the uh sorry condition nine megapart and it talks about the production the applicant wants to completely remove that so but essentially he 's still limited the applicant is still limited by the at the total tonnage it would go from approximately 200 tons to at the most 300 tons because you only allowing that three extra round chips per week is that is my calculator is my reasoning correct there so if my reason is correct why can 't we just change the tonnage there as opposed to eliminating it all together so is that correct so you get you go from probably 200 tons a year to about half as much again 300 tons a year so he still have a lot of limits so why can little bit through the man um essentially it 's it 's not that assumption 's not really correct it 's we 're not limiting it and we 're agreeing to remove this condition in full because the overall production will be limited by the vehicle movements the size of the facility itself and the hours of operation uh as well as the 10 000 liter a day limit plus whatever they can take out of the ground with the boar so those other aspects and conditions will regulate the overall production because what we 're ultimately doing is regulating impacts on amenity we 're not we 're not regulating how much they can produce because it doesn 't really matter it doesn 't really affect anything yeah so um that 's why they 'll be producing thousands of tons per annum and the essentially it 'll be whatever they can fit in those trucks uh per week with with those um additional six trips per week so yeah that 's right it would be thousands of times it would be just that three hundred times okay am i reading it then triggers a new development application is that correct we 'll have to go to high impact industry land use is that correct through the man uh no initially that was our advices and our position to the applicant in the early stages of i guess the da and then that was why we threw this condition in that limits them to 200 tons but they 've made representations and formed a strong argument to demonstrate that that doesn 't actually create a threshold that defines a new high-impact industry land use so we 've looked into the overall impacts when you look at land use definition of high industry in uh industry that 's where you 're creating a whole host of offside impacts you know emissions noise odors all that kind of thing you know you 're milling steel for example but when you look at the definition of medium impact industry which is what we 're what we 've approved um limiting that by a production quantity of 200 tons is not reasonable so we 've chosen to accept that this increase in overall production reasonably keeps that this was deferred because there were some answers that i just wasn 't comfortable or wasn 't i needed i wanted and councilman agreed to defer and there 's a few points here that sort of say applicant has not specified the actual intent for overall production capacity but then it said goes on to say the body was extracted by the facility are not expected to detrimentally affect grounding supply so we 're talking about what they 're going to extract from our supply through there no we so we know and we 've conditioned what they can take from our rural water supply but we don 't know exactly how much they 'll be taking from the from the ground but it 's not a particular issue we don 't we don 't consider it a particular issue because the state government who would regulate that doesn 't have any particular requirements in the daintree region uh it 's not a it 's not an area that they see concern with um you know taking water from from the ground it 's not like southeast queensland for overall heavy vehicle movements it wouldn 't be considered um reasonable to try to limit that further but you know when you 're in an area with an abundance of groundwater there 's a few point just concerning the water quality has not yet been determined so we don 't know what you know what limitations or what water is going to come out or what treatment is going to need that still hasn 't been determined i would imagine as a council we need the answers to that before we can consider consider this uh proposal yeah another point is still exploring the market for the most environmentally friendly packaging we don 't know what does that mean you know we 're going to pass this without knowing what we 're going to be putting back in the system you know as a council veteran eliminates single-use single-use plastic we really want to contribute to the landfill it 's already an out-of-control situation that 's my concern i think when the only answer to that foreign through the mayor i guess um so you 've got two questions there uh treatment processes and the applicant hasn 't determined the actual process and the equipment required because they need ground water samples for the board to determine what processes are available because there 's so many when you consider water treatment so you need to understand what what 's coming out of the ground before you can look at how you 're gonna deal with it now we haven 't conditioned anything around that because ultimately we still have the environmental protection act which regulates overall impact so the applicant still has a general environmental duty not to cause environmental harm now i guess in terms of their responsibility there we also opportunity to regulate them by way of the annual food licensing inspections that councils environmental health officers will be undertaking so as when they go to site every year you know they 'll make observations and if there 's anything that raises concern they 're also the officers that are responsible for enforcing the environmental protection act so we have that that control in place i guess i guess the second part of your question there was about the the applicant doesn 't have a supplier yet they 're still sort of in negotiations um i certainly see a concern in terms of you know we 're trying to get away from uh single use items and plastics in particular and you know support more sustainable outcomes the ultimately the issue is that there 's not a great deal of particularly recyclable products in the market so you have two issues i guess there 's pretty high standard biodegradable packaging that they 've they 're considering but that you can 't recycle those and then there 's also those other types of packaging which have a high percentage of recycled product within them um which they may be able to use but it 's i mean none of it 's a great outcome it 's there 's good aspects but the other thing is i don 't think from a planning perspective we shouldn 't really be going down this path because it 's not a particular planning issue and and we also have all these other suppliers vending packaging in all of our other shops which is to start up and create a slightly better outcome then it 's probably not something that we need to try to regulate too much further but yeah ultimately it 's not really something we would go down as far as planning conditions so the other thing is not but that doesn 't understand it 's not a planning issue that 's my concern we could end up with um recycling industry but there 's a lot of unknowns in regards to the market as dan mentioned [Music] any other comments from councillors i think it 's worth noting that this um was approved and this is a negotiated decision with some amendments made to it and these points that we 're bringing up now aren 't part of any of the amendments are they everything all these amendments are different points that we 're quite happy with the results oh i think oh the water usage and the trucks i have no issue with it 's coming out of danger i 've photographed before it 's extra street trucks come out of their carton so with that i 'll put and councillors gomson councillor knowley council occur those against councillor the motion passes thank you very much i think that concludes the open session today 's uh session we do have a closed session martin

on to the agenda items start off with 5.1 today which is the daintree water bottling facility request for negotiated decision notice the recommendations that council issues a approval for medium impact industry water bottling facility over the land described as lot sp that 's what 10 sp 304 851 are subject to the following conditions if i could have a mover please councillor schomazon seconded council mcewen councillor commission would you like to speak to it since you moved to oh no everything 's wrong with that anyone against i 'd like to ask some questions yes of course absolutely um just correct me foreign the 10 000 liters from the water supply that still stands and anything additional come from the boar is that correct and through the meter yes that 's correct it 's limited to a maximum of 10 000 liters per day per day and we have an indication of what 's coming out of the board per day out of the wood sorry the ball i don 't think they 've got any i don 't think they 've sunk any balls on site okay yet so we 're not so we don 't know if the ball on site is potable water so until it 's tested is that correct yeah something further but i don 't think i 've sunk in yet yeah through the mid there 's there 's no detail on how much water they propose to take from the border or the quality of that water at this point um what we generally do with these sorts of assessments is we just look at overall impacts and we 're regulating the impacts humidity by the vehicle trips per day the hours of operation per day the size of the actual modeling facility so as far as you can actually reduce it doesn 't really matter if they can fit in those um packaged parties within those requirements okay well i 'm suggesting that there are boards that aren 't are not portable that need to be treated so i think i need to know what methods are going to be used to be treated what message can abuse contain the runoff from the street i think we need to answer these questions before we can sort of make a judgment on this especially if it 's going to be damaged the surrounding environment we need to know to obtain food licensing and food production requirements in accordance with environmental health regulations but uh as far as the info we received on the plant and materials it didn 't seem like there would be a great deal of byproduct or water that was going to not be packaged and go anywhere so that 's depending on what level of treatment more water could [Music] the fact that if you 're wanting to bottle it you wouldn 't want that much treatment done to it you want it as fresh as possible another issue i have is also with the packaging the decision on the cardboard is now in question so i i know i think these questions need to be answered when we make a decision before i can make a decision on it what packaging is going to be used what methods of treatment if the water is possible if the ball water i think it 's and important issue in this turn to the other councillors on this if you have any thoughts well i probably agree with there 's questions about that i think counselor to want to know exactly what 's coming out the only other question i 've had as well is that the water they 're taking out the raw water will have been meeted but they have a meter on that amount that they 're taking out daily yes it 'll be fitted with a restricting valve so they can 't actually take any more than 10 000 liters uh council is coming i 'm talking about the actual poor itself at this point in time i don 't believe any ball has been taught to look at how much water can come out of the actual ball and i 'm sure there 's going to be you know health and regulation requirements about the the standard of that water which fall outside of the planning scheme assessment um in relation to the cardboard packaging and whether it 's plastical cardboard or the biodegradable aspect of that again that 's something that 's more of a marketing for their own business purposes as opposed to something that 's going to be controlled by the planning scheme when you seek to do scheme that say you know it has to be biodegradable or cardboard or all those particular components so um but it 'd be a bit of a stretch members working on eliminating single-use packaging so i think it 's something that we need to be aware of but assume from what you 're saying it 's not a planning issue though so therefore can 't_''_513.76 be considered as far as planning it 's more a personal thing yeah certainly the only one that i 'm concerned about is what you 're saying about the runoff etc if any treatment needs to be done to the water which i think you know i 'm looking to the start to see here on advice as far as that goes well that wasn 't really it 's it 's not anticipated that any water coming out of the wall is going to be you know contaminant to the environment i think it 's more so if it can be used for drinking water and it 's potable and high quality then they 'll bottle it otherwise i think the application spoke about just supply for you know cleaning and washing down hard stand areas and things like that i don 't see it as being a environmental no that 's yeah that 's fine um for me personally i i 'm happy to make a decision on it but i will put it to the other councillors if they prefer to defer the matter for to find its information out so i will ask all those in favor of deferring the matter that 's uh councilman mcewen councillors cumminson councillor against deferring it be myself but the majority is to defer it [Music] so that matters being deferred subject to further information coming forward right so 5.2 queensland planning framework changes planning initiatives to support economic recovery the recommendation is one the council makes a submission to the minister of infrastructure and planning regarding the proposed changes as outlined on the agenda report two that the copy of council submission be forwarded to the local government association of queensland for inclusion in a joint council submission to be prepared by the lgaq if i can get a mover please councillor scholars and the speak to this um uh anyone against the motion not against myself on page 19 in the planning comment the written advice to neighbouring often is considered superfluous and it goes on to say that the summit addresses uh rentals and [Music] transient occupants is that but is it not um rule of thumb to um the actual owner of the property to receive this through the man the owner is always receiving a written copy of any of their notifications and it 's a notice on site and non-links are noticing the newspaper so that isn 't changing the newspaper is changing a bit where there 's papers in our local government area they can have an advertisement in on a e-site and use e-site we still have the cancer posts so there 'll still be a requirement for public dose in the kings post but in terms of notifying the occupants of the site those occupants can change over time and they will be able to see the public notice on the display at the site anyway so that 's always physically happening okay well sorry danielle just saying that um the occupants are consulted on these planning issues or only the owner because this is suggesting the occupants there is the requirement under the statute under the regulations that the owner must be publicly voted in writing but there 's nothing for the owner for the occupants of that name and premise does it mean to say that those neighbouring occupants can 't do a properly made submission it 's just who is required to be informed of that proposed change it would mean in some instances though that if you said the occupants have to be given written notice then who are they giving the written notice to would that uh label them properly they may have a rental for a week they might have a rental before half a year but the neighboring owner or applicant is not to know whether they 're there for a week or half a year or when it 's there so in our show it 's quite difficult it 's also that some little properties don 't have letterboxes sorry don 't have an alert at the address so and that 's you know who is there and we may not have the advice of who is the occupant or how you get that notice the state was indicating the applicant could then serve it physically on that neighbouring occupant which meant that a person would have to go onto that person 's property to serve that notice some rural areas we do have a requirement and we still will have a requirement that a public notice is put at the front of the property to each road frontage so anyone who is in that local area anyone can write this properly page submission they just have to put their name address and their grounds of their submission and lodge it begin at a certain time and that 's listed on those houses okay so that 's actually saying that occupants are not necessarily need to be notified so yeah we 're just saying under the regulation that would be difficult and in some cases it may not be possible i think it is also worth noting that this is a state government initiative that they are proposing the to those changes this is not us making changes to any planning scheme all those in favor of the proposal and that 's carried unanimously 5.3 the truck trunk infrastructure works in craig lee the council resolves to allocate in the 21 22 kappa works budget one million dollars for payment towards the construction and delivery of planned trunk infrastructure works being undertaken as part of the construction of the first two stages of the approved residential state at craig lee over land described as lot 2 on sr 431 and delegate authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any and all matters associated with the payment of outstanding monies associated with the delivery of trunk infrastructure and to enter into an infrastructure agreement with the owner of lot 2 on sr431 which i 'm happy to move this one if i can have a second to please councillor scomazon um just i 'd like to say it 's great to see this project going forward it 's been sitting there for quite some time um and this is going and these lots getting up for sale this is money the council would have to pay anyway um and giving this assurance to them just brings this project forward and allows them to start construction of the actual lot so they can get them up for sale um anyone wishes to speak against the motion sorry for the benefit of probably the gallery this is money you said council would have to pay anywhere which would normally be paid for completion of the worker doing it to get kick-started through the mayor um it will still be payable at the completion of the work um so the they will still have to fund the actual initial construction of it but then we 'll immediately have that money sitting there too so this is just an assurance that we will pay any other comments from councillors no i 'll put the matter to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.4 single use plastic free policy the recommendation is the council adopts a single-use plastic free policy if i could have a mover please councillor scomason and speak to it thanks yeah i just think it 's a great policy that 's been put into place by the council and it just helps our environment and it may take a little time for people to get used to it but in the long run i think it would be great anyone like to speak against the policy any other comments counsellors again i agree with you councillors collins and it 's great to see this come through we 've had the plastic free douglas going initiative going for quite some time now and it 's worked very well i think this is the obvious forward step from that um we have spoken and i think if there is mention in here about um for concerns for health etc with covert 19 there are some practicality issues currently with like things like single source servings um with the copic 19 you can 't use a bottle of tomato sauce you have to use the single servings currently but there 's certainly things that we can work through as we go forward but the initiative is great to move any comments at all um for you mr maya i i would like to just announce that we have been considering about a six-month phasing out period so during this period we would like to also help those vendors for example at port douglas markets to really help them through that situation and go through the products and work through those better options compared to single use plastics wonderful thank you very much no other comments will put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously our next one is 5.5 the water and white border customer service standards the recommendation is the council receives and notes the updated water and wastewater customer service standards review 2020 within the douglas shy if i could have a mover please from that one councillor scoverson i 'm not happy to second that one councillor 's comments would you like to say anything to it oh no i think it 's pretty straightforward it 's a review that has to happen so anyone like to speak against the motion any other comments regarding it um yeah i 'll said it is five years every five years we have to do this we did go out to public consultation on it there was ability for people to comment um and you know customer service standards is absolutely something that we need to pride ourselves on so having the reviews regularly is something that we have to do would you like to just say anything to them not awkward that 's as written um put that to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you very much for that 5.6 uh we 've got the water and wastewater quarterly report for the period ending 30 june 2020 the recommendation is uh is recommended that the quarterly report of the water and wastewater department for the period ending 30 june 2020 be received and noted if i could have a mover please council zamotaro is seconded by council on mcewen uh councillor zamatara to try to say anything no or very straightforward like to speak against it any other comments from councillors um thank you very much for a very detailed report there 's more i highly recommend people actually going to the website having a look at this report and seeing the detail in it and what 's actually involved in providing water to this shy mr tox did you want to say anything to the report it 's all in there wonderful it 's very very extensive report can i just say one thing yes is it possible that with our reports which are quite detailed and they 're well done is it possible maybe next time that we do a water report that we can do the graphs like instead of two years maybe extend it to a lock of five years just so people can have a look at how our water 's going compared to a couple years just a little bit um i don 't know if it 's possible if we can do that but just so that 's certainly something we take on notice and discuss with the staff after the meeting you certainly see it for some ways even the comparison of the year prior like on our own water bill specifically yeah yeah there are look forward to making things better yeah and not that we actually have to comment on you know those years but just as that people are visual because most people things are crucial okay there 's no other comments we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried anonymous unanimously thank you mr tox 5.7 mossman golf course proposal of purchase the recommendation is the council resolves to delegate the power to pursuant to section 257 and 262 of the local government 2009 to the chief executive officer to purchase lot 21 on sp 212664 and associated buildings on the land and the adjacent land on lock 20 sp two one two six six four by negotiation for a maximum amount number two is after the purchase approve a trustee permit for the lot 263 sr540 and freehold leads 20 and 21 sp2 on 264 with moss memorial bowls club for 12 months with an option agreeable to both parties to extend into a trusty permit of management rights options on council freehold land and up to a further two years to manage operations authority under s257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to determine and finalize any matters associated with this report if i could have a move the police council mcewen seconded by council of scotland uh councilman would you like to say anything to this yeah just a couple of things um i really think this um negotiation has been done fantastically well through the council staff here i believe it 's a win-win for all parties involved you can find combined stuff obviously at this point in time with what 's been happening in port douglas can 't continue to manage the golf club so we 're helping them out in a fair way it 's not over the top it 's a fair amount that we 're doing this for the golf club continues on as a very important community facility there 's a hundred odd people out there that are so happy with that and also most importantly is the douglas shire council and the rate payers we 're outlaying money which is going to be returned to us over a relatively short once that 's done we have another income stream that will continue on for the life that we have with the bolster and i 'm sure the bolster will be able to run this facility very well with their experience absolutely anyone like to speak against the motion any other comments regarding it i think it 's a great it 's a great um step forward for the council to do this because the last the golf club 's been there course and clubs through this for such a long time and um it would be a shame that you know the opportunity arose where a development could come through so i think that 's something that we 've secured and it 's an asset for our community absolutely couldn 't agree more and again i just want to make it very clear that we 're purchasing bricks and mortar here we 're not actually purchasing a business so the business will be operated by the bowls club and the council is just purchasing the bricks and mortar for a return with the rent which we will get so with those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.8 uh wave daintree ferry bus fees for august and september 2020 the recommendation is the council resolved to endorse the proposed wave of dangerous ferry charges for the buses for the period of the 1st of august 2020 to 30 september 2020 and cancel the delegates authority under section 257 of the local government act 2009 to the chief executive officer to administer the above relief if i can have a mover please on that one councillor zamotaro seconded by councilman uh council zamatara would you like to say anything to the motion i think it 's a good initiative by councillor to with the pandemic we 're going through i think it 's essential that we visitors coming anyone wish to speak against the motion and any other comments then from councillors i just have one comment that i 'd like to make that i agree with the proposed waiver for the august of september after september i think we need to seriously look at what can be done after that absolutely you know we do agree in the sense the fees forever we have to look at it um we are battled with the systems that we have here unfortunately as far as what ways we can do things and this is the most administratively financially sensible way to do it this time but as you know we will speak about that in the coming months how we can look to the future and progressively start charging for these things if we need to but you know it 's important for the meantime that we get these buses going across there and get as many people as we can into the daintree to spend whatever they can over there to keep those businesses going uh with that we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.9 the interim financial report june 2020. the recommendation is the council notes the interim financial report and the estimated financial position for the 2019-20 financial year if i could have a mover please councillor

to speak against the motion and any further comments from counsellors no thank you miss colleen it 's another um very detailed report that covers off everything that 's been happening for the past month um you know the unfortunate true figures are starting to show through it um which of course will end with the approximate 1.4 million dollar deficit this financial year it 's starting to head towards there but unfortunately with covert and everything else that 's going on it 's the way it is unfortunately so would you like to say anything at all to the report uh through the mayor just to say that it 's a very um interim report so it 's before all the end of year adjustments there 's a lot of work still to do a lot of invoices still to come in um provisions to be calculated etc so it 's we have to present at this time to every meeting but um yeah it 's uh nowhere near the final result and estimated result at the same time thank you if there 's no further comments we 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.10 the ceo report for the period april to june 2020 the council receives and notes the organizational report card and the report from the

another extremely detailed report it 's amazing when you go through this and you see everything that has happened over the past couple months you know it 's amazing to see how much we do achieve in a short period of time when you look at it all in writing like this so it needs to be commended to yourself and the staff for them amazing work that you do here with a small team and a small shy we still battle way above our belts anyone wish to speak against the motion any other i 'd like to make one i 've just got to let um the ceo and his staff um that i 've had quite quite a few phone calls but people are so impressed on this report how detailed it was and and they really enjoyed being well informed with what 's happening mr stormer would you like to say anything regarding it thank you mayor yes i there was one glaring omission from my introductory comments which is that i failed to thank the staff and that 's really important because this is all about the staff they actually put this report together and they do all the work and they 've been able to do all of this despite all of the covered restrictions so i really really want to thank the staff for run delivery of this absolutely if there 's no further comments we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously so that concludes the open session today we 're about to go into closed

thanking you miss Colleen and your team of course for the work that you 've all completed on this very difficult budget there 's an incredible amount of time and effort that goes into these budget reports and the acknowledgment of that work and to the whole team is since being elected with the people to go casaya voting to steer the region in a new direction what I believe is a responsible direction of increase transparency sensible investment and a need to strengthen the Shires economy all things that we can look forward to seeing this term go with 19 lockdown restrictions may have depleted our local economy but I 'm determined to build resilience in the face of adversity for the past six years this council followed a plan of financial spending sustainability by driving towards a budget of surplus unfortunately a devious goal that fell short Douglas Dyer is as vulnerable as it is beautiful whether it is any of the recent natural disasters or global pandemic our entire region buckles when our tourism sector falters businesses shut their doors unemployment escalates and people leave the region economists are predicting that up to 1,500 jobs and 150,000,000 could be lost from our local economy by the time they crunch the numbers of the drinking water in the coming days now is the time for sensible policy and investment to build our resistance to the outside influences base diversifying industry and exploring revenue raising opportunities this budget is the start of that process over the next 12 months Council will deliver its largest ever budgeted capital works program with a focus on renewing and upgrading infrastructure as we build our way out of cope at 19 and expect this to grow as further grant funding becomes available a total of just over 21 million dollars worth of investment will see 12 12.5 million spent on civil work projects such as roads footpaths bridges and drains and a further five million dollars pumped into improving the schnozz water can wastewater infrastructure it is clear that this council has an important role to play in keeping our local economy moving and this program lets us focus on providing essential services to our community council will also dedicate 1.4 million on public spaces and sporting infrastructure while we have prioritized investment in essential infrastructure we have made sure there is a collection of projects that our community can also be proud of you can also expect to see more workers on the ground with extra funds allocated for outdoor crews required level service along with the impact of covered 19 pandemic councils financial position is now expected to be pushed back to a 3.7 million dollar operating deficit but this is not the time for this council to be chasing a quick surplus with unreasonable rate prizes now is a time for creating jobs repairing infrastructure and ensuring our economy becomes stronger through progress Council will do this while finding alternative revenue streams to ensure ratepayers do not continue to wear the burden over the next many years we are facing uncharted territory that we are committed to getting the tribe back on track through growth and diversity rather than cutbacks and reductions the responsible budget keeps council financially viable without imposing any unreasonable increases and most importantly while stimulating its economy as priced in this budget the general rates and utilities have been capped at CPI level of 2.3 percent and as a covert assistance offer we will introduce a 1.2 percent general rates discount for those that pay their rates before the due date this added discount will keep an estimated 140,000 dollars in the pockets of ratepayers revenue raising opportunities and fully investigate how rates are calculated across the Shire to ensure that in the future years will bring back fairness and a balance to all ratepayers so I 'm happy to have move this motion if there 's anyone that would like to speak against the motion please Thank You councillor Norman I believe this is a year to stay bring things back to the basics as a nation we are hurting but hearing duck palace is one the worst tip the most greatly affected shires and Australia because the covert pandemic we all know the big picture still impacts but the local responses to gopher Cove in need to be Nuits for to every area and I 'll give you some data about Douglas final Queens and economy will experience a substantial form between reporter and this is about Queens and average and like it rough to last long the rest of Queensland Douglas is reported to have the second highest impact in Queensland due to carbon and this is due to having realized with tourism hospitality as visitation drops so resulting the decline in of supply chain industries job losses of Far North Queensland they estimated it 's ten thousand seven hundred with another eight thousand six hundred supported by job seeker so when jothika ends Cannes and Port Douglas have seen the largest percentage increase of people accessing unemployment benefits more than double the state average there is a real threat of you to disobey disengagement or extended period of time and Douglas is estimated to be the second worst in Queensland and this last green super important point is the length of time to the bounce back is our real challenge on KOCO comparison of economic growth of violent Queensland regional growth up to the global financial crisis was eight years this time it is an estimated five years before visitation numbers refer to pre covered numbers so and I 'll speak to this later on this is why TBD is important topics that I 've received many thanks for the community for councillors Emmitt Aras and mines voting for the fees and charges budget of zero percent increase and care has shown that they can do the same I believe that hit home at the moment nobody seems have anything money the people with a little money are cautious and there are many people 's with no money coming off dear mother nation in 2014 Douglas capture council had a 0% rate rise and I think we must do the same today I job keeper fishes September and when that finishes I 'm scared that there will be a big effect here in doubles and other chars small businesses that up until now have managed to continue may actually closed their doors permanent in September Australia is in a recession and people in Douglas struggle but only for the big bills but they struggle for every dollar I believe we need to cut this budget back to the basics back to the basics let 's be leaders and let 's be strategic long-term better of the Shire and let 's be realistic too this year we must have a zero percent rate rise it can be done and I believe that this time next year we could actually be in a worse situation I want to see more caution with this should have been this year to the cobraman close to a need of 1.4 that 's how we start this financial year next year is estimated to be finished at 3.7 million dollars in debt I don 't believe that there are any there is I believe that there 's no real leadership shown no concrete ideas no hard decisions being made there is no vision no strategy I wonder as a leader to show the path we must be taking voting for this budget I believe that I 'm breaking my declaration of either the councillor the declaration we took the rules Warren was to abide by the local government principles and the principles of our job description were I swore to be transparent and effective processes and decision-making in the public interest and I spoils the sustainable development and management of assets and infrastructure delivery of effective services and I swore for democratic representation of social inclusion and meaningful community engagement and I saw for the government 's and my life 's no matter those are my promise and I believe that if we vote of this budget principles all another Thank You council anole anyone else like to speak to the motion yes counselor Matara sure you may be good but as I mentioned the fees and charges I believe the same should apply the rates we should freeze any rise in the 2021 financially yet businesses and families are struggling financially and they will be for some time recovering from why do we can 't use arguments on this small rise as a few dollars considerable out of money family to the struggling and businesses lost an income stream people are struggling to pay more we 're just putting food on the table on last thing there needs to find extra money pay their rates I believe this is achievable with my council if as a council for now we curb our spending and concentrate what 's necessary to keep Douglas operational with the financial climate we 're in it 's not a good idea four counts via raising the rates at this point in time I think they should be frozen thank you thank you cancel them sorry any other councillors like Wilson sure sorry like a lot to come in miss Killeen and their staff on the job they 've done it 's a great thank you any other counselors like to speak to the motion I understand you know what we 're going through at the moment and I do agree with the counselor no lien councils a Matara that people are doing it really tough at the moment but we have to look at it as a positive side everyone going through the same thing it 's not just a douglas charge the whole of Australia and the world so to look at this positively I think this is the time that this Shire can reshape exactly what it 's doing it 's quite obvious that we rely way too much on tourism in the shower and we need to open our doors now for other types of revenue to come into this town other businesses and other types of ventures that people can offer to the Shire so yeah we 're all going through it no it 's a not a discriminative thing this cook over 19 and I just think the Shire maybe down other tracks not relies so much on tourism because tourism is really shown that it 's not viable for this Shire Council nuki one I agree with Rory even there we go and Lisa I 've put out there just questioning people on the effects that this what I call a minimum rise will have doing the sums for example one storekeeper even you put Douglas who is actually closed at the moment they calculated that it would be an extra 50 cents per day on top of the rates that they 're paying the landlord Nia I think it 's important that we continue to keep the capital works and keep spending because it 's about the only thing that 's happening in the area you can see federal and state government as well they 're pumping a lot of money into different expenses rowboats etc and the communication I 've had with the ratepayers I 've spoken to they understand that they should be Iraq right or they has to be a price to get the economy going again from announcements point of view telling the council works it 's not a good position I understand that the effects it 's having on everyone including yourself in business but I support the increase as a minimal sensible increase thank you can secure but whistling if you 'd like to speak more to the your report through the mayor a rates increase was was held to CPI in the report based on a point three percent rate rise for the next ten years we would actually recover to a surplus at around year eight if we were to not increase rates at all the dollar impact would be six hundred and sixty eight thousand dollars so the deficit would go from three point six eight million to four point three five million and it would take much longer than ten years to bring it back into surplus there would also be a ripple effect on our capital works we would have to actually cut back on our capital works as well because we need to maintain liquidity level the QTC recommend that we maintain three months opera topics operational expenditure that is approximately twelve million in time so if we were to actually increase the deficit that will put pressure on would have to actually decrease the capital works program I think that 's all and comment thank you thank you thank you counselors for your comments yeah I think we all agree that people are doing it hard at the moment and I certainly appreciate the tourism aspect especially at the mind is doing it very hard and I think that 's you know where this budget is driven towards creating employment through other areas you know will possibly be one of the godsends to keep people employed in this region you know we 're looking at tourism being quite a few years before it kicks back in again and you know we have to keep people in this place employed and we also have to maintain the basic standard we need to keep our parks our gardens our roads you know all those council assets up to a standard you know so when tourism does kick back in again we have a great place for them to come to you know if we it tourism will be kicking back in and we won 't have anything ready to give to them so I think it 's really important that we do our infrastructure we keep people employed at the moment and we moved forward as a council without putting ourselves in too much financial duress I mean if there 's no further comments offered to the boat then place all those in favor Council on QM council sponson cancel occur all those against councillor nollie councillors and arrow motion carried and that concludes the special meetings so we 'll call this minute this meeting is 1328 and we should be palpable _"

thank you very much and of course we have to staff some of the staff here working on today press here thank you very much for coming so we 'll head on to the conflicts of interest councillors anyone wish to declare a conflict of interests councillor McEwan yeah I declare that I have a conflict of interest in I item 5.15 operational plan initiative two points one went for Muslim to technical goals as defined by section 175 deal with the Local Government Act 2009 as follows I am on the board of directors of Muslim technical gardens and as this is a major project for the community and is in the initial standing phase and I 'm not earning a financial benefit I 've determined that this personal interest is not sufficient significance that will lead me to make a decision on the matter that is contrary to the public interest or best perform my responsibility of serving the overall pub interest of the whole of the council 's area by participating in the discussion and voting on this matter however I acknowledge that the remaining councillors must now determine peruse into section 175 deem of the local Mann Act 2009 whether I have a real conflict interest in this matter and if so whether I must leave the meeting while this matter is discussed or voted on or I may participate in the meeting in relation to the matter including my voting on this matter Thank You councilman Keon so I will now put it to a vote to the remaining councillors do you believe that council on cue and has a conflict interest in this item if I can show my hands if you believe that he has a conflict of interest in this matter council anole Helen else believe he has a conflict of interest okay so therefore by show of hands and there is no finding the council eq and has a conflict of interest therefore council mercury is able to stay in the meeting you participate in vote I also declared that I have a conflict of interest in item 5.1 five operational plan initiative two point one point three Grand Street dining precinct as defined by section 175 dear the Local Government Act 2009 as follows I 'm the part owner of two hairdressing businesses in grunt strip and as this outdoor green dining precinct will far outweigh the benefits to the community rather than you personally I have determined that this personal interest is not sufficient significance that will relieve me to make a decision on the matter this contrary to the public interest I will best perform my responsibility of serving the overall public interest of the whole of the council 's area by participating in discussion and voting on the matter however I acknowledge that the remaining councillors must now determine this year intersection 175 e of the Local Government Act 2009 whether I have a real conflict of interest in this matter or perceived conflict of interest in this matter and if so whether I must leave the meeting of other matters discussed or voted on or I may participate in the meeting relation to the matter including by voting on the matter I 'll hand over to the deputy mayor to take them okay I 'll now put it to a vote at the remaining counselors the counselors that we that may occurred has a conflict of interest in this item put to vote actually believe I believe I agree look at it was different council corners doesn 't stand to gain anything financially from position I think it can be received from makers from the public that men who could be in a gang financial advantage from this on on that whole is yet I will declare it an interest on in that respect no that 's been mentioned and I will choose to leave for that item in particular okay just to make sure there is no conflict and we have some clarity for that item in particular for the operational plan so no no no for the the item two point one point three so you can categorize I realize I 'm really you know just the one that 's a pocket of interest of course all gonna be discussed later on but we have one more just on operational plan if so if you 've declared any interest this one but my understanding would be that you must leave room all discussions on that one about what is included in there and you can 't quote on that one by overnight this hold yeah what what we can do is we can break out that into the operational plan except for that item and then all counselors can debate that and then we can have a separate motion just for that specific item to address the conflict of interest it would be the appropriate way to handle it given that the mayor has decided to declare that conflict start be absolutely acceptable to do that we often do that in other reports that are made up of multiple decisions for example our grant funding we oftentimes break those out while I am in order to deal with conflicts of interest so it 'd be a very appropriate way to handle the conflict of interest so I 'm gathering but that when we get into that awesome awesome motion to split that to a separate yeah well we have to break out two motions one will be a motion to adopt the operational plan with the exception of what was it two point it 's two point one to point four two point one point three and then the second mostly will we will be able to debate whether they want to accept two point one point three very much like what you do with grant funding okay we 'll discuss that when we get to that thing before we do go any further though I 'd like to make a special mention before we go on I 'd like to pause for a minute to make me that we had a staff member to letting them just kidding them we have to manage the numbers in the room go to room limitations so they are just waiting at like the door periods so as I 'll saying before we go on I 'd like to pause for a minute to make a special mention of thanks we have a staff member today is hanging up the boots from council life after 42 years of service with this organization an incredible achievement and one that he and the entire community should be immensely proud off mark spent his first 12 years here working in various departments before finding his work home and must be a second time after all those years in the his belt I 've been told that he 's the equivalent of Google Maps when it comes to duggar-sized water pipes mark has been an incredible asset to the water team and his colleague Jill more so he 's sharing of his knowledge and mentoring will definitely be sorely missed on behalf of all the residents in Douglas Shire I 'd like to thank you and [Laughter] 30 years on time and said I 'm at the address this time we reach different mean exactly right tells me make it a few more phone calls just counselor would go fine yes all right so we 'll go on to the confirmation of the minutes the minutes from the 26th of May 20 2011 mover place counselors a Muslim and a second up and some McEwan any against the minute any questions about the minutes or against them problems don 't put that any comments about her put that to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried we have the minutes from the Tuesday the 2nd of June to a special meeting okay the movie on that 's speak against or any comments about no put that to the boat then all those in favor it 's carried in Owsley and these special meeting for Tuesday the 9th of June 2020 if I could have a mover on that one councilman orally and seconded that council is a mataró anyone like to speak against any comments come all those in favor and that 's unanimous in Carey Hall right now going to do a procedural motion as per standing order 3.2 I 've moved that the order of business be altered to bring forward an agenda item 6 the notice of motion has this item references and notice to rescind a motion which references to an operational initiative in the operational plan 2021 just for those the 3.2 states that the order of business shall return shall be determined by resolution of council from time to time the order of business may be altered for a particular meeting where a councillor of the meeting passed a motion to that effect a motion to alter order business may be moved without notice so because of the this item to discuss that first and then for when we get to the operational plan it 's already covered so I put that I shall move that if I could have a seconder for that motion please counts on the queuing anyone against counselor knowledge like to make any comment yeah absolutely this is a sneaky thing probably they 're not what I was know anyone was expecting and if you wanted to put before a minute where is that another six resumed motion and then move it on the floor any meeting like this lady have there any Arno 's councillors it 's a procedural matter because any other comments you 're not just ask monthly and can you just direct me to where we actually this is just a procedural motion we 've got the item 6 which is the rescinding of the block 83 all right of course that 's also discussed in one of the items before it the Standing Orders basically states that they 're sending motions are down the bottom but because this is involved in the top section we just need to put this it before we get to the other item oh that 's just a procedural yeah thank you all right so any other comments I 'll put that to the boat then all those in favor can some Q and counselors commerson counselor turn all those against councillor Knoll he counsels an entire area so six point one noticed your ass in motion the meeting 11th of February 2020 arts and pie for nine concept land a lot 83 is our five and six cape tribulation Road I gave notice to the councillors previously that I intended on rescinding this motion so here they gave notice to pursuant to s2 six to the local government regulations 2012 that the meeting held on held or council or the December 30 between 2020 I intend to remove the resolution of council made on the 11th of February 20 20 repeal item 509 concept plan for lot 83 SR 596 cape tribulation Road and that the council endorses the lot 83 is that five and six concept plan the establishment of a stakeholder reference grid another takes conveyance consultation I 'm happy to move 'm actually quite happy to move this motion to rescind his previous motion which will be the last step in reverse reversing what I believe was some of the most community dividing decisions that were made by this previous council this report was very clear in its definition of what is new councils direction is we all live here we all love the environment around us we all want to play our part in protecting one of the most precious icons on the planet which we are the guardian of but to what extent that is to occur whilst using rent payer funds as a hotly debated topic one which I have all intentions of finding out through a carbon mitigation community consultation this rescinding motion and the motion I wish to put forward following it will put back put this back in the hands of the community to decide it will also give the opportunity for another organization to be able to complete these environmental projects if they wish to take this block on a win-win situation as environmental projects can be completed whilst this council continues to use very clear that they want completed such as roads parks and gardens and the economy it is reason I put this board this motion for any would like to speak against the motion councilors an Atari thank you maker show you I 'm like to start with talking about the history of lotta industries important understand explains why my gang police in motion in a special council meeting held on Wednesday at 28 that all to 2019 it was resolved to purchase the block now known as lot 83 and I 'll add that was a unanimous decision what all five councillors and it was very clear in the report of what we were the reasons were Wireless wanting to purchase his block a lane for carbon credit generation carbon sequestration other ideas it was very clear why were in Britain on October the 3rd 2019 we managed to purchase the surrounding 70s six hectare block north of the Daintree River and there 's always been multi-faith ideas and how it could be used with the prime idea to expands councils environmental initiatives the land is located on what is of GSD whilst this land is predominately rainforest there are cleared sections consisting of approximately 70 hectares where I think that wastes about 90% of the block on the 11th of February 2020 castle adopting the concept plan with this plan counselors unique opportunity to live a positive environmental outcomes in partnership with the community environmental brief traditional owners local business businesses and researchers through the establishment of local initiatives located here I 've been in discussion with Cooper ko from Jabra bina and jumbled in there are very disappointed that this block is considered going up for sale they were looking forward to working in partnership with the Douglas high council it would create an employment for indigenous people in the area would have been able to promote and maintain their culture high ox a Cooper 's very disappointed that the whole organization is over block and they continue with this partnership and this councils always confirm its obligation to mitigate the impacts of climate change and the ideas presented in this concept plan will form an important part of councils action in this space the concept plan recommends representatives from local environmental groups traditional owners and local businesses it is suggested that the stakeholder reference group will be involved in designing that project initiatives which aim to complement existing daintree rainforest experience and leverage local expertise through partnership opportunities also in addition wider community engagement is recommended ensure a dedicated website online surveys and a public Gazeta period of the draft plan prior to the final plan being recommended to Council for adoption some of the ideas were that the achieved positive environmental outcomes I mean you improve water quality for an example promote habitat supports peekytoe species open up habitat corridors and sequester carbon provide partnership opportunities with community groups and the community provides knowledge sharing opportunities traditional owners contribute to scientific research for example carbon sequestration and agroforestry provide meaningful interpretation about the history of the and project initiatives provide a nature experience for visitors and residents for example trail tree planning it was a great concept plan on belief but recently muster counselor surprised and not quite council administration counselor advisor to and Conservation Trust offered to contribute financially in whole or in part to letter has been circulating since the suit was sent to Council last year the marathon Queensland trust for nature and rain for us to all get permission for it to be published as there was nothing secretive about knowing the reason for confidentiality yet we have been given nothing and I repeat nothing now that councillors that via other means received a lit-up I see that the letter says the contribution would be on the understanding this is part of a revolving fund to replicate the lot aviary acquisition at other appropriate sites in Douglas and possibly elsewhere like that 's an important point this would mean council could continue buying and owning land that could be restored reforested for instance or at the same time supplying carbon credits to council and interested tourism operators wanting to offset their carbon emissions at no further cost to council that 's that 's an important factor the offer would have enabled a council to still use part of a lot 83 for the ancillary users proposing the concept plan for the block besides offsetting its carbon emissions it can be used to the eventualities of actually providing a revenue stream and welcome relief to the ratepayers of Douglas a seemingly incredible officer why haven 't we been told about this now today councils were given the recent motion to this great concept plan the rest in motion is contradictory in its wording and also gives no real reason as to why the mayor wants to do this once again as councilor we have been asking to be involved in this and we have been pushed aside as inconsequential you 're up to five and a half minutes passes on Toyota 's go all the weekend we received an email sign has a meeting tomorrow duty FN and ran for a frisky to discuss the South I think that 's a little premature on the decision and the marriage pre-empting the result as well as having no intention of telling Council about this meeting transparency would boil in the second part of the rescind motion states the process must follow complies to council policy number 2250 cheek freehold land general policy and local government regulations 2012 this is a deliberate act addition to rescue Canton and Lola has already provided ministration or an email with all councillor cease eating legislation details of any cell does not have to go to open tender it appears as this information has been ignored so I reject this rescind motion let 's a reject this Racine motion let the concept plan ask what do its job as it reports behavior to let the bank through river crossing community consultation start and finish let the community consultation on carbon footprint start and finish when all this is finished and collated then decide what to do at the land and by the way employed councillors have a deputation the qtf any and rainforest rescue all councillors not just a mare in the CEO thank you thank you cancel cemetery just a couple of points there um people and I 've had numerous conversations and I 'm more than happy to discuss any of them we think cuz he hasn 't mentioned it tomatoes first I 've heard of it so he can come and discuss it with me I 'm more than happy to he hasn 't mentioned you well and I look forward to them coming through in the community consultation that comes up to find out the DD swap community actually wants us to do their money and that 's the whole purpose of this the workshops you know we have has workshops where things were discussed regarding qtf n and the revolving land purchase you know councilmen all you actually mentioned it at a meeting a couple weeks ago I 'm a counselor the reason I 'm meeting regarding the sale of the land with the QT event at a courtesy I asked the CEO to organize a meeting with him so that we can just talk introduce each other can meet each other which hasn 't happened as yet because of all this going on which I felt was an appropriate thing to do so and as far as the open tender goes I 've made it very clear in this report and I 've also made it very clear publicly that I do not want this block of land sold to just anybody the comment was that if this block of land comes to initiatives albeit that is all right because I 'm not using the right payers money at the moment to do these things until the ratepayers say that that is what they watch that is it counsel all you wish to say something against commotion yes Thank You councillor cemetery it 's a hard act to follow because you 've included so much information there look in if anything I find the two suggestions a little bit contradictory actually I really don 't have too much problem with your first point that no further action occurs on the land to the initiative thank you free consultation and if we go ahead with that we will find out what the community wants if we go ahead of that task force at suggestion from from the neon suppressor division of the local council resolution we will find out what was if the community wants to sell the lane then we do that but we might not find that at six months time whatever my suggestion allow number one getting it given the point number two because that for me is a real alarm future than we did with me tonight it 's very reasonable suggestion after all different management accounting seminar at CMS two very useful suggestions we 've got a cover to go upon that was the tax resolution of the lemons of February and she can come to it with rune out in six months time seven months time or Never that 's my vision effective Thank You Council anole and just in regards to that yeah this is a case of the horse before the cart you can 't make a decision of what you 're going to do then go to public consultation and we did workshops which was basically we said then we were told this is going to happen because it 's the right thing to do that is not consultation consultation is when you actually ask the public how much they want do they understand litigation did I want us to do and if anyone does come forward will be a resolution anyone else like to comment on them well you know this is a big bear back to me this block Elaine and majority erased was something I 'll rephrase that with majority rape phase with not that purchase of this block of land and I think that there should be an investigation done and why this rock ulemas purchase when you look at the concept plan we have all these environmental groups during here how many of them marching the double show up how do they benefit from using this buckle and how does the rate payer benefit from this Lane we talked about carbon credits but it 's a long-term thing I think it 's appalling that this has been done behind the right pays back same what the carbon credit Fiasco was this brother land should be put on hold until we 'd out a consultation or talk to rate payers at this show so I sold this bottle and I 'll make this quite clear this does not get sold under what we purchased for so if we have to sit on this block alone for the next 20 years so be it because this is an absolute disgrace and everyone should be ashamed about that do they actually voted for this proper land and these groups what kind of I want to know what benefit people in these organizations are going to get out from the right pace money that 's being spent on this block of land so we need to come up with some really good suggestions on how we can utilize this proper land for the benefit of the right page of this Shire it 's been asked a question we have to look at the possibilities of what what benefits the right Kaiser get and the stuff around the exact moment is nothing and when you look at the concept plan I can 't see any can I just just keep the motion going here this is purely just to rescind its motion yeah and the next section is to move the other things okay so that 's my view if I 'm cancelling you need everyone in the other section yeah there 's a no I am I support the motion that the reasons are that the purchase of this lady has been very controversial every second person that I 've talked to bring up and also believe that there is a connection with the ferry concepts that this Lane needs to be considered with so listen uh-oh I was devastated when I heard that this would be purchased behind there runs back as most people have been I think it should be taken out the consultation and the people given the chance to have it say and in relation to the point I think the wording there is a testament you know we 're not gonna it 's not going to be told without coming through here so I have no problems at they happen so the motion they were putting it the moment he is for to rescind the original motion if there 's no other comments I 'll put that to the boat place all those in favor council McEwen councillors competent counsel occurred all those against and to anole councils undercard luncheon class so now move on to the Commission to move that no further action occurs on the land and saw the completion of the danger very consultation and the council community carbons decision consultations both of the chuppah phased on to is that council approved the CEO to test the market for the sale of land but the intent of selling it to an appropriate buyer comes along the process must follow compliance to council policy number 22 strategic freehold land general policy and local government regulations 2012 the child will happily move that if I can have a second to place councillors commerson for the reasons I 've really spoken about I 'm just going to put it to the against if anyone else has any against comments for that one councillor Knoll even that councillor Knoll he has put through an amendment that we take out point to it has been seconded by

McLean came in and saw us and this is actually an urgent matter that I get this funding they won 't go ahead with it because the network needs to actually get an agreement and that 's why it 's being put through is thenali there puts in front of you it 's got all the details on it ok you can either choose to say yes or no to it tech support to the chair it 's part of the community development budget we ok any other questions against the mushroom of than three amount I 'm just I 'm a little concerned that in non procedures being in these sort of situations to have deputations with the companies involved and we haven 't had any of that this that 's why I 'm concerned we are I 'd like to know more about it that 's was agreeing to defer or did like that see it refer them to we even have a deputation I mean there 's bocalee the mantasy on counts of staff counselors have been involved in this at all so I would have liked to see at least a deputation so and I 'm not like I said before choice an important important event for the Douglas show I would have liked to see at least the deputations been normal procedures and fast one and what cancer dental does not bring regard well in response status it 's been their time restraint and I think it 's extremely important that especially the one on funding for the nine thousand dollars for a live broadcast to have an hour show advertising and you know with the host of it being the gentleman he usually comes up and hosts the show it 's a name as well kind of says TBD are also peddling bought on board with this I think it 's a great initiative any other comments from councillors then I 'll put it to the vote all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously five point three Cape York tenure resolution program requests for the view on be National Park tenure actions the recommendation is that council advises the Cape York Peninsula resolution program that cyp TRP on the objections you propose tenure actions see the attachments including road closures eight to ten and eleven can the unallocated state land I 'm not 63 at the eight nine eight three nine one on the basis that these proposed tenure actions have current or handle future used by council advises the cyp TRP the council has an objection to propose ten-year actions not mentioned above on the basis that these proposed tenure actions have no current or no foreseeable use for councils and three delegates authority under Section the chief executive officer to progress all matters associated with these discussions I 've have a move on that place Council is a Matar a second done cancellous commerson councils Emmett ARIA Charts make any comments oh I think you make although I just like to say Liz we 've discussed this at length with the offices and it 's it 's true a workshop so it 's quite easy to make a decision on this as many complain fully the reasoning behind the officer 's report anyone against the motion any other comments by councillors any further comments by start all right we 'll put that to the boat then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.4 relinquishment of john trusteeship between Douglas our

Local Government Act 2009 to the chief executive officer to execute any documents required for the completion of this transaction ok the move please councilman ollie now second on councillors a Matar a councillor nollie since you move this would you like to speak to it yes thank you yeah it 's been a long time coming this is one of the things that were brought that was brought to me the amalgamation Glen took me back and do that and 14 and it 's something that I have a council has actively joined it 's right through and how about side people so it 's good morning come to this council resolution this recommendation I we very privileged to have been part of it and I really enjoy Thank You council and I like anyone wish to speak against the motion all right any comments from other councillors I 'd just like to say I understand that 's a very long going process and agenda I 've had to do a lot of research and I 'm happy myself some things that are coming up from the past that may not have been mentioned maybe it 's appropriate to give us a little bit of extra information or provide some yeah because I heard the comments we 'll put that to the boat all those in favor and that 's unanimous carry 5.5 that was chamber of commerce resource and performance agreement the council resolves to contract the douglas chamber of commerce and specialized service provider under su-35s be of the local governing regulations 2012 for specialist business support the funding of 50,000 GST exclusive under terms set out in a resource and performance agreement for the period of one year dated from 1st July 20 22 June 30 2021 the notes that council staff will develop kpi 's for the allocated funding that will focus on strong support of small businesses in the community and supporting economic growth in the shire and three delegates authority under Section 2 5 7 the Local Government Act 2009 to the chief executive officer to finalize any minor and execute the resource performance agreement I 'm happy to move this one it 's canceled I 'm cured I 'm just start off with it now I believe that this is a resource and performance agreement that 's long overdue as long as I can remember the ability for this chamber to be able to contribute appropriately has been restricted by lack of funds the chamber has the ability to assist in our tourism transactions whilst one body gets the torus here the chamber has the ability to assist helping our businesses to be ready to service these tourists appropriately to the standards needed to ensure that they return a body that has the ability to unite businesses in the shire with information training advice is paramount to rebuild Douglas post over 19 and as I highly recommend for councillors to support this motion I think that you know the chamber will be able to do a lot with these funds as far as assisting our local businesses especially in training in information and it 's something that hasn 't been able to be achieved due to lack of balance so I 'm putting this promotion cord if anyone like to speak go to comment after that okay so now let 's begin snow will open floor for conversation the clients so I think counsel McEwing you pointed that first and you want to talk about this year sure now I understand the importance of the Chamber of Commerce and I understand the yeah let 's need to to front of them the only concern I have and I have been involved with the chamber comments over the it 's not not the last four five six but I think we really need to have the kpi 's put in plates very strictly I mean the chambers Jam has always been a very small group of people that hasn 't had a lot of support in giving them some fun I think it 's very imperative that somehow they made responsible to increase the number of people that will benefit from this because we don 't want to fund them and then just the same old kind people that they 're the only ones that want to come along and do that the sessions somehow we have to put in there that businesses importance of jump on board with all the training but I just want to see that somehow we make them sort of a cannibal to get out there and get lots of businesses on board and also have a regular update as to the numbers the progress and I 'm sure probably would be in the KPI that some way but I think it 's imperative that if we 're going to give him 50 greens we have to see that the business people in Mossman input targets impact trip and when giddy all the opportunity if they wish to benefit from and not just a small select group no absolutely briefing councillor McEwan do you believe they 're on the same path payment they don 't get the whole lot up at once through the chair as part of there are funny conditions that we will put on the parameters of this filing it will be to make sure that they are developed some KPIs in consultation with us to get that approved there will be monthly reporting and also quarterly releases of the plan so it 's every can then presented to Council on devices and just a questioning through June and if if we 're not happy with the the results on the fully affordable monthly what happen we address that it through the chair and as part of the quarterly report and releases if they 're not we 're not satisfied with the young kpi 's and achieving those take the ice every quarter we can then obviously old payment or the third season payment I think it 's extremely important that we keep this in this opportunity I mean it proved last year when we had the the big conference they held down in Port Douglas that they got great business support from and that alone I think we end up 13,000 around those you know prints in the report that we did around 13,000 yeah so 50,000 is not going to go far you know but at least it gives them the opportunity to be able to prove themselves worthwhile and actually I really want them to do something with all the businesses must be included not just part of us you know do that any other comments sorry Kevin Ollie was just inside yeah I support giving them funding but I believe that council needs it developer Street KPI visible and all I 'd also like to see if they have a business model or plan in place of how they will use that 50,000 in which direction they want to go and the other question of I 'd like to know the running we 've gotten here that they offered free membership to support local businesses during the cove at 19 I 'd like to know how many businesses that she 's taken that offer up to see if they are growing okay to what they are at the moment so it would be interesting to see if any businesses jumped on board with free membership I 'm actually it 's just again it 's building up confidence in the businesses as well but the chamber it 's there to do things for them you know I think the more the chamber guards the more businesses will jump on board choices that 's okay council anoles thank you it 's so the conversation perhaps you know of actually like possibly both the start of an anti of that conversation but I also think we need to point out first and foremost chain and then under okay just for that but the roba caller says that the recommendation comes upon recommendations from the economic strategic review committee so this anyway of the strategic review admitting is all very well and good but we haven 't seen the recommendations from that strategic committee this committee was formed things like last year or more I 'll go anyway there were six meetings some very clever people got together they came out some traditions okay now that 's pitched no problems of that what was supposed to come next what was that there was going to be trouble when you formal report regular catalyst that was Danny only go out really consultation to see the community wanted to know about the community so I had to back with recommendations you can really benefit we 're going back to Council for a formal resolution and adoption so the what we have today in recommendation is bond now I think we need to take a step back have those steps done that wasn 't on our websites the advertisers once that 's happened we haven 't had those steps okay go back do those steps and it 's been suggested then we come back read the China and sit down together we worry about we not act together it 's calculus and vision spoken about we find out the strategies of the China become a good throw net objectives kind of have to spend the money someone brought my here 's what they have we work together and then we come back and we have council report or some money I think these are the proper steps that need to be carried out first we have to pick the strategic review committee that hasn 't been finished we need to come back to Council and first of all has got community consultation we need to come at Catholics with resolution then we go ahead with this just do the steps do the processes that 's all I 'm asking thank you thank you Ken for Norling I know the reasons while it 's been delayed it 's called code 19 absolutely no problem being like that 's why these things are also coming through from a very competent body of staff members writing a report for us to sit there in front of you for you to read to try and assist these businesses and it is in the operational and also the image this whole economical study and the work group or the rest of it so the reports will come through the counselors with long term goals short term fixes to try and assist the businesses that are here now have need help these are the things that were doing thank you I never want to criticize the council stuff I just want to be part of be involved that 's all I 'm getting at it 's capsules I 'm a parent Nick you may look on this also again we 've got the other counselors have mentioned I would assume in the kpo that have to be developed before we announce the level of funding that they would be receiving and as far have said as counselor Noli pointed out either I think we need a victory game putting the horse before the cart before the horse I think we need to see these outcomes before we can make the cheese we can 't_''_3484.4 be asked to make decisions based on what technology review committee I mean they 're all much like a fictional character Ivan and receive anything from the old legacy I think we duty subpoenas as as promised that we need this again see what we announce of these meetings were you pump if there 's any other comments I will put that to the boat then all those in favor and some key one counselor let 's go Merton Council occur all those against and fenoli councilors NHRA first and I 'm quite sure those details we 're lunch 5.6 tourism Port Douglas daintree results in performance agreement the recommendations that council resolves to support tourism port douglas daintree with a contractor specialist service provided the destination marketing and management understoo 35b the local government regulators DS 2012 for the financial year of the first is live in 22 fifty thousand dollars GST exclusive and include pockets base to the in-kind assistance offered the agreement delegate authority for the council officer represented to join turrets and port douglas sanctuary board of directors and recognition of the significance of the tourism and destination marketing on economic growth and Ella gated authority under Section three five seven at the Local Government Act of 2009 to the cheating they could go office up to finalize any minor amendments and execute the resource performance agreement which I am more than happy to move that if I can have a seconder please that 's on a few and firstly I want to thank the staff very much that is very detailed report that clearly shows why council has chosen to take this path really what was or what wasn 't word in private a vat19 is no longer appropriate postcode of nineteen and is more than proper that the procedures used to assess compared investigated and decisions are made by those you have all the details in front of them while we are the chosen representatives we make the final decisions here at this facts that are in front of us not misconstrued opinions of those who have been involved in similar resource agreements twenty years ago kourin social media comments that are made to create debate rather than fact the decision has clearly been well thought out and rationalized through numerous discussions with CP DT and T t NQ to ensure that adequate amounts of funding is secured for the current performance agreement and the current conditions that we are facing I believe that this outcome is a balanced approach and one that the CEO and the charity p TT PD have advised me is a workable amount when considered in a whole fit package cancel TTP d TT and Q Chamber of Commerce and the newly created tourism economical development officer all working in harmony is one taking this Shire forward in one direction as a collective so as such I 'm more than happy to support this motion if anyone would like to speak against it councillors amatory thank you my wife some questions and I want to know why the fundings been cut in half and one of the issues don 't met DP be operating on the council premises I 'm not sure what that means and I find this report a little hypocritical because the pilots report focuses on how important DPD is to the economy that Monsieur yet we 're talking about virtually having their funding other the thought that was the economic climate where face and the TPP is one of the organization week we should be supporting a hundred percent you know the report indicates they are experts in their field life anyone can increase visit number sixty P P P cancer just male indecision due to grant to fund Andhra commerce to their tune of 50,000 without DVD to help Chamber of Commerce virtually non-existent they need T we need to get the people here we recommend and relies heavily on terra 's reservoir so without the full support of DB d they business their risk of dying on that Thank You counselors are tired anyone else like to comment on the motion for Norman yes well I personally want to believe that this reduce finding 1440p DD will be the first step and the first paragraph of the report there 's an agreement until August which I find interesting because really tomorrow that should cease to exist I don 't know what the thought so despite my request for information something that 's happened there 's got to be continually agreement orbits now I find that very interesting I think we need to go back to beginning of the TP DD contract cycle three probably three and a half years ago Council and I 'll use that word as a collective noun so that means counts laws and many hours a much input into the parameters around the contract the CBI KPI speaking other the outcomes decide what marketing areas or demographics would be targeted and why it was through process which wasn 't random or strategic and developed by knowledgeable qualified people through a holistic approach so in the strategic framework the organizational plans the marketing strategy wasn 't professionally done who preferred effort within look for counselors and accepted by counselors for a counselors notion first of August 2017 was moved by Councillor carry significant for Casa Luker encouraged unanimously that past so now we 've been often a done deal of which counsel for had a counsel of the pack no part so what information has been emitted to get us to this point of this recommendation I don 't know TBD in the past have always delivered me regardless in the last report presented to jewbilee deemed to counsel the report highlights and difficult ER because of weather events and cold region stories and rampant and yet or still successors born on one organization one thing of particular note council funding typically just under 500,000 a year but the end of tourism expenditure generated because of TPP DS existence is estimated as up to five hundred and twenty million dollars not anime turned this reduced funding can only mean a reduced tourism influx into the area do not accept it I actually would like to make a to move another resolution that we bring out fighting back to the immediately you know I went to current contract and continued it for three years actually are you doing a permit emotion so you 're believing emotion has read it except to supporters of put that was dangerous it 's finding up the toy world last year four hundred eighty eight thousand four hundred and four dollars and fifty nine cents plus in the annual report applying and annual indexation of one point five percent per year for eternal three years for the resource of performance agreement dated data the first of july twenty twenty to thirty two June 23 first of July to the 30th of June twenty twenty three over three year contract and then as this you indexation excited yeah de X okay so counselor nollie has moved an amendment second I 'm counselors and mataró all those in favor of that motion councillor Knoll any counselors Emmett are those against counselor q1 counselors Common Council of Nations fail so takes us back to the original motion and just in comics that TP DD also needs a channel it 's one thing to get the tourists here but don 't enjoy themselves when they hear that I 'd come back so it 's really important that our businesses when they hear also you know enjoy the time that it 's a two-way street that 's why I think it 's extremely important than council TP DD and chamber are all word together in one direction to get us out of covert Monty so with that I 'll put it to the vote all those in favor of the motion Council of the curing cancer scums and council occur all those against against the cemetery council nali nali forward okay let 's keep moving on 5.7 gifting of the belly hula steam railway recommendation is the council results to note that the owner has recently approached Council with the proposal to give to the asset of the belly Hawley steam railway to counsel invite the belly holy steam railway owner to enter into discussions with relevant council officers to discuss this proposal and note that council officers will provide a future council report describing the details of the proposal and recommendations about the value of a steam railway assets and delegate authority under Section two five said in the Local Government Act 2009 to the chief executive officer to determine and finalize any and all matters associated with this commerson pan a second down council McEwen councillors commerce some you like to say it in towards this I think this is a great gift that 's been given to the rate payers of this shot because it 's going to be a great little tourist attraction for the shop and and it 's been around for a very long time gonna be hey it 'd be hard to see this son no longer existing if we don 't take up this great offer he wants to speak against the motion Hanson cemetery through you maker thank you look oh I 'm done a bit of homework on this issue this Valley home has been offered to a few other than organisation to life in decline it 's it 's not going to be a financial asset right now it 's going to be a financial burden there 's a lot of a lot of our finance involved in financing one of these operations there 's maintenance on the tracks is you know maintenance on the engines it needs quite a bit of work we 're looking at public liabilities cutting people I think it 's a bad move again for getting involved in this sort of operation it doesn 't make money you 've never as autumn it hasn 't for a long time and then we 're talking about staffing which at least I think you need a fireman a driver and because you have people on board I want to suggest you need God I need to carriage it 's I don 't see counsel should be getting involved in private in the Croatia I don 't think this is an asset council at all it 's going to cost ratepayers a lot of money to keep this thing going and that 's thank you thank you any other comments from councils yep I assume we 're just having a look at the feasibility of the plant so we 're not actually making the decision to throw take the train on it 's an internal cost yeah I don 't see any problem with having a look at it I 'd be surprised if it 's stacked up but I don 't know a lot of details happy for the stuff that they have a look and bring something to us but it 's got to be able to make money and not burden that right player and everything has to be looked at in relation to that every section inside to have a look at it at a later date on happy but the plants or any vectors councillor Knoll you say something yeah thank you Thank You councilman you are honestly do one thing it will stack up well but okay we can see we I have I 've had a couple of people approach me over the weekend quite anxious about this because it 's a bit of an explanation face this these people in the lower said that in particular the train engine itself and I 'll use my layman terms has to have a very specialized certified person to check out the safety because apparently the boiler stays at 100 central they are we can 't just have our guys go down okay so it has to be done by someone from the National Highway Authority safety or something like that there of the train there is also the flanges the undercarriage the turntable the cap Hollywood different things that have to be audited by a certified persons they can 't just a repeat has to can 't descend out lights down because if our lives go down there 's nothing gets there to you but they have to be certified that things may get missed and the person who in particular people who tell me about this they they think their penis is except I 'm going to happen that might not get picked up it 's not the proper authority apparently the proper authority to do this type of job is quite expensive tens of thousands of dollars to do this type of checking so this is a concern for me if this stacks up then it 's a good thing for the right I don 't have a problem but just to get us to that point is apparently it 's a very expensive business tens of thousands of dollars almost old now I have no want to get in the way of an investigation I 'm very happy perhaps we request the current owner to take on those costs and LED and get the proper auditing done engineering certificates done whatever another right pay up of Douglas and then when he has that Donald she has that done come back to us with all the certificates in place with all the safety standards in place and then we can work out what work whatever needs to be done to bring it up to power so my suggestion will say if we 're going to look into this further we asked the current one block out what the right pose just yeah from my personal perspective you know not only this is the valley holy service a great to receive assets it 's a it 's an absolute historical piece for this region blast working piece of this railway is a reminder of the incredible word Township Port Douglas once was sugar being transported by this very rail to the dot to be shipped off to its destination the decision to start sending the sugar to Ken 's via road that started the downward spiral of the population of was around 60 people were living here this historical piece of Port Douglas and for Douglas for that matter I believe is an asset that we should not lose and if the staff through a due diligence process can see that it 's an asset worth taking on I believe that this council should absolutely consider it therefore you know I have no issue in supporting this current motion to allow the staff to present the report to Council once an investigation has taken place now I 'm not interested in what I 've heard on the street I don 't know the financials of the valley wooly these are all things we need factual information about we hear lots of things that we walk around about different topics I think it 's it 's really important that we actually get the facts of this Bowie Bowie whether it is an asset that 's worthwhile taking on it 's not an asset it 's not an asset but at least let the staff do the due diligence which is what this motions or so let 's come back to us comments yeah Nikhil um I agree with heavy that we would want to spend money but I would imagine that the council staff would come back and say this stacks up someone has to spend 50,000 to get the foreign Olympics like that 's a typical robbery so in that point then we would have to discuss whether it 's worth excellent spending the rate payers money to get to that point because I pledge find out what that cost is in them so how are your economy sorry for the mayor I understand well you 're asking for now step two we put into the recommendation then to find out what the course started going further to find out what will in the business so through that you are just in the report that the counselors give back to us they might go and say that railway mob is going to cost us sixty green to get us a to be it and have that rain checked out we don 't spend that no but it comes back as a report then we can decide whether well we 're 's ready if I can don 't necessary close not spend the money but just find out yes resolute in the resolution point to invite the ballyhoo a steamroller hona to enter into discussions with relevant council officers to discuss the details of this proposal now that gives the staff permission to say we 're willing to discuss it but you need to get us the roadworthy or whatever it may be you know so we can 't assume these things straight off if there 's any there 's nothing in here about the council 's spending money here okay if they want fifty thousand to do that then it 's going to have to come back here for resolution it 's just purely to enter discussion myself okay so with that I 'll put it to the vote all those in favor of the motion no to unanimously carried 5.8 rocks commercial water usage charge for untreated water supply the recommendation is the council adopts the commercial untreated water usage charge businesses that utilize untreated water supply within the Douglass Shire if I can get a mover on this get just got in there cancer cemetery would you like to make any comments anyone like to speak against the motion any other comments from counselors with that we 'll put it to the vote then all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously or on 5.9 concealed leaked assistance concealed leakin Anne Shiell assistance policy the recommendations that council adopts the considerably financial assistance policy which is behind them if I can get a mover on that place councillor nollie and i 'm happy to second that one council knowledge try to speak to the motion thank you yes I 'm actually very happy to speak to the motion and move this this was initiative in the as which them in the background they the 1920 operational plans and snuck in that 's right this was initiative that I kind of wanted but obviously accepted by everybody it shows the vibe I think and or so and then the the willingness to assist people who have to go have these water leaks that to no fault alone I have to spread out of pain so we 've done and what would really truly assist people and let 's come up that 's showing on a policy and so I 'm very very happy to have to have this move to do this and then hopefully have it down thank you thank you cancel all anyone wish to speak against the motion any comments from counselors about the motion you can 't sneak human I 've had a couple people who who read this in the minutes and have sort of said just that they don 't think we 've gone far enough I 'm not compared with other other shyest happened in the state but I think we had a workshop on it we all came to an agreement and I think it 's a good start and yeah we can always review it if we find that it 's not what people would expect that I think it 's a good starting round and mold on to that from in this study off any other comments for now I 'd like to thank the staff of course pairing this document and as counsel and I said this that there has been a lot of work and thought that 's gone into this policy touching on what you said this policy is designed for Douglas either already had comparisons brought up comparing it to other council regions which in fairness as they say is like comparing apples and oranges when you look at the the whole picture of Douglas financially and otherwise this policy shows compassion and gives relief without throwing the burden onto other ratepayers to compensate what could well have been a lack of maintenance of its ongoing the policy not only has a straight stipulation to show what is available and how to achieve it as well as giving the CEO and the finance team the ability to consider other cases on a case-by-case basis for more serious relief if required which currently isn 't the case so I think it 's it 's a great policy with others and I absolutely think it should be today so there 's no other comments we 'll put that to the boat all those in favor and that 's very dynamically 5.1 Rose financial hardship policy and policy can I have a mover please counsel on the queue one second up councillors commerson council on the keel would you like to speak to the motion at all once again we start and every one of us very hard on this

yeah I 'm very happy to see this in here and been put through a council meeting publicly so it 's great to see that in there and I think it 's another external control that shows the public to the boats all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously 5.1 to expense reimbursement councillors policy the recommendation is the council adopt the revised expense reimbursement councillor policy as presented if I could have a mover please come councilors commerson seconded by on council McEwan councillors comes from the chi-lites make any comments to that place explains everything pretty well

accept the increased enumeration put forward by the local government renumeration Commission for the 2020 2021 financial year furthermore councilors including the mayor and deputy mayor will continue to be paid in accordance with the renew marae ssin schedule decided by the Commission for the 2019 2020 financial year and point to is that their enumeration policy is updated to reflect a zero percentage increase if I could get a move I 'm going to move that one if I can get a seconder for that please councillors an Atari anyone wish to speak against that want any comments from councillors cancel some Tara through you I was going to suggest I think councillors on accepting a pay rise wouldn 't look very good that 's money that can be used elsewhere in the community absolutely agree more any other comments from councillors all right we 'll put that have buck move it okay so we 'll put the amendment to the votes all those in favor that 's carried unanimously so that is now the standing moe so we need to actually clip that pavement so again so I 'll move that one as is now with the new motion if I can get a seconder for that cancellous chromosome and if there 's any comments or questions about it as it stands which they shouldn 't be that 's all good okay so put that to the vote has that format all those in favor of that motion and that 's carried unanimously right and I just like to thank councillors for this and that once you watch it is absolutely imperative 5.15 so we need to move a motion to separate two point three so I 'll move the motion to separate two point one point three from the operational plan if I can get a second there on that place councillors commas on pump anyone wish to speak against splitting it this new motion all right he wondered about comment all those in favor and now separate do we do that one first after you but don 't know just launcher one are specified obviously in the so if I want to do that one first and council McEwen good read the room and then come back and me I think if we do the operational planner data first so the recommendation will now be that 's intersection 174 the local government regulations 2012 council adopt the operation plan xx xx as probably the wording for that now we 're taking that one out what do we do that is the third recommendation 2.3 this will have to reflect excluding excluding so explain the connection 3 will be excluding item 2 point 1 point 3 so that 's what we 're just the first sorry through the chair the first motion will be that the council got the operating plan with the exception of two point one point three and then the second part will be that we move to point one point three and then the third will be that aren 't the CEO does them you don 't need them mr. resolutions yeah separate resolution so with so what what that needs to be is as you so I 'm going to move that we now make this resolution type of 1.5 be excluded from that document not yes so I guys did you actually have that all the separate day like this yeah I was commissioned to split it and this resolution is now the new resolution of the operation plan with you need to have two separate resolutions because you 're going to need to leave during one of them so the first one should be really what the original one was excluding two point one point three and all of the additional clauses around quarterly reports and CEO finalizing details and he 's there do you mean to have as a third point do you need to have the CEO find all this because that 's per Section 257 yes [Music] there 's probably worrying about that normally if the CEO finalized all these valves as per Section 56 s delegate yeah go against a story in the studio to finalize all the details okay in accordance with section two this motion police counseling and counselors commerson has seconded counsel McEwan would you like to speak to this motion now is the operational plan with everything but chip on one point three yes a bit the operational plan first yes okay well this is my first operational plan very interesting exercise we reviewed it a few times whilst I 'm happy with it there are things that were excluded that I was I was looking for Jude but I think it 's a good plan I think it provides a lot of good development for the area a lot of a lot of work for the council and people will see a lot of improvement in the Shire with this plane so on I 'm happy to support it Thank You counselors thank you hang on wish to speak against the plank place counts cannoli I 've a lot of comments and I 'll just stay to the side to start off with that I have actually important these comments in quite previous to this it will take a long time for me to go through it so just be an important aspect to count some business we need to look at them all I 'll go through them in numerical order my comments so the first comment I have it 's on one point 123 contemporary housing solutions for the requirement market I don 't agree this necessary should be in there at all first and foremost it is not council business this is a private enterprise and not an expense law concern that local governments will be considering private enterprise filling this space they researched the market as to what is feasible sustainable and profitable secondly the word in there that says the sentence description potential sale of council and revenue scares me what does that mean it 's way too broad I don 't like to see something like that in operational plan if as a shire as a council we want to encourage people to come into the Shire you actually do not want to the I reckon you 're looking at encouraging other families if the Train is that if you attract to come into a child I see anything the money you know if they spend more money on groceries clubs associations and charities food etc etc and they will actually bring their parents and grandparents into the shot so if you attract families into a shire this is what makes the shot of the book and growing and vibrant I 'm sure we 've all heard of those 1 properties or country properties the Shires try to attract young families in there by offering very very cheap properties now they have the right idea so trying to sell me the idea that a retirement fee listicle actually attract profit for the shire next one one point two point two what does pool so I don 't know that specifically to the cutie girl if it does I think we just carry out the mare a minute as stated I 've don 't have put that into the operation folk operational plan if it just talks about something else I don 't believe this is the year for that type of expense we could have we can eliminate that and bring the budget down next one well the value Huli 1.2.3 we 're already this is an opera greater plan initiative that I 'm very proud to speak on behalf of and its importance in this community I think actually all all councils sit at this table they were not quite human but had a probably born in this hospital so it 's a very important thing that we try to bring back over to facilitate so I speak very much in favor of that two point one point to another radical solution I 've spoken against this in the past and I will continue to speak against this I think this is money throwing away looking at this type of any kind of research or auntie or whatever for me this year it 's after the money trail away we do not need to exit excessive type of financial burdens on the Shire I will actually also argue that if if we go ahead and find out doing palin Sultan 's or whatever to do this investigation will actually find that it 's not a sustainable and feasible environment academically reliable thinking for the Shire and this happen ten years ago you know thousand people think since ten years going through a branch tip and leaving modern medieval garden ones okay I want more than for technical Garland had since I found out about it but I don 't like the wording and I had sent this way than even a couple of months ago and it hasn 't been change and I believe that I need to point out I think we should should change the wording of this I love the concept of the beginning of gardens of what the Senate to achieve I see quite akin to can grow and say invest in don 't hang I 'm trying to be proactive and I really and why this type of spirit so please I understand that but I think is important do you understand that I would like the wording to read a report is brought to Council which details projected expenses that will be incurred by the rates of novice to the development of the wasp and Douglas car epiphanic Gardens expenses may include trunk infrastructure predicted water park costs and loss of revenue through water rates this is and say Abigail what 's happening lieutenant Collins we like the idea but we 're concerned about what 's going to cost me as a rate payer and then point to would be wild how to recognizes the Muslim potential gardens is a private enterprise Council strongly advocated for funding for this project so we put again that was my suggestions two point one point six going to ferry I think we all know what I believe about that there will be a thorough consultation I believe that will come up to be Malik true results or what people what but I don 't think it 's needs need I don 't believe that 's needed an operational plan to point to but one DVD do I think you 've heard my arguments I think believe once occurred today is the best way for two point two point two to support of the Chamber of Commerce and once again I believe it 's the processes haven 't been correct with the Chamber of Commerce and it 's not necessary to have that in operational plan okay two point three point so we have to submit that we still don 't have the processes that being followed before we start carrying out these good ideas we must counselors must provide with a detailed summary of the outcomes of an economic agreement many possible suggestions this is number one Tama dudes either important accounts and upon account resolution the es IC passports objections are provided to the community for the public consultation accepted recommendations are implemented so as it is in the operational plan we just implementation implementing the recommendations that we have not seen you cannot see those council it 's not responsible yeah oh just you know you 're up to here at the site yeah yes thank you me I do appreciate that but it 's talking you I just want you to thank you okay by a preset 2.3.3 once again I think it 's a great initiative and I suggest that the wording around that initiative I think we should acknowledge but finally really efforts or they acknowledge them for the effort diversified I would probably like to see that an operational plan wording and confirmed by three point one point one the microgrid I am all for environmentally friendly and decisions the most potentially but I think it is really big mistake Jesus specifically the word microgrid because people narrow narrow field for the benefit of what it needs it needs to be more generalized and I would suggest very simply advocate for environmental fairy energy solutions the north of the data River once again these are all things obvious like second a couple of months ago so it 's not last second I 'm giving you this information using the word microgrid it 's a long way of going about things 3.2.1 a three-picture relation row obviously I 've spoken against that I don 't believe we need them in operational plans three point three point two reservoir I don 't think we need this in the mystery room this year it is an expense that we we don 't need on our books this year I really would like to see our staff hours and financial resources go towards the other goals of the second water intake and connecting the intake between wine bill and say any dollars that we possibly can for the ratepayers at least for this year there will be something made in the future for point two twenty one the planning scheme this really scares me we had our process that took around about five years before we voted on the current planning scheme in the last month or two all of a sudden I hear about there are problems and we need to relook at the plan scheme I fear that this means unfettered development three stories and higher lots of pathology agricultural land down to downfall of the sugarcane industry in Douglas I think we need to eliminate that we nearly there are no actual evidence yep nearly there and one other life speak very shocking for is indigenously is being something that was a couple of years refining it up tightly and I think that 's a great initiative which the rest I have no problem with as 50 something initiatives at most I 'm happy with they 're just so sweetly one thank you thank you very quickly any other counselors like to speak on the much time I can 't support this because somebody should bury him and make them I think all on the same page with I won 't go through them all again but I want to have support this operations name as a whole because of this initial I put this through again a discussion will be able that 's all I want to get rid of again thank you councils because of course some issues we put on there Chrysler plant is it worthy for us to go back to workshop and further discussing council McEwen did you have anything to say about the operational plan not further this that you know we 've gone through there 's some things that no I wasn 't fully in other word but that 's it 's a process it 's a process I 'm the front for a few times and as we 've worked out at the workshops there 's things in it they were just not going to all agree on but it 's up to a majority of councillors majority wants it then it goes through the majority don personally no each year the douglas shire council puts forward an operational plan that provides the operational focus and direction for the staff and we have to take this organization this operational plan provides the framework to support the the goals of the corporate plan by setting out their specific activities timelines budgets and measures which help to maintain focus provides transparency as a council that as it progresses through the delivery of the operational plan objectives this year 's plan I believe shows the essence of what the discernible cancer will be about as you go through each category you 'll see flavors that have been spoken about and ones that I personally believe will enrich the Shire and assist in our growth mentally culturally physically and financially for me there are some real highlights and whilst there 's too many to list all of them I hope that people will actually take the time to download this and have a look at our website and have a read through to see the incredible mental work this council does on top of its daily general business and things that the CEO and the staff for their assistance in creating this document I mean there 's a lot of work goes into it you know for me personally I look forward to seeing some of these initiatives and these projects come to life over the next 12 months so if there 's no other comments we shall put that to the vote all those in favor of the operational plan council McEwen ancylostoma some council occur all those against councilor gnarly councillors and a pharaoh with motion passes now if that the deputy mayor will need to take on the next item and I shall leave the room lost it 's discussed and the CEO my picture of God cancers concentrating on those numbers on they were right just like any motion yo ask for a mover and a seconder and forward against comment he 's got a second please what it 's about first yeah you can read it out we 've all of it out yep maybe if you 'd like to work the cycle okay I mean item two point one point three Green Street dining precinct someone to move that have some occurrence some of the seconded that pursuant to section one seven for the local government regulation 2012 Council adopt initiatives two point one point three Grant Street dining precinct of the operational plan 2021 to delegate CEO to finalize all details of the operational plan 2021 in accordance with section 174 of the local government regulation 2012 and three counter requires quarterly updates from the chief executive officer regarding the implementation of the operational plan the 2021 financial year including initiative two point one point three grant regarding recent ask for and against compounds any four and if all comments were kids three years teamate I made this point about the ground speed on increasing I think it 's in principle it 's a good idea but port notice suffers greatly from lack of parking the last thing that diverse needs of the moments to take you out I think this there 's 15 or so parking bays in there are being and that 's that 's quite a few and until it I requested a traffic study was done before that we even why I 'm a postal because I don 't think we can 't lose any more parking import buckets that 's one of the reasons thank you yes I also in principle in make out this but I the wording in that operational plan is way too advanced because it doesn 't talk about conservation we 've gotta go we have to work out public appetite for this in principle the might be fantastic we don 't know I think I will just be very happy with the wording changed I will mr. Genest we chatted to have syrup public consultation to understand the desire but dining recent long-range streets information presented the public journal during the confrontation appeared would include such things as costs timelines different options disruptions expected traffic traffic alternatives parking on visitors if positively embraced by the community then develop a concept plan and finalize the detail design in preparation for construction of reaching here I just think we mean to have that the step principle could be fantastic I think we would end up in which written into their change the wording around that initiative Jason happy with no I 'm happy with your suggestion for your consultation and yep would you like me to read it out again I don 't know it and then Brenda have thorough public consultation to understand the desire of a dining precinct along Grand Street yes of course a thorough public consultation to understand the desire of the dining room cinema on Green Street information presented to the public might during the consultation period would include such things acts in world what you 're looking at new brand new costs timelines perhaps of different options are different other options how it can be done different options traffic alternatives and parking alternatives [Music] then it just has counsel really for clarification on that because I 'll have to implement as we 've got two point one point seven which talks about parking solutions as well so are you you can just that refer to to private second all right whatever it is it might be very easy I just want to thank you so much and then a point point to I suppose if positively embraced by the community clarification how will we determine what positively embrace is what we bring it in solution I 'd like to add something I think the consultation really needs to be focused on the other businesses in the Madras and Street how they will suffer if there 's a sit down precinct there how much their business again this up I think they 'll be concerned about that that 's that a big part of the consultation yeah well I actually have people like to serve on top of things yeah let 's part of the consultation absolutely we 're really sure we would ensure that all the communities or through Port Douglas to absolutely Andy finalize the detailed design in preparation for construction in a new studio in preparation for construction in future year so that 's the last of it what a blue-cheese to each other so it is very similar to the wording there it just includes a very definitive public consultation wording have fun over the profession to have to understand not to have on the same to understand understand the desire of joining a dining precinct during the public during the consultation would include such things as presented in deed information presented Sonora asked the question of Miss Holden I 'm a little unclear does this remaining part of the operational plan if there was that everybody become part of the operational plan because the only thing you 're doing here is we 're moving Mayor occur from the decision to include it because of the conflict of interest so if this is voted yes then you will become part of the plan but in that case I 'll fight against all of the operational plans but I would support this motion so how does that work you 're just it 'll this amended motion yeah the operational plan has actually been adopted that so that has actually been adopted so you 're now having this on so I think from a governance perspective it 'll be acceptable into the plan understanding that you voted against some as well against the plan but that 's now been resolved that 's now the operational plan now you 're observing whether you can actually at this moment to that plan that is now the plan of the council and I were just determining whether you want to that doesn 't receive like 8.00 Newcomen 's lines to be reported I got maximized it 's a really good question so okay so now you need to go to the Bible know for what it stands for for the motion amended amended motion so we 'll record tournament animus later [Music] [Music] week was there but second birth a person member their head applies all right so that will bring us to leave reading the closed session things out so in the closed session today we have a traditional matter st7 5h local government regulation 2012 portable Sports Complex in coronation park muscle and your _"

really tricky I had how powerful company try and communicate on the Sun Hat for a whole day after a certain company disaster all that 's a good idea to learn how to use it and we cut an awful experience some of the really big company the during Rollins not chapter I still don 't know that small business has a great application where you have to spend a little time with so at the moment even though it 's an extension on the concentrate on Instagram because there is here with remember the question of the bus snapchat I can 't use it I tried that my daughter is 18 she young people get

great applications for disappearing program and see what to do with it yeah it 's probably know how was it hurt now but into the ground on the other hand is all about visual pornographic content and their owners are making up so if you can take photos of your products your services or your destination and that 's where all that action happened on Instagram and how to get around the app is one hashtag give me a ways have turned into a complete mystery to you oh yeah there 's a couple others let me try to explain it for you let 's say a second photo of something so the clouds in the background behind here you 've had a saying that a picture 's worth a thousand words yeah do you have a budget so cool tickle me well this photo is we could say classic color to sunrise and some people find that inspirational and comfortable point of motivational you get around doing this so I have had represents the subject matter in photographs how many do you try to think of it so you 're

social to the detriment of the rest of our online presence popularity possibility pictures to have some great on the vision of the living birds come to be mad but what come out of it is repulsive raving fans who do our word of mouth marketing from across the social network but we have so little controllers in network and there we 'll wait a minute and tell business is a poor motive effort into that following particularly on Facebook only fine now that they get almost no visibility across that following in fact observes that yesterday that sense of the people who like you on facebook only six percent of those people ever see what you post only six the pants so there 's a concert highly little percentage and avoidance of the part we need to pay for exposure across Facebook now but I think so many businesses who 've spent a lot of time and energy and maybe mother to is in pain social media people to help them build their into different values in social as well as many things bodies perform so I 'm i recently read that facebook has a practice things that I 've been laundered in to address council mainly the network more relevant so you can release critic therefore why I think it 's in decline cause if you have a think about something use your Indian ages something 's are still a little bit embarrassed about now notice you 're a teenager today and you have the problem of being as may be always reported by your friend so you have indicated that the company in case you have to be careful about creature taken photos of you and what is doing in public all I can say is I 'm so glad no more than the teenager is using social media and I reckon forward as we now many people keep their private life private and that worked thanks for probation if the people I now I 'm not sharing parts of their life that they used to solution addresses or the name is coffee or the traffic ticket of hazzard follow through people and this is a big problem for facebook because they 're an atomic form rely on the finals being inside that social networks looking at her head that we pay for so that 's why it can be decline and commentators been talking about it for about twelve months now but Facebook activity how they really want let me talk about talking about adjusting our focus what things are working really really well in 2017 well we live in the age of the online expert everybody into the expert at something here in or would they say yeah I knew a negative something if you don 't think you are an absolutely really really be because people nor your expertise as they called it on the front she does expert at making his life or maybe even dis entertaining them but every one of us have some expertise we 're sharing and our customers want to know what that is and there 's a massive online houses between the businesses who are sharing their expertise and educating their customers and the ones who just have really decrepid websites that it on home you 've educated customers and it might happen and so how can you take advantage of this internally and I 'm sorry it 's so not sexy but I need to write more thing they were are being present coffee waiting in disease yeah some people copy or maybe just absorb its really really happy to see that when you get one yeah yeah I don 't think the prisoners are accountable to the front door and you know how beautiful is about that it loves it like a popular new google lump it so the more you can write especially on your own website is better to you always do now Elvis whole lot of people and I 'll so how many people going to go home and write things hopefully shortly so do people but the shin genesis if you so what should your honor available things about things that your customers and your clients ask you on a daily basis that is the first thing you should start with is it end to those questions on your own website so that when they 're you find the competitors and then secondly the party websites which are most often neglected other half to the things that you serve so information about your past and your services I 'm how to tell you how many personal websites are being on we 're a little welcoming environment and there is nothing except the description of having the better than that there 's a fridge especially accommodation with are very very lean on content so what enter it in yourself think of your website as the song a salesperson you have to tell it just what we 're doing a lot right as much as you can take photos and in the chitosan videos especially if you 've got something that 's beautiful even unoriginal I also really like to help you to write articles for other people 's websites because everybody I 'd just like to say don 't write anything so any website that has some kind of journalistic players they want some content they want you to write something and then once you 've submitted to them completely so that they can publish it as can get into Huffington Post that 's when you 've really rich gold because once you get into homes and really why the website you file it useless and ratings go up dramatically I has a true of my clients recently get published and Huffington Post and then had a remarkable differences so it is not impossible for us here at one point learn to write on seeing the webex goes on and it published internationally check it out there and to see and if you don 't think what you 're not awesome buddy what I think you 're an expert and no Howie people pretty good ass without how 's it feel about that is bob is a little bit far greater physical cyclamen tom yes very good alright the next thing I wanted to do I had an exercise clean right now but you can 't do it what I 'm constituted is Colette your mobile phone and have a look at yourself online how much did this innocent have a look at itself Google yourself entertain over 20 but in terms of the agreement uttoxeter so reception area I also have a look at how use at my mom because many websites now push more than half of their traffic promoter but it 's fifty percent of people here your website are looking at it on a mobile phone the world of servicing recently in services are closed between one-third and one-half of people are seeing you on their mobile and the stats are always so much higher whenever you have any kind of advertising out there on the market place because everyone 's watching TV with the tournament has the review second Exodus so your other filing anywhere traditionally then our mobile website is a great a job as a person you are you doing so in other company has now shifted to a mobile-first an eye on policy so when we 're designing a website legal services on the mobile version of that website and then designed an Excel version because it 's become so much more so much more important where all the really dominant roles now that 's not slowing down so I don 't want how about us and how about as well oh no one else what makes me do for a mobile citizens also that 's a really good question you need to think about what people want to know from your business on a mobile so from some businesses that will just be raphy Allen maybe a location it might be your phone up our proper businesses who have a full e-commerce set up it will be going to buy from their mobile and so in that case I want you to go and try to fly for yourself so hard why some amazing company last week and I put a very interesting process which took me an enormous amount of time or more about 20 minutes and and I pressed the Buy Now button it so there is no motion which means I don 't know what happened to my credit card details I had a bit of a security issue and i called the company and they said oh I 'm sorry our mobile site doesn 't work that was really yeah that 's likely depending on the common sense if you are but how would for when they 're accessing the mobile version I 've been another life isn 't food and they have QR codes that 's on their products and when someone scan that QR code it then goes to a recipe on how to use that product so that 's why I was like pretty different because it 's all targeted around the projects but that 's all so everyone 's different how do we have things feel oddly i 'm selling product or product information so somebody 's checking you out to see how credible you are with benefits contact for example so then if I want you to jump in tomorrow and see how you look and how do you compare this will and try to boxing yourself again Jordan accommodation and tutors are really all for this I find that point of booking interesting to really come unstuck and those looking systems are either very very confusing here 's our mobile all they just don 't work so I think that 's the biggest kisses if your journey in commerce to tire you need to know how helicopters are have a good public view web stuff and me just how much my belt package or getting I 've been very surprised to see ladies refer to a client who 's a bit about atomic water and she also has her baby and in the last year who sales have dropped dramatically where they came from a local and that 's just as people got more savvy on a level so we were not talking for the new mobile version on himself [Music] Occidental files in fact now so it doesn 't make a really big difference so when secure recommendations for you for 2017 is to invest more time incipient us lost China retention method and move away a little bit from the time it used to be investing in social and then really working on that mobile version and getting that right and of course share _"

    "text": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to our online story time my name is Miss Prynne and I 'm from the Murray Bashar council I thought that today we might read a story about the sea hmm what animals live in the sea I can think of one I can think of an animal that has eight arms in two googly eyes can you guess what it is that 's right it 's an octopus now let 's have a look and what book we have here today okay so this book is titled there 's a sea in my bedroom and the author is Margaret Wilde and illustrated by Jane Tanner do you know what authors do they write books and illustrators they drew pictures like here there 's a boy in his bed with his toys on the floor and I can see water on the floor and a rubber duck I don 't know I wonder what 's going on there let 's have a look let 's find out david was frightened of the sea and here is David it was her huge with monster that gobbled didn 't like the sea not at all not one bit what do you think David is doing here I 'm thinking he is running away from the sea mm-hmm but he liked collecting shells he had fan-shaped ones some that look like trumpets some but look like courage animals teeth and look at that he has a bucket full of shells they were yellow and gray and pink and purple then one day he found a conch shell it was shaped like a pear brown on the outside and orange inside that 's a very special shell said his father if you put it against your ear you can hear to see inside hmm how could the big scary see get inside a small shell said David but he pressed the shell against his ear and he listened and listened then he heard a sea it was soft and growly and friendly David wasn 't scared of this sea not at all not one bit so he took the shell to his bedroom and put it on the chair next to his bed he felt sorry for the scene he could let it out just for a short while it was such a friendly thing all soft and growly so he 's dropped the shell and whispered come out say come out I won 't hurt you then he waited and waited nothing happened then he heard a swish swishing noise and as he rushed out of the shell [Music] it curled around his toes formed up his legs and beat gently against the bed david was getting wet but he didn 't mind not at all not one bit he flopped down in the water and hid his legs and splashed he rode in his toy box floated on his back and did somersault one two three all around him his toys bobbed in the water his red tugboat there is his red tugboat there it is right next to the to the yellow gumboots he 's yellow wouldn 't dunk let 's have a look there it is here there is his yellow wooden duck next to a crab and his blue striped sea plane whose tribe sleep seaplane found it it 's just on top of handfuls of foam the bubbles disappear quickly in his hand he laughed and laughed and laughed his mother and father heard him and cold what are you doing David what do you have David jumped into the waves then came up for air and shouted mom dad there 's a thing in my bedroom I 'm jumping into waves I 'm getting all wet there got there is David 's blue striped sea plane see in his bedroom said his father I see in his bedroom said his mother what is he doing they opened the bedroom door and peeped in there was David David swimming on the floor with his toys all around him but there was no see no see at all now if the sea wasn 't in David 's bedroom what do you think David was using I think he is using his imagination David sat up he touched his trousers and shirt and his hair he was drying well there was a sea he said well there was a soft growl a friendly sea it lives inside a shell it 's gone back now his it 's just a noise the shell makes when you put it against your ear I could see David 's red tugboat just under his bed but David knew there had been a sea in his bedroom there was even a small pile of sand underneath his chair look this he said look there I 'm going to keep it always I 'm going to put the son into a job but do you think the sand might have came from the sea being in David 's bedroom or do you think it came from somewhere else I wonder well shall we go to the beach tomorrow asked his father you could go swimming yes said David that would be fine he would take his kickboard his snorkel and his arse pained he wasn 't frightened of the big sea anymore not at all not one bit if you were to go to the beach what would you take with you how it pack some sandwiches separate and plenty of water and there is David in the water he looks very happy it doesn 't look frightened at all not you 've enjoyed that there 's a scene in my bedroom written by Margaret Wilde illustrated by Jane Tana and you know what I think it 's time for crafts I thought we might make starfish because we can find starfish in the sea and now my starfish is colored blue with lots of circles in it to make a starfish we are going to need you will need some scrap paper scissors rubber a marker a pencil some crayons and anything that you have in your house that you could use for patterns I have your slotted spoon a Lego baseplate I 'll out love these and also there are bigger circles on the other side a plight with a rough surface the lid from my lunch box if you feel it on this side rough and that 's what we need and this little bowl would make with nice patterns as well but of course please ask you grown-ups before you use any of these items from home specially the ones that could break so what were you going to do is using a pencil I 'm going course it 's a starch star-like shape with five Conan 's so I 'm just going to draw I think you know that most starfish have five now I 'm going to use the mock-up and just trace the pencil lines there goes one on the second arm the third one the fourth one and there is the fifth one you can use the rubber to rub out the pencil lines do you know that starfish like to eat clams and oysters they also would eat injured fish if they can find them pretty interesting isn 't it and one okay now we have our starfish and it 's time to choose a pattern what I 'm going to use is the Lego baseplate so what I 'll do is I 'll put my I place my starfish just on top of my pattern and I 'm going to choose a color my starfish is going to be to be green so with your crying just likely call us your starfish I can see some patterns happening I 'm really liking this pattern [Music] alright and I think it 's 's just cut it out from one arm to the other a smart vicious arm is actually cold a ring that 's pretty interesting to know how many ants do you have most starfish have five remember I think we hope to cutting is really a fun exercise to do and it helps the real ones develop their eye hand coordination because while they 're cutting they 're following the direction of the right down to the fifth note to create a 3d effect I 'm going to fold each arm just like that and when you 're folding make sure you create a crease right here in the middle of the arm oh we have two more up John 3 2 and the last one we have our starfish so I 'm just going to add our new starfish with the rest of the starfish that we have here so we have a green starfish we have a blue one purple one and red ones so give it a go give it a try make some starfish at home and I even made little ones I hope you enjoyed in your voice make reading exciting we hope you enjoy joining us today better online storytime it 's time to sing our goodbye song where are your arms alright Oh Peng shut them open shut them wave your arms up high open shut them open shut them time to wave goodbye everyone we 'll see you next time _"

    "text": "[Music] hello everybody hello everyone hello everybody it 's time to have some fun hello everybody my name is miss wendy and i 'm from the mareeba shire council welcome along to this week 's online story time today 's story is the three wallabies gruff you might have heard a story called the three billy goats gruff let 's see if this story is the same so let 's see if we 've got three wallabies one two three we do we 've got a dad and a mum and a joey because a baby wallaby is called a joey this book is written by yvonne morrison and heath mckenzie so they the author and the illustrator of this book far out in the red country dusty and dry was a wallaby family saying goodbye a dad mum and son wallaby 's gruff was their name that all had enough and the drought was to blame they wanted to look at a pleasanter scene where plants weren 't so brown but were luscious and green they hoped they would find somewhere leafy and cool with trees bending over a a group of wild creatures lived close to a pond around the pond 's edge a thick stand of trees grew with only a tight narrow path leading through this led to a ditch and to reach the far side was a rickety bridge where a yowie would hide the yowie was selfish and stingy and cruel and he wouldn 't let anyone else use the pool look here 's that tight narrow path and there 's the ditch and the bridge going over the top and there 's the yowie if creatures crept over the bridge where he 's at pit pat peter pat pitter pat pitter pat the beast would rare up from his damn hiding place with his sharp pointy teeth in a hideous face who 's that going pit pat down my private track i 'll gobble you up for my afternoon snack it didn 't take anyone too long to learn if you crossed yowie 's bridge you would never return look the animals look very frightened there 's a wombat and a possum and a koala and a cockatoo so the animals always avoided bath not bathing was bad but what was the worst was not drink was drinking my my puddles to stave off their thirst then into the clearing with all of their stuff who should turn up but the wallaby 's gruff here were luscious green trees it was shady and cool and to top it all off a sparkling blue pool oh it looks lovely doesn 't it little gruff said i think we should all take a stroll and have a close look at that nice water hole but mr gruff said i think my swim will keep you two go ahead well i have a quick sleep then mrs scruff added i need to unpack but it 's okay with us if you head down the track hop along and cool off it 's been hot in the sun i 'll come down and join you as soon as i 'm done all at once a koala yelled down from the trees don 't go down that track he cried stay away please a horrible yowie is living down there he 'll tear you to pieces you must too bright to be scared by a yowie i 'm sure he 'll be right i trust his good judgment and so does his mum the koala side sadly still worried and glum i hope he 's going to be okay little gruff was excited he longed for a swim to snooze was too boring unpacking was grim he bounced down the track through the tight narrow gap slip slap slip slap slip slap the yowie red up from the ditch underneath with his red bloodshot eyes and his fearsome sharp teeth who 's that going slip slap down my private track i 'll gobble you up for my afternoon snack oh watch out little joey no i don 't think that you should said that brave little gruff you won 't get much meat i 'm nothing but fluff my mother is coming she 's bigger than me why don 't you try gobbling her for your tea the yowie was greedy he quickly said yes i 'm keen for a big meal why settle for less go on then why don 't you take a cool bath or will happen when his mother gets there meanwhile mrs gruff had set up their new place and was longing to rinse off her paws and her face she bounced down the path unaware of the trap slip slap slip slap slip slap slip slap with his fangs dripping slime and his eyes burning red from under the bridge lurched the owie and said that going slip slap down my private track i 'll gobble you up for my afternoon snack oh no look out mummy i don 't think that you should said the wise mrs gruff i 'm not all that big i won 't fill you enough my husband is coming he 's bigger than me why don 't you try gobbling him for your tea the owie was greedy he quickly said yes i 'm keen for a big meal why settle for less go on then why don 't you take a cool bath i 'll wait for your hubby to come down the path just then with the snort old gruff woke from his kip and was ready to join wife and son for a nap slip slap slip slap slip slap slip slap yeah we ran up just the same as before through razor sharp teeth he let out a great roar who 's that going slip slap down my private track i 'll gobble you up for my afternoon snack and then he caught sight of the fierce mr gruff who was rippling with muscles wiry and tough poor yowie he just couldn 't believe his two eyes for once he had picked on a bloke his own size mr gruff grabbed a clump of the yowie 's long hair and said it 's high time that you started to share i 've got an idea of what might do the trick then he lined up the yowie and gave him a kick [Music] the yowie went sailing high over the pond and landed far back of the back of beyond look there he is there the animals watching let out a great cheer for now they could all use the pond without fear oh they look so happy what about the yowie wonder what 's happened to him as for the yowie score he found a new pond that was cool and inviting and hoped that his new life would be less exciting well he has found a nice place there it 's about to go for a swim oh what 's in the water what happened to thee howie oh dear i wonder if the sharks like to eat yowies i thought today that we might even make a yowie i 'd like to say thank you to everybody who 's been sending in photos of all of their craft that they have been making it 's really great to see all of your artwork so thank you very much now i 've made this yowie just out of a bit of cardboard that i had a line around the house and now i 'm going to make one with a bit of scrap paper so these are the things that we need we need some scrap paper we need some scissors a pencil and a rubber and some felt pens and i picked up some leaves from around in my garden if you 've got a catalogue at home or i 've done here is just put some bit of catalog that i 've cut up for down at the bottom of the owie so what we have to do is just draw a shape just got some scrap paper here and if we just draw the shape of the yowie he looks a bit like a blob to me let 's have a look and draw him so just need a fat bit for his body and then come up to his head and then come back down again for his body and then i 'll go over that felt pen there we go so there we have a bit of a blobby shape that 's going to be our yowie so cut that out if you like you can rub out the pencil lines cut around that black line around the top of his head and then round his body right down to the bottom snip all of that off and then what i 've done here is i 've cut the catalog up and i 've fringed it so i 've just cut it a little bit a piece of the catalog i 've got some scissors and i 've just made some little snips here so when you 're snipping slip up to about there about one centimeter down from the edge so just cut a rectangle out of your catalog and then cut some fringing along the bottom just cut up lots and lots and lots of times but don 't cut all the way through you cut and you cut and you stop cut and stop cut and stop all the way up you go all the way down your piece of catalog paper or newspaper or if you happen to have some colored paper you could use that snip it all the way along there we go just about through to the end snipping and snipping and snipping until we get right to the end there we go so you can see i 've taken that piece of paper and i 've fringed it so i 've got lots and lots of little strips there but they 're all attached at the top now at the bottom of your yowie we 're going and tape it on so when i taped that on i taped it so it overhung the bottom of the paper just like that there and if you cut up a few of them i 've cut these out beforehand and just sticky tape on a few layers just like that and another layer you can put on as many layers as you like and you can see this is actually getting a little bit wide look at the shape of the yowie but that 's okay because i will just get the scissors and i will just trim that off like that now before you put your last layer on let 's draw the face and color him in so you can see here he 's actually got two eyes and one is smaller than the other and they 're red and they 're in spirals so let 's draw them the little eye here and then a much bigger eye over there and then he 's got some nostrils for his nose and he 's got a very big wide mouth with lots and lots of teeth in yellow teeth because in the story looked like he had yellow teeth i don 't think i would like to have yellow teeth though or red eyes for that matter now i 'm going to draw it around that yellow because you can 't see it very well but if i draw around it then the teeth will stand out how 's he looking remember he had a purple tongue he had a very long purple tongue draw a purple tongue i 'll color that in there we go and then if you take some green felt pens and draw some green coloring in a bit with the green and i like to use a few different colors in there so i 've got a couple of different shades of green there we go oh he 's looking pretty fierce now look at that now i 'm going to get my last layer of fringing and put it on up there a little bit of sticky tight and then i 'll trim that off because it 's a little bit wider than the actual yowie and then around the top eyebrows there so if you get your scissors and make a few little fringing snips in there and scrunch them up it will make his eyebrows stand out look at that and with all the fringing down here i actually got in and i scrunched all of that up as well so while your child is doing this remember to actually make comments about what your child is doing rather than asking them too many questions because this gives them information from which that they can learn the child needs to hear a word 250 times before they can actually learn it that 's a lot of time so i 've got the fringing all scrunched up now and you can see here i added some leaves so if you like you can get some leaves and you can sticky tape some leaves on because i think that if he lived under a bridge there 'd have to be some leaves there and there we have our yowie how 's that i hope you all have fun making your yowie this week if you 'd like to send us a might have our goodbyes on now everybody okay let 's put our arms up high open shut them open shut them wave your arms up high open shut them open shut them time to wave goodbye goodbye everybody goodbye everybody thank you for watching [Music] bye _"

    "text": "[Music] hello everybody welcome back to our online storytime my name is Miss Perrin and I 'm from the Murray Bashar Council it 's Mother 's Day on Sunday so I thought we 'd read a story about moms let me have a look on what we have here our book today is called mom and me illustrated by any white you remember what illustrators do they drew pictures and it 's a very colorful one here on our cover are you ready for a story let 's have a look my mom knows just what I like she makes me toast weed Vegemite what other things you would like on your toast honey perhaps it 's nice and sweet she lets me wear my favorite clothes and paint pink polish on my toes what is your favorite color mine 's red maybe you will like blue my mom pretends that she can 't see and makes the bed on top of me there is a little girl she takes me to my ballet lessons I wonder if he can find a little girl she was wearing a green top your Roy there she is I 'm glad we found her and listens to my trumpet session Oh her teddy bear here it has his ears covered maybe a bit too loud for the teddy bear my mom makes soup to fill my tummy she really is a special mommy whoo you can see that they 're putting carrots and potatoes and I think these are leads for the soup she takes me riding on her bike I wonder where they 're going and joins in all the games I like do you have a favorite game but you play with your mummy my mom and play hide-and-seek we always win because I peek we love to jump and splash in puddles that looks like fun and when I 'm cold she gives me cuddles that is so sweet my mom loves to make me laugh when she blows bubbles in a bath I could how big that bubble is and her teddy here is covered with bubbles we watch the nice guy from afar and make a wish upon a star and when mom tucks me in at night can see a book here in his on her bed mmm they might just have written a bedtime story do you have a story that you like to read before you go to bed cuz I love mom and she loves me and that 's the way it will always be the end it was a sweet story now on Sunday it 's mom 's special day so how about we make a paper flower craft for Mom I love this craft because it 's super easy to make and they look really good all right so you will need some straps some pieces of scrap paper but if you have colored paper that would be better you need a pencil and scissors so I 'm going to use an orange paper for my flower today you can use your pencil but so that you can see my lines better I 'm going to use a mark on I 'm going to draw a spiral now in the center I 'll just have my spiral my paper this way now in the center I 'm going to draw draw a draw I 'm drawing my line to my right just like that and it doesn 't have to be neat but till you reach the edge of your paper that 's each now I want to make a round paper so I 'm going with my scissors I 'm going to cut my paper following this line here and when I get to this side I 'm going to cut right to the edge here on this side here okay so I 'm just going to follow the outside line of my spiral paper cutting craft ideas are a good choice when it comes to getting the little ones involved can help your children explore the creative side while develop developing their motor skills so keep cutting and keep practicing so from here I 'm going to cut strange you know what this reminds me of a snail 's shell now what I 'm going to do is I 'm going to start cutting along this line here until I get to the middle right on to the center of my spiral I forget it doesn 't have to be we are almost there a little bit more okay we 've got a spiral paper so while I 'll do next is that I 'm going to take the outside end of my spiral and I 'm going to use a pencil I need to wrap my paper onto my pencil to start with and while I do is I 'm just going to keep rolling my pencil wrapping my paper and when you 're rolling your pencil make sure that you are rolling out once so it means you roll from the inside out inside out inside out and try to keep your paper roll tightly around your pencil there you go in and out and I see get to the end of your strip you will find it 's a bit tricky but that 's okay and if you kind of roll your pencil anymore you can just stop from there okay it 's time to lose in a spiral oh and let 's have a look because see from here we are going to loosen our paper just like that and you see this bit of your little bit and here you go what do you think it 's a pretty orange flower and if you look here I made a purple one yellow pink red at this one out of a piece of scrap paper and I even found an empty egg cotton if you don 't have an egg cotton you can use maybe a bowl ribbon or even a glass to put your flowers let me just take these so on Sunday on Mother 's Day how about we make some paper flowers for Mom and make her day feels it make her feel special in that day thank you for joining us today and we hope you had a nice and fun time watching us and making our paper flowers I think it 's time to say goodbye and one thing I could by song where are your arms oh 10 shut them open shut them wave your arms up high open shut them open shut them time to

    "text": "[Music] hello everybody my name is Miss Wendy and I 'm from the meriva Shire Council welcome back to our online storytime today I 'm going to read you a story all about out to nowhere owls live in trees they make their nest in hollow trees what do L like to eat I think they like to eat mice did you know that owls are nocturnal so that means that they come out at night time to hunt I 've got a story today and it 's called our babies our babies and it 's written by Martin Waddell and it 's illustrated so that 's the person who drew the pictures by Patric Benson then you see on the cover I can see three baby owls one two three can you show me three fingers one two three well done yes once there were three baby owls one two three their names were Sara Percy and the littlest one his name is Bill they lived in a hole in the trunk of a tree with their our mother can you see the owl mother behind she 's looking our feathers in it it was their home watch the little owls I think they 're very happy in their little owl home one night they woke up and that our mother was gone where 's mummy I 'd Sarah oh my goodness said Percy bill remember he 's the littlest one I want my mummy said bill wondering where their mother has gone the baby owls thought all ours think a lot I think she 's gone hunting said Sarah to get us our food said Percy I want my mummy said bill look bills the littlest one but they 're our mother didn 't come the baby owls came out of their house and my sat on the tree and waited sitting on the tree and they 're waiting there 's Sarah and Percy and the littlest one is billed there was a big branch for Sara a small branch for Percy and a little bit of ivy for Bill she 'll be back said Sara back soon said Percy I want my mummy said Bill there is it was dark in the wood and they had to bring us mice and things that are nice said Sara did you hear that it 's a rhyming words then mice and nice those words rhyme they sound alike and remember I said before that they like to eat mice I think I was right she 'll bring us mice and all things that are nice said Sara I suppose so said Percy I want my mummy said bill can you see them right up there in the tree they sat and thought all hours think a lot I think we should all sit on my branch said Sara and they did all three together there they go along there 's Sarah Percy and Bill one two three can you count them one two three well time suppose she got lost said Sarah or Fox got her said Percy I want my mummy said Bill and the baby house closed they 're our eyes and wished that our mother would come they all love you can see their eyes are closed and she did you watch the helmet fly here she comes she 's swooping down she 's still up see her three babies sitting on the branch soft and silent she swooped through the trees to Sarah and Percy and bill Mumy they cried and they flapped and they danced and they bounced up and down on their branch and watch them see them there flapping and dancing and bouncing they 're very happy to see there our mother there she is watching them what 's all the fuss there our mother asked I knew you knew I 'd come back the baby else thought all ours think a lot I knew it said Sarah and I knew it said Percy I love my mummy said bill they all love their money I think they 're all very happy she 's back safe and sound I wonder if she bought them a mouse how babies do you think that mice would be nice for dinner I don 't think I want to have mice for dinner tonight I think I would rather have nice casserole I thought we might actually make an out I 've already made a couple of May one that looks like that and one that a piece of scrap paper and I use a catalogue that came in the mail but remember to ask your grownups first before you go cutting up their mail now the other things you 're going to need some leaves so maybe you could go outside and have a look around in your garden and see if you 've got some leaves thing you 'll need a catalog Oh cut along here and you 'll need scissors pencil and thick marker and some felt pens or coloring in pencils and even a rubber and of course some so I 'm going to use just a piece of cardboard that I found at home and I 'm going to draw my owl picture so you can see the Owls but yes and then a very round body and then he 's got two eyes it 's got two wins and a little beak so I 'm going to draw him I 'm going to use my pencil first to draw a little spoop and then down and around it 's very round 40 then I 'm going to go around the of his head and his ears and then around his body so then I 've got a shape like that but I think he might need some eyes to get my pencil again and draw some eyes big googly eyes because remember owls are nocturnal they go out at nighttime it 's very dark at night time isn 't it so you just might need to have big eyes to be able to see I 'm going to draw a triangle for his beak and then I 'm just going to draw two round ones for his wings like that I 'll go over it with the pen 1 I 2 googly eyes guys and a and he 's wings that 's what are you look so yeah and now I think I might cut him out sis 's chop around the outside just like is around the top of his head very curvy line this one I 'm going down down the side of his head and around his little round body now to decorate him just like I said you can either glue some leaves on or what just cut out some shapes to look like feathers out of a catalog so what I did is I got a sheet out of an old catalog and I folded it in half and then I fold a bit in half again and then again so then when I cut it out I cut four at a time then I 'm going to get my marker and I 'm going to draw two little shapes with a little bit like leaves that they 're going to be feathers today just like that well if I went a bit wonky then I 'm going to cut them or not round around so then when I got them puffing up I actually have quite a few cut out at the one time it 's a bit tricky isn 't it okay well when you 've got lots and lots of the little feathers cut out and you can glue them on I 've got my glue stick here whoo all over his body where I want the feathers to be and just stick them down just like that lots of feathers if what miss Wendy did was to color them in so you can either use felt pens or your crayons and you can just color them in a little bit just like that just to give him a little bit of color abused Brown and now I 'm going to use our range and then I 'm going to use some yellow but you can use whatever color you like I 'm thinking that 's nothing very much like an owl now what do you think you think that looks like an owl just use a little bit of spray a lot of hours maybe you could even go out in your backyard and see you can find some other birds that are flying around in your yard I think you 'll find lots of them so everybody all the grown-ups remember that 90% of your child 's learning occurs before they 're 5 years old so remember to talk play sing and read with your child every day it 's really important to get those brain cells moving so let 's have our goodbye song ready for down arms up up high open shut open shut them time to wave goodbye bye everybody _"

back upstairs into the bedroom into bed under the covers is that you all are you hiding under the covers we 're not going on a bear hunt again is the babe he looks a little bit sad he smilingly maybe he wanted to be a friend do you think you might like to go on your very own Bay hunt if you do maybe you might need a pair of binoculars I 'll show taste you need to make a little bit out of the way there okay so I made a pair of binoculars so I can come on up and we used a couple of roles that were around the house and some scrap paper but if you don 't hand rolls it 's okay because you can 't just use some kind of board so I 've just used an old box here I 've just cut it to size and I 've rolled it around and then I stapled it up one staple at the bottom one staple at the top had two rolls and then I stapled them together a little bit hard to fit in there what really encourage your children to help with this it 's really good for their fine motor skills hey I think I 'd like to put something around it to make it look a little bit fuzzy I 've just got a piece of scrap paper yeah I 've already cut it to size I 'm going to wrap it around my binoculars like this and then I 'm going to staple now I think I want a string to go around my neck come on use I 'll put a hole punch here so I can punch some holes in it so I can attach the wall but if you didn 't have a hole punch at home that 's okay ask one of your grown-ups to put a hole in there for you it could be a little bit tricky so make sure you get some help with that one piece this piece here hook the wall around your neck make sure it 's long enough slip it off and then I 'm not saying that here lots of incidental learning happens at home so talk to your children as you 're doing this talk about how you 're pushing the string through the hole and how your time that knot and really encourage them to do it with you now I think I might like to decorate it it 's all I 've got crayons here I 've also got a big heap of scrap paper if you don 't have things like that maybe you might have a pictures out or glue some pictures onto it what you might like to draw a little picture and put it on there it might be easier to draw the picture before you put it onto the populace draw some circles oh that 's red oh I think this might be turning into a smiley face okay a nice little smiling face and then put your binoculars on whoops make sure you tie it up properly and then you can go looking for your bass maybe you could go for a walk around your yard and see if you can see any bears there you can 't see bears maybe you might see a bird maybe you might look for well maybe you might look for some pretty stones it could even get your grown-up to help you write a list of things that you can go looking so that 's all for today everybody I hope that you enjoyed our story we 're going on a bear hunt next week tune in for another story from marie bochet council let 's have a little goodbye song let 's put

    "text": "as well so this is our second master class of the series today we 're talking marketing so it 's called event marketing 101 and really what it 's about is giving you a a really clear appreciation of the importance of marketing for your event but more importantly some key elements that you need to think of to ensure that you get the outcomes that you want from your marketing activity because we all know that regional events have tiny tiny budgets typically for um not just their marketing to run their event full stop so this is really about how do i actually make sure that i 'm investing my marketing budget into the right place but also how do i make sure that i 'm actually achieving the outcomes or that we 're achieving the outcomes for our event from our marketing investment so i think we 're all familiar i can 't see any unfamiliar faces so everybody is now aware of who i am uh linda tillman and i 'm the founder of uh reevance academy so this is all about trying to build the supporting them to [Music] essentially make their job easier you know trying to get the back end of the event in order so that there 's more time to actually focus on the fun creative elements that most of us volunteer um to actually do so i won 't go into the detail there you 're all familiar with who i am if anyone at any point has any questions um about me let 's not make it too personal but if you 've got any questions about my background or what we do at revenge academy then i 'm more than happy to chat to you now just bear with me i 'm just keeping an eye as well on any new participants coming into the call but looks like we might have everybody now we 're all recording fantastic what i wanted to do before we start is just check in and see if there were any discussion points or questions that you may have from session one we talked a lot about more strategic planning for your event how to create a business plan the importance of vision and the goals and understanding the direction that you 're going in for the event so you 've got that focus so does anyone have any questions about setting up their business plan um you know creating that rich event experience or maybe you 've got something you 'd like to share in terms of what you 've been able to implement based on the learnings from last week 's session anyone is welcome to unmute themselves if you would like to jump in and ask anything before we change our conversation over to marketing or is everyone pretty comfortable with what we covered last week uh linda it 's deslay hi desley uh yes sorry i wasn 't sure if you can hear me i 'm on my phone today so you 'll have to excuse me if i 'm a bit tech um tech lagging uh no it looks good we can see now that it 's perfect uh very in interesting that you said about the the stages of the event and that the mature event can have its life cycle i think myself and i that some events that we 've helped run in the past certainly did have a life cycle and it 's it 's good to know that you can say call quits and i thought the 15 change rule was um an absolutely wonderful um idea for even just uh organizations rather than just events anything that you 're doing in organizations the way you do things could be changed every so often to make it a little bit more invigorated thank you thanks desley yeah look it 's always um it 's always a bit of a an eye opener when we have that conversation about the life cycle of events because i think as volunteers in a community when you get involved in an event you 're so passionate and you put everything into it and i think you 've reached that point where you think we 're not going anywhere you know what what 's happening and i 've worked with a number of events in that situation and sometimes you can 't_''_273.52 force it you know you can 't_''_275.12 force it you can certainly look at that have to also just be mindful of when an event has reached that point and also when the community and i worked with an event near toowoomba and it was a really good example actually because it was a very small rural community and they had been running this very successful event for five years and the event basically out had outgrown the community they created this monster you know it was so successful but the community got really tired and they had to stop and pause for a moment just think okay why did we start the event in the beginning and revisit what that purpose was to determine whether they had achieved success because sometimes we get sidetracked you know and we can go in all different directions and because that community had got so tired and they just said what are we going to do how can we try to reduce numbers how can we try to manage this load um and then they just said do we really have to keep doing it if we 've achieved what we wanted to achieve um so like i you all go and cancel your events because that 's not what we want because events are fantastic for communities but it is important to understand that they do have that life cycle anyone got anything else they 'd like to share from last week or any questions or happy for me to dive in to this week 's topic i 'm going to take silence as we 're happy to go so that you don 't feel like you have to always respond to me i 'll always give a moment for comments and if i don 't hear anything i 'll just move on okay so today as i said to you at the beginning we are structuring it slightly different in that we 'll have some discussion time throughout so i really encourage everybody to actively get involved in the conversation so as i 'm talking to you about different elements throughout our session today i want you to always be thinking about your event what does that mean for our event ask yourself how do we currently do that for our event and could we change with your event to understand if you 've got any particular questions because this is an opportunity to pick my brain so please don 't be scared to do that so today as you know we 're talking about marketing so this is what we 're going to cover we 'll be looking at profiling ideal event attendees this is a really important conversation when we 're talking about uh marketing and you 'll know and you 'll see why in a moment we 're going to look at how you can articulate your marketing objectives and kpis so many of you would be familiar with this term kpis it gets thrown around a lot particularly if you apply for funding you 'll be asked to talk about what are your key performance indicators essentially that is what are you trying to achieve how are you going to measure success and we talked about that a bit last week but this week we 're looking at it more specifically from a marketing perspective we 're going to talk about how to get cut through in a very crowded marketplace so that they 're working with to deliver on their marketing activity and as we know the marketing landscape is super super busy it 's very crowded there 's lots of activity happening everybody 's trying to promote their event or sell an experience or sell a product or service so it 's a very crowded marketplace and it 's really important that we understand how to get cut through so that the audience that we want to hear about our event does actually hear about it and that 's where our return on investment comes in i 'm also going to share with you some tips on creating a coordinated and a phased approach to marketing your event so just trying to get a bit of structure around your marketing activity so that it 's not you know just firing out messages all the time how can we be a little bit more structured in the messages that we put out or the promotion that we put out for our event at particular times and then finally we 've got some local and free promotional opportunities to share with you we 'll have moments throughout where we can open up the conversation and discuss various points in relation to your particular event now i 'm really keen to know and i 'm going to just share a poll here in a moment as you know i like to do polls and it gives me a sense of where everybody is at with this particular topic so i 'm really keen to understand who knows in detail now that 's the key do you know in detail who your ideal event attendee is and also do you have an annual marketing plan and a schedule of that marketing activity for your event so just bear with me one second here all right so you should see that on the screen now if you could just quickly respond to those couple of multiple choice questions if you 've got any other comments in relation to that happy for you to take yourself off mute and share and don 't forget as well we 've got the chat box so at any point if you prefer to type your questions or talk via that way then more than happy for you to also communicate via the chat box and i 'll make sure that i check that each time we pause for a bit of discussion okay we 've got a couple more to go so i 'll just give it another 10 seconds and then we 'll close that pole off anyone else want to jump in and respond okay so interesting um yes somebody does know who their ideal event attendee is but not in detail um and the majority of you have responded with we welcome everyone now i 'm going to challenge that once we get started in a moment because i i tricked you a little bit putting that one in there because i wanted to see how many people would respond to that and this is one of the reasons events get a little lost in terms of their marketing activities because they 're not very focused and targeted so it 's okay to go we welcome everyone but it 's also very very important to know who 's our ideal event attendee and we 'll talk able to really um explain why that 's super important from a marketing perspective nobody has an annual marketing plan and schedule for your event um would anybody be willing to just share with me if you don 't have an annual marketing plan or schedule which is fine and most events don 't um how do you decide where to promote or market your event what 's that process for you oops sorry my phone 's ringing i need to turn that off it 's susie with the show we just sort of have a bit of a discussion on what we 're going to market for this time of the year and how the events going and then we usually at this stage just do most things through facebook um and through the different facebook groups and susie is that because it 's an affordable option for you yes because we don 't have a lot of marketing funds yeah all right thanks for sharing that susie all right let 's get stuck in now this is a really important message or question with so many options available marketing activity to undertake to get the best results so it 's like susie has just said is it about sitting down and having a conversation with the team looking at your budget and identifying what you know the more affordable options are for you to promote your event to appeal to a bigger audience or or a broad audience how does how does that decision take place it 's it 's a tough one and a lot of events struggle with this so a lot of the work that we do from a consulting perspective around we develop marketing strategies and different things for events and one of the key questions i get asked from a marketing perspective is we only have this would be a scenario right i 'd have an event contact me they 'll say oh we 've only got two thousand dollars to do marketing well we 've only got five hundred dollars to do marketing we don 't know where to spend it where should we spend that should we do it in our local newspaper and radio should we do social media should even 2 000 that 's a real challenge to be able to understand or know where you 're going to get the best return but if you know who your customers are who your visitors are who your attendees are who your participants are whatever you call them if you know who they are in detail then that 's going to answer this question for you so before you can choose any marketing activity before you can answer this question and understand where to invest your five hundred or two thousand dollars the most important thing for you to do as an event is to know intimately who your ideal event attendee is so what is that you 're saying what is an ideal event attendee it 's you may have heard the term target markets you know it 's a very it 's much the same in the event world we call them the ideal event attendee because it 's not saying that these are the only people that can come to our event but what it 's saying is this is the ideal attendee for us i want you 're currently getting the attendees that you want through the gate at your event do you actually know what type of attendees you want through the gate at your event i had an interesting discussion yesterday um with some events and there were a couple of events there were actually um race days in regional parts of queensland uh and they were saying that they their event has grown so much like beyond their capacity essentially um and the most interesting things that they 're trying to manage so this this is what they identified as their biggest challenge the audience has changed so they used to get a lot of grey nomads and older uh visitors to their race day and in the last three years or so they 've all of a sudden started to get a younger crowd and they 're not sure about that because they 're not they 're not really keen on the experience these younger ones are wanting they say they cause a little bit more trouble than the grey nomads they make more mess um so it 's a very different nomad so for that particular event they actually aren 't getting the attendees they want through the gate how do you change that because that 's almost kind of demand has created that so it 's an interesting thing do you think you know that you 're getting the attendees you want through your gate a lot of people would respond to this and say oh yeah i guess so yeah maybe maybe we are maybe there 's some that we don 't really want either you know you might think oh yeah there 's a few fantastic customers or visitors and they love the experience that we offer they 're always giving positive feedback they promote us through positive word of mouth but then there 's some customers you 're probably thinking no i 'd probably prefer they 'd stay at home they 're troublemakers they make mess you know they they 're always serial complainers it 's really hard to satisfy their needs and expectations so it 's really interesting when you start to think about it are you getting the attendees you want through the gate at 's the type of person you want at your event for a number of reasons they may come to your event every year they may be advocates and promote your events so spreading positive word of mouth they offer good feedback they bring their friends they align with the values of your event and that 's really important maybe they even align to the values of your community so you need to understand the type of attendees you want through your gate and you also need to understand that not everyone is ideal for your event so when we say we 're marketing to everyone and we welcome everyone you need to just think about that because not everyone is ideal for your event you can 't possibly offer an event experience that meets the needs and expectations of everyone now to attract more people sorry more of the people you want so your ideal event attendees you have to intimately understand their traits um dispositions you know the geographic location of where they 're coming from so that 's where you need to really get to understand them because little five hundred or two thousand dollar budget is going to be focused on those attendees that 's what it 's about it 's not saying okay this is an exclusive event for that type of person only although you could do that there 'd be no reason why you couldn 't_''_1260.159 but that 's not what this is about it 's not saying this is only for that type of person what it 's saying is that 's the type of person that 's ideal for our event so we 're going to invest our marketing budget towards that type of person because we know we can offer the experience we know they 're going to have a good time we know they promote the event for us we know they clean up their mess and you know really respectful types of visitors so they 're the things that you need to uh i guess determine around your ideal attendees so does that make sense are you currently getting the attendees you want through the gate it 's an interesting question to pose to yourself so how do we you need to do a bit of profiling and you probably already know a lot about them and probably more than you actually think but what you need to do is sit down and actually do some profiling so it 's a bit of a brainstorming session similar to you know last week we were talking about you know identifying your values and themes and that type of thing and i suggested you get little groups of people together to brainstorm that kind of stuff well this is the same thing sit down and really start to think okay who are our ideal attendees and you want to start looking at things like what are their lifestyles and what are they interested in how do they purchase event tickets where do they live how often do they travel is there a certain time of the year that they travel you know grey nomads are a good one we all know that they 're kind of on a bit of a circuit so you need to understand that if that 's your market you also need to understand you know what they actually seeking out you know are they looking to educate themselves are they looking to connect with their families well maybe they want to immerse themselves in a new culture so it sounds a bit creepy but but you 've got to kind of really get to know this type of person because that creates your ideal event attendee profile so a few a few practical ways that you can gather some of this information to get to understand your ideal attendees as i said do some brainstorming with your team so really sit down and have that discussion around who do we really want through our gate and just start noting just just scribble down ideas and we 're gonna do a little bit of that in a moment you can also talk to your visitors face to face so this is where you know doing that post event review talking to visitors at your event doing your surveying trying to find out as much information about them as possible you can always send out surveys to previous attendees and don 't be afraid to do that sometimes you know asking them too much it actually shows that you 're trying to improve your event to suit their needs so if they are your ideal event attendee then they will really take the time to put into providing quality feedback for your event another really cool way is to listen to listen to chatter on social media and also not just about your event but themes related to your event so if it is a racing a horse racing event what what are people talking about at other horse racing events what do they like what don 't they like what frustrates them so you can actually jump on social media and just do some stalking in a very nice way you can research with google so we we have access to so much data and analytics these days that we 're able to do do some research into the kinds of people that are also coming to our facebook pages or coming to our website so if you do have google analytics set up you 're able to look in the back end and determine uh who of those digital platforms if you have them can give you some insights into who is interested in your event where they 're from etc there 's also research out there as well so you can also look at tourism research australia this you know read your regional tourism organization so out but queensland tourism will have some data to give you some insights into different types of visitors coming into the region so once you start to gather all of this you start to paint this picture of your ideal event attendee and some people even create personas you may have heard that term before so creating this persona and and they give them a name and they put a little image you know so they might go this is um you know uh joyful julie for example you know and they 'll have a little photo um that 's representative of her age and stuff like that and then they start to talk about joyful julie you know she loves a good time always looking to hang out with her friends you know she 's from brisbane um create a real life profile of who your attendee is it really helps when you start looking at your marketing activity because what you then do is you start to go okay where is joyful julie searching online what media does she consume when does she buy tickets or how does she buy tickets does she like to go into visitor information centers or ticketing booths or does she pre-book a lot of her stuff online so it 's really starting to get some insight into the habits of your ideal event attendee all right i want to hand over to you guys so based on what i 've just talked about tell me what you think what do you know who your ideal event attendee is or who you want to come through the gate at your event with the show we want more um competitors and do you know what types of competitors and where they 're from and the detail around that have you ever profiled them um no not really like we just think if we can build up our competitors for say the ring events more people through the gate yeah so it has that that flow on effect doesn 't it more competitors equals well that equals more entertainment right so your competitors are somewhat your entertainment um yeah yeah so then therefore you 've got more in your program and can attract more people and they also have friends and family right that they 're bringing they turn up with them all the time too yeah yeah and so have you ever it 'd be interesting to just really start to look at the detail around that and go okay you would obviously break it down if if i was you looking at uh different competitors for a show i would start breaking that down based on the types of events so you know whether it 's equine or sheepdogs or whatever else is at the show you know start to break it down and go because they 've got you know they 're very much focused on a particular interest yeah so when you talk about facebook what would be um a really good opportunity would be to look at different facebook if it 's the equine events in the arena then you 're obviously going to start looking at those different disciplines on social media and seeing where you can possibly do some targeted promotion so this is all about going who are they so that we can target our marketing activity to them what i want you to try to get away from is the broad messaging of events there 's certainly a place to do some of that but when you 've got such a small budget you have to be really targeted so how can we target particular you know event types or demographics for our event to try to build that reputation and then if you deliver a good experience and they are the right type of person coming through your gate then they 'll start doing the marketing for you and that 's when gold happens because you start to create what we call loyal loyal advocates you know so they love what you do they know that you always look after them you know they know you deliver a good experience it 's a total an experience so they just go and rave about it you know everyone talks on social media spread the word bring their friends or invite their friends that 's where you want to try to get to but you 've got to be able to know who those people are to begin with and it 's not about having one as well sorry i should have made that clear too it 's um you might find that you know when we talk about ideal event attendees you might create two or three or five different profiles you know i wouldn 't try to get too many but you might create a few different profiles of the type of attendees that are the best fit for your event how 's everyone else feel about that does it make sense is it a process that you can see would help in terms of understanding how to promote your event yes yeah and it 's once again it 's one of those things you know that a lot of events don 't take the time to just sit down and think through who can do it and you can really understand and everybody on your committee understands it also starts to help you create the experience and and add new elements you know desley the 15 rule that we talked about last week if you know who your ideal attendees are and what they love and what their interests are then you can start to also integrate that into the event experience as well because it 's one thing to do promotion and promote your event to ideal attendees but you then have to be able to deliver the experience if we don 't deliver the experience it 's a waste of time and money doing the marketing and promotional activity desley you 've just said in the chat box just doing it just do it on the run is that in response to knowing who your attendees are so it 's just you feel like you know them it 's just happens on the run is that what you mean by that yes that 's correct linda when you asked how do you set about working at your target audience and i just done you know at a meeting or whatever but there 's nothing scientific about it it 's just what you think who is your ideal attendee if you don 't mind me asking oh well tell me to go away if you want currently currently for the committee i 'm involved in it would be a group probably young to not so young adults that would enjoy a fine dining experience as well as some good entertainment um music and let 's say a delicate way of putting it had the ability to help in the fundraising efforts in other words be happy to you know buy something in an auction or contribute in you know in one way or another not necessarily buy something at an option but to to know that uh the people that are coming along and wanting an experience as well as wanting to fundraise for rfds and that 's important you know that 's really important to know that um you know sometimes you feel a bit awkward don 't you because you 're like i don 't really want to say that but if that 's the purpose of the event if your event is a fundraising event then that is a critical component in terms of who your attendees are so if you 've got a room room full of people that you know for whatever reason possibly financially are not going to be you know big purchasers then your event 's not going to achieve the desired outcomes so it 's okay to note that you 've got to be upfront i think about that in your planning yeah yeah yeah and i mean and the setting the price of the tickets as well absolutely anyone got any other thoughts on ideal event attendees before i move on or anything they 'd like to to share do you absolutely know who your ideal event attendees are jane you 're nodding your head who are your ideal event attendees sorry to some mute myself and sorry for being late everyone um but we 're having a welcome party a barefootballs welcome party in on the 27th of february um and it 's part of our multicultural welcoming and kind of attraction target audiences one of them being new residents and within that there are some subgroups so we 've sort of got teachers um sort of new medical staff nurses doctors police officers those sort of professional people that are new to the district because they 've had too many people work um then there 's our sort of multicultural residents most of them are here for work purposes as well but they 're perhaps or some of them bought businesses so they 're a slightly different group um and they 're a little bit more difficult to target because they 're not just attached to an organization you know we can 't just send a notice to we can send a notice to the school inviting teachers to come whereas we can 't necessarily um with the others and then also we want local residents to come along as well because we want it to be an opportunity for these new people to actually meet members of the community that that are more established here so that they can make those connections it 's kind of about manufacturing an opportunity you you 're welcome okay i 'll also note via kim i 've also provided a worksheet so that worksheet is a bit of a guide that will assist you to think through the process of identifying your ideal event attendee so it asks lots of questions and some of it you may be able to answer some you may think oh look that 's we just don 't know that about them and that 's absolutely fine but i encourage you to have a look at that so if you 've got the opportunity to sit down with a couple of other people that are involved with your event and just talk through those points it 'll help you start to get that picture of your ideal event attendee which is going to give you the information that you need to better target and focus your marketing activity and to get better outcomes from from your marketing budget so once we 've got all of this information about our ideal attendees so we know who they are we 've got that intimate knowledge of them what do we actually like i 've been saying it 's an opportunity to focus your marketing activity so what we want to do is we want to use that information we want to use the knowledge that we have of our ideal attendees to cut through this busyness of marketing because what happens if you don 't really know who your ideal event attendee is then you could actually be spending money and also time targeting people that aren 't even really interested in your event or they 're the ones that you would rather stay at home so you have to really understand who they are in order to optimize the outcomes from your marketing spend so if you 've got 500 you want to get the maximum return for where you spend that 500 whether it 's on social media or with the local newspaper or radio or whatever it may be you need to know where to spend that 500 so the right people get the right message and come to your event but also once you know who your ideal attendees are this is when you can start to program match the needs and wants of your ideal attendees so you think about like i said before when i gave that example of the race meeting that 's actually now starting to attract a younger audience over what they were traditionally used to which was the grey nomad and they 're not really sure how to deal with this that 's because it 's a complete different experience that each of them are wanting the races are obviously the the non-negotiable if you like but in terms of the other activity that happens around the horse racing grey nomads versus a younger you know uni students or you know young couples they 're a very different experience and therefore they impact the program that you develop you also need to consider things like the date of your event is it suitable for your ideal attendees you know if it 's for uni students then is it in the holidays or is it over a long weekend if it 's grey nomads for example then you need to consider that migration of gray nomads to know that it 's going your particular area so you need to think about the date also the price structure so does the price structure suit the market like you were just saying desley you know knowing that that 's the type of audience you 're looking for then you set the price of your tickets accordingly so you know uni students living on a very low wage if anything can 't necessarily afford you know high premium price tickets versus you know a professional couple perhaps from metro or even from regional area the price structure will be different depending on the the market and the experience that you 're offering it 'll also allow you to determine if you need payment plans you know if if you need to have payment plan options in place and what types of payment methods you need most importantly it allows you to understand the marketing channels that 's going to reach them so are they on facebook instagram or twitter or are they on all of them you know the uh the saying at the moment is you know that our parents i 'm putting myself the younger ones are now on facebook and even the grandparents are on facebook and all the young ones migrated to instagram and now they 're even moving to tick tock so even social media is really interesting to watch in terms of the types of people that are using the different platforms once you know who your ideal attendee is you can look at what other media they often refer to it 'll also let you determine what key marketing messages will resonate with those audiences because you need to capture them right so when there 's so much marketing activity just picture yourself right now and how many marketing messages you 've been exposed to even in the last 24 hours think about scrolling over facebook think about looking online on a website how many ads have popped up on there think about the radio that you may have listened to on the way to work think about you know tv last night you know there 's always so much noise from a marketing and sales perspective everybody 's trying to sell us something so you need to audience so that they hear it and you also need to think about once you know your ideal attendees is how do i convert them into loyal advocates what 's really important to them what are their values how can i deliver the best experience ever for that type of attendee so they go away and rave about the event so you can see how it 's you know it 's it 's totally about marketing and being more focused and targeted in your activity but what it does is it allows you to create an event that is relevant to your market and these are all things that you know all i 'm saying is you once you 've got your ideal attendee you need to line it all up next time you 're having a conversation with the committee about the date of your event or the price that you 're going to charge for you know a new ticketed component of your event i want you to be the one that says hang on guys this is not about what price we think it should be what should always put yourself in their shoes whenever you 're making those decisions about your event put yourself in your attendees shoes so now that you know who your ideal attendee is i 'm going to say that you do know and i 'm sure right now you 're kind of going oh my god yeah they are okay it 's that kind of person start as i 'm talking to you please jot things down if if you think of you know things relevant to your event or if this is getting your mind ticking start writing it down so now that you know who they are you can be much more focused focused in your marketing activity the next step for you from a marketing perspective is to set yourself some goals and targets so remember last week we talked about setting your business plan and we talked about in that you know having goals and a mission and a vision and all of those strategic things the objectives of your event you need to refer back to those because obviously that will provide some alignment for your about from a marketing perspective really what is it that we 're trying to achieve is your event about providing attendees with a range of top quality entertainment options it might just be about increasing outer region and international visitors or even just you know intra-state visitors your event might be more about building civic pride or engaging local residents so it 's a more localized event it 's about community and civic pride it could be building community capacity by increasing economic activity and stakeholder engagement your main objective might be about ensuring financial viability growth and even sustainability of the festival if it 's a tourism event often your overarching goal will consist of something along the lines of building the brand awareness of your town or your region or the core purpose could be growing profit or raising funds for a charity or it could be something other than that it 's really important to know what you want to achieve from your event and we talked about that a lot last week when we talked about business planning your purpose understanding your why what is that activity that you do needs to always relate back to that once you know what that overarching purpose is what you 're trying to achieve then you can start to narrow it down a little bit further and start to look at what do we want to achieve from our marketing and the reason we like to do this is because we like to measure results so we like to have some targets and particularly if you 've got funding even if it 's local council funding or you 've got funding from state government or funding another funding program they 'll want you to set you know remember what i talked about the key performance indicators the kpis they 'll want you to set some of those because it 's important that if you 're investing your 500 or your 2000 or maybe you get funding and you 've got 20 000 imagine that you want to know what results you 've got from that so you want to know specifically in terms of the activity you 've done what has worked because what that does it allows you always learning right we 're always learning what 's worked if my 500 was most effective through um you know the facebook advertising or the local radio pr campaign that i did then you 're going to invest more in that next year right and if it didn 't work then you 've got to reassess and start to look at where to invest that money this is all about getting the best return so some of the things that may make up your objectives or kpis are things like how many attendees attend your event and the ticket sales it could be around building your social media audience and following so you might have a goal or kpi around you know increasing the number of followers you have on social media it could be about attracting subscribers so a lot of events and businesses do a lot of work around building a database so some of your marketing might be really about driving you know subscriptions to that database so then you can continue to promote to them on an ongoing basis you might have some um objectives around website visits how many people have been to your website over a period of time so you might go okay we were doing our heaviest marketing during this two or three month period now we want to line that up with how many people came to our website at that time and that 's going to help you determine the success of some of that activity you might package up your event tickets so you might have event tickets packaged up with some accommodation or meals or a tour or travel coach and you might measure your objectives based on how many bookings you have for that package or media coverage a lot of events also have kpis around media coverage so if they 're doing a lot of public relations work what they 'll do is they will set a bit of a target to say we want to attract um you know a hundred thousand dollars uh equivalent value in media exposure for our event so when you 're setting your marketing plan you need to have some kpis or targets then at the end of your event even have a kpi around volunteer appeal so some events will say through their marketing activity they 're building some appeal amongst a potential or new volunteer base so you need to set these kpis you can 't achieve results unless you know what your kpis are because you can 't measure nothing all right i 'm really interested to get some feedback so how do you measure success and return on investment for your marketing what 's important to you in terms of measuring that and what about that whole thing around using the information to cut through the white noise anyone got any comments or thoughts on that around how knowing your ideal event attendee actually you know impacts the date of your event the price structure of your event um the type of program or experience that you offer for your event has anyone had to go through this process and really start to look at putting themselves in their attendees shoes to get an appreciation of meeting their needs and expectations probably when we bought um it 's susie when we brought in the motorbike gymkhana had actually asked for and being told no they couldn 't have for a few years and i listened to what they were saying and i said yes we can have it and the feedback and the success of that event was um unreal like and everyone said why hasn 't this happened earlier and i went well you 've got to have a committee that wants to run it so and we put that on the line as like probably that 15 for that show because we did put a lot of prize money into it and got sponsorship and that and it was successful and parents all said that it was the kids nomination fee was 20 for the day they spent all day racing motorbikes got their prize money then went to sideshow owie and they said it was the best money they 'd ever spent at a show so to us we measured that as very successful and did you interest so you introduced that because there was demand so that 's obviously a market of yours yeah so that younger market was looking for something 's what i 'm saying about the program right it 's and so much power in just listening to your audience um you know and i know often it 's overwhelming because we get a lot of different suggestions and ideas thrown at us as event organizers oh why don 't you do this you should try this you need to critically analyze all of those suggestions and ideas but when those little nuggets come up you know those things that are going to align really well to a market that you 're trying to grow or to your ideal attendees then that 's when you start to go okay is this going to build on the experience and give us a better return for our investment yes i think and we were really successful with that because there was that need for it at that stage i think this year it will be bigger again and we do promote that through a regional facebook or australia-wide motorbike facebook page made by gymkhana page and then we have our people that we strategically target that 's in other motorbike groups goes out that way perfect yeah and that 's a classic example of knowing that 's a specific market right that 's you know they 've got specific interest they 're going to come specifically for that but then they 're going to do other things as well so sideshow alley benefits at the end of the day but by knowing that specific market and being able to target your marketing activity by promoting the experience that 's relevant to them yes you 're generating that that interest without having to try too hard yeah and then it 's about going okay how do we now so if you think about if we just take that one step further and you think about the you know the motorbike fans or you know motocross advocates it 's how do you now get them to promote the event for you and it probably is already happening to be honest like if you had a such a good response from the event last time it 's probably already happening for you yeah well i has tended one in kind of muller in november at the show this year is the show going ahead and i said yes i said i will be there then like it 's that word of mouth um the year before i printed up flies and took to a couple of other events and handed them out with the program with everything on it and that was yeah it 's just probably a different couple of marketing options but that 's what we used anyone else got any comments or want to share anything about how you break through that white noise or do you find that most of the time your marketing message is usually pretty effective um hi um i 'm like susie i tend to and we talked about that sort of micro festival thing so i tend to tailor it around what they need there 's a lot of word of mouth you 're absolutely right susie and god and that 's your best um advertisement you can get is that word of mouth so um and i 'm meeting that need so um and i think um using the the survey monkeys to um what people want uh but the best like feedback i get is at the time is um because they 're in that space they 're in that mode and i get some really good ideas about what they want and there 's i have the other thing is one of the things i suppose i find difficult is you have that initial interest is how you convert that to an actual booking or to another event so there 's lots of people getting contact with you and and it 's like oh this is great to have somebody locally that can be able to do this and but then how do you actually convert that into uh them booking an event with you so um and that 's one of the things that i find a little bit difficult is getting that conversion and to um to actually booking you your time and exactly what the people want because sometimes people they don 't know necessarily what they want and then if you 've got one sort of product that they can identify with so it could be that you right brie cheese we 'll get sheila in because she does brie cheese but you know if you do you know several other different things and i can tailor it to what you require then people go oh i don 't know what i want so um so being flexible is great on one hand in the fact that you can tailor to what their needs are but i think sometimes um what i 'm finding is when you 're trying to have an event booked through a third parties they don 't know what the needs of the audience are and they just and they they know you exist but they 're just not quite sure how to turn that into something does that make sense um yeah that 's interesting so have you i 'm sure you have you know looked at at what point are they stopping you know like you say you 're not getting that conversion so um so if i hear or somebody mentions somebody to somebody and it comes around to me that they might be interested in so um so it might have to offer but um so then they 'll have a conversation with me and i can talk to them about well i could do this for you i could do that for you i 'm happy to do this we can look at that sort of thing and then it 's almost like i 've given them too much too much to think about and so then now they don 't know what to what they want you for and and now they 're not too sure um what their audience is and what does the audience need so when they 're so just that 's a lot of the time i 'll just organize my own events and i just liaise directly with the audience but when there 's a third part party it 's this is what i can offer or that 's great that 's awesome oh man i didn 't realize that you could offer so much and then no follow-up nothing after that it 's almost like oh it 's too hard basket we 'll just get somebody who can make cheese eh and wanting you to tell them what they need or want it 's like you have to yeah put yourself in their shoes and go okay what 's going to resonate with them yeah often with a third party um what i 'm finding is is that it 's a general thing that 's going out there so it might be something around health and wellness well you know there are 10 different workshops i could do for you on health and wellness and what do you want and they 're like well i don 't know we just got some funding to do workshops on health and wellness so it 's like well do you want something that 's progressive do you want just one office yeah and then and the other thing is sometimes is um yeah you wanting to make the cheese but like cheap making cheese is really complex and if you 're trying to do something around health and wellness um you need to start at the beginning not halfway through so um so yeah so that 's my challenge um if i 'm doing it things but through a third party i don 't know how to convert that i 'm struggling there what type of third parties do you deal with sheila are you talking about corporate so normally government agencies yes government agencies that want to that have been given i 'm really sorry sheila that have been like this might be targeted at me no no it 's not just you it 's this you 're not the only person that is really interested in what i 'm doing and and as from you know i 'm i 'm happy to travel two or three hundred kilometers so there 's there 's more than just um um local but what it is is when we 're when we 're looking at what we 're trying to do and you and in your information that you 've sent through which is around what 's your ideal who are your attendees and i suppose um maybe jane what we need to be looking at is who are you targeting what are your kpis around who are you targeting what do you have to meet you 've you 've had these events um and then probably something to keep in mind with that is that um so and this i guess comes down to understanding your target audience or who you 're dealing with if it 's me as a third part you know council for example as a client or someone who 's trying to work with you to organize things is we have to consult with the community so we have to go to the community we have to say what do you want and when the community says to us well we don 't know what we want then i 'm in the same position that you are where i 've got i 'm trying to follow up i 'm trying to get people to give me answers and they can 't give me answers either so so it 's yeah lot of one of the things intricacies to it let 's say yeah so one of the things is then i suppose what i look at from my queensland health point of view is like so when the person who 's do your um your healthy communities or your health and well-being what is their expectation and then we can then put that out to the wider audience and then people can either attend or not attend and so i suppose rather than because what i 've found is it 's better and this is why i offer so many different workshops is because what people want is so varied but and the first thing that springs to the head is always cheese making and it 's like well there 's a way to start before cheese making because i 've attended cheese making workshops and then nobody ever makes cheese so um so it doesn 't actually meet if the if the um if the criteria is around healthy communities and about health and wellness um it 's taking the audience then on a journey so that 's where we talked about whether you provide a program and people sign up for a program so i mean but it 's not just you may it 's it 's other organizations um like your country women 's association it 's your different things and but converting it to actual uh events is um quite difficult because they 're not sure what they want they just want something we want to change you almost need to help them determine those elements thanks for sharing okay now i 'm going to stay pretty high level with this i don 't want to get too technical but what i want to do now so we 've essentially talked about you know identifying who your ideal attendees are and setting those kpis or marketing objectives right so we 're now in a position to go okay we know who our audience is we know what we 're trying to achieve so how do we actually do it what are the marketing actions or tactics that we 're going to um use to actually reach our audience and and to achieve the kpis that we 've set now you may be familiar with this for they call it the four p 's of marketing i think actually it 's now six p 's or something it 's um they 've added a few more in but sticking with the four ps i just wanted to touch on this so i 'm not going to get technical as i said but i wanted to touch on it because the important message here is that marketing is about more than advertising and promotion and a lot of people forget that so when we 're thinking about marketing when we 're thinking about our ideal attendees and the experience that we 're offering we need to factor in these four key elements product price place promotion so we 've got to be thinking about our ideal event attendee in regards to each of those elements of marketing so when we 're talking about product that 's where we 're thinking about our event program we 're talking about the experience what 's the event experience that we 're offering like i said a little earlier you can promote or advertise the heck out of your event but and this is kind of what you were just saying sheila if the experience is not right it 's not what they 're looking for even if they don 't know what advertising you invest time and money in is going to be a waste of time and money so product is all about knowing the experience that your attendees are looking for and then we look at price is your event priced at the right price point what about the payment options and discounts do you need to offer a seniors discount to appeal to your target market or student discount is that important to them place is all about your distribution channels so this is about where are your customers going to search for your event or to purchase tickets and like the example i used before are they going on social media or digital channels to buy their tickets online or do they like to go into a physical ticking ticket booth or visitor information center for example so you need to understand what those distribution channels are for your ideal attendees because that 's going to give you a better return and also a better appreciation of what that conversion point is within your marketing and promotion and then lastly we have promotion and this is the advertising invest in to reach your audience so you need to think about all those things often people when they go marketing they just think about advertising and promotion we need to do social media we 'll you know contact the newspaper and get a listing in the local paper we 'll you know all of those traditional type things that we classify as advertising and promotion but there 's all of these other elements and i 've talked about them as well when we talked about you know the um the white noise you need to think of all these things when you 're talking about or thinking about uh your marketing activity for your event now i want to touch on this idea of a coordinated phased approach to your marketing of your event having a schedule that outlines this makes it much clearer i know everybody said at the beginning they don 't have a marketing plan or a marketing schedule that they use but it 's really important and i 've given you a copy also another document to use that will assist you to create a events actually that i 've ever dealt with only focus their marketing in the pre-event stage so that final two to three months and there 's obvious reasons for that everyone 's busy getting the event ready it 's like marketing doesn 't really become important to most people until about two or three months before their event and then it 's like okay now we need to make sure people know about the event and people come and buy tickets but what i want you to start thinking about is these three stages to your marketing once again you 've got to put yourself into the heads into the head of your attendees and especially when we 're in regional areas if we 're wanting to attract people from outside of our region or even interstate or even international who knows then the lead time is much longer people make their decisions much longer people need to consider booking travel and doing things like that so if we leave our promotion into the last two to three months and once again this all depends on who our target audience the last two to three months then we 're cutting down the potential audience that we will attract to our event so this is it this is a typical phased approach for um you know a festival or event and you need to adapt this based on your event if it 's a very localized event just for local residents then obviously you don 't need to do anything as extensive as you know 10 months worth of promotion but the stages are still really important so we talk about this awareness consideration and conversion stages and i 've just given here some suggested kind of time frames right so what we do is um first of all we look at awareness so we 've got to build that really targeted awareness of our event people need to know about it before they can even consider coming they also need to know if they 're from interstate or even interest state they need to be familiar with the destination as well so you 're building this awareness you know of your region of the event what it 's all about ten to six months out from your event so this is where things like organic social media so not putting any money but just you know your organic social media posts lots of content on your website doing blog articles doing direct marketing so you know um like you were saying susie knowing those motorbike clubs and groups and really directing some marketing to them to say hey guys we 've got this coming up in six months time make sure you let all your clubs know about it so really doing some direct marketing and creating content so like i said writing blog articles you know sharing that with different people that are associated with groups you know whether it 's health and well-being you know really starting to build profile and awareness so that 's that period of say ten to six months then we move into this consideration phase now people know your events happening words out oh yeah there 's this event happening in st george it 's really cool um and then they start to see it again and they 're like yeah i wouldn to st george and that event 's on maybe we should go so they 're already aware of your event and they 're somewhat engaged now you want them to seriously consider it this is where they start to go hmm how could that work let 's have a look at you know travel let 's look at accommodation let 's look if we can get some holidays at that time so in this phase you want to be doing digital advertising so you start to put some dollars behind your digital and your social media activity keep up that direct marketing because direct marketing to your ideal attendees is absolute gold and people start to do in this stage influence a campaign so you may have heard this term influences so they 're people that are typically quite influential in their own um in their own industry or their own audience on social media channels so you can work with these influencers that have alignment with your audience and they can actually do some promotion to that audience for you so you 're warning them to consider and there that that fear of missing out you know if somebody else is promoting it they 're like oh what are they doing so you 're really creating consideration at this stage you 're wanting people to go yeah okay i 'm gonna start doing some research this looks cool they start talking to you know family and friends hey would you want to go to this event and then we move into conversion so this is your selling your tickets this is your last chance messaging this is where it 's really serious and i know for some events that three months might be a bit of overkill but for other events even longer than three months will be necessary in this conversion stage so don 't leave it to the last minute to get those tickets on sale and this is where you want to continue that digital advertising social advertising your direct marketing and pr and sorry your direct marketing and this is when pr and media activations come in so working with the local paper or you know engaging with abc radio or other local media outlets event and this would also be traditionally when you would start to bring in any traditional advertising channels so if you do have budget to do things like tv or billboards or radio or any of that more traditional uh promotional activity most people leave it to the last three months and the reason for that is that 's when you want to convert but also you know it 's so expensive it 's so expensive to do it over those three phases you just won 't get any cut through with a small budget um even in just that three-month period you know you 're going to need a few thousand to make any kind of impact with traditional advertising which is why social media and digital is such a good option for a lot of events these days so that 's this concept of having this coordinated phased approach to your marketing we 've got to get away from that just firing out messages all the time and going oh my god we haven 't promoted the event let 's just go bam bam bam on you know 't really taken that time to consider this coordinated approach which gently kind of builds awareness then gets that consideration happening and then now buy tickets uh most oh sorry i jumped the gun a little bit there now let me just talk about budget because i you you probably look at that and go oh my god how can we afford to do all of that stuff you probably can 't_''_4809.28 and that 's why you need to be really targeted um just to give you an idea um festivals that attract so this is based on events that i work with so i work a lot with tourism events um but in the work that i do there 's also community events as well that um participate but give you an example just to give a little bit of context so say a regional event tourism event that attracts about say eight to ten thousand people to their event uh they are usually working on a marketing budget of around fifteen to twenty thousand dollars per year even that is classed as a fairly small budget and i that 's totally fine but it 's important to understand kind of where events are sitting and this is why it 's so important to actually get really clear and focused on your marketing activity smaller events are usually on average about you know 10 of their budget would go to marketing and nearly every regional event that i work with has a very very limited budget and they do rely heavily on government grants to help them with their marketing activity so i didn 't want to tell you that to kind of blow your head out of the water but it 's important to understand where you 're sitting or what you should strive for and there is quite a bit of funding to assist with event marketing that 's available all right as we said or as i said at the start of this master class one of the most common marketing questions i 'm asked from events is where to invest their small budget to get the best return so i 've only got my 500 or my 2 000 where should i put that to options and lots of event committees are really struggling to know where to put their budget to get that return and that 's why they go often to social media it 's just in most instances free but a lot of events and this is a whole other conversation but a lot of events don 't also understand how hard it is to get cut through on social media so this is just a little overview of some of the channels that you have available for consideration when you look at um promotion of your event or advertising of your event there 's things like content creation so this is more about you know creating good photos and videos and blog articles about your event and when you talk to a lot of marketing experts they will say nothing sells better than good quality photos and videos so it is important to consider particularly if you can tap into some funding can you actually get someone to capture some fresh photos and videos of your event you 've also got to consider website management so developing a website continuing to and google analytics which is a bit technical from a digital perspective but really important if you want to be promoting your event online then we go into things like social media advertising so facebook instagram youtube you can have your own pages or channels and then you can actually pay others to promote your event on theirs digital advertising so this is doing a whole range of things on digital platforms so different websites and google advertising you can do display advertising on websites you can do media campaigns online there 's a whole range of things that you can do from a digital perspective and one thing i often recommend to events if there 's a group of events in a local area that could tap into some funding to hire an expert because social media advertising and digital advertising is changing like that it 's just an ever evolving beast so to actually get good results from it you have to be working in it constantly and there 's lots of different agencies out there that just specialize in digital advertising and social media advertising it 's and that 's why i suggest to many regions you know to pull a few events together and see if you can do some collaboration to get some really good digital marketing um happening for a series of events uh there 's also things like pr media you 've got traditional advertising which is your tv and radio or your newspaper etc and then we 've got direct marketing or sales so that 's electronic newsletter campaigns so using things like mailchimp it could be mailbox drops cold calling people making sure they know about your event so you can see there 's so many options and when you 've got such a little budget it 's really overwhelming to know where to spend your money so what you 've got to remember to consider is where is your ideal event attendee so where are they going to see your promotion and that 's the key to gaining the maximum return on that investment you also need to gather feedback at every opportunity you have to identify how people are hearing about your event and that 's also going to working and what isn 't you don 't want to guess those things because you can 't afford to when you 've got a little budget you want to really understand what advertising spend is giving you the best return now these are just a few local and free promotional opportunities for you to consider so this has been shared by a council and you may have more if there 's more free local promotional opportunities or any free promotional opportunities that you 're aware of for events can i please encourage you to put it in the chat box so that everybody can see that or feel free to share it in our next open discussion which will be in about one minute there 's things like online calendars so connect southwest in my community if you are a larger tourism event um you want to consider the atdw which is what they call the australian tourism data warehouse and that is a free listing so events in queensland don 't have to pay to be listed on that and that means your event gets listed on like hundreds your event it goes on the this is queensland events calendar but then it also gets distributed out to a wide range of other relevant websites um to promote your event so if you don 't know a lot about that and you think that that 's suitable for your event i encourage you to chat to kim at council and she 'll be able to help you through that journey facebook 's another free another good free option so create an event so it 's not just creating your page or doing a post but create an event on your page because then people can rsvp and they can share that local radio you 've got southwest newspaper and also things like dropping flyers and posters to visitor information centers is a good free way to promote your event as well not always free because you 've got to usually cover design and printing but i 'm still a good distribution channel all right how 's everyone feeling there 's a lot of information and i actually still have a bit to go i 'm nelly there but let any thoughts on marketing channels do you know what marketing channels are giving you the best return do you have any questions about those marketing channels i 've talked about uh it 's just like him linda leslie why did i call you kim um can you explain about mailchimp um versus just ordinary email out emails out like an emailing why do you need mailchimp and what is it yeah okay so mailchimp is one of many email marketing campaign platforms the reason i 've referred to mailchimp is because a lot of people use mailchimp because it 's a user-friendly platform but it 's also freed up to a certain point and what i mean by ups to a certain point is up to so many subscribers so why mailchimp this over just a standard email out i guess you would use them for different things desley so what you do with mailchimp is you 're trying to build a database of people to promote to so you know sometimes you 'll go to a website and it will say you know subscribe to our newsletter that 's so they will automatically get put into that database in mailchimp and you 're building this database in the background and then when you want to do some promotion you can send an email directly from mailchimp to that database so it 's really i guess about building that database and it 's all there within mailchimp it also looks a bit nicer than just sending an email you know so you can create a nice newsletter with images in it and it just looks a bit fresher in saying that if you have a small group of people that you want to target let 's just say you 've got a a list of top 10 companies you know and you want to try to target them to purchase tickets to come to your event you know you might have tables at 10 or something um i would say in that instance personalized emails would work better than mailchimp because i guess the downfall of mailchimp it 's not it isn 't actually as personal we all we all know when something 's coming from mailchimp versus just an this is this is promotion you can clearly see that it 's promotion whereas an email personally from yourself to an organization or to a small group is going to be probably have more chance of being read and be incredible to ascen to an extent so i would i would treat them slightly different but continue to use both of them i had a funny feeling that you had to use something like mailchimp if you had more than a certain number of email addresses to send to is that right or can you do an email out to an unlimited number of addresses you can 't just send it to know hundreds of emails so there is a limit um whereas mailchimp does send it can send to thousands but it like i said before there 's a cut off before you have to start understand yes i was i was thinking i thought you had to automatically go to something like mailchimp if you maybe had i 'm not thinking in hundreds or thousands but 50 say yeah well mostly it may depend on your email provider um situations where sometimes it 'll let me send to you know 30 or 50 sometimes it won 't let me even 20._''_5589.84 so i think it 's just on your provider and yes yeah yeah okay no thank you i just that 's clarified it thank you very much that 's okay any other questions about any of those marketing channels that coordinated approach is everything making sense i 'm not overwhelming you too much all right let 's keep going then because we only have about 20 minutes what i want to finish on um i could talk for five hours about digital marketing it 's a whole other topic on its own and i kind of um denied about how much i would include in this session so what i have done is i 've just picked whoopsie i 've just picked a few key messages to share with you from a digital marketing perspective so when we talk about you know advertising promotion marketing one element that has just grown so rapidly in the last five or so years is digital marketing it 's overwhelming you of time online it 's really hard to keep up to speed with what 's happening in the digital world so it can be overwhelming and like i said before if you 're ever in a position to apply for some funding to do some digital uh marketing for your event i would highly recommend that you do it your event website i don 't even know if you guys have an event website i 'm going to take a guess and go maybe one or two of you do and that 's based on other experience in other regions but what i encourage you to do is consider getting a website and they don 't have to be massive big websites that are super expensive these days the beauty of digital technology growing so rapidly is that it 's become more affordable as well so your event website is your hub of your marketing activity so these days uh you know we as consumers expect to be able to find anything we want at any time online so if we 're looking for an event to attend in belongshire coming there for a holiday or we 're a new resident we 're looking at what events are coming up first thing most people will do these days is go online and search so if you do not have a website i highly recommend you put that into your plan for the next couple of years and start to look at getting a website set up if you do have a website you need to make sure it 's always up to date because what it does is everything all of your activity will lead to that website so if your website 's got all the most up-to-date information about your program any guest speakers you know packages that you 've got on offer information about the region that is going to convert them on the spot if somebody hears about your event and then goes to look for it and the information 's outdated or you don 't have a website at all most of the time you would have lost them so what i want you to think about is building a website and making sure that that it 's the hub i want you to think of it as a hub of your marketing activity so your social media your direct mail your traditional everything feeds people to your website that 's also usually the conversion point so you 'll have a book book now on your website what makes an event website great it needs to be mobile friendly so there 's up to 80 of web traffic coming from mobile in some categories these days so a lot of people are accessing things on this so you need to make sure that if you do have a website it 's mobile friendly you also need to focus on the visitor journey so do your research and look at other websites and so if you 're embarking on building a website for the first time or working with a web designer to do your website you need to start doing some research so look at other websites and work out what design you like what functionality do you like what are the features of other websites that you like and just start making a list when to your website you want to make sure that i 'm not overloaded with information um you want to make sure that 's got a lot of user-generated content on it so we want we want to see things from other people not just typical sales content i want to i want to have ideas i want you to give me ideas of what to do in the region what to do at your events and i want it to be easy and simple to navigate around so you need to look at other websites you need to start mocking up a bit of a map of your site so people that actually plan out their site will end up with a much more effective site keeping it simple isn 't really important and also create a marketing funnel so this is where you want to think about okay what do we need people to do we want them to buy tickets or we want them to subscribe to our newsletter in mailchimp we want them to book accommodation packages you need to know what that ultimate goal is so a way that that actually takes them on that journey it 's a bit sneaky how that all works but that 's what a marketing funnel is you 've got to link in external tools and this is all stuff that a web developer will actually go through with you so don 't panic you know if i 'm talking a little bit too technical for you but you want to make sure to get the most out of your website you also have external tools integrated into it so that 's google search google analytics mailchimp as we talked or another email newsletter provider a ticket booking platform like try booking or eventbrite or you may have your own so really starting to link in those external tools and you want to actually make sure you 're also putting links on your site so google loves videos it loves google map listings it loves links to like government websites so need to understand what 's going to get you that good organic traffic and make sure it 's easy for visitors to communicate with you so you know have fill something in and ask a question you know easy access contact details really making sure it 's really easy for the user to take action we don 't want to lose them now in terms of what content management systems can i use so if you are looking at getting a website for your event or perhaps in the next couple of years it 's something that 's on your list there 's lots of different content management systems the most popular systems used these days are wordpress it 's like totally got the market share others that are quite popular are things like joomla you may have heard of things like shopify or squarespace um and things like wordpress are a little bit harder to manage and update on your own so you want to find a system that 's easy for you to make updates to because it gets really costly if you have to continually pay someone to make small text updates on your site so squarespace is becoming really popular because of its ease of use and it 's also got really nice design now the date and location is not clearly listed that should be absolutely front and center when people open your site it 's hard to find where to purchase tickets or where to take action to purchase tickets the site branding and style doesn 't match the target audience so once again we need to think of our ideal attendee when we 're creating our website and we need to make sure the look and the feel and the language and the tone of voice is all important and related to or relatable to our audience you want to make sure the ur url is the same as your event name so often an event will have a url that 's just completely different to their event name which is really confusing for the user and will make it really hard for them for your website to be found so if your event name is um linda rocks then make your website www.lindarocks.com.au obviously it 's pending availability but that is the ideal situation another common mistake is that events don 't use high quality images you can 't afford to because people will just move on they won 't think it 's a legitimate website so invest in that photo and video content that i talked about and make sure you 've got some good quality images for your website and there 's broken links and errors on pages like there 's no excuse for that these days so make sure once again that everything 's working well on your website up to date fresh and visually appealing okay one final thing before you start using social media there 's a number of things you need to think about i know for events that social media is probably one of the most used promotional tools but before you can actually get maximum benefit from social media you need to have a few things in place first of all you need to understand why you 're using social media is your audience on there who are they what channels are they on remember the phases we just talked about so that coordinated phased approach you need to understand what your messages will be and when you 'll distribute them on your focused don 't just have a scattergun approach putting out a whole heap of messages and content at random times so have that structure always check out what others are doing and work out how you can be different it 's not about copying what others are doing so look at what stakeholders are doing look at what competitors are doing make sure you 've got a point of difference your website the hub that we talked about it must be up to date and ready to convert so there 's no point investing in social media and then someone goes to your website and they find old information if that happens there 's a good chance you 've lost them forever set up an email marketing program and capture those email addresses so that 's the mail chimp that we were just talking about that 's one example of a email marketing program because once you have them sounds sounds like we 're kind of trying to really um con people in but once people have subscribed to your database you essentially own them from a marketing sense so individual person can unsubscribe but once people have made the choice to subscribe to your email marketing program you then have the ability to communicate with them um when you wish and you can do that directly so that 's really it 's a real marketing asset which is why a lot of events and businesses are always looking to capture email addresses i encourage you to set up a blog on your website so publish your own content and you don 't have to be you know a super duper writer you can do video i 'm sorry photo blogs you know the top five um pet photos from our last event for example but what it means is when you 're capturing content it gives you sorry when you 're writing content it gives you stuff to share on your social media so you want to be able to drive those leads back to your website and finally a very key point with social media is to determine who will coordinate your social media if you don 't have the skills on your team and you 've got it or maybe if you 've got somebody that 's developing a website for you maybe that 's something they can actually assist with or see if you can find you know a younger person in your community that loves digital marketing that might be able to assist with it so you all have limited resources so it 's really important for you to focus on the social media channels where your ideal attendees are playing and remember i said before there 's been this a bit of a i guess a transition around social channels where facebook has now become more for the parents or the grandparents and the younger ones have moved off and have moved more towards instagram and or tick tock so depending on who your audience is will determine what social media channels you use if you 're unsure best chances to work with facebook and instagram there 's also things like snapchat which some of the younger ones are shouldn 't say some a lot of the younger ones are on as well now my final slide with all of that said all of remember if you cannot measure it you cannot improve it so if you want to get bigger return or better return for your investment it 's so important that you put in place those kpis and you 're able to measure it you need to be able to review your activity measure it analyze it improve it every year and you can measure your results through your website or facebook insights you 'll know by ticket sales how successful you 've been you can look at when ticket sales occur or postcodes etc to get a sense of where people have come from just remember that you need this measurement to align back to those kpis and objectives that we talked about so if you 're working on building civic pride you need to implement measurement tools to be able to measure civic pride so it 's really important that you put in place measurement tools now that 's everything i have to share with you in our masterclass today our marketing master class it 's a lot of information i 've given you two good resources so you do process of identifying your ideal event attendees and then you 've also got a marketing schedule template that will also help you start to consider how to have a more structured uh approach to your marketing activity for your event so i hope you 've gained a lot from that if you 've got any questions i 'm happy to stay on the line for another five minutes or so and answer any questions otherwise thank you so much for your time and i look forward to catching you next week thanks desley thanks very much linda can you hear me i can hear you yes thank you that was excellent today and i particularly liked about the the targeted uh marketing approach i um and and also the the the digital and social way of advertising and not to use a scatter gun so that 's taught me a lot um i was wondering you did say that for any of the sessions we could get one of our committee members interested in that particular aspect to come on board next week i was wondering it 's um is a quick look [Music] yes next week is uh event sponsorship and grants yes event sponsorship and grants well i 'm just wondering that the lady on our little committee that um is looking at doing sponsorship and grants would she need to register or do do you envision that that they would just sit in with with one of us or can she register in her own right and do it from her place either option would be absolutely fine desley whatever is convenient for her if she wants to just register and then participate from her home then that 's totally fine this is open to all events um and committee members in the longshire so that 's absolutely fine she would just need to touch base with kim at council and let and let her know and she 'll make sure that she 's got the information um ready to be able to participate next week thanks well thanks for that linda thanks very much and we 'll see you okay wonderful thank you thanks linda talk to you next week yes so as you 've all funding so bring all your questions along if there 's anything that comes up in the meantime we 've got that facebook event so you can jump in there and ask any questions or raise any points that you may want me to cover off in next week 's session i 'll see you all same time next week thank you so linda sorry mate just before you go um so next week 's i 'll have to duck _"

    "text": "so today we have a fun topic the reality of events risk safety and security this can be a little bit overwhelming in terms of you know all the things that you need to think about in terms of risk and safety and the health and wellness of your attendees your volunteers etc but i i guess my suggestion is always just use common sense so when we 're talking about this stuff although i 'm going to give you examples and there 'll be things that have no relevance to your event at all so just as i 'm talking through this today just be always thinking you know what 's relevant to my event because risk management can be somewhat overwhelming okay so we are into our fourth session now uh two to go after this so we 'll look at event teams and then we 're going to look at events in a covered world to wrap up the series as you know all of these sessions are recorded so if at any point in time you need to leave or something happens you can access it sessions it 's also a good opportunity to share it with other members of your committee or your team that you think may gain some benefit from listening to the session so throughout the session make sure you jump into the chat box um ask questions have a bit of conversation yourselves amongst yourselves while i 'm presenting all of the information to you if anything pops into your mind that you 'd like to talk more about always just pop it into the chat box and i 'll make sure that i come back to that throughout the sessions you guys know who i am um reevents academy linda tillman i don 't need to go into that detail how 's everyone feeling i 'm really interested to know whether you have any questions or you know is there anything from previous sessions that you know you 've either gone yep cool we 're going to implement that or things that are a little bit challenging for you um at our show meeting last week after that heavy sponsorship um session i sort of explained because our sponsorship girl and i think she was feeling like she was hounding and i said listen we 've just done this in this course and linda said you just need to keep ringing she goes oh okay then like she felt a little bit better that she wasn 't just hounding people um and then we talked about being a bit more focused on who we were asking the sponsorship for and they all sort of went yeah well that 's a lot better idea so the committee sort of could see all the points that you 'd listed last week as a go ahead we should change a little bit yeah yeah and it 's kind of i mean you don 't mind hounding if you know it 's a good offer for them right if it 's and that 's where it comes into that you know being a bit more focused on who you 're going to target if you know that you 've got something good to offer them it 's easier to have those conversations and to keep you know hounding them yeah but it is look projects where i 've had to like negotiate or follow up or chase or hound for six to eight months like it it 's just a long process um and that 's why it 's so important to take the time in identifying the right people that are the fit for your event yeah so you 're not wasting your time there 's nothing worse and i 've done this as well where you spend you know a lot of time following people up negotiating and then in the end they say no anyway it 's like ah that is a real kick in the guts and you 're always going to get that to a certain extent but we want to try to reduce that as much as we can and it also come up with our um social media with our uh spon like putting our sponsors stuff forward and i put through what you said and um the lady that 's doing our social media had just been and done a course in durham bendy the weekend before so she had a lot of input as well courses and it 's just made us very positive about how we can put our show forward now oh good great feedback uh linda it 's display how are you yes very well thanks i was missing last week but i read the printed information looked really really helpful thank you very much and the group i 'm involved with the the lady that 's looking after sponsorship uh was travelling so we 'll look forward to looking at the recording uh when it comes up i emailed kim to see when the recordings are available and i just um i haven 't received an email back yet she said they 're still working on them so okay see excellent yeah make sure you jump in and have a look at that the information i sent you certainly supports what i presented in that session but i also in the session talk a lot about really just trying to save time and energy because sponsorship and grant funding as well you know we talk about both of those things they 're a very time consuming process so what we 're we approach and know what we need and what we can offer in return so that we get the best result so it would be worthwhile absolutely once that recording is available my understanding is what 's happening with the recordings um so i send the recording to kim at the end of the day so for this one for example i 'll tidy it up and send it to her this afternoon my understanding is council 's creating a page on the website and they 'll put all the recordings on there so you can go in at any time you can share the link with your other committee members and you 'll be able to access those quite freely all right so let 's jump in so today as i said we 're talking about risk management um you know we 've got different types of events that are with us today and anybody you know listening on the recording there 's so many different size scale types of events out there that risk management varies but it 's absolutely essential for every type of event no matter like i was saying just before it can be quite scary to start thinking about all the things that can go wrong which is essentially what you 're doing when you 're looking at risk management you 're putting that kind of you know that lens over your event to go what could go wrong and essentially how do we manage that or how do we prevent or mitigate that from happening so it can be a little bit scary when you start to think about all these things that could go wrong with your events but when you think about it we 're we 're managing risk every day in our lives you know we do it without even realizing you know we 're making decisions you know should i cross this busy road here or should i walk up to the pedestrian so you 're managing risk right and that 's all we 're doing so once again we don 't want to complicate this too much it really is common sense when we look at our events and you would be able to look at your event risks you may also have you know sometimes when you 're a little bit close to an event some things you don 't see so it 's often worth getting the team together to just brainstorm what are the potential risks so today 's going to be a bit more of a practical session i 'm hoping that everybody has received the risk management template that i emailed through if for some reason you don 't have that can you please just drop your email address into the chat box right now and i 'll email it to you because you will need that throughout today 's session oops sorry we will be working through that so it 's a fairly practical document that steps us through the process of creating a risk management plan and i actually wanted to make today quite practical because we 've got the two hours and there 's not a huge amount of content um to talk to you for two hours so i thought you know this is a good chance to actually make it a bit practical so when we finish the your event so if you haven 't_''_552.72 got that drop it into the chat box now and i 'll quickly email it to you and essentially what we 're going to go through today is get a really good understanding of risk what is risk what are the different types of risk we should be considering for our event we 're going to look at a simple but effective way to develop a risk management plan we 're looking at contingency planning and we 're also going to touch on just briefly because we 've got a whole session around events in a covered world but i did want to just touch on how to manage covert and the implications of covert because that essentially is going to become a new thing that you will need to consider into the future in terms of managing risk at your event sheila um just a quick one did you receive the risk management template that i sent through because um i was just saying to everybody else this is a this will be a much more practical session the content won 't through uh the risk management template that i sent yep i 've got that one so um i 'll have to duck out and i 've got another meeting at half 12 and then i 'll dock back in but now i 've got the template on my desktop yeah easy if everyone just has that handy i 'll continue to refer to that throughout throughout our session today all right now i 'm going to do a quick poll with you this is more for me to get an understanding of where you 're at in terms of risk management so you should be able to see on your screen now a poll if you could just answer those two questions do you have a current risk management plan and how do you feel about risk management all right excellent so as you can see um yes we updated annually or it 's due to be updated so there 's a risk management plan in place that 's great to see that it 's being updated annually you know no we don 't have one or we don 't to learn a little bit more around that in terms of why you don 't need one how do you feel about risk management yeah okay look everyone 's up in that top section which is what i wanted to see definitely didn 't want anybody saying it 's a waste of our time so fine everyone understands it 's critical it 's important yes it 's very time consuming so we understand the importance of it but this one here in terms of no we don 't need one um linda that was me that 's desley there wasn 't an option we don 't have one yet we haven 't actually planned an event and we 've never had a an event so we 're a new organization so there wasn 't an option to say we don 't have one yet thanks for letting me know desley now this is a very important message when we 're looking at risk management for events like i said before it 's really common sense so we don 't want to overthink it too much but a lot of people our obligation around safety at our event as volunteers on a committee you know are we liable if anything happens to anybody well yes you are on a committee if you 're an actual member on a committee that 's organizing an event then yes you are and you should seek legal advice on that if it 's a concern essentially when we 're looking at risk management planning the underlying legal issue around safety all comes down to this term duty of care so it 's your responsibility to take all possible steps to avoid potential injury to anyone involved so that 's all you ever need to be thinking about you cannot stop or prevent everything from happening and there 's certain things that will be outside of your control you can 't control what people do but you can take the necessary steps to influence what they do at your event or to encourage them to avoid doing anything and that can be something as simple as you know where you position a security guard in order to stop people from you know accessing a dangerous area you possibly can to try to stop people from accessing that dangerous area but you cannot physically stop them from accessing that dangerous area so you have displayed a duty of care in that case even if that person is to go into it you know dangerous area of the site after being told not to by a security guard and injure themselves or something happens you have done what you can in terms of the duty of care which means then you are not technically from a legal perspective liable around any health and safety issues that arise from that so always be thinking it 's our duty of care to make sure anybody coming onto our event site you know is safe and that they 're aware of any dangers and that we prevent them as much as we possibly can and that 's your job as event organizers or as an event committee now it 's really important to know that risk management or risks is more than the health and safety of people there 's quite a few different types of risks that can impact an 're willing to i 'd love you to let me know you can just pop it into the chat box what would you say are the top let 's just say three or however many you want a maximum of three of the top risks at your event that you need to manage if anyone wants to pop that into the chat box have a think so thinking about your event what are the top three risks that you need to manage when i 'm working on events risk management planning is one of the most important planning tools or processes for the event and it 's similar you know we 've talked about strategic planning we 've talked about having a timeline we 've talked about a marketing schedule it 's just as important as those documents in terms of the initial planning of your event because what it does it helps guide decision making and planning because if you know there 's any risk around any element of your event then that 's going to influence how you plan and manage that aspect of the event so it to actually put in place in those early stages of your event and what i suggest you do when you 're developing the risk management plan the first thing should be getting your team together and brainstorming with them sitting down and getting people 's heads together to start to define and identify what are the risks to your event lots of things will jump out at you straight away because you know your events so well but there will also be things that you just can 't see and that 's why it 's good to get other people together to actually start to brainstorm it and like i just said that risks are more than just health and safety so they cover all areas of europe of your event what you need to be thinking about are things like you know risks that can cause injury to an attendee or participant so that 's your typical health and safety and they 're often things that come to mind first risk could be anything that cause damage to equipment infrastructure or the event site there 's even things like future of your event or even the organizing committee so this can be things like financial risk legal risk human resource risk so there 's quite a number of different types of risks and i want to look at those just briefly with you in a moment but what you need to do is ask yourself as many what if questions as you can and that 's going to help you identify your risk so what if we lost power supply what if the key managers were sick on the day what if there was a storm during the event what if a major sponsor or a grant funding partner was lost so asking yourself those what if questions will help you identify the types of risks for your event so let 's just have a quick look at the different types i won 't get bogged down in this but i just wanted to make sure you have a really clear understanding of all of the different types of risks because when we 're looking at a risk management plan i want you to be thinking about all areas said the one that is probably top of mind for most people is health and safety so absolutely the health and safety of anybody attending your event so your event attendees should be a really significant priority for you but i also don 't want you to forget the health and safety risks to your volunteers what about during setup and pack down they 're often the times particularly packed down you know when everyone 's exhausted they just want it to be over sometimes you know some you know some policies or um processes on site may kind of fall to the wayside because we 're all a bit exhausted and we just want to get this done you know lifting heavy things driving forklifts cars on site you know it 's really important to consider those things because as soon as we 're a little fatigued that 's when accidents can happen more so when we 're talking about health and safety we want to think about anybody on our site so we 're talking about our event patrons or attendees our suppliers and our volunteers and staff that me you need to consider are hazards in the outdoors so snakes i mean i 've worked on many events in rural parts of australia and we often have incidents where we 'll see a snake how do you deal with that you need to think about falling tree limbs particularly if you 're in a got camp areas even dust you know sun stroke all of those things that come with an outdoor event in regional australia as i said volunteer injury particularly during setup and pack down public safety you know the the increased cost that comes from security and public safety overcrowding you know you can get often you know if you 've got mass gathering you know we have things what that we call crowd surges you know you often see this at music events so everybody rushes you know when a certain act comes on the stage or there 's a certain performance i mean you can even get it i 've seen it happen at kids events where you know a particular performer you know the wiggles for example come on stage and same place it 's the same kind of thing you know overcrowding can lead to health and safety risks we 've got natural disasters so fire flood excessive heat pedestrian traffic so you know accidents from you know people accessing in and out of your site or car park areas and then we 've got the fun things that we add to our list over the last few years are things like terrorism and covert and i 'm not going to go into that in detail because for a lot of our events particularly terrorism is not a high concern however there are some certain things that have been coming out through local government australia around what councils need to be doing to encourage events to actually consider things like terrorism which sometimes for our events we will think how stupid that 's really inappropriate for our event but it 's one of those things that we just don 't know and obviously covert is now a new risk to health and safety at events particularly mass gatherings when we 've got lots of people in one condensed or confined with things like bushfires you know in places like victoria they have what they call code red days um which are a big risk for high bushfire prone areas um we 're also familiar with weather conditions so bad weather you know cold rainy that can be a risk to attendance at our event so it 's really important to be thinking about what are those environmental risks that could impact on our event um you know it 's as i said whether natural disaster other things around environment are also really important you know the things like unnecessary energy use excessive litter and waste contamination of watercourses pollution you know really important to consider those environmental risks around your event there 's actually a really cool [Music] checklist that 's available around environmental management of events you know and it addresses things like you know looking at uh how to manage waste recycling you know a whole heap of things around environmental sustainability for events and i 'm happy to share that with you following this session it 's a really useful checklist just to give you insight into when we 've got a large number of people coming into an area there are potential environmental risks that can come from that and a lot of people when they 're at an event or on a holiday they tend to relax their own values a little you know so even if they are quite good at home in terms of you know managing recycling or you know littering or whatever it may be [Music] there 's this natural tendency when people are on a holiday or at an event to actually relax some of those values that they have at home so we need to be able to understand that and put in place things to actually prevent that from happening at our event and the other thing to consider as well when we talk about environmental risks are things like placing pressure on water-stressed communities and also can this thing we call community license so is your event placing any pressure or risk to on to or on your community and it 's really important to consider that you know sometimes community can be really uh i guess communities being overrun by tourists they can 't get their usual car parks you know these are things that we need to consider because we need to have the community support for our event placing pressure on water stress communities that 's that 's one that 's come up a lot in the work that i 've been doing for the last probably three or four years um being based in southeast queensland you know i 've done a few events in warwick you know in the last few years and as we know there 's been some issues around stanthorpe and water in the southern downs and there was some concern around you know attracting visitors in for an event when the communities have already got a lot of pressure on them in terms of access to water so once again they 're risks that you wouldn 't normally think of for your event but they 're really important in terms of ensuring a sustainable and a successful event for um for you now and into the future financial risk this is all about any risk that will result this is all about how do we manage our budget and our finance as well and we covered off on a lot of this last week a lot of what i covered off uh in last week 's finance session really talked about how you can mitigate a lot of risk around uh having you know around your event finance so having a good budget that 's managed and reviewed regularly so you 're actually always got a good understanding of your actual expenses and income versus what you 've projected so that you can make sure that you 're able to adapt and be flexible so you don 't end up with any unexpected costs or financial loss at the end of your event so some risks that you should be keeping in mind a loss of income due to reduced ticket sales or poor attendance uh there could be you know budgeting risk around spending money you don 't have and we see that a bit it 's just like i just really need this if we need to get some extra power cords or we 've got the money at the event it 's really risky another risk is changes in local or state government priorities for funding so if you are dependent on state government funding and then all of a sudden they change that funding and it 's no longer available to your event what kind of impact is that going to have on your event under budgeting or overspending as we 've just talked about and a loss of major sponsors and i talked a lot about the risk around you know being dependent on sponsorship in our session last week as well so what would happen if you lost a major sponsor at your event what kind of financial impact is that going to have on your event and these are all things that need to be addressed in your risk management plan if you are really dependent on some grant funding or a particular sponsor or sponsors you need to note that in your risk management plan and you need to be thinking about ways to overcome that once again i talked a lot about that last week in terms of having you 're not dependent or highly dependent in one particular area we also have what we call technology risks so we are now very much living in this world full of digital and technology so it 's really important for us to consider any risks around this so you know often we think okay well we 've got mobile phones you know on site we 'll be fine as a team just talking on our mobile phones and this is a real life example that i suffered from a few years ago where we thought okay as a team there were a certain number of two-way radios that a few people had otherwise we 're just like we 'll just use our mobile phones to stay in touch with each other throughout the day it was a big site what happened was no mobile phones would work on the day because we had excessive mobile phone and data usage so 10 to 12 000 people on this site it actually overloaded the mobile phone coverage and data and it all just failed on the day so there was no mobile did that impact the communications amongst the team it also meant that we couldn 't really gain maximum value from people sharing photos and content on social media during the day because they couldn 't load anything they couldn 't get onto any of their social media channels the other thing to be aware of is drones so um you need to actually have approval to use drones so any unauthorized um airspace intrusion over your event event site is a no-no and you need to be mindful of that as well if you 've got media coming in etc they need to have paperwork to actually show that they 've got that authorization we 're all pretty familiar with spam and scams they just seem to be endless these days so you know just keeping those risks in mind also ticketing system failure so if you have online ticketing you need to be aware of that or be ready for that system to potentially fail also viruses so this is more from an administration or a back of house perspective but what do you do if you get a a whole heap of key information or data or contacts for your event so as i 'm talking about these i hope what you 're thinking in your mind is how would we deal with that what would we do because that 's what risk management is all about we 're trying to think about what the risks are and then we 've got to mitigate them so straight away you go talk about viruses loss of data is how do you back up all of your event information and we can 't leave off this whole um conversation around social media and the reason that 's in there as a potential risk is because it 's negative um publicity uh it there 's so many things with social media that can actually have a detrimental impact on your event human resource risks i 'm like i said at the start this can be overwhelming i 'm obviously giving you a really broad insight into the different types of risks once again some of these risks will not be appropriate to your event or relevant to your event at all just going through a whole list of risks to try to overwhelm you it 's about making you aware that there are a variety of different risks that cover different areas of your event so human resource risks are things like losing key personnel and this one 's really important because a lot of the time in events that are volunteer run there tends to be one or two people that are key to the delivery of that event often they have a lot of information up here that isn 't documented they just know how things happen they know who to contact what happens if you lost them and how do you prevent that from being a problem volunteer management is a risk so knowing how to motivate them how to use them and when to use them so if you don 't know those things they can become hard work what do you do if volunteers don 't show up if you 've got a team of volunteers that you 're really waiting on to deliver on a particular part of the event and you have no shows blowout so poor time management you know managing those can be challenging lack of innovation and inspiration for growth so we talked about i think it was in the business planning session we talked about this whole thing of a lot of events becoming same same so that 's lack of innovation and there 's risks around that because your event could become quite stagnant you know it starts to plateau and could fall in terms of its growth and success and that can be as a result of the committee or the volunteers just getting tired how do you prevent that from happening succession planning higher turnover and the final one on the list there is you know a key piece of your entertainment whether it 's your headline act a speaker not showing up or being late or even worse they come but they 're really poor quality so they 've oversold themselves and they don 't deliver the experience that you 've sold to your attendees that can be really awkward and it can have a negative impact on the reputation of your event so how do of risks i just want to talk about today is marketing risks so these are things like negative social media and reviews you know social media is great because we we are so connected these days however the flip side of that is we are so connected these days and we can get out our information our thoughts our opinions to a very big audience very quickly like instantly so something happens at the event and i have a negative experience i can jump straight on my phone and go blah blah blah blah never coming to this event again and it might even might not even be the event 's fault that this has happened it could be a third party you know food truck that you have at your event that has given a bad experience like cust bad customer service to an attendee but it 's the event that suffers in terms of um you know the social media or review so how do you manage that poor feedback uh can jeopardize the event the following year so you know making sure you 're managing that feedback events industry is highly competitive well obviously it hasn 't been for the last 12 months but it 's a very competitive space and i feel that once we get through this challenging time we 're in right now it 's going to be even more competitive as events start to continue to come back online we also don 't have access to international artists so it 's going to be really competitive trying to acquire or attract good quality australian talent so what if you can 't secure any is that a risk to your event or local talent is more your thing there 's the the risk of your festival um losing its spark if you like because there 's competing events locally and regionally so that 's whole thing of how do you make sure you 've got that point of difference complacency is a good one you know the volunteers the committee community council becoming complacent there 's risks associated with that and finally lack of promotion or targeting the wrong markets that 's a marketing risk spending money where you shouldn 't be spending money session so that gives you a really comprehensive overview of the different types of risks that you need to start identifying for your event so this is what you need to brainstorm with your committee sit down and look at all of those different categories and think about okay what are the things that could have any kind of negative impact on our event and then you 'll come up with a full list of risks that you can share with everybody and get feedback and then you start to go okay what have we missed have we covered everything and that 's the first step is identifying your risks so what i want you to do now is go to page 15 in the document that i shared with you so the risk management plan template and in that document i 'm going to give you about 10 minutes or so so if you need to make a cup of tea or go the bathroom these are the little moments to do that as well but what i want you to do is now that i 've just talked you to fill out on page 15 as much as you can in the first five columns so you 'll see there 's a table but i just want you to think about the first five columns for now don 't worry about that that first column is like the activity that 's not so important you can categorize those activities later but if you go what 's the potential hazard or the risk what 's the consequence of that happening who is it likely to impact so who is at risk and what existing control measures do you have in place right now so what things do you have in place to try to control that risk do your best to fill out those five columns even if you just get the first i 'm excluding the activity column i mean that you can always do that later i want you to focus on potential hazard consequence and who is at risk if you can do existing control measures things come to mind pop those down as well but potential hazard consequences and who is at risk i 'm any questions or you want to brainstorm something or discuss something as you 're working through that please own me it yourself and ask or if you prefer put it in the chat box i 'm going to open the chat box up now and have a look at what you 've already put in there so i 'll keep an eye on that if you prefer to do that do your best to try to work these things out for your event if you 've already got a risk management plan think about things that might not be in that plan based on what i 've just shared with you in the different types of risks i 'm just going to put myself on mute while you are working on that if i do start to talk and you can see me my lips moving and no sound can you just remind me how 's everyone going have we at least identified a few you know maybe even two or three potential risks or hazards good job i 've got a big thumbs up from desley so that 's that but i 'm going to move ahead we 're going to essentially now we 're going to go to the next step so this is all about first of all we identify the risk so what i 'm trying to do is give you a practical experience of how you can best do a risk management plan so we 've identified the risk and as i said that would typically be a process of working with your team or a small component of your team to actually brainstorm what those risks might be you fill in that first section and then we move on so essentially we 've covered step one which is identifying the risks now we want to move into the next few steps so step two is then the need to evaluate the risk then we start to look at mitigating the risk and i actually added step four myself so usually people just go step one two three i added step four because i feel like there 's a real need to actually review your risk management plan at the end of the event actually up did you mitigate everything really well were there any new risks that you identified during the event that should be noted for the plan for next year and i know it 's really daunting when you have to do stuff post event because we 're all super exhausted but this just makes it easier for future years so make sure you do allow that time at the end of the event to actually really think about what do we need to change adjust adapt or improve in our risk management process now i just want to have a little closer look at step two and three so we 're going to look at how we evaluate the risk and then we 're going to have a look at how we mitigate the risk so once we 've identified all of our risks it 's essentially this process of working out the likelihood of it happening so it 's frequency or its probability and this is where you look at risk management plans and go oh it starts to become a bit complicated when you 've got formulas but it some time to think about this in a moment for the risks that you 've just identified but basically you 're trying to work out what 's the likelihood of the risk happening is it very unlikely is it unlikely is it likely or is it very likely so that 's the first thing you 're doing is what is the likelihood of it happening and then you start to look at well what 's the consequence it would have or the impact it would have if it happened so as you can see in that matrix um sorry i put the timer on for the 10 minutes that was my timer you can see there in the matrix when we look at the consequence or the impact we 're looking at is it could it be a insignificant is it a moderate consequence or impact is it high or is it severe so then we start to just evaluate or categorize our risks and that will help us determine the level of risk so the level of of risk is essentially the consequence versus the likelihood of it happening need to do this what 's the point of actually you know evaluating our risks because then and you 'll see i 'm going to talk about this in a moment then you start to determine what action needs to be taken on it because if it you know is extreme risk then you need to get rid of that that is not acceptable you do not want any extreme risks at your event if it 's something that is you know very likely to happen and have severe outcomes or consequences you want to try to get rid of that altogether you can 't manage that that 's you know scary to think that you could have that it could be high risk so that 's where if it is a high risk you need to consider alternative activity so try to get rid of any high risks unless you feel like you can put in appropriate control measures if it 's a medium risk then you look at developing and implementing a mitigation plan so how do we mitigate that how do we try to prevent that from that we have very good duty of care to try to mitigate or prevent that as much as possible low risk we just want to monitor and manage that so you might have just a simple procedural process in place that manages that because one thing we need to remember here when we 're looking at anything with risk and events we do not want to impact on the quality of experience by you know being too risk-averse and that can be a hard balance to find and you know i 'll give you an example we um we worked on um apollo cross event which was an international event and one we wanted to try to attract people that have never seen that sport played before and one of the key selling points because a lot of people think of polo when you say polo crossed so one of the key things for us in terms of selling that event was the actual um opportunity to be sitting right on the sideline of a game so you know in our marketing we talked a lot about you know you you 're sitting that close to a game you may end up with sweat off the horse thrown on you like it 's this trying to tell people you are right there amongst the action so that 's a key selling point or it was a key selling point for us for that event but we had to manage the risk as well because when you think about you know the pace of horses playing polo cross um and then having people sitting right on the sidelines not like not bright on top of them obviously there is a a barrier there but right you know not like polo where you 're sitting you know away from the field in a marquee so we had to put in place risk management um processes and systems that allowed us to still be able to actually deliver that experience but also manage the risk and show that we put a duty and had a good duty of care in place so it 's important that when you 're looking at all of this with your event that you also keep in mind care but i also don 't want to take away the experience that we deliver for our attendees and that 's not what risk management is about if you do risk management well you can still deliver the experience but you 're delivering it in a safe way where risk is managed or mitigated i hope that makes sense now just to give you an example of this evaluation framework so let 's say a fire okay so a fire may be unlikely at your event but it could have severe consequences if it was to happen so its level of risk is unlikely but the consequence is severe so that gives you a medium risk and as i said that 's where we want to develop and implement any mitigation plan so we want to know if there is a fire on its way to our site or risk of fire this is the plan that we 're going to put in place to make sure that we do not have those severe consequences so this is a process of evaluating the risks i 'm going to hand back to have a little play with this in terms of the events you 've just identified for your event so once you 've evaluated the level of each risk you 're then able to better understand the priorities and what actions are required to mitigate that 's why it 's important to do this because some risk you might go you know they 're very insignificant so low some may be extreme so you start to go okay we need to pay some attention to these extreme risks and we need to get rid of them otherwise the event is way too risky to run and you focus some energy in that place so that 's why it 's important to evaluate the risks what i want to do now just going to give you five minutes because i just want you to think about what i 've just shown you i want you to go through so if you just listed a couple of risks in your template i want you to look at the next three columns so we first looked at the first five columns but i to look at these three so think of each of your risks that you 've identified what is the likelihood level what is the consequence or impact level and then based on that what is the risk level or priority based on this matrix which is also in the template that you 've been provided so you 'll see it in there so you can refer to it to help you determine uh the level of risk so what 's the likelihood of the event happening sorry of the event well that is a big question we ask these days uh what is the likelihood of that risk that you 've identified happening and what 's the consequence if it was to happen low moderate high so i 'm going to just mute myself again and give you a few moments if anyone has any questions once again sorry i muted myself too soon put them in the chat box or you can also unmute yourself and i 'm happy to discuss it with you okay how did we go with that did anyone end up with some high medium you go destly um mine were all medium all medium yep anyone get anything that was extreme fingers crossed no so with those medium to high that 's where mitigation comes into play so like i said if it 's a low risk so once you categorize them you 've got low medium high or extreme extreme are the ones we have to get rid of those you can 't run an event with extreme risks around it unless you 're a major daredevil and you think you can survive it but i certainly wouldn 't be keen on that so we want to try to get rid of any extreme risks our low risk like we said usually usually just some standard procedures you know you can manage those quite well but what we need to really focus on are those medium to high risks that you 've identified because they 're the ones where we need to look at them and decide on what steps we 're going to take to try to reduce or avoid them so what we can do to so to reduce or avoid reduce the likelihood of the risk happening so how can you reduce the likelihood of it happening is that through training staff is that through some form of maintenance is it a change in procedure is it around some form of compliance and then we want to try to reduce the impact if the risk does occur so this could be having a public relations plan it could be about having off-site data back up emergency procedures you know depending on what the actual risk is so we want to reduce the likelihood of it happening and we want to reduce the impact if the risk occurs so some steps to try to reduce and avoid them are elimination so are you able to remove the risk completely by you know changing your program or putting in place a new process or redesigning the site layout are there ways you can eliminate it entirely substitution is another way of mitigating risk so that 's replacing you know risky materials or methods with less risky alternatives so think about what that risk is why is it a risk and is there so you still you 're not impacting on the event by removing it all together but you 're putting in place a more safe substitute engineering so you can isolate the risk or the hazard by changing you know the design the layout the site administration so this is where we ensure safe operating procedures are in place so this is around you know training staff having good documentation and plans in place like i said pr public relation plan um you know good operating manuals and systems around you know using electricity or site setup and pack down so making sure you 've just got in place good processes and procedures can help mitigate a risk personal protective equipment so you know gloves hats sunscreen you know thinking about you know even not just from your own perspective in terms of your volunteers and your staff but how do you ensure also that attendees have you know appropriate sun protection and enough water and you know when we talk about things like heat stroke or dust or you know for those outdoor events in regional parts of australia we those attending the event are equipped to actually handle those conditions as well so you need to be thinking about all those ways you can try to mitigate so you 're reducing the likelihood of the risk happening and reducing the impact if the risk occurs so this is where you need to think about those risks you 've identified and answer those two questions how can i reduce the likelihood of it happening remember we 're just reducing the likelihood these we don 't need to get rid of these all together we know that they 're there and they could happen but your duty of care is to reduce the likelihood of a happening the next thing i want you to consider is well how do i reduce the impact so if it does occur so if we can 't mitigate it and it does occur how do i make sure i can reduce the impact on the event on our attendees etc so now with with a couple of those risks that you identified in the template now i want you to think about this once again on that table now that you 've identified the risk you 've you 've evaluated the risk so you know what level it 's at for any of those that are medium or high i want you just to think through what are the mitigation and prevention measures what can we do to reduce the chance of it happening or if it does happen to reduce the level of impact that it has and who 's responsible to manage that i 'll just give you a few minutes i just want you to get a feel for the process okay i hope that that gave you a bit of insight into that process so it 's just like i said right at the start of our session today it 's it 's common sense i don 't want you to overthink it too much sometimes we just try to think too much when we go into risk management mode but just think of what are those things that could happen but always think beyond health and safety so it 's also thinking about those things that can happen from a your event often brainstorming all those risks is the hardest part once you 've got them you can then evaluate them and put in place mitigation measures the other thing i want you to think about is incident response plan so if there 's any medium or high risks that just can 't_''_4370.4 be avoided or transferred or reduced then you need to develop an incident response plan what this is and most of you look for smaller events i 'm assuming majority of your events you 'll be able to put in place you know good mitigation measures to try to avoid um or to transfer or reduce any of the risks that you 've identified but if there is anything that you just it 's at a medium or high risk level and you think i just don 't know how we can avoid this so this is you know that example of polo cross you know we had the risk around you know injury on the sideline we didn 't want to remove that because that 's part of the experience so we had to have an of the risk if it does occur so basically what the incident response plan does is it gives really clear instructions on what we do if the risk does happen it 's all about how you manage these high risks it 's that duty of care sometimes a risk can happen but if you manage it really well it 's not going to have a negative impact on your event if a risk happens and you manage it poorly then that 's going to have a severe impact on your event particularly when we talk about negative publicity or reputational damage what we also need to be mindful of and i 'm not telling you this to scare you but with you know mobile phones with video um and we 've got social media commentary from attendees so when something bad happens at an event and let 's face it bad things happen attendees can quickly use mainstream media to publicize it so before you 've even had a chance to respond it can be out there in the world of social media so you need to be mindful of who 's going to respond to the incident and who 's going to communicate it to media and also on social media because it 's all about how we respond and how we manage a risk when it happens once we get to this point so in an incident response plan it will include these things as you can see on the screen now and we 've got a template of this that we 've supplied to you as well if you need to use it it 'll have the plan activation details it 'll have the teams detail so who 's responsible for it you 'll have details on an emergency kit it will have evacuation procedures a communication plan so how will you keep everyone safe a media communication plan so i was saying before who 's going to be putting out communication on mainstream media and also on social media it 'll have a contact list for people to contact so if this risk does happen these are the people we need to contact and it 'll have a log where you can record information and decisions to manage these situations well so this is where you 've got to think through the process and this is where it can sometimes get a little bit overwhelming or scary when you think about okay this is what we have to do if it happens and this is only for those things so mitigation is the key this is only in the case when you feel like those medium or higher risks can 't_''_4609.76 be avoided it still doesn 't mean they 're definitely going to happen it 's just there 's more chance of them happening so you want to know how are we going to respond and manage that one of the most important things actually not one of the most important ensure successful risk management for an event is activation you have to as a committee as an event team you have to have the ability to be able to activate your plan there 's no point having a fancy plan that you 've spent a lot of time on with all the bells and whistles that 's been approved by council and emergency services if be able to activate it on the day so you need to think about a few things in terms of activating the plan do you have the essential resources on site to activate the plan if not there 's plenty of external people that can actually do this for you you need to make sure that you 've given a copy of your plan to emergency services and have a briefing session with them so once your plan is done get together with council you know the ambulance fire police or the emergency services in your community and make sure they 're well briefed on the event and this doesn 't matter how big or small your event is this is all about managing risk if you 've shown your duty of care then you 're reducing the liability to your event or to you and your event committee i always suggest that events assign a risk coordinator so someone with the necessary skills to oversee the activation of the plan and that 's their sole responsibility and you can if you have the resources to do it you can comfortable there 's companies that specialize just in you know event operations or risk management for events and if you are an event that has more risks that might be something that you want to consider the other thing is to ensure that all your volunteers have been trained and briefed on the risk management plan your volunteers or your staff need to be fully aware and also third party providers so if you 've got stall holders coming on site you know anyone that 's on your site needs to be aware of the risk management plan they also need to be aware of the need to take reasonable care to avoid any risks occurring at your event and don 't be afraid to ask for help if you need to talk to council staff or any emergency services or people that are highly experienced in risk management for events ask for help so activation of the plan is the most important thing make sure you 're able to activate it well in order to prevent any negative um reputational damage on your event hands up if you also wrong on event day it 's just the nature of what we do you know how big or small they are will obviously vary hopefully they 're only small things but there 's a lot of things that are also outside of our control and that 's where contingency planning comes in so you can certainly identify risks and you can hopefully mitigate most of them but things can happen that are outside of our control so this is where we want to have for some instances outside or possible incidences outside of our control we want to have a plan b and everybody in your team all your volunteers your committee know need to know about plan b so that they can respond so when when would you need to contingency plan the obvious one that we consider is weather so weather can prevent or inhibit use of outdoor spaces so you know if we were running a you know outdoor event it might be the show it could be a music festival it could be a food event you know under the trees in a paddock and you hot no wind so you 're banking on those conditions and it 's raining where do you relocate your guests what happens what is your plan b what is your plan b if you have lower than expected attendee numbers and this is particularly um concerning when you have say a confined space where you know a speaker or an entertainer or a comedian whatever is staring at a sea of empty seats can you drum up an audience or can you move to a smaller space so it doesn 't look like a lot of empty seats what 's your plan b another one i 've had this one a few times working in remote areas you have lost power what happens if a power cut occurs and everything goes down your internet your av your lights you might have electric doors you might have an outdoor kitchen yeah what happens in that case do you have generator backup what 's your plan b i hate to say it but what about a broken toilet what do i have toilets you know you 've got poor to lose and one portaloo for 300 people can you redirect guests somewhere else do you have an emergency plumber on call what 's your plan b and there 's even things that can happen outside the venue you know imagine you know there 's a roadblock or a protest taking place so people can 't access your venue there 's congestion traffic congestion and you can 't get your headline act in i 've had that happen before so the things some of these things you 're never going to think of before the event but many of them you will so you always need to have that plan b your contingency planning this is the whole what if what if that happened what if that happened so for those things that you simply cannot avoid or that are outside of your control i want you to think about how you are contingency planning or what is your plan b and that doesn 't have to be [Music] you know that doesn 't have to be a five page document of what you 're going to do in each situation it 's communicating it to everyone okay guys if it rains this is what we 're gonna do if for some reason we haven 't sold 100 tickets by three days before the event we 're going to change venues or we 're going to do this it 's very straightforward but you need to document it and you need to communicate it to everyone and that 's it that 's your plan b don 't change it at the last minute and the reason i say don 't change it at the last minute is often when we 're in event mode and it 's the last minute we have so many things going through head we can 't make the best decisions so that 's why it 's important to decide on these things in advance now i just wanted to show you this because this is a really cool case study of how important communication is or it demonstrates how important communication is and how it 's done well obviously you guys may not have to have you know practice and promote safe sex and consent at your event serpent festival it 's a magnificent event the the way they run this event um in the operations and the management components of this event are just absolutely slick but the one thing i want to just draw your attention to here is this section on their website where they have community responsibility this is all part of your duty of care right you know we talk about the duty of care you need to make attendees volunteers crews you know third-party suppliers aware of things that can go wrong at the event and give them some you know advice and warning or tips on how they can act responsibly to try to prevent anything from happening and once again if you 're doing this in advance and you 're communicating this to your attendees then that shows really good duty of care on your part so they have this community responsibility section you know i love this look after your mates they have things around you know the 10 pillars of festival safety it 's all common sense but you 're putting that responsibility back on your attendees through do that now we 're nearly done the new risk we all need to consider at future events is our friend covert you need to think about how you 're going to manage risk around covert or transmission of a virus at any of your future events you need to also consider do you have the resources to do it and as you would know we have covert safe planning guidelines in queensland now so that 's very comprehensive in terms of the expectations around your event and once again that varies depending on the size and scale of your event in terms of what measures you need to put in place so we kind of have some guidelines around what 's expected of us there but just some things to help you prepare these are some of the things that i encourage to you to look at when planning your event in 2021 and i 'm going to talk a little bit more about this in our final session in a couple of weeks time when we look at events in a covered safe world but i just want so really the focus is what we 're trying to do is reduce the risk of transmission at our event so the queensland government have given a checklist and some guidelines and each of these areas have actions that you should do before during and after the event so things like governance arrangements what you need to do is identify key staff or volunteer volunteers who are responsible for managing your covert safe plan so like i said if you 've got somebody that just before i started having a a risk coordinator for your event i would also suggest you have a covert safe coordinator that can just focus on making sure that you 're doing everything you need to from a covered safe perspective perspective you need to also think about how you 're going to communicate expectations to event staff and attendees so this is all about communication so including messaging on your event website um you know including messaging in electronic newsletters that you send out through your social media channels so making sure that you 're continually reminding people of their responsibility so you know they 're displaying any covered symptoms reminding them that when they come to the event social distancing is important using hand sanitizer you know good hygiene is all important so communicating that to staff volunteers and attendees is your responsibility one of the hardest things is this whole thing around maintaining physical distancing or social distancing so hard when we you know events are typically um this social environment where people want to be close together so this is a challenge that a lot of events are having is this whole thing of maintaining physical distancing and we can 't physically be pushing people apart so you need to think about how you will encourage physical distancing and there 's a whole range of great examples that have been tested out there so talk to other events things like physical barriers in high foot traffic areas people are using those you know stickers or even just spray painting marks on the ground um so that people have uh a guide of where to stand if they 're in a queue i find they 're quite good because we don 't for us um we 're more likely to do it you might need to think about things where you need to do some screening um you know if people do become unwell can you isolate them from other attendees you know how will that all work you need to be able to facilitate contact tracing we 're all pretty familiar with that now you know the qr codes but for you at your event you need to keep a record of everybody on site so that 's staff volunteers contractors third party providers attendees so you need to think about how you do that regular and thorough cleaning so this requires increased resources so looking at you know your cleaning protocols for the higher traffic areas so your bathrooms your catering areas anywhere where people are sitting down and eating food so you 've got to consider the frequency of cleaning and how you 're cleaning the methods of cleaning as well and then finally the good old hand sanitizer and hand washing facilities you may need to increase the stations that you have around your event site and making and have good hand hygiene so that 's essentially i mean when there 's very comprehensive guidelines for queensland events but they 're really the things when you break it down doesn 't matter what state or territory you 're in they tend to be the key elements that events need to take into consideration i don 't know if that 's going to change with a vaccine i 'm not sure if they will you know reduce some of the requirements on events but at the moment that is what 's expected now i have had the opportunity to talk to a number of events that have been held already under a covert safe plan and these were some of the things that they [Music] provided i guess as tips or words of advice for events that are about to plan or start planning their event in a covered safe way so focus on the attendee experience it 's really important that you focus on ensuring that your experience is just as good despite the covered safety measures it 's so important to make sure that we remain focused you may have seen there 's some or quite a few events uh in all parts of queensland that have said you know what we actually can 't deliver on the attendee experience in a coped safe way because our event is just all about mass crowds people being close together so well there 's no way we can deliver our event in a covered safe environment so therefore we 're just going to have another year off in 2021 and we 'll come back in 2022 and hopefully conditions will have changed another word of advice was when you 're doing your covert safe planning and you 're thinking about you know how you 're going to manage physical distancing screening etc it 's been suggested that you do some role playing of the processes so if you say this is how we 're going to do it actually do some role playing so that you know that it can work in real life it 's highly advised that you talk direct to the public health unit and submit your covert safe plan early so that you can get with the public health unit on solutions that are specific to your individual event and if you 're able to meet them on site at your event site then that absolutely helps because what we need to remember is public health unit department of health they are not experts in events so they have been thrown in the deep end as well so they 're enforcing guidelines on events which they really don 't understand as in they don 't understand events and how events operate so it 's really important to have those conversations with them very early and work through that process so that you don 't leave it to the last minute and things become really delayed another piece of advice was don 't overthink it so when you 're looking at your covert safe plan go back to basics you know someone described it as you know think back to your kindergarten days where it 's like we 're not allowed to push in the queue we 've got to keep our distance in the tuck shop line we 've got to wash our hands really the signs of how to wash your hands it 's kind of like that so without kind of dumbing it down it 's obviously a serious issue but it 's about thinking when you 're thinking of your event just really go back to basics also make it fun where you can so uh there was an event in toowoomba actually a cycling event that was held and they actually gave their volunteer toilet cleaners some fun names so just try to keep it fun where you can start the contact tracing process early and make it simple and fast so if you can have pre-sale tickets or pre-register for your event even if it is a free event still have pre-registered to attend then you 've already got all of their details in the system that 's going to improve or speed up the process for you if you have more space available to you so if there 's space around your event site and you can make your site bigger use it the advice has been spread out chat to council about getting some extra space for your can have and with social distancing in place and finally don 't be restricted by the way you 've done things in the past a lot of event organizers are really overwhelmed by covert and concerned about not being able to do things the way they are used to doing things i suggest you look at it as an opportunity and go how can we do things different so that 's a really quick overview of covert and some things for you to think about because we will need to be factoring in covert safety as part of our risk management plans for events in the near future who knows if that will stay forever but it 's certainly something that will be a real priority for your 2021 22 23 even um events so i hope that 's just given you a bit of insight if you hadn 't already had the chance to do a covert safe plan or at least look at the guidelines and that 's all i have to share with you today in terms of risk management we still have some time so if today or anything that we 've covered in any of our sessions i 'm more than happy to do my best at answering those for you i 'm just going to check the chat box and see if there 's any questions in there yes susie when it rains the day before the show that 's hard and when there 's rain you know forecast but you 're not 100 sure if it 's going to fall on rain on event days it 's really tough to know how to manage that and i 'm sure most of you would be aware that there is such a thing called wet weather insurance so there 's a variety of difference in different insurance policies that you can get one of those being for wet weather however it 's um a very costly insurance and it 's also got a lot of fairly tight parameters around it in that you know you have to have rainfall at a certain time in a certain amount in a certain place to be able to make a claim on it so you just need to that one also with that one it was it impacted our show ring so oh yeah lunch time on the saturday we had to rearrange the whole show ring that had been set up fully on the friday for one way of doing the event and like we did have um the jump ring was too small and that and we said was either have a smaller jump ring or have no jump ring and everyone went yeah rodeo then we 're happy with that but just so you know and i said well there 's only spot we could go so you know um it makes it hard sometimes but a lot of the time you have just got to go on the run and see we contacted our our judges were there um to help change the ring and set up so they had to think on their feet at the same time so is that your contingency plan moving forward now did it work well enough to be able to implement that model if that happens again no i think we 'd rearrange our whole ring um could have changed and put the hack ring into the smaller ring and the jump string back into the hat it 's just a learning curve i think we all learnt after the event but yeah desley you 've just asked the golden question is there any insurance for covert lockdown the number one biggest risk for all events all over australia at the moment is planning with uncertainty around border closures and we 've just seen it in victoria where there was a snap closure only for four days but the impact that had on events and tourism and business was ridiculous so it 's very hard for events to actually organize without that or with that uncertainty around borders and i 've actually just recently been talking to the organizer of big red bash in birdsville and that 's the same for him he 's got an event going ahead in july with 10 500 tickets sold he 's got his covert safe plan approved the biggest risk to him right now is borders being closed and it could actually kill the event to answer your question unfortunately covert and this has been a really hot topic amongst the industry and there 's been some lobbying to government to try to get some kind of insurance policy through government to support events um so there 's no insurance for covert lockdown so it 's a big risk and certainly something that you need to be really mindful of of as you 're planning it 's something you know fingers crossed i mean with the vaccine now starting to be rolled out i 'm hopeful that there won 't be any more need for these lockdowns but it 's so it 's it 's an unknown it 's unknown territory thank you for asking that question because i did overlook mentioning that anybody got any other questions or we happy to wrap up well thank you again i hope that was really useful um in terms of thinking through that process of identifying risks um good luck with it all make sure you use that template so you 've basically got a start now so if you can get a few people in your team or committee or even it with you and feel that out completely it 's a useful document and you 'll be a step ahead in terms of your planning process so i will see everybody again next week and next week i 've already forgotten what we 're looking at we 're looking at event teams in succession planning so that 's all about really looking at how to set up a good structure so that you 've got clear roles and responsibilities on your committee and that everything you do is you know filed in shared systems and documented well so that whenever you 've got changes in committee members it 's a smooth transmission transition sorry my headphones are beeping at me i 'm assuming they 're going flat can you hear me yeah it 's telling me you 're done you 're done [Laughter] thank you all so much um don 't forget to jump into the facebook event if you 've got any questions and i 'm i 'll look in that daily have a good afternoon bye-bye you _"

    "text": "today we 're talking about creating a business plan for your event and as i said this is part of a series so we have six sessions that we 'll be covering over the next six weeks today creating a business plan for your event then we 're going to look at event marketing we 're going to cover off on seeking events sponsorship and grants and talk about event finance and financial viability around events then we 'll go into risk safety and security succession planning um which is also linked to event teams so how to actually you know recruit volunteers maintain volunteers or retain volunteers and also how to be more efficient with volunteers and our final session in march and we 've done this one um last on purpose which is events in a covered world because as i 'm sure everybody is aware on this call today uh it 's an absolute changing environment so we just wanted to hold that one out as long as possible to see if we get some some stability um or even a little bit of clarity around direction that may mean um so basically we 're running all of these assessions at the same time each week so we decided to run them from midday thinking that people will be able to do it in their lunch break or it 's a good time to just grab a bite to eat and sit down and watch the webinar um what i 'm going to aim to do the sessions are designed to be two hours i 'm going to try really hard to cover off on the content within a maximum of an hour and a half and then leave the last half an hour to 45 minutes for discussion time so that i guess is to allow those people that need to go to just hear the content and then be on their way those that have a little bit more time can actually hang around and we can have some open discussion about your particular event or some challenges that you may be facing um the series as well is designed to be as engaging as possible so i will deliver the content but i am your events so there 'll be moments throughout our sessions where i 'll just pause for a few moments and let you just kind of i guess think specifically about your event and what that means for your event um sorry i just had siri on my phone thinking i was talking to her god technology um so it 's really important i guess while i 'm talking through the content in each session that you 're really thinking about what does this mean for our event how does this relate to this event what action do i actually need to take for my event because it is designed to be very practical for you and the other thing as well is you can see there the list of topics that we 're covering over the next six weeks what i also encourage events to do when i do master classes is to invite the relevant committee or team member to the sessions where possible often there 'll be one consistent representative from an event that will attend the full series but then what events do is they 'll say our committee that looks after sponsorship and grant funding for example try to get them to attend the one on 16th of february if you can understand it 's hard from a timing perspective for a lot of people but if that 's possible i highly recommend it and finally just before we get stuck in in between our sessions each week what i encourage you to do is jump into the facebook event so council set up a facebook event if you don 't know the details of that let me know in the chat and i can send i can put a link in the chat for you basically the idea of that is for you to be able to put in any questions so in between our sessions um if you come up with any you know challenges or queries around anything we 've talked about or anything really related to what we 're talking about then i 'm more than happy for you to post that in that facebook event and i 'll be checking in on that on a daily basis and answer any questions other bits and pieces that will help you as well so that 's a very useful resource for you to tap into and also just finally sorry there was one more thing we are recording these sessions so uh the recording will be sent out um this afternoon so that 's also available for you to look back um have another look at anything that you may have missed but it 's also an opportunity for you to share it with your your committee or your team as well um and also just with that in mind if for some reason you have to jump off the call at any point i won 't be offended i understand that everybody 's busy but if you can stay on the live session you 'll certainly gain some more independent advice on your particular event but the recording will be there for you if you need it what i 'd love to do those of you that have just jumped in i encourage you to use the chat box so if you want to start by jumping into the chat box and you 're representing uh it 's a really good way just to have that conversation so even as i 'm speaking if you think of something or a question or an area you may want some more clarity on or some more information on or if you 've even just got a view or perspective um feel free to drop it into the chat box because what i 'll do when we get to the discussion time at the end i 'll go into the chat box and just have a look at that and have a look at what has been dropped in there and see if that sparks any further conversation to get the discussion going at the end so make sure you use that throughout the session today so just a quick introduction for those of you that don 't know who i am i 'm linda tillman i 'm the managing director of a tourism and events consultancy firm based in toowoomba that 's tillma group we 've been operating for 13 years now and we do a lot of strategic development and marketing work for of regional and rural australia um and what we 've done in the last it 's probably the last three years we 've started working a lot more in a capacity building perspective for events and identified really quickly that there was this need to support regional and rural events that you know they potentially don 't have that capability to actually deliver a sustainable event on their own there 's amazing volunteers in the community that are delivering fantastic events but it 's really about getting that back of house stuff in order to make their job so much easier um so that 's what revenge academy is about so we deliver workshops we do mentoring we do strategic development and essentially it 's about holding the hand of event committees to support them in making their job so much more streamlined and efficient because we all know delivering an event is a tough gig it requires a lot of hours there 's a lot of stress there 's a lot of energy that goes into it and my belief is that if we can put in place good it makes that job of delivering an event so much easier so that 's what revents is all about so you 'll see as we go through our sessions over the next six weeks it 's all about assisting you in developing those really good foundations for your events so that you can enjoy the fun parts a little bit more okay now today let 's get into it as i said we 'll deliver the content in one and a half hours maximum and then we 'll have open discussion so if you think of anything that you want to talk about in the discussion please make note of that in the chat box so what we 're hoping to achieve today is to gain a better understanding of the stage that your event is in in its life cycle and what that means for the future of your event so today we 're looking at big picture we 're looking at strategic direction we 're looking at business plan we 're looking at the model of your event it 's really starting to go where do we want need to do is to understand where it is at the moment in its life cycle we 're going to touch on then reinvigoration how do you reinvigorate your events so that it 's appealing to your target markets and how do you keep it fresh every year so that those target markets keep coming back we 're going to talk about how to deliver an event experience we 're going to touch on event trends and what attendees are looking for because there 's some really distinct trends in not just in events but globally at the moment that are having an impact on events and then we 're going to talk about i guess in a more practical sense business planning so how do we actually set measurable goals and how do we smash them out of the park what 's the point of that because i know a lot of people you say do you have a business plan for your event or the first thing when you go to apply for funding is they want a strategic plan or business plan or an event plan whatever they just don 't have the energy to do that so this is all about trying to make that job a bit easier for you so you 've got that strategic direction and you know where you want to go so by now you should have received an email from me so i sent that out last week and that had a business plan template in it if anybody didn 't receive that let me know in the chat box and i 'll make sure you get a copy if you 've got a copy of that i make make sure you 've got that handy during the session today just to scribble notes in it because we 'll start looking at that in the in the second part of today 's session but it 'd be good idea to just have it there to start scribbling notes all right before we get started i just want to get a sense from you who has a business plan and who 's using a business plan and who 's used to that whole process so just bear with me i 'm all to jump in and respond okay now on the screen you should see a poll which you have the um ability to respond to so we 've got two questions in there do you have a current strategic plan or business plan for your event and this doesn 't have to be a 40-page document so i 'm not talking about a business plan that an external consultant has come in and created for you it could be a one-pager you know something simple that documents your vision and how you will get there the second question is do you refer to this regularly to help guide your decision making and direction okay a couple of people have responded i 'll give another 20 seconds or so for everybody to respond this will just be interesting and i 'll share the results with you in a moment it 'll be interesting to see where everybody 's at okay let 's have a look here okay i 'll just share those with you so you can see there you know quite interesting um i know we don 't have huge you can see it 's i guess it 's in the middle there yes some have it but it 's old and majority are saying well i 'm not sure do you refer to this regularly to help guide your decision making once again not sure so that could mean those people on the line today perhaps are new or haven 't_''_750.16 been strategically involved in the event um and it could also mean you know no there isn 't actually a business plan for the event because if you 're involved in the committee i would like to hope that you 'd be aware of a business plan it 's good to see that those that do have it that you do refer to it even though it may only be once a year to track progress that 's still better than most the unfortunate situation that a lot of events fall in with business planning by no fault of their own is they have a business plan created or they create their own business plan and then everything gets so busy just turning the calls of the event forget to come back to it all the time and it can be hard to i guess reset um when necessary but i think even more so now considering the period we have just been through or are still going through with covert it 's so important for events to have an appreciation of the direction they 're going in and now is a really good time to you know reset we 've had most of us have had close to a year off in terms of the delivery of events you know and that gives everybody i guess that space to just reflect and to think what are we doing with this event what 's our purpose so looking at the business plan now having had that downtime is really important to go okay where do we want to take it and often the first question that 's asked is what 's the purpose i always say to people go back to why explore that question around why do we actually run this event why was this event even started however many years ago what was its purpose so event life cycle sorry just admitting somebody else this is something that i 've created there 's many different versions of this uh out there but essentially what this does is look at that life cycle of an event and i 've developed this based on what i have seen over the last 10 or so years with events in regional and rural communities across australia a lot of these events have hit that maturity stage in their life cycle and they 've got a lot of challenges around volunteer capacity you know having enough volunteers and also access to funds so financial viability so volunteers and finances are usually the two big things that events in regional parts of australia struggle with and probably not even just in regional parts of australia to be honest but that 's the area i focus on um they 're really struggling to find the time and the energy to consider how they revitalize their event so they 're kind of sitting at that maturity stage and they barely have the time and energy to turn the cogs every year and what i few times is that 's just making the event happen so i kind of see that there 's there 's kind of two little buckets in in events maybe not little but one is just making the event happen ticking the boxes making the event happen every year it 's kind of you 've got a model you 've got a format you tick all your boxes you get it done the event happens that 's great and it 's probably a fantastic success then there 's this whole other bucket which is about how do we keep our event fresh how do we add new things to our event how do we gain feedback from our visitors to understand what they want from our event how do we look strategically at the future of our event so it 's kind of those two buckets and most events do the turning the cogs or the event delivery part really well but it 's really hard for them to find the time to do this and that 's why we have so many that are sitting at that maturity stage and this has been the case for maybe two to three years now is around providing external advice and expertise around how to revitalize an event so i work a lot with events that are at that maturity stage and they 've plateaued and they 're looking for external help to actually bring their event back to life and to reimagine their event so what we 're going to look at in our session today and everything that i 'm talking to you about is essentially the process that i take these events through it 's how i assist them to reinvent their event and to gather that you know that direction and that newfound life and another thing i just want to point out as well and it 's important to note this is that it 's okay for an event to run its course and cease operation you can 't_''_1066.72 force an event that is done or a committee or a community that is done so that 's just something to put into your mind i 'm not saying to everybody you know go down that path absolutely but little bit overwhelming so that 's something just to keep in mind some events do have a use by date i guess but the most important thing in this process is that you as an event coordinator as a committee member as a community member is to be completely open to embracing change we need to be brave as event organizers we need to be open-minded enough to allow our events to evolve based on demand and trends because it 's a really competitive space there are events everywhere and there 's more and more events popping up another piece of work that i do from a consulting perspective is i work with councils around event development and in the last 12 months we 've worked with a number of councils across regional australia looking at strategic development of new festivals so it 's there 's more and more events popping up all the time so being fresh being innovative being you know open to change is really important to future success so always thinking about your event and going okay well that 's not working let 's flip it you to just be really open-minded through this process today and be thinking about your event don 't limit your self because there 's so much potential now as i talk through these next few slides where i 'm going to just briefly touch on these different um stages so here you can see i 've got the new event what i what i 've essentially classified as three stages new event establishing event and mature event so i 'm just going to talk through each of those really quickly but i want you to think about where does your event currently sit and i 'm going to ask you um to put that in the chat box but as you kind of think about where does your event currently sit in that life cycle i want you to consider and this is going to influence you know business planning for your event i want you to consider what what you need to do to influence change if change is what you 're looking for alright so new events i mean pretty self-explanatory what a new event is you 're 're new everyone wants to check it out you know everyone 's like oh we 've got this new event yeah you know so it 's it 's quite popular and you know sexy the media are also keen on new events so as you would know they want new stories freshness all the time so they 're keen to feature events and stories that are new i always say to new events don 't get too excited by that interest and and excitement that 's coming from the community because often the first year or two is the easiest year because you 're fresh and you 're new so so you tend to get a lot of attention what you need to do as a new event is to be so focused on how do we maintain this because as you start to move up this curve you start to move into an establishing event where it 's not as easy to attract attendees to your event to secure media exposure to attract sponsors if you 're just doing the same thing year on year and you hit that little bit harder for you so as an established event i typically classify this as an event that 's reached their ideal attendee numbers and they 've stag they 've stagnated essentially they 've kind of got their ideal visitor numbers and it 's not moving to it might kind of move a little bit but it 's starting to stagnate you typically as an establishing event you know you 're you 're fairly healthy from a financial perspective so your profit is starting to become a reality your success is still rising and everyone still finds your event fresh and exciting and fun but as i said before you have to work that bit harder to keep your audience interested if you just get to the establishing event stage and you 're just you know doing the same thing year on year and you know struggling to kind of get that momentum then you 're going to hit maturity much quicker and you may start to plateau at that point so establishing events need to work quite hard to maintain that interest and enthusiasm and freshness and then we this is where your attendee numbers have definitely plateaued and perhaps have even started to decline a little bit and also when you hit that maturity stage you also find that you 're struggling to keep the team motivated so your volunteers your committee they 're all starting to get a bit tired and exhausted you also start to notice other events in the region start getting the attention because everyone 's tired your program and the experience that you 're offering tends to be the same every year because you just don 't have the energy to be creative from a financial perspective because numbers are starting to drop a little bit and you know the team 's a little bit tired usually what you 'll find is that reserve kitty that you had may start to be eaten into and this is where you 're starting to go what 's the future for us how are we going to reinvent ourselves how are we going to get ourselves out of this where are the opportunities for our event and it 's that is exciting you know i know a bit like oh well that 's the end right well no it 's not and that 's the point of this is that is not the end there are many many events across regional australia that have been operating for 80 plus years and those events have successfully reinvented themselves it just takes a bit of time and energy and commitment all right i 'm just going to share another poll now that i 've shared those different stages with you i want to know what stage of the life cycle is your event currently in bear with me for one second all right you should see that now just don 't think about it too much um but where do you see your event sitting at the moment oh wow okay there 's a couple still to vote i 'll give another 10 seconds or so okay how exciting i actually did not expect that so new events that 's great um i haven 't had a chance to look in the chat box yet so to actually understand what event names i mean i obviously did see actually realize we had a large number or a large percentage of new events that 's great so mature and new events nobody has classified their event as establishing which is very interesting so those mature events this is where revitalization is really important for new events for you it 's absolutely critical as well because revitalization is not something that we leave until we 're our events 50 years old right we don 't we shouldn 't wait until we hit maturity to revitalize our event i actually believe it 's something that needs to be done on an annual basis so how do we revitalize how do we reinvigorate think about it how do you renew your event when you 've been doing something for so long how do you renew it how do you know where to start what are some of the things that you would do to regenerate or rejuvenate or stimulate your event what would you do there 's a few key things that you need to do i 'm sorry but it 's not about you it 's about your attendees and this with events we have committees and community members that are so passionate about their event and that 's why i love working with events because you guys the people that are working really hard to deliver these events are amazing inspiring people but what that also means is sometimes we get so passionate about it we start to think about what we want and and what 's best for us and we forget that we 've actually got all of these attendees or potential intendees that are the ones we should be listening to so the number one most important thing when looking to keep your event fresh or to reinvigorate or reinvent is to listen to your attendees you need to consider all the decisions you make and all of the planning that you undertake based on what your ideal event attendees want and we 're going to talk a lot about ideal event attendees next week when we talk about marketing but essentially it 's your target audience so gathering feedback from them regularly is very important and as i said before that 's something that should be really intimate knowledge of what it is that your attendees want what their expectations are what they enjoy what they don 't what they 'd love to see at your event so this is where you know doing attendees surveys each year and even when you 're working on your business plan trying to gather some more in-depth insights and feedback from a you know small group of attendees is really useful so when you 're looking to reinvigorate always think about your attendees the other thing you want to do when you 're looking to reinvigorate or reinvent your event and also when you 're developing your business plan i want you to look broader than your own bubble you need to look at the trends that are impacting events and how you might be able to embrace some of these in your event some of the things that are quite important at the moment and you may have heard some of these things are things like micro festivals conscious travelers has anyone heard of conscious travelers things like immersive experiences authentically local and diverse and accessible events so at the moment um globally for smaller volume higher quality micro events so this is all about doing more with less so this is not about having mass gatherings as such what it is is about saying we 're going to create a really high quality exclusive event experience for limited numbers of people so it becomes a more premium type experience and this is something that has definitely spiked um as we 're coming out of um covert and covered restrictions for obvious reasons so it 's something to think about with your event you know do do we need to be so focused on mass numbers and large crowds or can we create more of a intimate premium exclusive experience with a micro event which could be a series across the year rather than just one big date and it 's certainly appealing to um prospective attendees as well because they get a richer experience other thing to be very mindful of when you 're looking at the future of your event is this idea of a conscious traveler this is all around sustainability responsib responsible and sustainable essential to the success of your event um in the immediate future so you want to be basically attendees are demanding sustainable practices and responsibility around the environment so things events are looking at to to embrace that are things like using electronic ticketing so moving away from any printed you know paper type processes switching to reusable or biodegradable items and there 's suppliers coming on the market now doing that so it 's making it a lot easier for events um offering lower emission produce and meals encouraging or even enforcing public transport and carpooling so rather than having you know thousands of cars driving to your event and then only working with venues or suppliers or stakeholders that have strong environmental practices in place recycling and the likes so the conscious traveler people when they 're going to destinations or events are much more conscious of the impact those places or events are having on the environment the other thing i said was immersive experiences so we 've heard this for a few years now event attendees are wanting more interactive experiences they 're wanting more compelling want to connect with others and meet new people so how can you create that interactive personalized immersive experience at your event behind the scenes type activity you know get involved that type of activity is what people want the other one is authentically local so this is where a lot of travelers now whether they 're going to a destination or a festival an event they 're wanting to experience uniquely local so they want to it 's this whole thing you may have heard this before living live as a local so when you come into a destination you feel like you are treated like you 're a local you get to hear the behind the scenes you get treated as though you 're a local and that can include things in an event like showcasing local produce showcasing local cultures and inviting people to be part of that and finally the other thing that 's really important when we talk about event trends is around diversity and accessibility similar to sustainability this is not a passing trend events are all about building community so you need to how to make sure that you are considering how your event is accessible to all types of people so this can be things like proactively seeking out diverse talent you know multiculturalism that type of thing offering diverse food options having a dedicated space for breastfeeding moms offering scholarships that give free entry um to different attendees so there 's all these different things that you can do to be inclusive and also to show your support for diversity so that kind of just gives you a bit of a sense there 's all of these trends out there that you need to consider and that can provide you with opportunities around how to keep your event fresh and finally the other thing i just wanted to say when we 're talking about reinvigoration is to consider this idea of a 15 rule has anyone heard of the 15 rule i actually this is not something out of a textbook or something that i came up with i actually learnt this from the team at uh gamari pumpkin festival i did some mentoring work with them and some strategic planning they do is they go in order to keep our event fresh um and have new elements in our event all the time they have what they call a 15 rule so 15 of their program every year has to be something new and fresh based on feedback from previous events i just think that 's gold it 's so easy it 's so practical i love it and what you need to be mindful of as well is don 't try to do everything so if you just use this concept of a 15 rule i mean call it what you like it 's this idea of pick the winners so identify those things that your attendees are really drawn to and focus on those things so the 15 rule don 't try to do everything because that 's just overwhelming right but if you break it down like that and go okay well you know every year we 'll try to have 15 or whatever percentage you know you work that out what what works for you but if you just go that 's the component of our on feedback so remember it 's about attendees so based on feedback that you 've had for previous years then that 's going to give you an event that 's fresh you know you can start to promote that through your marketing activity and it just makes sure that your event doesn 't become same same all right i want to take a couple of minutes um now for you to think about what you can do to reinvigorate your event so no need to write anything in the chat box i 'm just going to give you a couple of moments of quiet time you know maybe three or five minutes i just want you to jot down if you haven 't already these ques answers to these three points here what can you do to reinvigorate your event what would be your 15 for your next event and what are your attendees saying are there some consistent things that your attendees have been saying at you know say the last two or three events is there something that keeps coming up no matter how big or small that needs to be addressed okay i 'm just going to have a quiet couple of minutes while you just think about that for your event and make some notes wherever you like foreign all right one more minute i 'll give you i 'm just looking in the chat box that 's some good discussion going on in there don 't forget if you 've got any questions or areas you 'd like me to expand on please pop it in there and we 'll do that in the discussion time shortly all right if anyone 's keen to share that when we get to the discussion time at the end i 'd be really interested to hear um if anyone 's had any you know really good um brain waves through that process on what they can do to reinvigorate their event and once again this is if even if you 're a new event or a mature event it 's still important i don 't want you to think about reinvigoration or renewal as something that you wait until you 're a mature event to do every event every single year it 's an ongoing process of keeping your event fresh all right now what i want to go through is this is i guess a bit more of a practical component um i 've kind of now just talked up up until now talk to you about you know reinvigoration and you know the importance of looking at different things so when you 're looking at your events from a business planning perspective there 's all these things you need to consider where do we want to go what 's our purpose what what else is happening out there and what are our attendees saying so it 's not just this process we 're going okay here 's a business plan template let 's fill it in okay it 's done it really is about how do you create a rich experience that people are going to enjoy into the future now the business plan as i said i have sent a template out to everybody so if you haven 't got it and i noticed there was a comment or two in the chat box i so don 't panic what i 'm going to do now is just step through some of the elements in that particular template to give you a sense of what i believe a business plan should consist of for an event and look this it 's 10 pages maximum and even that i mean some events may not take it that far but that 's the maximum that i would suggest this is not about making the process complicated or overwhelming because then nobody will do it right so i want you to just think about how how do we create a business plan that 's really pragmatic that we know it 's something that we 're going to use because that 's the most important thing we don 't want to create something that 's going to gather dust on the shelf so just have a think about these elements as i talk through them and know that there 's a template there for you to fill in either do that as we 're going through this now or make some notes and you can fill that in when you do have it handy be really good to have it in front of you so you can take notes as we go so this is essentially the key elements you have an overview section a situation analysis and then your priorities your strategic priorities so there are three key areas that i believe are critical in a business plan the reason these elements are critical is because they get you thinking so so it 's good to know where you want to go with your event but the situation analysis component in particular is the part that gets you thinking it makes you stop and look at what else is happening around you otherwise we can just fall into that trap of guy what do we want to do now the event overview this is very straightforward you guys should be able to do this standing on your head the reason we include this section in our business plan template is because you need to remember that your business plan for your event will be a document that will support grant applications and also other things like you know recruit volunteers you can share your business plan with them so they they can see that you are a really you know reputable event with some direction and strategic foundations so it needs to give an overview of the event how it started its core purpose it 's really telling the story of your event so that one 's pretty straightforward to pull that together now the second part of the business plan is what we call the situational analysis so this is where you 're considering the current situation that your event operates in and analyzing the opportunities that that may present for your event so you know how we just talked about event trends and you know what your attendees want they 're all things that you need to take into consideration in this stage of your business plan you also need to look at strategic context and what we mean by that is have a look at the strategic plans for your region and think about how they will impact your event so read the tourism strategy from council the council 's community plan your regional tourism what their strategic plans talk about and i know they have a lot around events and their new direction is certainly presenting a lot of opportunities for events so you need to make sure you 're aware of that you need to also know what the state tourism organization is doing from an events perspective what 's their event strategy and you can get all of these online they 're all public documents you can access them if you can 't find them online you make a phone call and you can get hold of them so you 're wanting to just have a quick read of these different documents relevant to your region and take note of any any areas that you might be able to leverage off or any areas that may impact your event that you should be mindful of as you start to look at the future of your event and just a tip this will also help you when you 're applying for funding with any of those organizations so what they want to see when they 're looking at funding applications is how your not about you it 's about the other so those stakeholders or funding bodies they want to know how your event is actually going to help them achieve what they need to achieve so you need to understand what they 're trying to achieve so looking at that strategic context is important then what you need to do is and i find this a really fun process strategic sorry strengths challenges and opportunities analysis so this is where you need to really consider what are the strengths of your event what are the barriers and what are the possible opportunities that exist for us because this is what 's going to frame your strategic priorities in your future direction you need to also think about what sets you apart so understanding your distinct difference to others and that is other events in your region and similar events out of your region think about what 's special about your event so the best way to do this what i recommend to events or if i 'm facilitating it what i would do with events is we would get everyone together so we 'd get all of the committee together we 'd get volunteers we 'd get people involved in different aspects of the event together for a brainstorming session around what are the strengths and challenges and then let 's think about what opportunities these present it 's a really fun process once you get started what i also suggest is that you even get together some of your external stakeholders and major sponsors because they bring a different perspective and can raise some interesting points so getting those different views and perspectives is quite important through this process all right now once again i 'm going to just pause for a few minutes as i said at the start the idea of these sessions is for you to have have the opportunity to listen but also to start to think about how do i put that in place for my event so i 'm just going to give you three to five minutes now just to note down if you 've got the template put it in the template otherwise just on a piece of paper or a notebook or just note down what do you see as the top strengths for your event the top challenges and then think about once you 've done the strengths and challenges what opportunities do they present for your event and when you do this think about all aspects of your event so think about the people involved think about the program and the experience you offer think about your location your host community or the event site think about your marketing think about your digital assets even finances so you 're kind of breaking apart the entire event and thinking of all of the strengths and challenges all right i 'll give you a couple of minutes oh interesting bolon is now outback queensland rather than southern queensland country well if that 's the case i 've done quite a bit of work with outback queensland and i know they do a lot from an events perspective um so rather than look at southern queensland country tourism when you 're looking at that strategic alignment what you want to do is talk to um the guys out at oqta about the focus know the outback is full of fantastic events and they put a lot of their marketing focus on it my apologies for that little error oh i 'll just give you another minute sorry about that flicking that slide a bit early i 'll just give you one more minute to note down any final points all right i hope you were able to note a few strengths and challenges there and from that be able to come up with some opportunities as i said i mean usually if you 're by yourself thinking independently about your event that 's a little bit hard to do because we always just have these blockages but getting a team together and doing it as a bit of a fun interactive brainstorming session is a really effective way of getting some good views and perspectives and insights into the event because that really helps frame what your strategic priorities and direction will be now another thing to do when looking at you know how your events different what are your strengths what are your challenges um it is to look at your benchmark consider inspirational events around the world so if you are able to answer this question it 'd be really interesting for you to put it into the chat box and share with us if you could be as successful as any other festival or event in australia or the world which one comes to mind and why i 'm just going to give you a minute and see if anybody has any thoughts on that sometimes it 's hard to think of one off the cuff a good way to to look at this when we look at benchmarking i often encourage events just to jump on google and have a look because you would be amazed at what events exist around the world and when you do benchmarking it 's not it 's not necessarily looking for events that are exactly the same as yours you can actually look at any events and you can gain you know inspiration for different areas so you might go you know if we could be as successful as this festival in regards to how they manage volunteers in their volunteer program and the water so it 's thinking about events and what they do well you know you might go this event and its program you know the quality of their program how engaging their program is and how fun that might inspire you so it might be that you go okay there 's a number of different events that inspire us for different reasons why this is good to do is because it opens your eyes eyes to new ideas and inspiration so it 's always good to look to look around the country and even around the world at what other events are doing it 's not about going are we going to copy every part of what events are doing but it is part of research and development for your event to actually keep your finger on the pulse around what other events are doing around the world so if you 've had a bit of um a struggle to come up with any events today think about that and do a little bit of searching and think about what events would we set as our benchmark and you and i guess with international travel restrictions we may be limited at the moment but if you haven 't been to those events put them on your list you need to attend events as well to get a sense of what works and what doesn 't all right now as i said before we 're going to talk about ideal event attendees in great detail next week when we do our marketing master class but it 's really important to note this because this is a key part of your business plan is to actually understand who your ideal event attendees are you need to be able to clearly articulate who they are so that you can identify what your priority actions are to try to attract more of them if we don 't know who our ideal attendees are then we 're just doing this kind of broad approach to our marketing activity which may not get us the results that we want you also need to know who your ideal event attendees are so that you can create a program and experience that actually suits them so what school-aged children are your ideal event attendees then you 're going to ensure that you plan to include family friendly activities as part of your event experience and your marketing is going to focus on promoting different children 's activities you may also go okay we also have um you know a dedicated space for breastfeeding mothers with a kid zone to make it easier for that type of market so it 's really important when we look at business plan to understand who our attendees are so it 's look it 's very typical process of looking at who 's our primary market and our secondary market so we look at things like the demographics so how old are they you know the age of the children um gender etc we look at geographic so where are they from you know how far a radius around the lawn shire are they coming from um and then we look at more behavioral stuff so that whole psychographic stuff so what are they like what are their hobbies what are their values and interests because that gives us some insight into so we 'll talk about that a lot more next week when we dive into marketing so now we start to get to the fun part you 've done all of that strategic alignment situation analysis piece so this is all about getting the information you 've been gathering information getting a sense of um where your events currently at the current situation now it 's about putting all of that into i guess the the structure that sets the future direction for your event when we talk about a vision and a mission i don 't want to get too technical on those terms because we can overthink it a little bit essentially what we 're saying is where will your event be in three to five years and how will you achieve it that 's essentially what we 're doing in a business plan i recommend only looking three years ahead so much changes these days you know i remember at one point um councils or clients were wanting to actually look at planning five to ten years ahead things changed so much that even three years is would look at three years as your length of time around a business plan so i want you to think about what does your event look like and i 'm going to give you a couple of minutes here as well we 're getting towards the end i just also wanted to let you know we are i 've just got a few more slides that i want to go through before we get to the discussion time so we 've gone a little over an hour so far probably another 15 minutes of content and then we can jump into the discussion time what i want you to think about now is where will your event be in three years this is kind of the visionary component this is the dreaming phase if you like but we want to be realistic dreamers so where will your event be in three years time i 'm gonna say three i 'm not gonna say three to five i 'm gonna say three years time can you visualize it what does it look like what new opportunities have you introduced how many or is it still the same event what 's new at your event in three years time these are all things that you need to think about to be able to get your strategic priorities and set that vision for your event i know i 'm kind of getting you thinking you know i say i 'll give you a couple of minutes to to answer these really deep questions um don 't overthink it right now i just want you to jot down some thoughts on that it 'll just help you through the process if it 's a one-off event so i 'm just going to answer this now for you jane if it 's a one-off event then you 're just doing a 12-month business plan so you just basically we don 't need to obviously look three years ahead and we don 't actually need to think long-term strategically if it 's a one-off event you still need to do your situation analysis you need to align with those other strategic plans etc you need to think about the trends so all of that is still our business plan for our one-off event for that 12 months so just kind of i guess i 'm i 'm more focused on events that happen on a recurring basis um but it doesn 't mean that that 's it 's still not relevant to um one-off events that may just happen [Music] annually all right i hope that got you thinking a little bit now another really eye-opening part of developing your event business plan you may have noticed in the template that i sent you is we have a section in there around values and identity which is not i guess something you would see typically in a business plan but i believe this is an absolute critical part of business planning for events as i said at the start of our session today we are starting to see so many events coming online and so many events that have hit that maturity stage and they 're becoming same same it 's what i call same same so we 're starting to see a whole basket of events across different parts of regional australia becoming the same markets we 've got music and we 've got carnival rides and that often happens because people don 't have the energy to think about how is our event different what 's the core purpose of our event what 's the dna or heart of our event what makes it tick so this is where this process really helps it really encourages you to go back to the roots of the event and to think about the reason why it was established in the first place and what are the values and identity that are so important to this event this example i 've got on the screen at the moment is from one of my clients the henley on todd in alice springs and we worked through this process with that committee to give them a really clear appreciation of what their values and their identity are because what it does it underpins decisions that the event committee make it also allows you to start looking at themes for your event and it helps you stay focused and allows you to really understand how your event is different so when you 're doing the strengths challenges opportunities you can take that time to really brainstorm it with your team and different stakeholders you need to understand the core values and the identity or the dna and what i mean by that is if your event was a person a human describe its personality so you can see there for example with henley on todd we put in their crazy fun because that event is crazy some of the stuff they do is crazy but that 's what 's appealing to people so that 's a really important element for them to make sure they maintain so once you know what your values and identity um are then you can better tailor your program it also helps you determine your brand story and it allows you to be clear with your marketing message and it prevents you just from falling into that trap of becoming the same same and i know these two words are really overused but if you do this you can create an event that is unique and authentic and in such a competitive environment that is information that you need you 've gathered it all you 've decided um what you want to achieve in the next three years now it 's essentially time to just document it and that 's where this template will come in really handy so this is where we look at the typical structure is going okay the primary aims of our event are x y z and the priorities are x y z so what are we trying to achieve so they can be things like we 're trying to increase visitation to our town we 're trying to build community pride we are aiming to raise funds for rfds we 're you know aiming to establish a new sports club um whatever it may be what are the key aims that you 're trying to achieve in the next three years then you 've got priorities that are going to help you achieve those aims and objectives so it 's this then becomes and i 'm not going to go into this in detail because it 's all articulated quite well in the template that i 've provided and for you but then you 're basically just going through and starting to document it and then this becomes your blueprint for the next three years remember i asked the question right at the start who has a business plan but then the second question which was perhaps more important was who refers to it on a regular basis to assist with their once you 've done this and you 've articulated what your goals and actions are like i said this becomes your blueprint so you want to pull this out at every meeting are we still on track because it 's so easy to get sidetracked when you 're planning an event rein it back in is this going to assist us in achieving our aims and objectives that we 've set if not sometimes you 've got to say no because lots of people will come to you with grand ideas and then finally make sure you have measures of success so that you know when you 've achieved success and they need to be you might have heard that acronym smart measures of success specific measurable business plan that you know what your measures of success are so some measures of success can be around you know the number of attendees that you attract to your event it might be around if it 's very tourism focused you know economic injection into the local economy it might be more community focused so it 's around building community pride or engaging certain you know parts of your community it could be around the number of volunteers that you have at your event it could be around the amount of partners and sponsorship or grant funding you secure so you need to determine what measures of success you will have in place for your event then you obviously need to be able to measure it and one of the most important things is you need to celebrate success don 't just let success fly by and i see this with event committees all the time and this is often why it can be hard to re-engage volunteers is because they everyone puts in so much energy and i know we 're all exhausted and at the end of even mention that event name to me for at least six months but it 's so important even though everyone 's busy that you celebrate success that can be about you know you might take the team out for a special event you might do some media activation so it doesn 't necessarily even have to be you know some physical um celebration it might be doing you know some media activations and really communicating your success shout it from the rooftops and you definitely want to make sure that you share your success with your key stakeholders all right you 've done amazing i know that 's a lot of information to take in but following this master class what i want you to do is these are some key things i want you to go back and review the last few years of your attendee feedback and i want you to also look at benchmarking events do some research think about those events that inspire you and why they inspire you what can you learn from them i want you to complete the event strategy that i supplied some brainstorming in there and that 's a bit time consuming getting everyone together but once you 've got that information together it should only take you a few hours to complete that only she says i know everybody is already jam-packed uh i encourage you to have a team get together and share the strategy so once you 've got an event strategy or business plan get everyone together and share that with them so they understand the direction that you 're going in with the event and then i want you to make this an annual process so it doesn 't mean you have to redo your business plan every year but you want to revisit it how are we tracking measure your success what did we do well what do we need to perhaps adjust because it has to be a working document and you want to define your 15 like we talked about and i want you to allow time to celebrate success even those little wins are important because when we talk about volunteer retention they 're the things that will make a difference all i 'm just going to jump into the chat box and i 'll just quickly run through and address any points that have come up in here then if anybody has any further questions i 'd be happy for you to unmute yourself and we can have a discussion i 'll just go through these first of all first one is linda do you have a recommended number of organizers for an event so there isn 't too many chefs in the kitchen and progress can occur based on the event plan that 's a really good question i don 't have a recommended number it 's perhaps not my opinion would be it 's perhaps not so much about the number it 's more about what are the roles within your event and having those very clearly articulated and somebody allocated per role so you don 't just want to have a lot of chefs in the kitchen throwing around stuff you know it 's about having a clear structure that says we need a finance manager we need somebody managing the bar we need somebody on market store you really need to and we have a whole master class on setting up an effective event team and it is more in my opinion about having a very organized where everybody knows exactly what their role is in the event and that everyone also knows how they can get on to deliver on their role in the event then there 's usually one main coordinator or president that brings everyone together so i wouldn 't say that there 's an ideal number that varies depending on the size scale and how much is involved in the delivery of an event um but certainly having clearly articulated roles and responsibilities is really important yeah there 's a comment here which is really interesting looking at events which target travelers is a new ball game for many of us and that 's not unusual for regional communities um but i just want to touch on that comment for a moment because it 's interesting a lot of events in regional communities are often established initially as a community event so they might be something that has been started by locals um to have a bit of social interaction and some fun i guess but then what happens is with tourism and the visitor economy we start to get interest from external people so there becomes this point in time where some events may evolve from being a community event to becoming more of what we call a visitor economy or a tourism event or these event and they can naturally just that can naturally just happen without you even realizing it 's like you create this monster um and there is a difference you know because when you look at a community event versus a visitor economy event it really is different from a um i guess more a marketing and experience development perspective so the needs and expectations of the local community are very different to the needs and expectations of visitors they can certainly be integrated together as one but you just need to be mindful that their needs and expectations are different so it 's an opportunity if it 's new to many of you at the moment don 't ignore that as an opportunity regional areas are had an impact on that with domestic travel really booming but there is a real opportunity to appeal to visitors if you have the desire to do that uh any tips on info gathering from attendees do you suggest facebook polls survey monkey paper surveys yeah look post event review um it 's a big job um and really really important okay so tips on gathering information from attendees you need to use multiple channels so yes as you 've said there jane facebook polls if you 've got a specific question let 's just say you 're planning your event you 're looking at the program you might want to get some input from your community on their preferred option for a musician for example so that 's where you 've got a specific question where you might put it out via a facebook poll or a really brief survey monkey to your database to say we 'd love your input on this um you know you 've got to be careful that you 're not creating a headache for yourself by getting too much feedback but it 's on specific things in terms of gathering information that 's going to assist you with the future of your event um surveymonkey is great i know there 's some limitations on access to technology with certain events but if you can i would highly recommend surveymonkey and the reason for that is because it saves you hours of time collating survey data i 've done that before i 've done it multiple times and it 's not a fun job so if you can use surveymonkey to collate um or to undertake your surveying process it means that you 're going to save a lot of time at the end in collating your information it even puts it in nice reports so if you 've got to do a report to a funding body for example it really helps however in saying that what i suggest events do is back up their online survey with just a very simple survey paper survey at the event because there 's nothing better than getting feedback from attendees in the moment and there 's also a real opportunity to get as many postcodes multiple channels you have your online survey which is a kind of event survey i also recommend you have a simple paper sheet at the gate or an entry point or a key high traffic area point to just get so um sorry just get postcodes from people so you can get as many as possible but then what i suggest is having a you know somebody that can be just dedicated to attendee feedback that might have it 's not necessarily a survey but it might just be a couple of key questions that they walk around and just chat to people during the day and that can give you some really rich insights so it 's something that a lot of events um fail to do and that 's because they 've got so much more to think about when they 're doing um an event that that 's the least of their worries so so if you can actually dedicate someone and this comes back to that earlier question around how many chefs in the kitchen it 's all about having clear roles and responsibilities so if you need to dedicate a person to coordinate that because that activity that 's their sole responsibility and then it will be done um next question how do we define our target group when it 's open to the whole of the community if it 's open to well that 's your target group so if it 's open to the whole of the community that is a broad target group so if you go whole of community is that all of the community in the whole shire or is that all of the community in saint george is that all of the community in another town within the belong shire is that another part of the community is it a certain age group so is it still you know than 80 plus year olds and you know the primary school students is it part of the community that has a special interest or comes from a particular background if it 's just a community event and it 's designed to be for everybody in your the belongshire residence then that 's your target group if you can 't break target group the only challenge that will present is when you come to doing your marketing activity and also creating the experience how do you create an event experience that appeals to the 80 year olds and the five-year-olds how do you create an event experience that you know appeals to a wide variety of different people from different backgrounds different values etcetera and i 'm not saying by no means i 'm not saying you can 't but it just means that becomes a bigger job so the reason we we look at target groups is because it allows us to focus our energy on delivering an experience that 's suitable to that group but it also allows us to focus our marketing activity because once again the broader a target group is the more marketing dollars we need to be able to reach that broad group i hope that helps sophie okay i think i 've covered any specific questions in there um [Music] what i would like to do now if you want to add another question or anything into the chat box please do or if question or open up a discussion point please do i might just start while everyone 's thinking about it is there anybody um you know when we talked about i just need to remind myself here we go remember we looked at this what can you do to reinvigorate your event what is your 15 what are your attendees saying if anyone wants to share anything around that whole idea of reinvigoration and how they actually ensure that their event remains fresh every year i encourage you to do so hi lindra it 's sheila marshall here um i might throw out the first question or sort of experience if you like start a discussion you guys can hear me okay yes i suppose i sit with two hats uh one i sit with my queensland health hat and how i look at health promotional side of things and develop um you know events that happen within my community around health and wellness but now i 'm also a permaculturist gardener and i run customized events for people with local needs what i 'm finding is is that i use tend to contact me within the sort of region and they 'll have a specific need that they want addressing and that i have a particular skill set to be able to talk to them about so a lot of my events are that more i suppose immersive um events if you like and but then i do also have the queensland health which is that sort of mass um how do we do a health promotion on you know quitting smoking or something along along those lines how do we make it a little bit more immersive and personal so um so i use surveymonkey um in that regard and and that 's one of when i 'm looking at my target audience as well is that depends on um what the message is or or what that particular need is so um i might have young parents who 've got children that they 're trying to bring up and they want something around how to eat healthily um or i might have and what i 've noticed certainly with covert is i 'm doing this as a as full-time position uh what i 've found is within the community there has been a need around health and wellness covert has made that more apparent um and so they have very specific needs so when certainly the survey monkey but your challenge being is just you by yourself whereas you the hat that i wear of course is i have a huge corporate organization that has very set uh ways that they like to do things and it 's very difficult to be entrepreneurial within a a set organization and i don 't know whether that 's where maybe the council comes from it 's very set way that you want to maybe run things or i don 't know whether they have a bit more leeway so i suppose i come from either end of the continuum yeah i love that really customized approach to the events that you do like that survey monkey and i guess that 's it remember we talked about micro festivals and that 's kind of what that is you 're you 're kind of going it 's a very tailored exclusive event more like you were saying immersive experience it 's more of a premium experience for people and do you get good response from those events yes i and i do like you said in regards to i ask at the time and i 'm continually checking that i 'm actually um when i 'm doing the workshop or event that i 'm actually hitting the mark for them is that and i suppose having that customized process as opposed to buying a workshop off the shelf or an event off the shelf and you have somebody that comes out and then just sort of presents what they present everywhere they go and what i 'll do is i 'll customize for that and then when i 'm talking with the audience and i 'm interacting with them if they want me to head off in a certain direction i have the flexibility to be able to to do that and that 's often what i 'll find and again one of my challenges is trying to keep it within the time frame as well because then you go on for get uh people want another workshop on something else so because it triggers things for people yeah sheila it 's susie um higgins with your surveymonkey um do you just put that out across with facebook or have you got a database you put it through so i developer hi suzy i develop a database one of the great things about covid and and being the donors at the local hospital i make everybody sign in and give me their email address and of course then i send out my surveymonkey i ask permission and send out my survey monkey to the guys so then i will appeal to them directly and through an email and and then i have a really good return rate on that rather than just putting a link out on facebook i find that 's very hit and miss i 'd be lucky to get two or three responses but when i send out to my workshop and the attendees at the workshop then i probably get an 80 response right from the attendees of the workshop and then that 's how i then build needs okay then thanks and susie just trying to sort of build how we can get a bit more information gathered for the show um we haven 't probably done that very successfully in the last few years and that was why i was just wanting to know where you got that yeah info so susie you 're um representing the show yes yeah okay that 's an interesting event example because i mean you would know better than me you know the the whole cycle of um agricultural shows you know and and the challenges that they faced and the need to look at how they remain current you know and relevant because um you know it 's there 's been some challenging times and we 've seen so many agricultural shows just you know fall to the wayside um unfortunately and and knowing what attendees want and like i said at the start also being being open-minded i think shows have a great opportunity they 're so important to regional communities um but they need to remain fresh so do you not have do you not have a people that have perhaps been to the event in the past exhibited at the event competed at the event they 're probably in 2019 we did start one and the issue was that um it 's probably not on one computer yeah um and all collated together um we did get a lot of memberships in 2019 because we put out a good package and we had a prize a membership draw which was tickets a flight to brisbane and tickets to australia zoo so we got a lot of memberships that year but i might think i 'm just thinking i 'll go to the next meeting and say listen um i 've got a printed out sheet of this i 'll put it into a database and see whether we can do something like that because in 2019 we actually introduced a motorbike gymkhana with our show and um that was a massive hit from everyone and all day the whole arena was just full with people watching it because it was that different and it 's probably that 15 that you were talking about and um instead every year we ran a double barrel motorbike event in the arena main arena that afternoon when the horses had finished and before the radio started and i was actually sent to the pavilion to put out give out prize money and there was just this mass exodus to everyone stand around in the ring and watch it because it was different yeah yeah yeah and you need to you 're on the right track i mean if you can try to gather some information on what you would like to see at the show and i think i think just think of multiple channels susie so get your database together the best you can and you can put out a survey monkey through that also use social media like sometimes in your case which is a bit different um to the smaller more micro events but you need to get it out as far and wide as you can you know you want to try to get feedback from as many people particularly in the local community because i know where i 'm from people locals tend to have they want to feel like they 've got input into what happens with it yeah right anyone else got any other discussion points or has that uh session raised anything for you around your event that um you 'd like to discuss i 'd just pick everyone 's brains for this one it might be something someone can think of later on like one of our points that the attendees were saying and it was addressing the issue for the children 's entertainment from the 11 to 17 year olds um a few of the kids come up and said there 's just nothing for us at the show one because they didn 't have a motorbike or they didn 't ride horses and it wasn 't something i had thought about in that pacific area we 'd gone and done a lot of free entertainment for that probably the younger lot of children up to that eleven but yeah does anyone have any ideas on sort of entertainment other than sideshow ally for that group what about something cool like dancing well we do yeah like a an x we did look at that and i think it just um not having someone specifically to run it was uh issue i think but yeah no that 's great thanks sheila dance is something that most kids will do it 's a hard age group that one 11 to 17. um it it is yeah you know and there 's all different types of interests as well at that age you know and that 's that 's where it can be a little bit challenging you know i 've seen people do um you know yeah dance and that kind of thing is good you know hip-hop even doing you know different kind of art and cultural type activity as well that 's a bit more funky you know because that 's the thing at that age they kind of be cool you know like they or they want to be seen to be a bit cool um and they also want to be with their mates right that 's all about that age is about being with their friends and um so it makes me think of you know they 're all like doing a big um street art mural or um you know something like that but this is where susie we could sit and talk about it for ages yeah why don 't you talk to local schools about getting together a bit of a focus group of kids in that age group and have a little workshop with them okay yeah i hadn 't thought of you on that but yeah i 've done that in a community before um we got some students from the school like from different age groups within the high school and it was so interesting i was really scared i was like oh my god what 's going to come of this um but they were so good oh my god they came up with all of these amazing ideas um and they just really appreciated that opportunity to be engaged yeah yeah so if you can talk to the local school um or schools and see if you can you know there might be some you know year leaders and um stuff that you could get together uh and with them on what could we do to bring some youth type activity into the local show because the last show in 2019 we did have um the manny tribes gallery did um art workshops where all the kids painted a small um piece of artwork and it was free and then they got people to judge the artwork from the different age groups and um that was a really good um everyone engaged in that and even the boys at the gallery said we did not think we would have anywhere near as many people involved in it and um someone took a photo and every child that was painting there was one aboriginal child and i think there was five um caucasian kids with the thing and they were that grossed like and they went this is what um our community really should be like where was just this whole group of them all just so focused yeah and we also had a cooking workshop at that one which i think with covert we may not be able to do as well this time that 's what i traditional things that happen at an agricultural show and i think they 're important but it 's really about your community it 's about bringing your community together it 's about looking at those opportunities to bring them together all different ages yeah i reckon go and talk to kids at the school and you will be really surprised and excited by what comes of that yeah thank you there 's also been a suggestion in the chat box for a smoke off barbecue actually that whole smoking type thing of cooking is really trendy at the moment oh sorry susie yeah we do have one of the um one of our food vendors he does that um american ribs oh yeah yeah so yeah excellent anyone else got anything or are we happy to call it a day as i said at the start if there 's anything because often what happens when you do these sessions because i know i give lots of information there 's a lot of talking and a lot to absorb use the facebook event so is everybody on that um or do you so that is the facebook event set up by council and you would have seen in the last couple of days i 've put a couple of different posts in there no i haven 't seen anything on that i 'll just just bear with me for one second i 'll just turn that off and find this link i 'll just quickly put it in the chat and you can each just jump in there because it 's a really good place for us to just chat in between sessions so if anything comes up any questions come to mind or even just like susie just asked for everybody 's views on what she 's going through it 's also good to put that in there as well because it it 's all about trying to share information and support one another um computers being a bit funny here now look it 's not i 'm not sure what it 's not going to let me share it in there i don 't know if that 's a security setting or something what i might have to do is everybody everybody except for there was one person that didn 't yes linda it 's definitely i think um i managed to link up with the email that you sent the facebook email but my trouble with facebook i can 't find things again once i 've found them so going back to your email or would appreciate a refresh email so thank you okay no worries desley it 's a bit of a rabbit warren that thing isn 't it um so sheila i 've got your email here so i 'll send add you to my email list and i 'll flick everyone an email after this i 'll re-attach the template um and i 'll put the link to the facebook group in there and then if you 've got anything that comes up please just pop it in there the reason we i like to encourage people to do it through the facebook event you 're more than welcome to email me if that 's easier but if we do it through the facebook event everyone can see it so often if you 've got a question or thought so it 's nice just to be able to do it that way so we can all see that all right thank you all so much for today uh so next week we 're talking marketing so same time same zoom link everything will be the same as what you did today and we 'll just have a different topic so if you 've got anybody in your event apart from yourself that plays a specific role in marketing try to encourage them to come along to um to next week 's session thank you all for your time and have a lovely afternoon thank you thank you _"

    "text": "today we 're talking finance we 're looking mainly at sponsorship and grant funding but i am going to talk a little bit about uh event finance uh in general at the beginning so just bear with me it 's some important content and stuff that a lot of events need to be very mindful of before they actually start this process of sponsorship and grant funding so this is our third session um as always we are recording the sessions so if at any point anyone has to duck out um or you want to share this with any other members of your team it will be available um this afternoon i 'll send a copy of the recording to kim and she 'll make sure that 's made available to everybody my understanding is they 're being loaded onto a website and then everybody will have access to those whoops so you can see now we 're this will be our halfway point so we do still have three more sessions we 'll look next week at risk safety and security then we look at succession planning and a a really robust team for your event and the final one will be looking at events in a covered world and we 'll look a bit at covert safe planning etc as part of that session so if there 's any questions or comments throughout the session as always i will have moments where we 'll stop and have discussion but if there 's anything in between that please feel free to use the chat box just to raise any points now i 'm assuming everybody can see my screen just make sure i 've got that on wonderful great uh so everybody 's aware of who i am linda tilghman from uh revenge academy and you can check us out online um if you want to understand a bit more about what we do before we start does anyone have any [Music] questions or points that they would like to discuss from last week 's session does anybody have any insight into who their ideal event attendees are which was a big focus of our session last week you 'll recall we looked at event marketing but spent and and getting that understanding and the appreciation of knowing who your ideal event attendees are okay that suggests to me that everybody 's ticking along fine okay so today what we 're going to look at as i said the focus of the session will be on sponsorship and grant funding however we 're also going to have a look at this whole idea of what is your financial drive we 're going to look at tips on how to become self-sustainable and we 're also going to look at how to successfully manage your budget so we 're going to touch a bit probably for the first 40 minutes or so on finances in general and then we 're going to spend the other three quarters of our session on event sponsorship and also looking at grant funding opportunities because there are some current grants that are available at the moment for events um in regional australia and also queensland all right now i 'm interested to know so if you wanted to pop it in the chat box or feel free to take yourself off mute to understanding of how dependent your event is on sponsorship funding and what are your key revenue streams for your event if anyone 's prepared to share or drop that in the chat box and the reason i ask this question is that sponsorship should only be one of your revenue streams and in an ideal world it should be less than 20 of your revenue now i know that 's not the case for a lot of events but that is something that events should be striving for and i think what we 're going to see as we 're coming out of the um covert situation we 're currently in is that those events that are more dependent on corporate sponsorship are potentially going to have a tougher time victoria has raised her hand please jump in feel free to unmute yourself or you 're welcome to also pop it in the chat box hi linda how are you good and everyone else thank you i think this is a really great session i find a lot of our community groups are highly dependent on sponsorship and when you from businesses as well is that absolutely yeah any third party any third party funding um from business or corporates i would put into the sponsorship category okay because yes i from my observations and from event um assisting with events i find that uh a lot of our events in in my community are very dependent on sponsorship um some of the events i have been apart um with revision other revenue streams has been personalized merchandise like singlets or t-shirts or caps um but if you 're dependent on getting sponsorship it 's a bit hard to get those sort of items on a tight budget yeah absolutely victoria this is a very common um situation you know where events are very dependent on sponsorship and i think we 've got to this point um we 're our own worst enemy in some cases but we have got to this point where we have created that dependence you know it 's certainly and i 'm going to talk about this i 'm not by any means suggesting sponsorship is not a good thing like i said it 's it 's a really key revenue stream but we need to move away from that dependence on it you know and you can see i talk through this session what i mean by that and it 's and it 's somewhat changing a bit of mindset where even community events need to think about how they are financially managed you know it 's it 's not just oh we 're a community event so we can 't charge an entry fee or we we we 're not about generating revenue um there 's all varying levels of that right so it 's it 's about how you 're creating viability for the future of your event i agree with you and i think that 's um a strong mentality of because we are a community event we have to keep costs low when we have to try to subsidize the costing of this so it 's free talking to a lot of the people like a lot of the mature members of the community they would do raffles or someone would auction a bale of wool and that would go might donate a beast and that would be auctioned off and that would go towards the event so i see a lot of that happening in the past and i i sort of wonder um that we have beca have we become so reliant on seeking other sponsorship that we don 't communicate and actually ask more people around our community to help um sponsor a community event because that 's who it 's for so yeah i sort of hear about what they used to do and i see what we 're doing now and and maybe there 's an overlapping that we need to bring back and i think it 's a bit of time to you know everybody is so busy i think sponsorship is seen because it 's definitely not easy but it is seen as an easy option from a financial perspective rather than you know generating your own revenue oh definitely and i think also from a community point of view there 's so many who are on the same committee and that just tires so many people out and if it 's like less one less raffle that they have to put together or one less a lot of cakes they 've got to go and sell or yeah so absolutely yeah thank you and a few people have shared some comments in the chat box which is wonderful and they 're all look it looks it 's great to hear i mean some are not dependent on sponsorship you know they 've got product to sell some rely on sponsorship but there 's other revenue streams and that 's all absolutely fine it 's just this dependence on sponsorship have a think about this question for a moment and if you 'd like to comment in the chat box with any thoughts on that please do but this is this whole thing and like i said just before even community events need to understand this what is the financial drive of your event and what do i what do i actually mean by that it 's not just about you know generating profit or being you know commercially driven by any means it 's about financial viability in order to be able need to actually be able to cover costs so you know the cost of running an event is not going to go away unfortunately if anything it 's contin it will continue to rise so it 's really important for us to understand our financial drive and what that is in order to be able to remain viable in the future so that 's about knowing what your targets are so you know you may be an event that is commercially driven so for you it is about profit what 's that profit margin you want to attract each year what what are you striving for maybe it 's just to break even maybe that 's your financial drive you know maybe it 's about raising a certain amount of funds to actually go to support another charity or another community organization or group and i actually worked with uh an event uh in uh northern territory that 's run by combined rotary clubs so their financial drive for their event so they have a major tourism festival and the major drive for those clubs in running that event is their local community so that 's their financial drive it 's to raise funds and they even had a financial target which they put in their budget so they would say you know our our charities for this year we want to raise say ten thousand dollars so they put that as an expense line in there in their budget so that they knew that that was their target so they 're very clear in terms of what their financial drive is and then i worked with another uh event in queensland and their financial drive was to raise enough funds over a three-year period to be able to build a new community hall in their rural community so do you understand what i mean you 've got to understand what is your financial drive and that could be like i said before that could be simply just to break even so that the event can continue you don 't have any real financial aspirations around raising funds for a charity or making profit or giving back to a community group it could simply just be breaking even but you whole tone for your budget for your sponsorship for your grant funding that you 're chasing now setting your event budget this is a really important process that events need to go through um and it 's not just a matter of sitting down and saying you know we 've got five thousand dollars for our event this year you really need to think about the financial management of your event in order to get the best outcomes and i love this little cartoon why bother to budget so we can worry before we spend the money as well as after we spend the money it 's kind of what budgeting does right it makes you just a little bit anxious about things um but in a good way because it 's really important for us to understand how we 're sitting from a financial perspective and obviously the bigger your event and the more expenses involved in your event then the more extensive your budget 's going to be so once again this is all about scale but in principle no matter how big or small your event is financial management practices in place so when you 're setting your budget and setting your budget should be the first thing you do in the planning process for your event so when you 're sitting down to start the process in planning your event there 's a few key things you do one is setting the budget another one is getting your team structure in place and another one is setting your planning timeline so what are our milestones what are our key dates and what 's our action plan in achieving those so your budget is a really key planning tool for your event so what you need to do is that you need to work really collectively with your committee you need to set the budget and you need to agree on the risk appetite of your committee what that means is understanding how much risk your committee is prepared to take within the budget and once you start playing around with the budget you 'll get a sense of what that is so for example does the committee want to take the risk of spending more money what let 's get somebody you know international to come to our event as a strategy to increase ticket sales are they prepared to take that risk or do they want to be a little bit more i was going to say responsible but a little safer and maybe go with a local act that they 've had in previous years so how much risk is the committee prepared to take don 't forget that as a committee or a committee member you 're accountable for the finances of your event so it is a big responsibility the other thing you need to think of with your budget is having a really good finance coordinator or a treasurer to manage the budget and that 's their only job with the event so they will do regular reporting and reconciling and make sure that everything 's up to date and everybody is aware of how the event budget is tracking i 've worked with many events that will set a budget so they 're really good at setting the budget at this stage of the planning process but then they don the event which is quite scary because the idea of a budget is a planning tool so you should be reporting regularly and having a look at how your actuals are tracking compared to what you 've budgeted to spend and also how much income is coming in as compared to how much income you had forecasted so you need to be doing that so that you can adapt and adjust accordingly so that you end up in a positive financial situation at the end i often get asked this question of income or expenses first when you 're looking at an event budget and i always suggest that you set the expenses first so i always say think about the type of event you want to put on and that 's as we know based on demand and feedback so you know what 's the ideal event program and the type of event that you want to put on and what are the expenses that are required to do that then that 's the ideal world right and we 'd wish that we could go yeah let 's do start looking at the revenue that needs to be generated to make that work and then we have to start trimming most of the time so setting the budget isn 't just a really quick process it is a bit of a process of scenario planning so you 're looking at different options can we afford to do that oh well here 's our revenue no we can 't we need to put money into this this year so setting the expenses of your event first then looking at the income to match that and then you 're going to just have to play around to get that to balance out now there there should always be as i was saying before this whole idea of monitoring and reviewing the budget i always recommend to events that there is a finance report at your committee meeting so always making sure even if you 're not the finance coordinator or the treasurer it 's still important for everybody to be aware of where the budget 's up to so it 's this process of monitoring the budget reviewing the budget and and leave them until the event 's over because it 's only those little things so it might be you know fifty dollars here or ten dollars here or a hundred dollars here that 's been overspent on different items and it 's all of those things that add up at the end so keeping a close eye on how things are tracking in terms of actual spend and actual income is a really important process to get into the habit of and as i said your budget is your is one of your key planning tools so make sure you use it as a planning tool all right i want to just take a quick look at revenue stream so as i said at the start sponsorship is just sponsorship and grant funding have a role in terms of the financial management of an event or the financial contribution to an event however it 's only one small or should only be one small component of your revenue streams for your event have a look at that blue bubble and i want you to think about that have you if you removed income and grants from you sorry if you remove grants and sponsorship from your budget what would that look like and i always set that challenge to events because it 's important to actually start looking at your event in terms of your owned revenue streams so they 're revenue streams that you generate yourself that you own so nobody can take them away from you because grants and sponsorship at any point you can lose those and we know it 's hard work to secure them and it 's often a bit of effort to maintain them so imagine if you had your own revenue streams and didn 't have that reliance on grants and sponsorships so just think about that and maybe that 's a little exercise for you to consider after this is taking a look at your budget and seeing how would you replace those revenue streams so festivals do need to have an income generation strategy and like i was saying before it even if you are a community event you need to understand what your income generation strategy strategy is so and that obviously is linked back to your financial drive so that 's going to give you a sense of your target financially is it break even is it ten thousand dollars in um donation to a charity you know is it a fifty thousand dollar profit to go back to a commercial investor you need to determine that and that 's going to also be linked to your pardon me your income generation strategy can you survive without grants or sponsorship like i said before set yourself a bit of a challenge and see if you can actually find new revenue streams to replace grants and sponsorship i always say to events grants and sponsorship should be a bonus so start to think of it as a bonus you shouldn 't be dependent on it to actually deliver or cover the running costs of an event i also encourage you to think outside the box to create year-round revenue streams so what do i mean by year-round revenue streams so i 'm talking there about revenue streams that you can actually that that can create for you revenue throughout i 'll give you an example of that an event i 've worked with in the past what they did which was i just loved this it 's so smart they purchased a marquee so they got a grant it was a state government grant they purchased a marquee that they could actually use for their corporate events sorry for their corporate groups and their sponsorship area at their event so they would normally have to pay i think it was around oh it was 20 to 30 000 that they had to pay for all this marquee and set up because they were in a remote area so a big investment for them to actually just hire it for their event so that 's a big expense item in their budget so what they did is they got an infrastructure grant they purchased their own marquee to use at their events so straight away they 're saving that expense line item in their budget which is massive now what they do because they 're in a more remote area and all other events you know races race days and well they now hire out their marquee year round so that 's generating over thirty thousand dollars a year in revenue for that event in addition to actually cutting it was like 20 i 'm sorry i don 't know the exact figure but it was over twenty thousand dollars the expense of actually hiring the marquee and everything that they needed at their event every single year so are there ways that you can think outside the box to create year-round revenue streams for your event and things that are easy because we don 't want to actually create more work uh merchandising your events uh so excellent way to raise funds if that is appropriate to your event not every event is appropriate for merchandising but what you can also do is look at securing brand partners so a classic example of that is the deniliquin muster down in southern new south wales they have a partnership that it used to be with rm williams but i believe it 's now with rb sellers or it could be with bringers western ware anyway one of those types of so they have a big broad range of merchandise and you can have a look at that on their website the deniliquin ute muster and they actually have a partnership arrangement so all of their merchandise is co-branded with let 's say rb sellers and an eliquid ute muster they get that merchandise at a heavily reduced price because they 're that brand rb sellers is getting massive brand exposure through the event and they sell it at a premium price so it 's a really good way for them to raise revenue by doing that brand partnership i 'll obviously another ticketing option for events is to become ticketed if you are currently a non-ticketed event and you 've been operating for a number of years you need to be really cautious taking making that transition from a non-ticketed to a ticketed event i 'm not saying don 't do it i think it 's really smart i think we need to we definitely need to be looking at that user pay system it 's really the way of making our events viable but if you 've been free to just take that make that transition to a ticketed event a very cautious process um because there 's some examples that i 've experienced where that has had mass massive backlash from community and from the audience that attends that event because it hasn 't been managed or communicated well so just be mindful a lot of events do it but they need to you need to manage it extremely well so what are some revenue streams look if you 've got any other revenue streams that aren 't on the screen at the moment please pop it into the chat box because i i find it very interesting to hear from other events in terms of the types of revenue streams that they actually have ticket sales that 's a no-brainer but not all events are structured to charge an entry fee but if you can it certainly can become a big revenue stream but if you aren 't structured to charge an entry fee there 's also often option for events to have components of their event ticketed so it might not be just one ticketing structure some particular areas of your event that are a bit more of a premium experience that lend themselves well to being ticketed and you may ticket those elements of your event uh other revenue streams as we 've said merchandise food and bev sales is always a good one i see a couple of people mention that in the chat box as a revenue stream and it doesn 't just have to be like one canteen or one bar think about how you can have multiple food and beverage outlets so for example you might go we 've got just a a water store all that does is sell bottled water which is not really good for the environment but i 'm sure there 's other ways to do it but you know it 's just a water stool you might have you know a coffee store that 's just coffee and some you know cakes or something like that so thinking about not just having that typical kind of canteen and a bar but how can you actually break it down and have things that are a little bit in quality that can be charged at a higher cost it out at a higher price you can sell advertising in your program trade and market stores so getting the site fees and that can be a big earner but don 't fall into the trap of letting that take over your event because it is a earner too many festivals are becoming you know the same same so i encourage events when you 're looking at market stores or food stores or trade stores is that you be selective and aim for quality over quantity fundraising initiatives so can you hold a stall or raffles etc at other events advertising on your own website or social channels uh vip events so similar to what i was saying before in terms of ticketing a component of your event that could become a vip an exclusive vip event you know behind the scenes we 've got 50 tickets for people to actually go behind the scenes and meet some of the entertainers and you charge a premium price for that uh also things like commission on third-party storeholder sales and some to manage but it 's certainly something to consider okay i 'm gonna just jump into the chat box i 'd be interested to know if anyone else has any other revenue streams other than what i 've mentioned or is there anything from what i mentioned that has kind of sparked a bit of thinking for your event in terms of what you could add as a revenue stream if anyone has any comments or thoughts i 'll leave it open for a couple of minutes so we 're going to move on to sponsorship now what i 'm going to share with you is it 's the process that i go through with my clients in terms of identifying who are our ideal sponsors prospective sponsors and the process we go through to secure those sponsors sponsorship is is a really hard slog and i 'm sure everybody would agree it 's tough to get knocked back often from prospective sponsors it 's disheartening it 's draining uh it 's yucky so what we want to try to do is to have a better process so we have want less knockbacks ultimately so as i said sponsorship should only be about 20 of your revenue and what you need to be doing is thinking about all of those alternative revenue streams so what we 've just talked about is trying to just get you in the mindset of we don 't just want to dive straight into sponsorship and grant funding for our event we want to be looking at it more holistically from a financial perspective to go this is our financial drive this is our budget now these are the sponsorship and grant opportunities that we 're going to go for to fill any gaps in our budget and that 's the first thing we do with sponsorship is to set our target we need to be really smart and understand what we need a lot of events will go out with a bit of a blanket approach just saying sponsor our event we 've got a gold silver and bronze package please sponsor our event but do they really know what they need as part of their sponsorship strategy so what you need to do already a step ahead as we 've just talked about you 've got your budget so once you 've got your budget you can identify your cash sponsor target so basically that is once you 've got all your income all your expenses you 'll then have a gap so if you 're like me your gap 's going to be pretty big because you want this amazing top of the cl top of the range event but your income and revenue can 't quite match that so there you 've got a gap so my event expenses might be a hundred thousand the revenue forecast that i 'm getting at which has always got to be realistic is sitting at about 75 000. so i know there 's a 25 000 gap there so i need to generate that through cash sponsorship um in order to ensure that my event at least breaks even so you need to be able to identify what is that gap between income and expenses that i can offset through corporate sponsorship you also should look at your budget and really critically review your will often say oh i can donate you know a bag of feed or i 'll donate um some fuel vouchers i 'll donate some accommodation vouchers and you end up with all of these in-kind donations at your event and you 're like what will we do with these oh we 'll do a raffle or we 'll give them away or whatever sometimes they become more effort than they 're actually worth so what you need to do is to make sure you can identify those expense items in your budget that can be offset through in-kind sponsorship or donations so what i always suggest is focus on in-kind donations that are budget relieving so if i 've got an expense item in my budget that is you know graphic design for example so it could be graphic design of you know our website our poster and our flyer you might have designed some content for your social media channels uh so graphic design is an expense that expense might be 500 for example so you might then go okay if we can remove that 500 by getting that we know to actually provide that service in kind in return for a sponsorship package then that is budget relieving it 's taking 500 out of your expenses that 's to me that 's as good as cash so that 's what you want to be aiming for you want cash or you want budget relieving in-kind sponsorship now the third thing you want to consider when you 're looking at targets is you need to consider what new projects or initiatives do you need cash for you may want to add a new element to the program you might want to build a new toilet block at the show ground you may need a new stage there may be some you know goals or aspirations for growth and development that you know you 're not going to be able to cover the cost from the event budget but that 's an extra project or initiative and if you can secure some extra sponsorship funds to go towards that then that 's fantastic so as you can see taking the time to set your budget is really important to a position to go okay we know we need twenty five thousand dollars cash and we want to secure in-kind sponsorship to cover graphic design printing media and fencing for our site so straight away you know so you 're not going to waste time going out there recruiting sponsors for anything because it is so time consuming i worked on an event last year given it was a international sporting event but i spent easy 12 months negotiating with a couple of corporate sponsors and one of those still didn 't come through in the end so my point is it 's very time consuming the negotiation process going backwards and forwards and then even managing the sponsors is really time consuming so you only want to secure or chase what you need so understand what those targets are the next thing you really need to understand is what you have to offer sponsors have a think about it do you really understand what you have to offer sponsors many events do just whack together a series of packages the classic is the gold silver bronze packages and typically far and wide they 'll cross their fingers they 'll pray every night that somebody comes back and says yeah we 'd love to sponsor your event and that 's really successful absolutely it may get some hits and it often generates a lot of in-kind donations but you need to ask are they the valuable hits that you want if you end up with a whole heap of in-kind donations often what that means is you end up with a heap of corporate sponsors that have given an in-kind donation but haven 't high expectation and they become a lot they become really demanding on your time so can you see where i 'm going it 's understanding what you want and only getting what you want so that you don 't burden yourself in managing sponsors that are only giving an in-kind donation so you need to understand what your event can offer a prospective sponsor and you can only understand that if you take the time to analyze your assets of your event so i just want to step you through this process quickly happy to take go through with events to get clear on what they actually have to offer sponsors because this is a partnership right you 're not just going to sponsors to say can we have five thousand dollars please thank you very much it 's a partnership so you really need to understand what you have to give back for that five thousand dollars why would they give you that five thousand dollars what 's the transaction so first thing you need to do and you guys should be experts in this now because we spent a session on this last week you have to know who your event attendees are sponsors will want to know how or who they are and how they can engage with them basically what your event is is a marketing channel for the sponsor so they want to know that your attendees at your event are the ideal market for that sponsor to build awareness conversion for their business so this is where building that complete picture of your attendees is really helpful and that 's that process we went through last week was looking at profiles that becomes a really rich piece of information for you to use when you 're pitching to sponsors and also for you when you 're analyzing who your preferred sponsors could be because you want to have the same ideal markets the second step you need to take is you need to brainstorm what your event assets are essentially all that is is a list of things that you can sell and we 're going to look at some examples shortly but what you need to do is you need to bring your committee together and brainstorm everything that they think you could be selling through your event just brainstorm everything and essentially what you 're going to do is you 're going to come up with a list of all of these things that you can sell to a sponsor you can look at your competition and see what their offering sponsors it 's good to do a bit of research and i 'm not by any means suggesting go out and copy what your your competitors are doing from a sponsorship perspective but look at other competing see what they 're offering you can often search and find sponsorship proposals online and just get some idea of what others are offering so you want to come up and and this is a process of getting all of the assets just a brainstorm nothing is a silly option here once you 've done that you 'll end up with this massive list of assets and that is what will form an inventory list and that becomes a key part of your sponsorship proposal once you 've got an inventory list rather than creating a single generic sponsorship package and sending it out to everyone you know and their dog you can start looking really closely at building an inventory of everything you are willing to sell so you can start to be really targeted now the final step is to then start looking at what you would charge for everything in your inventory list this is not easy and you may not be able to do it for everything but what you want to try to do is put value on your assets because that 's going to you 'll look at things like product placement or free tickets or market store space and you 'll give all of those different things of value advertising in your program promotion on your website you 're going to put a value beside each of those and as i said it 's not easy particularly things like logo placement on your website so when you put a sponsors logo on your website how do you put a value on that well what you can do is you can actually compare it with the cost of them doing their own google adwords and it just gives you an idea so if you 're not trying to come up with a an absolute figure here it 's just an idea of the value of these assets and you 're obviously you 're not going to share this information with any sponsorship prospects it 's your planning process to be able to then go okay if we 're going to pitch to xyz a sponsorship package that includes logo placement speaking opportunities free tickets exhibition space blah blah blah then you know based on value that is so you can go okay that sponsorship package is worth a thousand dollars you see what i 'm doing like this is about you need to understand before you can start pitching before you can even start considering who your potential sponsors are is understanding what you have to sell your sponsors it 's this process of you know really understanding what you 've got to offer and once you 've done this once so i don 't want you to feel overwhelmed and think oh my god this is making sponsorship so complicated it may appear complicated but you know what it will save you hours of time through the sponsorship pitching process because what you 're doing is you 're cutting down on the potential of going to a whole heap of sponsors that aren 't even interested or relevant or appropriate so i trust me i 've been through this many many times i 've done it the wrong way and i 've done it this way and i know that this saves a lot of time and once again if your event 's you as long but you need to understand what it is that you have to offer sponsors so you do this and you 've got that then you don 't have to do it every year if your event changes slightly you might add some new things to your inventory list you might be able to come up with a new package but once you 've been through this process and know what your assets are you can just draw on that each year to create your sponsorship packages now here are some things that you may want to consider so when you 're looking at that inventory list so what are the assets of your event i just wanted to give some examples because sometimes that confuses people the terminology can confuse people a little bit but if you have any others that perhaps aren 't listed here i 'd love you to pop it into the chat box so naming rights this is an obvious one it can be for your entire event or it can be for elements of your event so events might have a naming a main stage where all of the entertainment is taking place it might be you know the revenge academy main stage and we pay a fee in order to get the return for that sponsorship package so naming rights the other thing to just be mindful of with that is that many sponsors will look for category exclusivity what i mean by that is if a bank if you approach a bank for example they may want to be the only bank sponsoring your event actually they will want to be the only bank so just be mindful of that as well when you start to look at your hit list which we 're going to talk about shortly don 't go and approach five local banks at the same time maybe approach one that you think is the best fit if you 're unsuccessful with that then go to the next one because majority of the time those different industries will want to have exclusive sponsorship rights to the event okay some other assets are things like access to your mailing or distribution list i won 't go through 've got any questions about any of those please don 't hesitate to to yell out or pop something in the chat box um you know adverts in your official program so that 's quite popular co-branded merchandise um and i was talking about that before in terms of uh danilalique utmaster as the example i see that working more and more these days and is a really good strategy your volunteers are also an asset and a lot of people don 't think of this but you know your volunteers are walking around at the event for that whole event duration so for a sponsor to actually provide uniforms or even at least shirts for your volunteers so they all look the same it can have volunteer written large on the back and then their branding on it that 's a real asset for them to have all of these brand ambassadors essentially walking around the event for them so really think about what are all of our assets speaking opportunities you 've got a lot of space well depending on your event you 've got space you have people to speak you there 's all of these things are assets that can go on your inventory list even think about your marketing in the lead up to the event if you 're investing in tv advertising there 's an asset right a sponsor might be interested if they know that they can get exposure through your tv campaign so it 's really about thinking what are all of the assets or things that we could sell a sponsor or that a sponsor would find valuable all right before we move on to the next step which is about identifying your prospective sponsors or how i like to call it finding your perfect match does anyone want to comment on their own assets has anyone got any questions on that assets or inventory lists everyone 's very quiet today busily taking notes or enjoying lunch linda so with our events assets we try to get someone to say sponsor the fireworks um this year i 've looked at and asked directed to a few people like our rodeo they 're going to sponsor shoots and also the different events different one we 've taken on this year yeah yeah so you would have lots of different elements i mean you would have so many assets yeah you know in terms of the events that you 're running the the site you know signage space yeah even the announcements you know you 've also got the audio announcements that are happening throughout the night or the day or the event there 's loads of assets there yeah so yeah it 's breaking it down if if it 's an event like yours for example it 's also about breaking down the different events within the event and thinking about those and sometimes you 've got to be a little bit smart in thinking okay am i better to break down elements within this event so if you take the rodeo for example do we sell the shoots do we sell off also naming rights to each of the um categories or do we just get one big sponsor to be the sponsor of the rodeo and they have exclusive but they 've got to pay a premium the challenge with the sponsorship appetite or environment is like um post covert you know there 's some suggestion that it might be a little bit harder for events to get sponsorship i mean no one really knows everyone 's kind of making assumptions but considering um some industries and some states have been through a really rough time it could be a little bit more challenging to secure sponsorship so with that in mind what i 've been telling events is you might just need to lower the value of your sponsorship and maybe it 's about getting more smaller sponsors rather than a few big sponsors which is not always ideal because it 's it then becomes harder to manage but that 's a little bit of an unknown at this stage but it 's still something for us to keep in mind i just know i 've just targeted or asked a few people with the rodeo that are in that field like or associated with other rodeos would they like to put sponsorship on an event and jumped at it and said yep we 'll donate the prize money do one event or two events and i went oh right like it was general conversation it wasn 't actually a proper proposal it was just general conversation yeah and trying to get gauge people 's ideas whether this would work or not was my thing and they 've all jumped on board and said yep no we 're happy to do it just tell us our value and we 're right to go which surprised me yeah that 's great i mean that 's an excellent position to be in you just need to you know in that case and it sounds like you 're doing all the right things but making sure if they 're so keen that um you 're getting exactly what you need you know like i was saying before you don 't want to have a whole heap of sponsors that you 've got to manage that aren 't actually filling your needs um so yeah knowing okay this is exactly what we need and like you said prize money but that once again that 's a budget relieving item because if they don that cost out of the budget right so that 's as good as cash to me um you know those kind of sponsorship arrangements yeah victoria i think i just seen your hand up yeah you ask about social media value so while we put our sponsors logos and details on the flies and on the brochures and we announce it all day in your professional opinion how how do we value ad for our sponsors on social media should we be acknowledging them once a week three weeks before the event should we be acknowledging them three times a week should we be asking for promote likes how do we handle that value on social media yeah good very good question um and this needs to be managed well um not just for your sponsors but what you 've also got to remember is the purpose of social media um what you can do is really sour or damage the um audience so if you and you would have i 'm sure you would have seen this where events you know they 're a month out from their event see all of these posts about different sponsors that 's not necessarily the purpose of social media it 's not about you know just spamming almost your audience with a whole heap of posts to promote your sponsors and it doesn 't really achieve what the sponsors could gain from social media so you need to think that through you need to think through the plan so what and and what i would typically suggest in that case and this this does vary depending on the type of event who your audience is on social media but you need to first of all have the conversation with your sponsors so what is it what is it that they 'd like to gain from your social media channels you know do they want to try to get some people over to their facebook page do they want to try to encourage people to subscribe to a newsletter is there a particular product or service that 's related to your event that perhaps they 're going to be at your event demonstrating or showcasing that could be promoted on your facebook page sponsor to to get a sense of what it is they 'd like to really achieve from any social media promotion that you do for that sponsor so first of all finding out that the second thing you need to do is always when you do a social media post about a sponsor you should always have your audience in mind try not to be just sales focus so you know those posts that are like oh we 're so proud to have rm williams sponsoring our event you know and there 's a logo of rm williams doesn 't really achieve anything for the sponsor and it doesn 't give any value to your audience either so always think about your audience so um what is it that they want could the post be a little bit educational could the post actually be you know making the audience aware that rm williams is going to have their their big fancy truck at your event um and they 're going to have a 20 discount for anyone that you know likes their page or something like that um so always audience so that you don 't just annoy them with you know all this content promoting sponsors and i guess the final thing i 'll say as well on that is timing so you asked about timing should we do one a week a few a week how do we do it however you do it spread it out because you want it to be part of a content plan where it 's evenly balanced so you 're not just going oh no we 've only got a couple of weeks left let 's just you know put out three posts a day on our sponsors because that 's just going to once again frustrate your audience so spread it out as much as you can the other thing to keep in mind with this is typically your social media channels for your event are going to be more active during your event so you know what happens is you see if you look at your analytics for social media usually you 'll have you know you it kind of starts to spike as your event comes up and then media and for a few days after you have a have a bit of a peak as well because people are naturally then looking up your social media pages during the event they 're posting about the event so your engagement levels are really high during the event and maybe a week either side of your event just as a as an example so keep that in mind because when you 're doing sponsor posts you want to make sure that your sponsors are getting the most exposure possible and a lot of the time on facebook our stuff that we post is just goes into facebook land and hardly anyone sees it so we want to do it when our engagement levels are high so if you 've got some you know top sponsors that are contributing good cash contribution to your event then perhaps you want to have that discussion with them and say hey we 're actually going to do your posts around the time of our event or either side of our event because our analytics show that that 's when we 're getting our peak you can see there 's a few things to consider there and i guess it really shows as well that sponsorship and this whole partnership arrangement with a corporate needs to be very well thought out and therefore that 's why you know targeting the right sponsors with the right package is so important i i i can 't_''_3855.44 say that enough because i know i 've been there where we 've wasted so much time on sponsors that really don 't add a lot of value um you know sponsors that just waste your time um and i mean that with most respect but you need to be quite strategic in how you approach your sponsors and what that package looks like to get your outcomes and you need to understand that you 've got value to offer sponsors as well sometimes events think that they 're there like this to their sponsors you know it 's it 's a partnership so if you have a good partnership arrangement that sponsors gaining the same if not more from your event than you 're getting from them so don 't right we 're doing pretty good with time what i want to talk about now is this next step so basically we 've looked at what what is it that we can offer sponsors we 've if we 're thinking through the process i 've just talked through with you right now you have a good appreciation of all of your assets and what it is of value that you can offer potential sponsors so now you need to get really clear on who are the appropriate prospects or another way to say it is you need to develop your hit list so this is really about identifying who your corporate sponsors could and should be and what you need to remember there is not every sponsor will be a good fit for your event and that 's an interesting comment because often we go if anyone offers a sponsorship we 're like yeah oh you know how exciting but you need to be mindful that not every sponsor will be a good fit you need to think about your values you know your community 's values your brand and 's a an example of a bad fit a resource company um approached a food a small food festival to sponsor a small food festival some members of that committee were like yay we 've got you know a big sponsor coming on board they 've approached us they were excited at this committee meeting it actually clashed with the values of some of the community members because they didn 't want to support a resource company in their small agricultural community and what happened is they actually lost some of their really committed volunteers as a result of that they didn 't end up taking on the resource company anyway but but what it did is it created the even the consideration of taking them on created this divide within the volunteers it wasn 't an alignment to the values unfortunately they lost volunteers so remember not every sponsor is a good fit for your event so what you need to do now in terms of identifying your prospects is you take that inventory list that you created you take your attendee profiles that you created last week and opportunities and what companies want to engage with our attendees so this is where you 're starting to match it up and that 's how you save time and energy so you need to think about who is the right fit for our event and then you 've got to develop a database of all of those potential sponsors so you 're lining it up with your assets you 're lining it up with your attendees and you start to identify what i call your hit list of potential sponsors so you start to collate the details of their names their contacts all of their details in a database and as you 're doing that you start to think about what kind of level would i be pitching to these potential sponsors are they a 500 sponsor are they a 50 000 sponsor we wish so that becomes what i refer to as your sponsorship hit list so it 's just compiling all of the contacts of potential sponsors but not just any business like i said the first thing is to make sure they 're a match so you competitors and see who they 're working with you can also ask attendees for sponsor suggestions or get a feel for the types of brands and businesses that your attendees are aligned to look at what types of cars are in the car park is there a particular car brand that everyone 's driving or a lot of people are driving so start to really kind of think it through then finally once you 've got your list of prospects you need to then research them and this is a time consuming part but once again once you 've done this then you 've got that information it 's going to help you have a better chance of success in your pitching so you want to actually just google them so you just jump on you know abc company and just read usually they 've got you know a community section or sometimes they 'll have a sponsorship section or just read about us and learn a bit about that organization what are their goals who 's is their audience nothing impresses a sponsor more than showing them that you solid pitch they 're so used to just receiving hundreds and hundreds of generic proposals every week if you can show them that you 've done your research you know how your event aligns with their organization and their goals i guarantee you you are going to be on the top of their list but it takes time so let 's discuss that a little bit more what are some of the things that sponsors may want to achieve from your event so when you 're doing that research on your prospective sponsors or when you 're having discussions with corporates these are some of the things you want to be looking out for sponsors are ultimately looking to connect with your attendees but they also want things like increased brand loyalty they want to [Music] you know reinforce their image or establish an image amongst your audience increase sales they want to launch a new product that 's often a good one if they want to launch a new product or service to a new market brand building and just on that launch a new product just to give this international sporting event at that time we had doing our research we identified a car brand that was actually launching a new suv and they needed to try to jump into the market and compete with the likes of toyota and isuzu etc so we presented them with an opportunity to actually launch it was all the timing was perfect we presented them with the opportunity to launch their new model at our event which was a perfect rural audience for them they didn 't take it actually which was really disappointing but it was their loss but that 's just an example of where you do your research and you start to find these things out and you go oh we could offer something to them that 's going to help them achieve that and sometimes it 's just one thing it 's one thing that you may find that you can pitch to that sponsor that gets them and then the conversation starts so you need to know what the sponsor wants to achieve and you do that through research now you 've got to find the i know that sounds like a really big process but once you start i promise you it 's not and you don 't have to do that every year basically what you 're the point you 're in now is the point of matchmaking so this part is the most critical part and if you get it right it will save you so much time it 'll save you so much time pitching it 'll save you so much heartache getting knocked back from inappropriate sponsors and that never feels good so what we 're trying to do is to improve our odds so basically where we 're at we 've we understand what our event can offer so we know the benefits we know our assets we understand what we can offer a prospective sponsor we also have identified who those prospective sponsors are and we understand what they want to achieve basically then you are identifying your perfect match that you want to start pitching to i 'm a really firm believer that when you have a good asset list and a well-defined audience your ideal sponsor will linda you 're dreaming um but it often happens it 's like you do that work you know what you 're looking for you 're much clearer on the type of sponsor that is right for your event you start having a few conversations and they just appear magic maybe so who already knows who their perfect match is does anyone has anyone been through that process have you got a sense of who would be the right fit for your event or or do you think going through that process will give you that clarity of who you should be targeting for your event okay now 's the fun part so we 've got our perfect match we know this is xyz sponsor and this is the package we 're going to pitch to them now it 's about doing the pitching and like i 've said a few times now i 'm not a big fan of the generic approach in some cases for lower level sponsors it can work but today what i suggest particularly when it 's so competitive to secure sponsors is that you take do is i use a bit of a tiered approach so i 'll go i usually set a a a bit of a value so i 'll go okay my tier one and two that 's anyone over ten thousand dollars cash so my tier one and twos i do a customized very personalized approach and for anyone that 's t3 or that is providing in-kind i measure how much time and effort i put in based on the value and this all comes back to knowing that you can spend way too long on this process so you need to set yourself some boundaries how much time will i spend on this okay so first you need to do your research so if a business does state on their website what their needs and requirements are what their goals are then you need to follow them for example i know for a fact that if you want to pitch to somebody like toyota they clearly stipulate on their website the process to go through so do your research have a look so if you 've identified that toyota is it 'll tell you exactly how to go through the process for any others just do some research and understand what their objectives are and what some key messages are for your pitch you also need to understand who to pitch to so even the best designed best researched best price proposal won 't work if you send it to the wrong person and that can be very frustrating who should you send it to typically you 're looking for people that are either in branding or marketing or some larger companies have a sponsorship department somebody that works in business development or communications them kind of roles those kind of roles are going to be the ones that would typically look after sponsorship so find out who the best person is to send it to before you send it i always suggest that you call before sending a proposal so don 't send a proposal cold and particularly for major sponsorships if it 's possible have a face-to-face meeting with the appropriate person develop a customized proposal so develop that presentation or a quick pitch that summarizes the objectives so always have you may not always have the opportunity to give that pitch with a with a hard copy document but know what your key points are so if you have the opportunity to get in front of the right person at toyota for example then you want to know what are the key messages that 's going to grab their attention you need to follow up and expect to do that multiple times and this is the thing it can be very time consuming but once you 've sent them a proposal give them a few days to sit on it then get in touch with them and expect as i said to follow them up multiple times if they 're a major sponsor and you 're asking for large cash amounts then leave yourself enough time for long periods of negotiation that can take three six or more months to actually come up with an agreement another thing i just wanted to mention as well is it 's important that you secure any major sponsorship commitments prior to commencing any of your marketing activity why do we sponsors want is that exposure through your marketing activity so if you 're halfway through your marketing activity for your event and then you secure a sponsor they 're only going to get value from that second half of your marketing activity and sometimes that can come back and bite you so i guess the message there is to start your sponsorship process early in an ideal world we want to have all of our sponsors locked away three to four months before the event at least now you need to manage your sponsors or your partners really well and this is where a detailed sponsorship tracker can come in really handy to keep track of everything i want you to also try to deliver more where you can a few other things you may want to do is create a leverage kit for sponsors what that is is essentially a file of you know marketing material for your events some photos or videos of your event you might create them a specific email signature so basically you 're giving them some material that they can then use to promote really good value add to sponsors i also encourage you to add your sponsor 's primary email contact to any newsletter e-newsletter subscriptions that you have so if you 're sending out you know to potential attendees a newsletter every six months for example add your sponsor to that because then they 're going to see that activity happening they want to know that you 're promoting the event they want to see that activity you want to also make sure you allow time for regular phone face-to-face where possible and email contact directly with your sponsors so one-on-one not just sending them group updates looking after the sponsors at the event look most events uh do this really well so having a hospitality area catering taking the time to go and spend time with your sponsors at the event really important because what we want to remember is it 's so much easier to resign a sponsor than to get a new sponsor so always keep that in mind by the time you 're at this stage always share any so if you 've used their logo anywhere you screenshot of it and share it with them and also make sure you have some time post event to have a really good debrief meeting with them to find out from them what worked at the event what worked with the sponsorship what could we do next time it 's an opportunity to try to resign them on the spot now once the sponsorship money arrives in your bank a lot of people think it 's time to kick back and relax no that 's not the case i estimate that getting the commitment from a sponsor is about 20 percent of the total work of sponsorship in other words now that you 've got the sponsor locked away you still have 80 percent of the work to do sponsorship is a transaction and when sponsors don 't get what they 're paid for they 're often not very happy so you have to deliver for your sponsors don 't just think once you 've got a sponsor yeah we 've got our sponsor and then we do put their logo in a few places and forget about them you go overboard too much you can sometimes do too much for them and then you don 't get that return so you you will know at what level and what commitment you need to give to that sponsor now finally reporting and accountability as i just said before renewing an existing relationship with a sponsor is much easier than trying to develop a new one so as you can see we 've just been through the process of uh sourcing sponsorship when it 's done well it 's actually quite a lengthy process so if you can actually renew existing sponsors oh my god it 's the best and what i suggest you also try to do is when you lock away a new sponsor try to lock them in for multiple years all right so what do we need to do post event you want to have a debrief meeting or some people call it an exit interview as i 've just said you can do that by phone or survey and once again that depends on the level of sponsor if it 's a higher level sponsor a meeting with them you need to send through a letter of thanks and also include a copy of any post event report if you 've got any media clippings anything that showcases the success of your event even if you 've made a video you know often at the end of the at the end of an event uh events will have a little you know video which has got just uh some clips from the event send that through to them as well share with them the success that you 've had this is also the opportunity to review the arrangement and to see if there 's any interest for them to participate in future years and if you can sign it off at that point then that is excellent so always making sure you 're reporting be accountable to your sponsors they want to know your success they want to know what their return has been as well so share with them you know a bit of a report that shows the success of the event and also all of the exposure and work that you 've done renew existing sponsors and then the cycle just begins again but as i said if you 've done that process as we 've just been through you don 't obviously have to do that every year you 've already got that but then you 're just reviewing updating your sponsorship prospect and perhaps you know reigniting some conversations that you 've had in previous years to try to get another sponsor over the line that 's sponsorship good luck and there will be instances where a sponsor will just come to you you know if you do deliver a great event you have you know a fantastic experience you 've got great success you 've got a lot of advocates out there talking about you then there will be cases where a sponsor will just come to you and that 's a bonus but if they do just come to you don 't get too excited and just take whatever they offer sit down and have a good conversation with them about what it is that they want to gain from the event and then think about how you can the best arrangement okay before we wrap up i also just want to talk about grant funding so in addition to corporate sponsorship we 're often looking for grant funding for our events as well grant funding is usually something that can be used to offset a bit of a cost but more importantly grant funding is usually used for you to do something more with your event that more might be doing more marketing it might be looking at a strategic plan it might be building some infrastructure at your site it might be giving you some money to have increased entertainment at your event so you typically apply for a grant for some specific element of your event one thing to be really mindful of is grants can be admin heavy not only do you have to apply for the grant then there 's certain reporting requirements so always just be mindful of that don 't just chase a grant for the sake of a grant because sometimes it can become a burden i 'm actually dealing with an event and the sunshine coast at the moment that 're at the point where they just want to give it back because it 's become too hard for them to manage so make sure you 're always seeing value in the grant and knowing similar to what we talked about with sponsorship knowing exactly what you need and want it for so there are some current funding opportunities available for events one of those is the tourism and events queensland destination events program some of you may have heard of this it 's called the qdep program there 's single-year funding for events that are looking to grow so these are events that have specific tourism outcomes you can 't source this funding in your first year you have to be at least in your second year and you can seek up to 25 000 per year depending on the size of your budget so they actually determine the allocation of that grant based on your budget because that determines really the size and scale of your event as you can see the rounds i 've got on the screen for you these funds are specifically to be used personnel and the higher of temporary infrastructure so tourism and events queensland is really about trying to support the future sustainability or viability of events so they 're looking at how they can set events up for future success so that 's why there 's things like strategic plan development included it 's a quite it 's quite a straightforward grant to apply for it 's not a very complex application process but once again make sure that you 're only applying for it if you have a real need in those particular areas and you 're going to get that return so it 's a fairly long url but you can just search search for queensland destination events program and it will come up for you online and it 's got all of the details and the guidelines another one that 's open right now is the building better regions fund now you must be a non-profit or council to apply for this one you can apply for up to twenty thousand dollars unmatched otherwise if you think you can match anything over twenty thousand you can actually apply for significantly expanded events or first year new events so if you 're adding a new element to your event you will be able to apply for this 20 000 unmatched if you 're in new events and never been held before you could apply for twenty thousand dollars unmatched to help cover the cost of running your event now this one is much more comprehensive in terms of the application process and it does close on the 5th of march so time is running out for this one and i suggest if anyone is interested in that for their event that they jump on it today and have a look once again it 's a long url so i haven 't put it on the screen but if you just search building better regions fund you 'll find it and it 's it 's in the community stream so you can see they 're two very good funding programs that are available right now and you can also do some of your own work finding other funding opportunities and keeping your finger on the polls so if you know you want to invest in increased marketing or you want to employ a short-term contractor to help deliver your events for example if you know what these things are you can do a bit of searching and you might be able to find a grant that can help with that now the rda darling downs and southwest is an excellent resource so if you 're not yet signed up for their newsletter i recommend that you do they send out a great update of grants that are open on a regular basis so make sure you jump in and sign up to their newsletter and if like i said before if you 've got something with your event um that you know you want or need grant funding for give them a call or give council a call and just say look we want to build a new toilet block or a new stage or whatever it may be any thoughts on any funding that may be available or suitable for that it 's also good to sign up for industry newsletters so tourism and events queensland or even outback updates on what funding opportunities currently exist there 's grant connect and community grants they 're good online resources the funding center for non-profits and also foundation for regional for rural regional renewal as some of you may know as f triple r they often have really good little programs and they 're good because you know any rural communities that are drought affected or flooding or bush fires or anything around building resilience in rural communities you can often tap into some funding there to assist with events as well so there 's quite a few different funding opportunities and also in addition to in addition to that if you 're looking at you know arts based an arts based event or a sporting based event there 's also other channels whether that be you know art specific funding or even sports based funding and obviously you also have a local funding opportunity so everybody should be aware of this the tourism events grant and this provides funding across three categories so as you can see there on the screen and i 'm sure most of you aware of thousand three thousand or six thousand um and that is available for existing events or developing new events which is really exciting because not a lot of councils or government agencies will actually fund new events so it 's a really good um i guess channel for you to actually get some seed funding if you are a new event so all the details for that are on the website and also if your event doesn 't qualify as a tourism event because we know there 's often from a fi from a funding perspective there 's always two different categories you 've got tourism events so any events that actually attract attract external visitors or you 've got community events and they 're events that are more focused on local residents or building community pride or community initiatives so my understanding is council also has a community grants program for anybody that may not be eligible for the tourism events grant now my final slide before i hand over for any questions there 's a number of things you should consider when you 're applying for grants once again an onerous process so making sure that you take the time to identify the right grant is really important because we don 't want to waste our time applying for something we 're not actually eligible for and i know that sounds silly but i 've seen it happen a number of times so call the funding body prior to commencing your application because you can read the criteria or the guidelines and think yep okay i think we 're right but sometimes they can be a little bit confusing when you read them so i suggest you call the funding body and just say to them this is our project this is what we want to do do you think we are eligible what that also does is make you top of mind for that funding body so they already know that something 's going to come in from you now read the instructions and the criteria thoroughly and multiply that by two and that 's because of what i was just saying you do not want to waste your time applying for something you 're not eligible for you may anyone that 's applied for a grant recently will know that a lot of grants are now applied for through an online platform so you 're typing your response straight into the website they 're pretty good these days but i have certainly had cases where i 've lost a whole grant application because that online platform has done something and just lost all my information so now i don 't trust them and i always suggest to people write the questions and answers in a word document and you can easily just copy and paste that in once you 're finished and happy with it now point four may seem really stupid and you 're probably thinking linda 's just lost the plot now answer the question it does seem silly but i 've also assessed some grant applications um before and you can tell when somebody is really just fluffing around in their response i 'd rather people use dot points get straight to the point and answer the question don 't fluff around it 's always good to ask someone separate to the project or it that whole thing of fresh eyes can really help and even sometimes the funding body will provide a service where they will actually review your application and give feedback before you submit it if those opportunities are offered i absolutely suggest you take them up because it 's going to place you ahead of the rest and make sure you also take advantage of any webinars so sometimes funding bodies will also host a webinar on how to apply and they are jam packed with tips on what to include in your response make sure you get the budget right because that 's often the first thing the funders will look at always include credible letters of support and if you can include visuals so if you 've got photos if you 've got site plans anything that 's backing up your case is really helpful and they 're just a few things that i 've learned over the years of doing grant applications that can really help and put you ahead of competition because applying for funding is a really competitive space everybody wants that bucket of money apologize if i 've overwhelmed you i know that 's a lot of information but it 's really important that i covered off initially on that bigger picture around budgeting and finance for events it 's giving some context sponsorship and grants are critical to the success of a lot of events but you don 't have to be dependent on it and i challenge you as an event to actually do that task of removing sponsorship and grants from your actual budget your revenue from your budget and see what impact that has on your bottom line i don 't suggest that you 'll be able to survive without any sponsorship or grants but we do want to start to reduce that and i want to start to challenge you to look at other revenue streams because that 's going to set you up for a better chance of success into the future and then you need to do that strategic process of knowing what sponsorship you need and what grant funding you need and be really targeted with it please don 't waste your time it 's it 't need to get bogged down in so be very strategic know what you want know who the best fit is and go out and get it sounds simple right now i 'm very conscious that that was a very heavy um master class there was a lot of information in there you will have received this morning two documents from kim one of those is a sponsorship toolkit and the other one is a grants toolkit that information will help support what i 've talked to you about today and also give you some more practical tips on that successful approach to grants and sponsorship so make sure you have a look at that use it if you 've got any questions guys please pop it into the facebook event i 'm looking at that on a daily basis so use it if you need any help in other areas make sure you put it in there and i 'd be happy to assist where i can otherwise if anybody has anything they 'd like to say right now i 'm happy to stay on the line for a thanks linda it was mind-boggling what you 've told us but it would be interesting to go back and sit down and re-look at my notes and read the handout and there 's a lot that i can see we can improve on just as one group so yeah and you know what even if it 's just and this is important as well even if it 's just something really little that you take away from these sessions you know there 's lots of information but if you take away one or two little things that 's going to improve your processes and give you a better chance of success then that 's a win so good luck thank you everyone go have a cup of tea [Laughter] have a lovely afternoon and i 'll see everybody next week see you all next week bye bye bye _"

    "text": "[Music] hello my lunch shire um gardner radford the economic development officer for blanchard council i 've got peter spindler with me today from alexa peter 's the managing director of the business and just earlier today we had peter speak as our keynote on growth diversity and pivoting in your business and there was a lot of great i guess comments and some feedback that some of our small businesses that did participate will definitely be able to take uh when they go back and and operate their business so i just like to ask peter a couple questions um you 've seen a lot of change in business transformation pivot what actually is pivoting pivoting itself is change it 's it 's the ability to recognize that perhaps things aren 't working the right way perhaps things have changed in the industry maybe the markets change covert prime example and pivot is the mechanism that we use in business to i guess take advantage of a particular change or perhaps address a challenge or a threat that 's coming our way now you 've reno you 've operated to touch on some of those it 's pretty diverse so first business age 19 turned into one of the largest online bookshops in the country at the time and that was a spectacular journey going up and down in the space of about five years since then there 's been a lot of other businesses i 've tried many many different things importing exporting sporting products eyewear medical equipment had my own range of men 's accessories and clothing ties cufflinks etc i 've owned a medical recruitment agency and that was a very successful operation as we 're very proud of that particular business been in food manufacturing i 've owned a web development and design agency digital marketing agency and for the past nine years been in consulting so alexa was a strategy digital transformation agency and two months ago we lost lost we launched our software company minolexis so i guess being out here you know the rural areas the bush when you come into the community some people might look at you thinking oh here we go city slicker uh what does he know about of your insights and some of the clients you 've been working with yeah definitely it 's always an interesting journey um coming out to these sort of areas especially look i don 't_''_155.92 normally wear this so i 'll just sort of put that out there don 't normally wear a jacket special occasion did you get it but look over the years interestingly in terms of our business and our client base most of our clients are based in rural and regional communities most of our businesses either are within the agriculture sector or have got to do with agriculture and in fact my background in terms of my family and where i come from we come from a small town in rural hungary where my family for generations were farmers so we 've owned waterculture businesses we 've owned crop production businesses we 've also retail stores that were sort of like the front face of some of the horticulture businesses that we 've had so i 've been involved with regional rural areas for many many years i understand the challenges that we face on many technology and uh so i certainly come into an area and work with with uh regional rural businesses with that in mind i certainly don 't bring city slicker mentality because that doesn 't work entrepreneurship in the area i think you could feel there was a good vibe this morning at this morning 's breakfast and just some of the levels of degrees of entrepreneurship and innovation and ideas what would you if i 'm starting up a business in a rural area or what area or even operating a business what 's maybe is there any two or three helpful hints that you could provide to to you know show that you know i can succeed in in a business here in the bush really really good question and um probably i 'd say three things three key things come into my mind first of all you need to learn to collaborate and i think collaboration in business and in fact collaboration as a business model in itself is proving quite viable in today 's world and it 's quite a growing movement towards collaboration and business and doing in your region understand who 's who will look at working together to achieve outcomes together sharing resources leveraging each other 's time and experience but really importantly this is something i should have mentioned this morning collaboration should extend into the bigger cities into other regions as well don 't hesitate to knock on the doors of other businesses located elsewhere and see how you can co-collaborate and work together the other thing that i 'd recommend and this is certainly from a startup point of view but for any business itself don 't run a business just without a plan you need a plan you need a strategic plan to give you the direction of acute where do you want to head give you guidance and then really importantly have an implementation plan which means that you don 't just talk about doing things but you actually action things you take action um and probably the third thing that i say from a rural regional perspective is make the digital your friend it 's really really critical because your location uh can make certain things challenging but of those barriers and help you access different markets help you run a more effective business in general in council in communities council has its core businesses now we we have our economic development team uh we 've got a number of projects there 's lots of infrastructure lots of investments but even on a smaller level in terms of supporting small business we have a number of programs and one is our business mentoring program we 've had two rounds and we 've been lucky to have you as one of our mentors for both rounds one and two can you share some insights and maybe some reasons why some of the small businesses are just business and startups should be looking at the mentoring program to be involved in let me frame it this way um take any sports person doesn 't matter who take any successful sports person i can guarantee you that successful sports person will have at least one coach if not more uh guiding people or team behind them success isn 't made by the individual and the smart individual recognises that one individual _''_392.24 it 's really powerful to learn from the mistakes and successes of others and that 's what mentoring mentoring provides if you look at top performing musicians athletes whoever they are they 've got voice coaches they 've got performance coaches they 've got nutritionists why do you think they have that it 's because one person can 't do everything and they can 't and then even if they could there 's not enough time in the day so mentoring gives the mentees the ability to leverage off of my experiences and i 've made a lot of a lot of failures over the years i 've made a lot of mistakes but you know what i 've grown and i 've also had a lot of successes i 've built some great businesses great outcomes and to be able to impart this knowledge to another individual on a personal level is very very satisfying one reason why i love mentoring but the other other thing with it as i 've seen with the mentees that i 'm working with is that when you listen to the advice and and that 's the power but within a space of three four months you can transform the way that you think the way you look at your business and if i may drop his name nick hope you don 't mind nick that 's a young individual who i can tell you the way he thinks now is different to the way he thought of the business when we first started it 's just micro little adjustments but it 's enough to make a big difference down the track thanks pete because i think that 's really the pathway council is looking at is how we can assist businesses to grow diversified people just like they talked about this morning is the theme and mentors like yourselves and all these other programs that the businesses can can you or can um can apply for every business should in all honesty you should not be walking this uh journey of business by yourself and if i had the means to go back in time back to my first business what i would tell myself is quite simple get a mentor because 19 guess what i would be the jeff bezos of australia i would have that 's what we wanted to achieve we didn 't achieve that and the thing that limited that business and the reason that business failed was because of me had nothing to do with anything else other than me and that could have been adjusted if someone was sitting there going so a lot of a lot of power in uh in a mentoring relationship and we 've got a couple of upcoming events we 've got an agritourism and farm stays event that 's on the 17th 18th and 19th we 're going to be in fallon deer and vanity and st george with our consultant carrion withers cons are carrion 's looking after the or the lead consultant for the dear bandy thermal bass but has a very strong background in working with farm stays in the health and wellness market so if you 're thinking about getting into that space i urge you to attend these events um 17th 18th 19th now in deer in vanity and st george and then we also and small business month here in may is an event in terms of making the most of major capitalizing the opportunities of major tourism events plenty events happening plenty of tourists that are coming to the area more events that are happening as we as we move out of covid they are happening in the shire so as a small business owner definitely start preparing for that event because there 's going to be some really good speakers about how you really can capitalize on those opportunities and where you fit in in that event scheme so i guess if anybody wants to get in touch with me give me a call gardener adford at the milan shark council call reception and happy to set up a meeting and go further or go forward and yeah let 's be successful in the launch shower thank you for your time pete um and yeah best of luck everyone and don 't hesitate to give me a call _"

    "text": "so i want to apologize right from the outset because not only do you have to deal with an american accent you have to deal with a new york accent later on top of that you have to deal with a staten island accent so i will try to speak slowly i wish there were some subtitles so you could understand me more clearly but this is as new york as you 're gonna get well it 's wonderful to meet you okay may i go back to one you you mentioned the the the drought and in the reading that i did um it seems that you finally have gotten some relief though uh in the form of rain so things are turning around economically they are so we we had a drought that lasted about eight or nine years and the last 12 months during that 2019 period was probably the most severe but since early 2020 and definitely in the last 12 or 18 months we 've had really good rhine and because we 're mostly an agricultural based area that 's really important to us we a lot of horticultural products like onions garlic table grapes things like that so it has provided bit more stability for that and then for our broader agricultural area so we 're a large cattle producing area sheet producing area we grow irrigated cotton and other crops like barley and wheat and things like that so it 's definitely much improved and um a fairly positive economic future at the moment that 's great that 's great to hear and how are things how was i when i signed on i heard you addressing covet how did you guys endure the pandemic yeah it 's been quite different for australia because our prime minister closed the borders externally quite early in the pandemic um i think it was late february 2020 so we 've really been isolated as a country from a lot of the impacts that have occurred and you know have family in canada that 's obviously been quite impacted but in australia i think at the moment we have less than 90 cases in the entire country they are all in quarantine or in hospital because most are australia 's citizens and then their cases are picked up while they 're doing their two weeks quarantine coming in so generally speaking as a population we haven 't been hugely impacted i mean we have had lockdowns on occasion but they 've been very short and sharp and and mostly during 2020 um so for the last 12 months we 've almost lived you know fairly normally although we have other um you know precautions that are in place to protect us if there is a broader outbreak and we 've started heavily in our immunization program now so um lots of controversy about the vaccines and which ones should be used but um we are progressing i think slower than other countries because um i know the united states is well ahead of us with the vaccination program but because um we haven 't really had a huge outbreak here we 've allowed you know it 's been able to go slower and still get a great outcome how 's your experience been lucky it was um it 's it 's been rough uh last year the uh then it then it kind of changed into actually chasing staff we needed we needed uh nursing help uh because we just burned through uh the staff at both of our hospitals and because we 're the smallest borough we 're always the sort of last in line and because politically we tend to be more conservative than the rest of the city and there 's a mismatch in terms of our electoral power we 're always last so our struggle was similar to places all across america but it was probably a bit more acute because we are the sort of lasting line here um it 's and then the and then you know this is a lord help us this is a uh of the five boroughs this is the most pro-trump and the politics seeped into it in a big way there 's been uh we had at some points we led the city in terms of positivity rate of covid and there was a lot of reluctance to wear masks and real pushback against the messaging which was incredibly infuriating um we we 've done of the folks who who uh pushed back against social distancing were were first online to get vaccinated uh but it 's been a it 's been a it 's been a tough go uh lots of angst about our restaurants and commercial establishments lots of animosity directed towards governor cuomo and mayor de blasio and we had a few really ugly moments that made national news which were a real embarrassment outside a bar wanted to stay open and so it 's been it 's been a it 's been a heck of an experience for everyone but we 're hoping brighter days are not that far away in terms of continuing to open up the economy and and really get the vaccination penetration to the point where you can start you know doing away with the masks at least in public so how is the experience been for your businesses like you mentioned um obviously hospitality heavily impacted but you guys are also have a pretty good tourism industry don 't you so have your businesses fared or what is the outcome you know what 's the future tourism for new york city uh we were setting records every year every time you think you hit a number that that will be it more and more folks are coming so obviously that ended uh the the if you were to go to manhattan and and if you were familiar with manhattan and drive through it you would be really astounded at how many businesses were shuttered yeah right major major skyscrapers had and continue to have like 10 or 15 percent occupancy which is and a lot of that the fear is is not coming back because we 're going to go to a hybrid method there 's no there 's no no one 's going back five days a week to the office space uh and so restaurants take a hit from that you know obviously hotels take a hit from that uh bars take a hit from that um and they haven 't been allowed to open to full capacity yet we have lots of restaurants and bars locally on in the borough and and they they 've taken a hit um jen uh sammartino was staten island to kind of get a bigger piece of the overall city pie and they 've done fantastic work you know pushing a boulder up a hill every day and we were making some really good progress and now we have to reboot that which is which is going to be difficult um in some folks have been really unreasonable and on top of that um you know if they if they had their way they would they would have opened up everything right in the middle of the the outbreak so um but again jen i 'm sorry you want to add to that because i could talk to these ladies all day um just one just maybe one or two points one being that our our hotels actually did okay um believe it or not we had people that you know um we are sort of um the southernmost of new york state so we had a lot of people driving in from pennsylvania and new jersey um you know we have a lot of green space on staten island we have the green belt which is we have more hiking miles here than any place else in the city um so we actually in terms of the hotels they did pretty well in that people would take a weekend trip or a night away you know just because we all got sick of looking at the four walls of our homes you know our homes became the school it became work it was everything so they actually i 'm not saying that they 're rolling in it but they actually fared all rights um given you know the last year and a half um so that 's that that was really positive you know to see that um beyond that we are a little bit different in terms of some of the other boroughs so we do have that green space and we do have um access to water and things like that so um you know i felt good that maybe some some some friends you know from other locations came to visit and and they and some new people discovered staten island for the first time so um i 'm a very uh glasses think that there 's some some positive came out of of the situation yes um i was going to say i think that ended up for us actually being a real positive in the end i mean we 'd come out of those years of drought and our tourism figures were actually in decline so when covert hit we 'd already come up with a marketing plan to get people back so the initial lockdown was a bit of a shock but then after that as soon as they allowed everybody to start moving we had that same thing where everybody and especially because we have space people came west and we ended up having a really good year in the end and now we 're actually starting to beat our figures from 2017 which was our highest year we 'd had so it 's actually i 'm kind of in a way going it 's kind of nice that they 've kept the borders shut and um encouraging you know australians to travel within australia so as i said so that has worked really well so if you take the rest of the city or if you take someone from new york city and drop them in utica new york which is north in new york state or you take in new yorker from anywhere in the state and you drop him or her in georgia the differences are stark and quite evident um how and from how we talk about linguistic insecurity how we sound to our mannerisms to how hectic we are or slow so so tell me about where you 're from and and the turrets that were were fine found you how different they are you know australians who came from a different part of australia like how how what are the differences across the country oh i mean we certainly do have some differences but they 're not as acute as they would be you know in the states i mean there 's certain sort of you know you can tell if someone comes from south australia there 's certain things they say differently or something like that but on a whole probably the the biggest difference you 'd get would be from a it 's probably you know when you 're out west things are you know a bit slower you talk more slowly you probably stand further away from each other you know that kind of thing where you you get someone from the city who 's in a hurry who 's got places to go and things to do and so it 's more about trying to slow them down um i suppose traditionally um our travelers actually though the ones that we had been getting um they are more that kind of grey nomad older um generation who it 's um a very traditional thing here to you know buy an rv go do the big lap around australia and you know when you 're in retirement so that 's probably been our base and they do tend to come from so the melbourne and the sydney so the bigger cities they do pack up and leave and come here and obviously also brisbane one closest to us so um with clover though we 've had like a little bit of a change because um it was all those families off and travel i i had relatives who um they were all meant to go to italy last year and they 'd never been west before ever and they all individually came out and visited me and bought everybody and did a big trip around so it was kind of that um you know because you do get the grain no man 's who of course they 've spent all that money on their rv they want to you know penny pinch a little along the way so they don 't traditionally spend huge amounts of money but they will spend longer but when you um get this this other sort of family crowd that was coming through um that were younger they were spending more staying longer and and really getting out and truly experiencing things in places and doing something they 'd never done before the expression you use i want to make sure i have this correctly is gray nomad yes we call them a grey nomad yes did that not fit me please that 's what i wanted 250 days but this will tell you and it been since february 16 1999 that 's the day i was first elected to the city council and today i think is 8 101. yeah i have two that 's fantastic 253 days left in my tenure as an elected official and i and i 'm looking forward to the next chapter but i want to be a gray nomad yes get your army and go traveling around what do you guys call them in the united states in canada we call them the snow birds but yeah snowbirds are the seniors from new york and michigan right that would go down to florida or walmart yeah yeah but green yellowman is so cool yeah um lots of them yeah so so tell me about what with the letter uh said about the the contest that that you 're in and how can we help can we use our social media platform just to throw a bone to our friends and say from one saint george to the other we would love that i mean that was what it was all about it was it sort of came out a couple of other places that had been called george and i was thinking gosh there 's got to actually be a whole bunch of places called george that are around and you know as we said we 're we 're a small place with a very small population and it 's all about the public vote and getting people to vote for us so it was that let 's reach out to our mates around the world who come from a town or a place or a location called st george and just see where this leads to and sort of do that whole let 's extend a hand of friendship you know and i mean obviously we realize people can 't come visit us at this point in time from your locations but you never know when things open up maybe we can start doing that kind of reverse tourism you come here we go there we send people around but if you could yeah just encourage people to vote for us on through your social media that would be great so jen and colleen what can we twitter and just let the world know that we have some friends from looking at the date it 's the 22nd i mean colleen we could just blitz it all weekend long that would be great i know we actually um i i already spoke to uh lauren um about so i came i think i showed you the visit staten island that 's our tourism campaign and i gave you some of the the content i do have slides if you if you 're interested but you know we can always talk

of similarities with staten island because you know you talked about being green and being um get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and that 's kind of what that 's like the same messaging that we have as well because um people come to set now to get away from manhattan um from the hustle and bustle so i just really loved um that we really we have the same messaging along the same aspects and features so i just think it 's so great so who knows maybe we could get something across you know the rest of the city that goes a little viral and we could have a little fun with it and help you guys win um i really appreciate it like when kim came up with the idea of contacting all the saint george 's around the world we weren 't too sure how we know so to be honest we really appreciate the contact back of requests so was just totally stoked to hear a shout back from you guys and to have a meeting with you today is fantastic _"

    "text": "hi everybody its Linda Brennan here from echo Botanica you 've probably met me at one of the brisbane libraries sustainability sessions at your local library but today i 've brought you into my garden and let 's do a herb ramble to introduce you to some of my favorite subtropical herbs but you can also grow in enjoy from your garden the first one is going go ginger look at it it 's about 2 to 3 meters tall and it 's beautiful we grow it as a screening shrub but you know what you can eat the root of this I 've dug up some already to show you this root is absolutely delicious it has a spicy peppery lemony fragrance and flavor that adds the most delicious additional flavor to any Asian dish it 's pink you can see galangal ginger is typically pink and this is the part you eat and this is the part that you want to plant as well it also has an edible flower it 's autumn now but you can see that there are still some flower spikes left and these in sources like dipping sauces for Vietnamese rolls during the summertime it 's delicious you 'll love growing it let me now introduce you to another one that I think you will love to grow and that is stevia now this is stevia she looks a bit Haggard at this time of the year because it 's autumn and she 's had her flash of leaves in the summertime but stevia is the plant that produces the sweet leaf that 's the alternative to sugar the leaves on this plant are actually between 100 and 300 times sweeter than sugar and hmm it tastes great you can put the leaves straight into a cup of tea if you want but you see how she 's gone to flower now those dry flower heads are really worth keeping because all these little seeds are the ones that you 're going to resew in bring so cut the dry seed heads store them in a paper bag and their next spring you 'll be able to plant them in your garden and you 'll have as much Steve your as you want is culinary sage I love having it in the garden because I use it a lot in cooking although it has a history of being used for more than cooking during the Black Plague this was one of the herbs they used in for thieves vinegar to wash their hands with to get rid of the Black Plague it 's not amazing it 's quite an antiseptic but you know culinary sage is really affected by grasshoppers and caterpillars so after I 've dusted it with diatomaceous earth I often find that those insects disappear and I get some nice fresh growth before I cut it back so I cut it back in autumn or early winter and I just take off the parts that I want for the kitchen and the rest of it has a light trim back so it springs back again in springtime easy as that I love salads and for us we can 't always grow lettuce in the summertime because it 's just too hot so this is a herb that I love growing as a leaf in our salads and it 's called and I just want to show you how it grows because it 's very interesting Lebanese Chris grows by these long sort of stole any fresh roots under the ground and it 'll pop up through your garden you do have to limit where you want to put it because of the want to take over your garden but you 'll eat plenty of it and any that you don 't eat you can feed to the chickens so that 's Lebanese cress one growing very nearby is sorrel and this one is French sorrel I first had French sorrel when I visited France years ago this garden sorrel has a pleasant lemony flavor and I think you 're going to enjoy it in salads with that Lebanese crisps as well there is also a relation to this and it 's the sheep sorrel over on this side of the path the sheep sorrel has a tiny little leaf which tastes just as lemony and crisp as the French sorrel and it 's great any time of the year this makes a beautiful micro salad herb so this is part summer but it 's very moist and that 's where our topical and subtropical herbs thrive this one is tumeric and I grow tumeric for two reasons first of all the leaves are wonderful to wrap morsels of food in but secondly those orange roots these ones here I 've dug them up before these are the most wonderful flavors and things to having Curry 's spice mixes and these are a great thing to have fresh or dried throughout the year so normally you would wait to harvest this until the leaves die down completely once the leaves have died down they fill out the roots beautifully and it takes on that very vibrant orange color so turmeric is worth having whether it 's in the pot or in the garden but remember keep it moist growing next to the turmeric is another one in the same family it 's shorter and it looks just like tumeric but this one is called Chinese keys or crush I this is a spice or herb when it 's fresh that we use in Thai cooking and if you 've ever been the Thai dishes when you get home it 's because you 're missing out on this this root gives you that lemony fragrance that you only taste in that real Thai food so it is a relative of the gingers as you can see it looks like a very small turmeric but this is the section that you eat here and once again once the leaves have died down the roots become longer and fatter and that 's when you dig up the whole plant take off those small root peel them and either use them fresh frozen or dried and it 's called Chinese keys because evidently the look on those fingers when they 're mature resembles a very old Chinese door lock where the keys used to go in and slide around so Chinese keys or crack chai growing next to those in this equally warm spot is ginger and you can see the colony ginger has a short spiky leaf this is what it looks like under the ground you can start harvesting this back in January or February when you get the new ginger roots which it until this time of the year because I like to harvest as much as possible when it 's bond fat after the leaves have died down and then I use it fresh or I also slice it very thinly and put it into honey which preserves it in the fridge for you and any extra I peel and then pop through the blender and dry it off in the dehydrator so I 've got enough dried ginger to last me for the rest of the year the final plant that I 'd like to show you which is just a marvelous thing for growing in a subtropical herb garden is this one pandan leaf it 's got a beautiful fragrance especially in the afternoons when the Sun has been shining on it and it 's normally from those areas where in the Asian countries will grow by a flowing stream so that tells you that it likes to have wet roots this one has an irrigation head right at the back of it so it gets irrigated three times a week and I put some cow manure or mushroom it growing really lush and beautiful it always looks as good as this what I do with it is that I cut the leaves off and then these leaves I tie like this into a little knot and I drop that into a boiling pot of rice I flavors the rice deliciously so that 's about it for us today in the herb garden I hope you 've enjoyed your time I 'll see you next time _"

    "text": "hello I 'm in at McFarland today I 'm here to talk about pest control in the garden now we all know that pest control is a matter of balance we all have to put up with a few to bless and frankly I 'm happy to have two leaves if it gives me butterflies in the garden or if I 've got wonderful circular patches taken out of my rose leaves I know then that I 've got the wonderful leafcutter bee but in terms of other pests I may be not so generous it 's important however to recognize that a lot of pests and disease problems we have in the garden we actually cause ourselves and that 's because we haven 't done something that we should have done perhaps we haven 't watered or fertilized or even perhaps we 've overdone things so for example too much nitrogen on the garden being a bit careless with fertilizer application can mean that we get more pests like aphids that love that really soft growth so it is a question of balance but there are some things simple garden is balanced and you don 't have too many big outbreaks of pest problems when it comes to fruit trees one simple thing you can do is simply cover the trees themselves once the fruit has set now you can buy Exclusion netting like this and put that over after the fruit is set to protect it from a whole range of pests not only things like the dreaded fruit sucking moth or the fruit fly that attacks our fruit fruit sucking moths attacked the fruit at night and cause them to drop prematurely from the tree and of course fruit fly you open up the fruit and they 're all full of those terrible maggots inside so exclusion netting like this can help but if you don 't want to go to that expense you can also just use old curtain netting that you might be able to get from a secondhand store if it 's not possible to cover the entire tree then a technique that I like to use is simply to bag individual fruit and this is perfect for capsicum tomatoes and things like that a paper bag it can be a brown paper bag in this case this is a white blessing bag and pop it over the fruit secure it with a pig and that 's it all done it 's surprising how long these bags will last even if we get the rainfall the the bags will still survive and they 're cheap easy just bag the fruit that you really want to keep let 's move on to some other issues in the garden that are easy to control this is my really productive lemon but it 's suffering at the moment a little bit just from some damage on the leaves and that 's caused by the leaf minor moth now the MAS flies around at night it lays its eggs in the new growth and of course you get all these relief distortions it 's not too badly affected but it just looks a little bit ugly now I could just trim these off which is probably what I 'll do I could spray with an oil spray and I 'll tell you how to make that up shortly of a worry on an established plant like this I also while I 'm looking at the plant will try and check out to see if there are any and citrus gall wasps there so this doesn 't tend to have you many swelling is I can 't see any on it on the plant itself but if you find that you get swellings on the stems particularly on that new growth citrus gall wasp has been active and you need to prune those off before the wasps emerge but there are times when we have pest outbreaks that we need to control you don 't necessarily have to rush off to the shops you 'll often have things at home simple things in the cupboard or in the shed that you can actually use and I 'll just go through a few of them now we are putting the recipes of all of these preparations on the transcript so if you need to check any details please do so before you try and make the products up one thing you might have available is garlic so you can use something like one of these jars of garlic paste then that 's quite suitable as well so garlic is used actually as a repellent you need to put it on before the pests are active but you might know from experience that a particular plant that you have or a crop that you grow in the vegetable garden tends to get pests and so you can know from experience that it 's a good idea to put it on at certain times of year garlic also has mild antiseptic properties as well but really it 's repellant qualities what really gardeners admire so you 're going to need the equivalent of about three cloves of garlic or that 's about a tablespoon of a paste product like this a tablespoon of vegetable oil you 're going to need some soap and some water the idea is to soak the garlic in the oil overnight and so basically you 're making a garlic infused oil then you would strain that put it into a liter of water and then add a little bit of soap II just need either grated soap the equivalent of about a teaspoon for make that up and spray it fresh if you can because that 's when it 's going to be its most potent and some gardeners say this works effectively for them in repelling things like aphids and even sometimes ants another scale insects so that 's one that you could try if you find that the garlic perhaps isn 't doing its job you can move on to something stronger and that 's where something like a chilli spray comes in now chilli sprays are both an irritant an insect and also a stomach poison if they actually consume them you can use chilies that you 've grown yourself that you put in a blender with water and then get that concentrate or you can simply use ground fresh chiles so dried chilies or you can even cheat and if you 've got a bit of really hot sauce like Tabasco in the fridge you could actually use that so you 're going to need the equivalent of about a tablespoon of ground chilies or Tabasco sauce 2 liters water and again you this bar soap like this that you grate you can use that as well if you put that in a little bit of warm water so you 're going to combine those ingredients in 2 liters of water and shake them up and apply them straightaway with all of these sprays I try not to store them because they will deteriorate over time and of course with the chilli spray in particular there 's always you know a bit of a risk in leaving it around you want to really make sure that people don 't mistake it for something else and be careful yourself when you 're applying it in the garden because of course chilli is an irritant so you don 't want to get it in your eyes or on your hands on your skin at all make sure that you take the appropriate protection in speaking of soap the soap we add to make some of these products actually stick to plants and get better coverage over the leaves you can also make a simple soap spray now soap is a desiccant that is it breaks of an insect and you can use just bar soap so a really old-fashioned pure soap and I tend to grate this just on a fine grater and you 'll find that then that will dissolve quite readily in warm water and then you can expand it out just by using cold water but you can also use really simple dishwashing liquid so as long as it 's something that 's reasonably pure doesn 't have too many enzymes in it you know it 's not meant to remove too much grease then that 's going to be a perfect product so your soap sprays I tend to just make the map as if I was going to wash an item of clothing and that 's about the right stage that you can spray them onto plants they 're really good for things like easy pests like aphids even works on caterpillars very often you can use them on scale insects as well but remember with all of these products they 're safe to use but you do need to reapply them on a regular basis so it might be week with something like a soap spray to bring a real pest under control if the soap doesn 't work for you again you can move on to something stronger and that 's when we go to oil sprays now oil sprays where the soap desiccates the insect the oil spray suffocates it so you need to bring the oil in contact with the insect and you 're going to need to makeup concentrate so that 's half a liter of oil and half a cup I you is just dishwashing liquid or you could use any other liquid soap so that makes you a concentrate and then you dilute that down and you 'll only need one tablespoon per liter of water this will store for a while but again I do like to try and make it up as fresh as I possibly can and not store it for long periods in the sprayer my favorite spray of all I must say is this one here which is molasses now molasses is easy to buy from the supermarket but it 's much much cheaper from the produce store 's the third stage in the sugar production process and so blackstrap molasses is very concentrated and it also has quite a lot of nutrition in it as well it 's really easy to make up you 're going to need 1 tablespoon of blackstrap molasses in a liter of water and again you 'll need that soap to make it stick so we 're just going to use that teaspoon of liquid soap or if you grated soap make that up spray it onto your plants it works magic on things like caterpillars eating everything in your garden if you 've got cut worms that come up from the soil at the night and in the night and chew things off at ground level in your vegetable garden this is the spray that you need it 's also quite good some people say for repelling possums so you could try that but don 't store it for long periods of time because it will ferment in your sprayer and suddenly your sprayer will be getting better and better as it ferments so use it within a couple of days and drench your soil if you find that you 've got some nematodes that are causing problems or any other coolgrub larvae for example so the lover of beetles that are actually eating the roots of your plant you can drench this through and if you 've got those dreadful lily caterpillars that eat all out your bulbs then use the molasses drench on a regular basis now of course if your pest is bigger if you 've got things like possums and we all do have to share our gardens with insects and other wildlife but if possums are making a mess of your garden then here 's my suggestion buy a bag of carrots and put them out for the possum to eat after all they 've got to eat something and those plans that you really really want to protect you simply need to spray them with oil of cloves so six drops per liter oil of cloves in in water sprayed onto your plants and do that every week or you can do it on fence lines or boundaries but you must do it every week thought for them and leave some plants for them to eat or provide an alternative food source so there you go balancing the garden is easy to achieve next time I 'll be back telling you how to deal with disease problems in you _"

    "text": "welcome back to library my name is Beck and my name is Nana and today we 're going to be doing another library laugh so today our experiment that we 're doing it is a level in yeah so for today 's experiment you 're going to need some vegetable oil you 're going to need some water some food colors so you can pick whatever color you like and then you 'll need your parents help this one as well because our last ingredient is alka-seltzer or Esper clear ok guys so in your jar or your bottle you will pour some oil but so we want to fill it about three-quarters of the way it 's about there so then you need your water you want to fill that the rest of the way almost okay so now you want to do is add about five or six drops of food coloring so we 've chosen blue or else okay and then the next part is the fun part you 've got to get your alka-seltzer tablet so you can use a couple the more you use the so what happens is the oil and the water don 't mix so if you try and check out the bottle but oil will break up into small droplets but it won 't mix for water and when you pull the water into the bottle with the oil the water sinks to the bottom and the oil floats to the top so the oil flows it 's because the water is heavier and it 's more dense than the oil and the alka-seltzer tablet it reacts with the water to make carbon dioxide gas so the bubbles attach themselves to the colored water and cause them to float to the surface when the bubbles pop the color syncs back to the bottom and you know you love a link I 'm gonna use a funnel for my audio cuz I 'm a bit clumsy about 4 of the way set three corners you know me wetting it good thank you might help right I know the way what 's next nearly at the top that should do some read more read more okay get out alka-seltzer really broken the map sure that you dispose of your oil in a plastic bottle don 't keep it down the drain thanks guys so I hope you all had a good time making our lava lamps and we 'll see you again next time _"

    "text": "well good evening ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for coming this evening to City Hall so the Lord Mayor 's writers in residence program the opportunity to meet Francis whiting Wow and I want to acknowledge Kate Jones as well who 's here Minister Kate Jones my wife Nina the Lady Mayoress but importantly each and every one of you for being here the the Lord Mayor 's writers in residence program started off in 2012 and it 's been such a well-loved thing that happens now across many of the Brisbane City libraries right across the city Brisbane residents certainly passionate about reading they 're passionate about their libraries but the opportunity to meet the authors to hear the author 's perspective on what they 've written to ask them questions and also afterwards to get the book signed is something that so many Brisbane residents have loved and appreciated we 've had more than 50,000 people over the years participate in these programs and 10,000 of them just last year alone but tonight is very special because we have two on stage two genuine Brisbane local it that that that murmur in the crowd that 's a good thing that 's good that 's a good sign so here we 're here tonight to meet Francis whiting and Nina and I had the opportunity to meet Francis whiting earlier this year one of my staff members came in and said Francis would like to do a profile piece on you and this is shortly after became Lord me and interestingly for most people that would be like fantastic I was petrified absolutely petrified I was so nervous and because answer says literally to me being a legend and someone that I read and I 've read all the way through well not all the way through my life but through much of my life and just as just a part of life where you 'd probably don 't expect to meet them in person and you certainly don 't expect them to be writing something on you there 's a saying that you may have heard people may forget what you said but they will never forget how you made them feel and so I was we Matt met Frances the one thing that became instantly clear is she is the kind of person that loves people gets people she loves them for how unique they are and appreciates the unique nature in every one of us but most importantly she makes people feel instantly at ease she is a legend but when you meet her instantly you feel at ease and you feel like you 've known her forever and so it was an incredible experience sitting down with her asking lots of questions delving into your life story basically and then seeing the finished product and I was literally amazed because I thought there 's nothing really that interesting about my life why would anyone want to read about it it 's pretty boring and ordinary yet when I rushed out to see the finished product I thought how how did she make it sound so interesting how did she weave the story together and that just goes to show the the incredible talent and skill that she has now we 've seen just recently the launch of her new book the the best list for December and I am looking forward to sinking my teeth into that book when I get a break over Christmas so I am NOT going to give you a review I 'm not going to tell you what it 's all about it 's coming next with the the conversation that we 're about to have but what I will say though is Julie who has worked with me now for 14 years in the office when we got sent a copy before she gave me that copy she took it home and read it straight away and I asked her what did you think and the first thing she said was it was a beautiful story it was a feel-good story and it was a story about a lot of miscommunication and misconception and it had an interesting twist in it as well which we all love so the the the take away thing from all of this was that the best kind of beautiful is the real person behind all of the misconceptions and I guess that was Julie 's take so Julie who works that will have a different take on what it was all about but that was her take and it was a thoroughly enjoyable read so like I said I 'm looking forward to reading myself over Christmas but you are all here to hear from the legend herself and you all know her incredible history the incredible career that she 's had writing each weekend and I think I understand that she is the longest-running columnist in Australia at least 23 years in a row writing a weekly column but if that wasn 't enough she 's writing books she 's got all of these side projects and I could only imagine the assistance the determination and the talent it takes to write a single book but to write many books throughout several books is just an incredible thing as I mentioned before Frances will be joined by her good friend and colleague and another truly a legend Matthew Condon now Matthew has been a journalist for more than 30 years and for almost a decade has been investigating the fascinating topic of crime and corruption in Queensland as we know and he did that for over three years and had exclusive access to the Lewes private papers that research resulted in the best-selling true crime trilogy three crooked kings Jackson Jokers and all fall down okay see if hands who 's read those books yeah a few of you okay if you haven 't it 's time to go out and get them but he has also had an incredible career over a significant period of time culminating this year when he was awarded a medal of the Order of Australia for his services to the community ladies and gentlemen can you please join me in welcoming to the stage francis whiting and Matthew Condon [Applause] thank you good evening that wasn 't me haha it 's so nice to be called a legend I know it 's sort of shorthand for old but it 's nice it 's very nice I 'll take it that was not really wonderful yeah hey thank you so much I 'm really thrilled to be here with my great friend Francis whiting and especially in this incredible building for a number of reasons Francis Oh in my annual school Christmas concert for some reason I was dressed as a convict and I sang a la the st. Claire family I sang bye-bye blackbird no one seems to love or understand me and all the hard luck stories they keep handing me bye-bye blackbird I still don 't know what it means Francis I love that song I still would have seen it and secondly why I 'm excited is I 've adored Francis 's riding and have worked now for many many years before I even met her and became friends with her as a newspaper columnist as a feature writer and now especially as a novelist with her incredible debut if you haven 't read it you must read it walking on trampolines and now this brilliant new book the best kind of beautiful I was just saying to Francis behind the stage and we 'll come to this in in our interview but in just two books she 's managed to carve a very unique niche for herself in the literary landscape it 's difficult to pinpoint what it is I and there 's enormous humor and it 's a combination of those things which make it very unique but we 'll discuss that and there 's a close colleague of Francis 's for many years of the career mail I have been privileged to be a part of that intense agony and ecstasy that is involved with the creation of novels I 've actually had a ringside seat to Francis 's enduring pain so and you know make no mistake it is no easy thing writing a novel in fact my friend the novelist caramel bird said writing is harder than life and sometimes I think she 's right now sometimes Franny would come to work in the grip of some terrible self-doubt or in a panic over a deadline or fretting over a plot twist and sometimes you 'd come up to her with an urgent piece of gossip which you do in newspaper offices and you could see that she was looking at you and nodding her head at appropriate moments but that she just wasn 't quite there the eyes were slightly glazed and you knew she a Manhattan cocktail Albert flowers riders recognized when other riders are on the journey of the novel once this is a true story Franny strode purposefully from her desk at cue we can to the Korean melted the office kitchenette which is quite a significant distance where I was standing and that she stood facing the sink turned to me and said what am I doing here and strode straight back to her desk that is a novelist at work and with the best kind of beautiful Frances has confirmed that she 's a very fine novelist are the two things that have made her one of the country 's best columnist sand feature writers are the same qualities to my mind that have elevated her fiction one there is always a genuine heart and soul in Francis 's work and to achieve that you have to have a genuine heart and soul yourself you then need the courage to that on paper without filter or ego and the second point is that Fran is one of those few writers who can successfully achieve the extremely difficult art of balancing you can be laughing out loud in the first half of a sentence and feel a tear welling in your eye by the end of the same sentence that is an extremely difficult thing to do in writing it is a high-wire act and the slightest misstep can send the prose in too fast or sentimentality and it is this I think that makes friends work so attractive and satisfying and memorable and she 's done that again in spades in her new book so Franny sorry for that long and legendary introduction thank you thank you and use everything you said in a recent interview about this book that the two primary characters Florence st. Claire and Albert flowers and this is your quote there is a sense that we are becoming less kind to each other and that the things that divide us are growing stronger than the things that unite us I don 't believe that 's true but it 's very easy in this climate to fear that it is so through Florence and Albert so flawed so funny and awkward at times I wanted to in us could you just elaborate on that Thank You Manny it was absolutely because I do think there is a sense for all sorts of reasons social media being one of them the political climate that we are some of us behaving towards each other in a less kindly manner and that 's the sense but when I meet people and I 'm sure the same with you and Matt now works for the Australian and writes stupendous features through my job and through the column because a lot of people approached me at the supermarket usually what I 'm looking my absolute worst but we get past that my experience is that most people are really really good as in they 're kind they 're lovely they 're open to experiences they 're very happy to be generous with you and tell you you know their stories and I don 't think we 're seeing enough of that in the general landscape so when I wrote best kind of beautiful in my head I really really wanted to celebrate most people I meet who are funny who are arts they 're here on earth to celebrate it and just be kind to one another and I think that 's the norm I don 't think that 's the exception at all do you do you think that 's become old-fashioned a little yeah and one of the reviews of this book by a critic on I 've had killed actually I 'm not that nice I said it was a very old-fashioned book and I don 't know it probably has a I don 't mind a bit of old I think I just want to tell you the truth I think that 's a compliment and as Eugene O 'Neill said of critics I love every bone in their head I 've never heard that you 've had some terrific reviews of this book they 'll notice quote from one the book is wittily told with the lightness that only a skilled writer herself warmed by a love of humanity and cognizant of the frailty of humankind could supply while writing about human foibles and the pleasant things that people do or think whiting retains a deafness upon or talked down to the word to describe her writing is genuine I really like that word to describe your work genuine I think you do that with your column and you 've done it for many years you bring an honesty and genuineness to your work and now that 's magnified in your novels but what is it about your work that they can attract that sort of disruption i I 'm not sure about the novel writing but to say for example the column I would agree with you I think it is genuine if if you were to read my column you know me and I would say that I would hope that I would always be genuine because I can 't see the sense in being anything else and every single time I have tried to adopt perhaps a different character at work if maybe I feel I 'm too loud or a bit missing or what all of those things it never works out well and I can 't I can 't sustain it I can 't give it up so I think that the same I love that your messy though you can 't see a desk at work oh my but to fit in with what you said earlier are we losing communally are we losing a genuineness about ourselves I do worry to tell you the truth about social media and Instagram and Facebook and particularly I guess for teenagers I think it is a very easy trap to fall into and I think it 's very seductive and I actually know that because I 'm not a social media person naturally but with this book because of the way the world is changing I 've had to be far more active on Instagram and Facebook than I really ever have been and I find myself at night and now and I 'm gonna stop instead of reading I 'm scrolling through other people 's Facebook lives and Instagram excuse me and I can recognize how unhealthy it is because I 've never ever bought into it but at the moment I am in that world and I can tell with my own reactions you know seeing people 's lives and party number one everyone looks great they look great the kids are great and their kids achievements you know is wonderful but it does this terrible comparison you know there 's that um wasn 't more my dad used to say to me never compare and I think that 's what it 's done it 's created a culture of comparison which I don 't think is healthy I feel a column coming on said why I was at an airport two years ago Regional Airport and they were accounted then there were 17 people waiting for the plane including Warren inch the politician every single one of them was on their phone yeah staring up there it 's really I did actually write a column once about a moment that struck me I was driving home from the Curia and I was coming along Petrie Terrace and I was driving past girls grandma and boys grandma and as I was driving past girls grandma is end-of-school every single kid was waiting and they 're all on their phones and then there was this one girl hanging upside down by good all you know tucked in which we have to do it was one of the best things I 've ever seen she 's just you know swinging away and I should read a column about it because it was lovely let 's go to the origins of this story because I remember when you first started talking about your second novel that it was you doing a drama set around a dinner party or something yeah you suddenly there 's this beautiful book what happened I can 't say you were from memory and I actually remember this quite well max with Matt was editor of key weekend at this stage and you and I were talking and I said I 've had this idea for a novel and I think we were talking about maybe how do you come up with ideas was a number one I was seeing a movie at the Chanel maybe two years prior and you know those credit sort of just endless at the end I don 't know why I stayed for them but something like a lighting technician or some way thought that 's how I 'm gonna write my next book about well well I know because I thought what did I was just like that 's it that 's the name so there was that and then I said to you and I remember this I don 't you do I said I 'm going to do a novel about a dinner party and I want to give too much worried about this book and it 's going to be about someone who has double life and I 'm going to call it the invitation that 's right yeah yeah that was that that was the the seedling and you said you loved it and initially you said it 's all coming back to me now we said I think was you why not make the actual cover an invitation do you remember the truth yeah but that didn 't happen no I did it so how how did those little seeds grow well well well from that so Albert flowers I wanted to be a good man and I wanted to write a book where the male character particularly in women 's fiction it 's very female centered so I knew that I wanted to have a man in it that was you know an equal an equal role and I wanted him to be a good man because again I have a lot of good man in my life you know my father was a good man my husband was a good man my mates who are men are good men so there was that and Florence I 'm not quite sure where she came from but I think the idea Ferb 's the plot was I spent so much time at work as do you and there are so many characters at work and I was thinking one day about how you 've sort of got your work game face and then you 've got your real face when you leave work so I wanted to write a novel about people who were in a work environment that perhaps weren 't showing who they really were fantastic fantastic now please talk about the st. Claire family they are immensely loveable but they 're they 're a well I always have to preface this particularly if there 's any members of my own family in the audience when I was a kid I grew up in injure killing and I had a very suburban childhood which is not to say it was a bad childhood it was just pretty kind of everyday went to school came home played watched countdown that kind of life but every now and again I would get these glimpses of people that were different and there was a family in our neighborhood who were very musical and I was absolutely fascinated by them and I loved to go to their house because it was very different from my house in that it was always full of music it was always full of life the father would be playing the trumpet the mother would be on the piano the kids would be dancing in the lounge room and I just I think as a kid I just I kind of you and for that and the second family my older sister knew a family in Brisbane who are real family and they were was like a musical director up at the Mount kusa and they 're all very musical no staying together and they actually had one hit signal cool gingerbread man and again I 'd go with they were like foreign objects to me and I loved to be around them because they were so different from me and my family and they just had this hint of glamour but mostly the other and you 're attracted to that very desperate there are two other there are two presiding presences in this book it 's the natural world and music mm-hmm what role do they play in your actual life well I love both dearly the natural world I really don 't know a lot about knowledge wise but I love to walk in the Australian bush now that makes me sound like I 'm out tricking in the Australian bush on weekends or not I 'm actually talking specifically around the edge the gap but it is still night of less Australis there are bushes and I just I love that I love it I love this smell of the Youkilis high cow that 's gross I wish I was but I really I love it and I find it very calming and I love the smell to Goucher rain so when I wrote this it was very important to me to place them in that Australian bush landscape and because I don 't have a general knowledge I really don 't I would walk through the bush and I would do two things I would use a application my phone called plants actors when you take a photo and then it tells you what player to do so I 'll quickly write that down and then I spoke to Claire Bacall who 's there ABC radio gardening person and it also works for you magazine and I just plans to her and then she would tell me what it is and then towards the end of the writing I read out to her a couple of things I 'd written specifically about plants that I 'd basically gotten from googling just to check it was right and she said it was and one of the greatest compliments I 've been signing a man came up to me and told me he used to be the curator at I don 't think they exist anymore the old Sunnybank gardens and he said to me I can tell you really know your place I think yes yes I do I get a sense only because they 're so warmly drawn that you you become attached very attached to your characters I mean mr. and mrs. st. Clair extraordinary characters did you base them I know it 's an obvious question but you know mrs. st. Claire with the cucumbers on her eyes and the creamin and the jazz legend father I 'm not sure exactly where they came from but Amanda st. Clair I love I 'm quite attached to her because at her heart she 's a mother and she 's a working mother but she has this whole other kind of public persona and probably in a way I can relate to that not to suggest that I 'm a glamorous jazz singer but I love that she has this kind of wild life where she has to be a 's for love so I liked that and Lucas st. Clair is just a bit naughty isn 't he he 's a bit dashing at a bit of a rake and I don 't know where that comes from I think every single woman in the world goes through a very brief thank God stage where she 's attracted to the bad boys so maybe maybe it came from that I 'm not sure Oh tell us more friends no getting quite so badly but I 'm just saying there is an element of that that women find quite attractive I think but but despite his bad-boy reputation his wife is still well leading up to his death I don 't want to ruin the plot for the book still willing to forgive and madly in love with him and and treasures their relationship and I think that 's very possible I know and you know and probably everyone here knows what goes into a marriage or a long partnership you know is that old saying no one knows what goes on inside of marriage or except the people in forgive all sorts of things during a marriage big and small on both sides and you do it for all sorts of reasons you didn 't do it for the kids you do it for the family unit and you do it because there is always something of who you were when you first met and why you came together in the first place I mean if you 're lucky and even in infidelity and I 've seen it you know with friends of mine even when that occurs as deeply as it hurts I have seen people forgive and understand for the bigger picture mm okay do you sing are you a singer now I think no I think to myself at home but I don 't sing sing although literally I have been seen with another girl Andrea Tucker and so just just the two of us in her in her house in her garage just for fun and I 've loved it her name is Andrea and my name is Frances and we have decided that when we launch ourselves on the general public we are going about this okay no one is ever go to publicly here in the book Albert describes a girl he meets at a bar and he says quote something about her face was slightly off-kilter making her he thought the best kind of beautiful the almost kind this notion of the best kind of beautiful just take us behind that how you came up with that I again I would say because the notion of what is beautiful has become amplified the last decade very much so you have a daughter same age as my daughter I don 't sell it would concern you many what they 're being thrown out being told constantly what is beautiful and what is not and there 's this ideal and you know girls I 'm sure men too but I think more to girls you know young girls getting all sorts of procedures done really early and I think this idea of this is what 's beautiful and this is what you need to strive for it 's such a bad self to all of us because again we all know when we meet to it 's it 's never because you know they 're ridiculously good-looking for sometimes it is but I 'm just saying you know what we find beautiful and the people we love are there all sorts of different things it could just be a feature it could just be their eyes it could be their laugh it could be how funny they are all of those things and that ideal of beauty of this crazy level of beauty so few people look like that that it 's an impossible bar to strive for and when Florence and Albert it is only when they show their true souls to each other did they find each other beautiful because that 's what it 's all about isn 't it mmm that 's what 's beautiful when someone shows you who they are that is very beautiful moment in both of your novels you write really interestingly about fathers hmm and I 'd like you to tell us a little bit about the whiting family I 'm hoping that they were like the Von Trapps but I guess that won 't happen this is why Matthew is such a good writer an interview I think he picks up on these things so my dad Paul whiting he was very eccentric in fact when I say that we have a typical suburban childhood we did bar one factor and that was my dad and he wasn 't wildly eccentric but he kind of stood out in that neighborhood of men he wasn 't like in what way when he wasn 't like the dad that did the barbecue with the boys he wasn 't at all sports forward sporty he was a great reader like my main memory of dad is seeing him at the kitchen table with his thick black glasses on smoking his head off surrounded by books and he was at the water driver he did right he wrote lots I 've got some of his plays and prose but in there never happened for him I don 't think he ever actually tried but he was eccentric and I can only say this with love so please don 't think I 'm being mean to him because I 'm years before he died and we never realized he had us because because he was a little bit eccentric so for a long time we were just like oh no he wasn 't but he was great because he was very okay I can remember being woken up in the dead of the night by my father and him dragging me into the back yard in my pajamas to show me an owl in the tree he would dance and sing but mostly I think it was his great love of language that I remember and he has found my way he found his way into my books and with walking on trampolines there are two male characters in that Harry and the other one whose names I 've temporarily forgotten Harry and the other fellow and it was only after I had finished writing it and it had been out for quite some time that I realized that if you took this man with no name and this man Harry and put them together they made my father I didn 't know when I was writing them separately well but very strange numerical connection that you have with your late father okay can you share that story because it is gives me the chills just asking you I remember telling you at work the most recent yeah okay so this is a strange tale but is true so we grew up at number 34 Clarence Road intercooling and I cannot tell you how much my father loved that house he talked about how much he loved that house incessantly and as a big old wooden Queenslander with the mango tree and macadamia tree a mulberry tree you was very Queensland upbringing and we lived their whole lives we never moved and dad used to always just call the house number 34 so instead of saying are we going home now or I 'll meet you at home he would say I may be number 34 I 'll see you at number 34 and when he died the number 34 since then has cropped up in my life with such regularity and also my sister Louise that it is impossible to not think it must be my dad because not up in very unusual and strange places where it should not be so everything from every time I check into a hotel room is usually number 34 or ends in them 34 or just so many and the truth at stand out and the one that I told Matthew about it work and completely freaked him out because I was freaked out was once at my mother 's house my niece who was only 2 at the time we were all in the backyard and she just walked over to the garden and she picked up a piece of paper and it was about this big and she brought it over to me and I opened it up and number 34 was written on it but then at work I was in the female bathroom and I wash my hands this is only what many a year ago yeah and I wash my hands and I went to the towel and I pull down the towel and into my hands came a little piece of paper with a number 34 written on it chills oh my goodness say hi to it 's ridiculous but it 's true that 's hi dad thank you that 's amazing well that 's that 's that story right there goodness when everyone leaves it 's not the only thing they 'll talk about is number 30 I know thank you that 's that 's what I mean it turns out with regularity but in very unusual circumstances incredible he was lovely moving on from the city okay the Australian wrote about your book thus Widing is more interested in soothing the saw harder than agitating over past misdeeds and indiscretions aside from its easy wit and humor there is a tenderness to the book as the author extends her administration 's to all those in need now should you have been a nun I think Francis now st. John 's man I think you know me better than that I would have been a terrible nun and I am as equally I am done terrible things we all have I 'm not do you know once at the paper Oh Rita sent me a letter and it was addressed to Francis in quotes Pamela nun no no but I mean that comment review does go to in all seriousness to the heart of your work as I see it the quality of genuine there 's that word again tenderness and the appearance that this is and I mean this an absolutely the best possible way that it is almost today an old-fashioned notion that that of care of trying to help others of recognizing others pain that is in your books and I think that 's a great thing I would say I am definitely a naturally empathetic person and I think that when you 're a journalist or a feature writer that 's important I think I think the best feature writers are you are but you 've never become cynical which is a very easy thing to become as a journalist when you see what you see which is not what normal people get to see yes but would you not also say and your work has been you deal far more with the darker side of life than I ever have but would you not say Maddie that in even in in amongst all that darkness I 'm presuming here that you would have met people who were absolutely wonderful and beautiful people absolutely and who have carried a lot of pain in their lives or seen things that no one should see and yet go on and are also not too jaded or cynical or I mean I know you would have also met many many damaged people but I think the human condition is naturally inclined more towards wanting to be kind to each other then wanting to be the other what I love too about the st. Clair 's is that they they all think they 're getting away with secrets but sort of everyone knows yeah and they laugh about death and you know it 's just that classic Australian family sort of ethos where they 're all sort of piled into life together and yeah people make mistakes and then well that 's okay we all make mistakes and it 's just a lovely chaotic the base of it is genuine love and I think for me the part I liked writing about that particular family a family like no one can tease you like members of your own family can 't ease you because they know you so well and they know your uncle is he 'll and you know I think thank you for saying it feels Australia because I wanted that I think one of the nicest things about being Australian is that really one of the greatest ways that we show affection towards each other is by giving each other a hard time that 's how we show love often you know if you 're really comfortable with someone you can say terrible things to them in in in love and fondness you 're gonna be signing books after this right I am okay so I want to read this passage from the book because it 's very pertinent in the novel there 's a writer called Kat Morrison oh yeah who 's launching her new book in a bookshop and she whispers to Albert I need to get out of here she jerked her head towards the glass front door not that way she said that 's where they are who beginning cat said she could write her books and essays and people were happy just to read them yeah but now people wanted to get beneath the words they wanted to meet the person who wrote them they wanted to know how she wrote them when she wrote them and it was not she said her natural inclination to tell them so will you be comfortable signing haha yes I I she liked that part of meeting readers and you know I like that I really liked our part but I 've also interviewed many authors it 's not their natural inclination and it 's hard for them to be on you know when you interview authors sometimes it 's hard work because authors by their very nature solitary people you know these are people that spend most of their working time completely by themselves and there 's a reason many of us are attracted to that because I would say that most authors are a real mix of introvert and extrovert but we love to be by ourselves writing but when the time comes we can do the other if I 'm wrong walking on trampolines you took a bit a fair bit from your actual personal life and experience and family and so on so forth how did you cope with this the cliche of the nightmare second novel it 's a cliche because it 's true the the the first novel can pour out of virtually anybody yeah your first and perhaps only book yeah then the bridge to the second novel is a very difficult one how did you manage it well in all honesty I do remember being at home one day and thinking to myself you know what I am gonna be one of those people that just writes one book and I 'm absolutely fine with that I remember thinking I don 't necessarily want that to be the case but that is going to be the case I 'm gonna be a one book person and I need to be very happy with that achievement and I had kind of come to a place of acceptance but then quite soon afterwards you know the character demand to be rich so it just would say that the difficult second album or novel syndrome is alive and well but I didn 't feel it so much because walking on trampoline was successful but it wasn 't mega best-seller international and as much as I would have loved that to be I mean it was successful by any count but it wasn 't you know it wasn 't and I think had I had that it would 've been much harder because I reckoned that must be extremely hard if your first book if expectations are up here I think that must be extremely hard to think oh my god the whole world world is waiting so I was actually pretty comfortable with with that I mean I loved your first book absolutely adored oh yeah this book though technically he says a different planet from and it 's you know as as writers it 's a nightmare because you 're constantly trying to pick apart other people 's works how did she make that work I 'm gonna work that out so you pull you expose the infrastructure to yourself mm-hmm how did you stopped trying to learn the tricks and I love it when you read someone else 's work and a sentence just stops you in your tracks mmm I love that when you go oh that 's fantastic I love that feeling I don 't think you could have written correct me if I 'm wrong again I don 't think you could have written this book when you were say 30 not tell us why because I think you do get better as a writer look I even know with the column I look back on columns when I first started and every now and again I 'll come across one or read one and I 'm genuinely embarrassed I can 't believe it I think that is a that 's so bad and I think that we 're lucky man in that because of feature writing being long-form we get to practice our craft every single day and I just think you get I think it 's like anything it 's almost like a muscle memory isn 't it that I just think you get better at it the and your strengths are so you play to them more and I don 't think at 30 I would have had enough life experience anyway to write that sort of book about families and look because I was you know pretty silly at 30 really when I come to thinking you must have asked yourself over the years because it 's been 25 years 25 so you must have asked yourself with about the column mmm-hmm why it 's work why does it keep working yes what is it about your writing that can sustain that 's an a phenomenal relationship with a readership I don 't know and I genuinely don 't know except that I have always it 's I don 't think about it too much ever I don 't try and analyze it I don 't let it become big in my head because I think if I stopped to become I think if I stop to think my god this columns been going for so long I think it would completely throw me so I treat every week as a week in itself and I fiddle with it too much and I don 't know why I don 't know why Reed is a lot love it the way they do except that I think that there is something in that writing that makes them feel included beautiful novel number three yes so yes so I have signed with Pan Macmillan for two more books and my lovely pad Macmillan publishers Charlotte is here tonight so I 'm going to say I starfish and I 'm really really quite a long way no I know I know exactly what it 's going to be which is nice because I you don 't always get that arrive but I was going to end or anything but I know what it 's going to be about and it 's going to be send it around a literary scandal cuz I lovely very schedule I want you to publish it and block her ears because you went on leave right right was it this book or put a portion of base long service and I remember when you came back to work and I said so how far about 8,000 words I think he 'd been off for six months but you did get it done I did everyone does it differently maybe how do you do it Matty like how what 's your are you we won 't need to go into that but are you are you are you discipline do you oh you have to be yeah you want you know that yeah well I 'm a bit stop start yeah but a you just head down it 's changed over the year I mean I get I guess the thing to think the big thing is obvious as it sounds is that you have to finish something first if you can go back reshape remould yes just get it yeah yeah the draft done agreed that 's a great journey absolutely and learning to let go of that 's not perfect yeah so what you 've done 1500 words of the new book or I have done many I know you were very very self-effacing Francis you don 't like to push your own Barrow you 've got enormous talents but you you 're writer who 's had such incredible success but my question is do you would you now call yourself a novelist yes great and Matthew is acknowledged in the back of my book both books because this is very true and so when I I was at the firm my mouth for years as a columnist and a writer but when I came over to Kew weekend it was like going from the it was it was just the big leagues so there was Matthew condom Trent Dalton Matty finds Clinton you know these were writers that I so I was pretty nervous to tell you the truth and I always doubted myself as a writer because I had always been put in that box as a columnist only because the column is very double-edged sword on the one part of success is great but on the other half people don 't that 's what they see you as they don 't know that you can do other stuff and Matthew was really good at encouraging me and making me feel like I have it 's here sorry that I deserve did have this self-doubt and when I was editor at the magazine I sent her we came up with an idea to do a story on the dairy industry this is a long time ago and the price of milk and what how far off and we needed to tell the full story of that and Francis went out onto the land and she spoke to these farming families and she came back and she wrote the most brilliant feature and I read it and thought where did this come from it 's obviously been there but you never had the outlet know to really bloom and blossom as a rider 100% so it was always there you just needed to shine yeah and now you 're doing it as a novelist we sound like a pair of old legends are we are we having at all are we having are we having questions to questions okay do we have microphones oh thank you let us know about the editing process I 'm wondering which editors did you choose and how you work through until you to publish your work the rewrite isn 't it when you 're editing it and so when you 're fortunate enough to have a publishing company they have in-house editors so at Pan Macmillan I had some really good in-house editors including a lady called Julia Stiles is brilliant and has edited some really big books and Brienne Collins as well and that 's one really good thing I think to learn as a writer when you have to let your ego go and it comes back with the red marks and the question mark hundreds of them yeah it kind of first you go that night round more most times there right for example in this book I had an additional hole two things right at the end which everyone at pound Macmillan said to me they 've got to go they 've gotta go and I fought I fought for them and in the end I acquiesced and now when I see the book how it 's written I am so glad I did because it would have been superfluous and milking milking the emotional factor too hard yeah I 'm sorry right I know it 's annoying isn 't it and I always ask for the hardest toughest editor oh yeah they 're always right yep well they 've read so many so they know that 's their job that 's their job zactly I know an interesting story Chris guys didn 't get away he was led away would you be interested in writing on that Chris case didn 't get away he was little way led away I 'm sorry I don 't this is this is a true life story you know I 'm not sure how to answer but I would say that if you I would say this if you do know that story and it 's genuine and it 's bonafide and you have new information then you should 100% write down what you know and then try and get someone to look at us or indeed if you are a writer that you all you want to be a writer I would go the Queensland writers centre and let them help you whip it into shape and ifs case is actually still alive could of the century that 's that would be quite something just finally Frances wedding thank you thank you Matt a magnificent book thank you Matt and you will laugh and you will cry thank you thank you thank you so much Frances

    "text": "hi everyone I 'm Lucy from curbside library and today I 'm going to be showing you a demonstration of our 3d robots to print up so first of all I 'm just going to explain how you create your designs for the 3d printer so the library we use a program called tinker cut it 's a free program that you can use army described it on the internet so what you do is you create your create your designs on tinker cuts so today what we 're using is a design that we 've created previously which is a little key ring it 's called book lover so what I 've done is I 've downloaded the design onto the computer and then what we do want to download the design is you go into the program for the robots printer and you upload it into the program at the moment our 3d printer is currently running so it 's starting to do the printing so with this little key ring that we 're going to be making it takes about 22 minutes to print so it does the bigger you design the longer it takes to create so with our 3d printer it uses a plastic filament so it 's eco-friendly and what it does is it feeds through the Machine it heats up really really hot and then it comes out of these little nozzles here so on on here there 's three little nozzles that they that the plastic comes through and then it goes on to the plate down here and that 's where prints the 3d prints are prints in basically layers so with the design that we 're doing today it has 25 layers so at the moment is on layer number two on the program here it counts down how long it 's going to take so right now is some two layers and there 's about 17 minutes remaining so as I said before it does take a little while once once the program has finished doing is printing we can 't get the design out straight away and that 's because in this machine at the moment is extremely hot so once it 's finished printing on the machine minutes before you can get the design apps that 's just so at the inside of it can cool down and also so the design can cool down as well I 'll show you an example of what we created in the past so this is a little keyring similar to what we 're doing today so this one is love books so plastic is quite strong so the key to when you 're doing your 3d printing designs is to make sure that they 're quite thick just so they don 't break very easily and of course you can make things that are larger as well but they do take longer to print so just keep that in mind as well today we 're printing with orange plastic but we do have other colors here as well so we 've also got pink we 've got purple we 've got white we 've got black and blue all you have to do is you have to change over the colors each time your door prints so if you want a different color you 'll have to change it so today we 'll open the orange so that 's pretty cool so the moment we 've is gonna wait for that one to print at the back of machine because it does get quite hot inside there is water fence so it takes the piece out the back of the machine so it doesn 't know the heats all right so our 3d print has now finished after 22 minutes so I 've had to wait about five minutes for it to cool down completely before I can open the lids so now that it 's cool I can open up the lid yup and I can carefully take it off yeah just making sure it doesn 't break and that 's it there 's a book my my key ring so as you can see it 's quite strong because it 's plastic so we 've made this design quite thick so it was a break very easily so in the library in the past we have had our 3d printing pop-up events so when we 're up and running again just keep an eye out for those very soon all right take care everyone bye _"

    "text": "hello welcome to Brisbane City Council libraries my name is guy I 'm from sunny Bank Hills library welcome to our library lab at home library lab is a fun way to learn about science and engineering today we 're going to look at walking water so we have used items that you can find around your home so that you can try this for yourself with the help of an adult what you 'll need are seven cups seventy clear plastic cups six folded sheets of paper hand towel food coloring red blue and yellow colors and a jug of water as you can see this is what we 've already made this has been on action now for the last couple days and you can see all the different colors that we have we 've got your Reds on the outside and then your blue and yellow on the inside there the other cups these three they originally started as empty but since then the colors in the water had traveled to outside ones to the inside one same please two into there and the same please to it 's made we originally started with red blue yellow and model red but as the colors have moved somewhat mysteriously then that mixed as you can see on the paper at the top here different colors and moving water to different things that we 're going to be experimenting today with our library lab okay now the first thing that you have to do is you have to fold your sheet of paper Intel so fold it in half fold it again and then fold it in half again like so so make sure it 's nice well folded that 's good what you need to do then is just to test and make sure that your paper towel can reach as close as it can to the bottom hopefully touching it like so so we 'll just test that out push it down that 's pretty good if you pipe it to Han Taylor 's stuck up too high then the water wouldn 't be able to walk I have the bridge to the other side okay so that 's good so we 'll take the paper hand color so we 'll need four cups one two three four the next thing you have to do is to fill your cups with water so fill it about half way that 's good try to make them all equal good okay so now you 've got your four cups the boiler the next thing that we have to do is to mix our food coloring into the cups of water so we 'll start with red you 'll need about five or six drops be very careful because food coloring can stain your fingers so you might end up with red yellow or blue fingers after this experiment it 's no armed explosions of color one two three four five I 'll do six and we 'll do two cups of bread one two three four five six isn 't that beautiful look at it like flows down let 's see if we can mix that with a little bit of a shake yeah that works you might want to use a spoon for this actually it 's just mixing itself quite well if you just leave it for the other two colors now quite dark I might leave it at four and just see how that goes I think the Blues a bit stronger than leave that for a little bit see if it mixes in okay and our last color yellow need a bit more yellow and the other colors I 'm thinking let 's see one two three four five six maybe seven a little bit of extra strength because I think the yellow is a bit weaker as far as strength goes to the other colours very nice now that we 've got our four cups of coloured water let 's set up the experiment so we 've got our three extra cups so spread out the other two cups in between nice and close together okay now we need to add the paper towel sheet water walking bridge into each cup so we 'll add that in so sits in there nice and as you 'll notice already the color in the cup with the water in it is already starting to travel up over the bridge this is a process that 's called and it 's what our blood flows through and this is similar to that small little icome tubes or channels in the paper that makes the water absorb up against gravity and then down the other side once it goes up against gravity and starts going down the other side then gravity 's working with the water that 's been absorbed to cool it down and it acts a bit like a a wicking type or siphoning type action now we need another one in here good look at the blue travel up it 's quite strong the blue looking at the retin thinking it might need a bit more color out I can always add a bit more in there 's no problem with though always modify the experiment just to make it work a bit better that 's good the yellow is really absorbing through there and now our last sheet it 's looking good try to make sure that paper stays down as low in the cup as it can because if the water level goes below the paper then it might absorb okay it 's been all the colors have joined together okay now as you can see in the first two cups the red and the yellow the water has walked over the bridge and down again and join together the two colors in the empty middle cup and you can see there 's quite a bit of water in this one and the rest of them the colors have joined and have formed orange Wow so now you know that red and yellow make orange okay on to the next to the blue and the yellow so again they have traveled over and combined together to make a lovely looking green color in the middle empty Cup okay on to the last two the red and the blue they have joined together in the empty cup to form quite nice purple here 's the finish result which is a beautiful rainbow of colors I hope you 've had fun watching the colored border walk over the paper bridge in creating all these different colors thanks for joining us today at the library I hope you 'll join us again soon _"

    "text": "hi everyone my name is Sarah and I 'm one of the chef 's here at oz harvest and today I want to share with you a delicious recipe from our feast Schools program it is a crunchy noodle salad it is full of all the great textures all the great veggies and it 's gonna be so much fun to make this at home with your kids so first what we 're gonna use is some cabbage so this is walmat cabbage we 're not gonna use quite all of this I 'm gonna use about half of this half so that 's a quarter for all the matheletes out there so what I want to do is I 'm just going to cut straight down the middle just like that set that bit aside and then I just want to cut out just this base core here because that can be quite rigid it 's not really that nice to eat but you could certainly cook it off in a stir-fry really important to you though as you 're chopping sort of pro tip as well is always a chopped salad like this once you get a bit chopped and it 's basically using up all of your space on your chopping board clean it off next up is our capsicum so we 've got this little half capsicum we might have used this in another recipe maybe you found it in your fridge this is the perfect recipe to use that up what I want to do to get our little seed pod out here isn 't just going to use two fingers like bunny ears and I 'm just gonna pop the right underneath that little seed pod and I 'm just going to pop that right out takes the green bit with it and there 's zero waste so just gonna take out a little bit more of that pick it can be a little bit bitter but really don 't waste a whole lot of time trying to get it all out just it 's not that bad so with capsicum you always want to try anything that you 're chopping you want to find sort of a flat side capsicum is a little through the outside than the inside so when you 're making slices it 's actually easier to cut from this side out capsicum is full of vitamin C there 's more vitamin C in a capsicum than there is in an orange really really super good for you so I 'm just going to pop all of that into my bowl next we 're gonna grate a carrot so this carrot it 's pretty big carrot it has already been washed and scrubbed so there 's really no need to peel it that really just produces more waste but you could certainly just use it as long as it 's clean it 's pretty much good to go I 'm just gonna take just the very very top bit off of the carrot I 'm gonna pop that into my little compost now when you 're grading a carrier if you 're giving any vegetable to a child too great just remember that their hands are considerably smaller than yours so what you want to do is make sure that it 's in a in a size that they can this carrot in half so another little trick even though you 're grading is making sure that you 're using the link of the grater a lot of times what happens is people really get stuck in these sort of three or four rows here and that part gets dull very quickly because it 's overused so if you really just spread it out to make sure that you 're using the entire area you 're gonna get a lot more life out of your grater so when you get to these little bits that are starting to get a little bit dangerous if you 're a kid that doesn 't have you know as well finely tuned hand-eye coordination and motor skills just leave those to the side and then you can definitely chop those in later so I 'm gonna give that a little pot up go using my keyboard just to scrape all that out into my bulb and then the second half of the carrot so now we want to do is add some herbs so with this recipe it 's really easy breezy you can parsley and some mint you could use coriander so this is a good little trick for kids of all ages especially little kids who are working on fine motor skills getting them in there to get the leaves off of the stems so you 've got different types of hurts you 've got like rosemary which is a hearty herb then you 've got your soft terms like basil mint those kinds of things they actually do better when they are torn instead of chopped because they bruise quite easily and then once they 're bruised they start to discolor so what I want to do is I just want to roughly tear these up so this is a great job for for a grown-up using a proper knife to just chop the parsley a little bit smaller parsley is a very strong flavor herb so you don 't want a big big pieces of this just pop of parsley that can be a little bit overwhelming for little palates so I 'm just going to use a grown-up knife and I 'm just going to roughly chop this up see what we 're looking at so far so that is looking super colorful we 've got all that crunchy cabbage the crunchy capsicum so that 's looking really nice so what we need to do now is we need to dress it up so for our little dressing very very simple we just need equal parts of soy sauce some olive oil we 're gonna add some water and some lemon so I 'm going to add tablespoon of soy sauce [Music] I 've got a little bit of water in here use a tablespoon of that so that 's just diluting it a little bit cuz these are very strong flavors and it just sends it out a little bit too you 've got a lot of cabbage there so you just want to make sure that you 're evenly coating everything and then we 're gonna do a tablespoon of lemon juice so a couple little tips when you are cutting citrus firstly is you want to give it a nice little roll so just with some firm pressure so what that 's doing on the inside those little membranes up to where when you cut it it will produce a lot more juice than if you didn 't do that what I 'm gonna do is I 'm going to juice this into my little like beautiful little prongs here and I 'm going to squeeze the lemon over my hand just cupping it and as you can see all of the seeds stay put in my hand and all I have down there is just all that lovely juice just like that so I need a tablespoon of dish [Music] move that size give that a good little mix-up so let 's dress our salad so we 're just going to pop the dressing right over give that a good mix toughie so everything is really nicely coated now if you were doing this for lunch for the next day I would recommend maybe making the dressing separate and keeping it into a little container separately and then just dressing the salad when you want to eat it sometimes sitting overnight the salad will get a little bit soggy which is not what we 're that have so much crunch that you don 't want to lose the effort all your hard work so that is all mixed in and then for the super crunchy super exciting bit we 're gonna add some little fried noodles so I 'm going to add most of them now I 'm gonna get them all nicely mixed in it 's got a nice generous serving plate so popping [Music] birth weights go spread it out just a little bit and then just top that off with more of our crunchy noodles on top so this salad is really kind of a baseline all of these ingredients work so well together but definitely a choose-your-own-adventure if there are other vegetables that you could pop in there that are going to be maybe a bit more successful with your kids in eating them then definitely pop those in [Music] _"

    "text": "hi there and welcome to bundle wetlands i 'm emily and i 'm mike and today we are learning about migratory shorebirds so what is a migratory show a migratory shorebird well first mike there are two kinds of shorebirds and shorebirds like to live by the water there 's residents and migratory so residential birds live locally like uri but migratory shorebirds they travel all around the globe okay so these birds make a journey of over 12 000 kilometers flying from boone or wetlands all the way to the northern hemisphere places like siberia and alaska and the path that these birds travel along is called the east asian australasian flyway what a mouthful so the bundle wetlands play a really really important role in these migratory shorebirds because they come here every summer to feed um on the mud flats and also rest from their long journey wow so should we go check this out yeah definitely let 's go check it out get out of here let 's go so we 're at the boondor wetlands bird height right now yeah so i have to keep before we were talking about that big flyway and they come down here during summer and you were saying they come down to eat but what are they eating down here okay so it 's really important that they can only eat when the tide is low because they eat on the mud flats yeah so they 're eating things like worms mollusks seeds all sorts yeah but when the tide 's high they have to roost hey mike who 's your friend so this is one of the smallest migratory shorebirds this is a redneck stint oh yeah it 's pretty cool and this is obviously a model and it weighs the same weight as a redneck stint three one so oh but that 's so light yeah it 's about the weight of a chicken egg wow when it makes its journey after that long flight of 12 000 kilometers it has to feed it loses half of its body weight so it 's just feeding and feeding on those mud flats it would be so tiny so like i said it 's the smallest and we also 's probably my favorite but what i 'd like to know is how a bird this tiny can fly all of that way so to answer your question emily the birds like other animals take on adaptations to deal with the environment that they 're living in so to survive on the mudflats shorebirds have a couple of key adaptations they have flexible toes and long legs to help them stay on top of the mud and not sink in another adaptation are their beaks some of them have very long curved beaks so they can dig right down and pull up some worms or some of those mollusks and different food sources and some of them have short sharp beaks and that allows them to pick on the surface so emily before you were talking about the east asian australasian fly away yep yes so i 'm a bit confused because the birds are down here in our summer to feed why wouldn 't they just stay here all the time why do they go all the way to the northern hemisphere well mike there 's a really good the northern hemisphere and that is it 's perfect for breeding so up here in the winter it 's really cold and iced over and it 's not very it is quite hostile for migratory shorebirds but in the summer when the snow melts it 's perfect breeding conditions there 's lots of insects and little bugs for the babies to eat when they hatch out so what we 're looking at here is a year in the life of the migratory shorebirds so you 'll find from september all the way through around mid-march is when we 've got the birds visiting us here down at the bundle wetlands and throughout the southern hemisphere during our winter the birds then fly all the way back up to the northern hemisphere so there 's 34 different species of migratory shorebirds that visit bundle every year which is pretty astonishing once the migratory shorebirds leave boonda wetlands at the end of summer they fly north along the flyway heading up towards russia and alaska but sometimes they need to stop off and have a bit of a rest and a feed yatsuhara our sister wetland in japan now you may be wondering how on earth do these birds know where they 're going how do they navigate do they have a map and a compass in their back pocket google maps i think google maps i 'm just joking emily they can use a range of different ways to find their way um through the stars yeah also listening for sounds so when they hear the waves crashing on their on the shore that gives them the sun they might be near land and not oversea wow so they 're using a lot of different sensors yeah well you know i also had they have a special internal compass that helps them navigate north to south wow [Music] so that nearly brings us to the end of our lesson today mike but there 's a couple more things we need to talk about unfortunately many of these shorebirds are under threats they 're under threat from development across the globe but also threats locally like people not having their dogs on the leash oh i hate that yeah the beach off trying to feed right yeah and then they 're using all their energy trying to run away and they can 't rest and feed so i guess if you 're down at the beach and you dog on a leash they 're not going to disturb these birds right that 's right that sounds so simple oh maybe that 's an action that we can take well not maybe that 's an action we can definitely take definitely also rubbish and pollution so not only can you put your own rubbish in the bin but taking three for the c who 's heard of that saying i don 't know i have now i think three for the seat what do you mean three pieces of rubbish three pieces of rubbish every day yup putting them in the bin and helping everyone on the planet wow that 's consistent so easy isn 't it yeah i stopped at three you could take more you could take more that 's an action that you guys could do taking three pieces of rubbish making sure your dog 's on a leash and time oh definitely that 's a given mic yeah and if we can do these little actions guys we can really help these birds to you know thrive and um thrive and survive every year yeah so thanks for joining us here today at boondo wetlands to learn about migratory shorebirds yeah i hope you found it really interesting and i hope you remember about the actions that you can take to help protect and look after these birds brilliant we hope you see you soon catch you later you _"

    "text": "[Music] hi everyone my name is Sarah and I am one of the chefs here at oz harvest and today I 'm going to share with you a delicious recipe that was developed for our feast schools program it 's a honey soy noodle stir-fry it is absolutely delicious and you are gonna have so much fun making this at home with your kids stir fries are great because they are so quick which is why they 're such a good go-to meal for any night of the week but one of the things you want to make sure is that you have all of your ingredients chopped or graded whatever your recipe is stating make sure you have all of that done before you even turn your pan on so the first thing I want to do is I 'm going to start by soaking my noodles so I have some Hakka noodles here but because they 're pretty much cooked we just want to heat them through so I 've got some boiling water on top and I just want to start to soften those up a little is get our veggies chopped so we are working with some capsicum a little a nutrition note there 's more vitamin C and red capsicum then in an orange so really great little tip there for kids so why what to do with this is slice this a couple of things you want to make sure firstly you want to make sure that your board is nice and stable and then secondly you want to make sure that you are using really good hand techniques so that you 're holding the vegetable properly this recipe we 're going to use only half of this capsicum so I 'm gonna use a little archway to hold the capsicum steady and then I 'm just gonna cut right down the middle over the capsicum cause I 'm going to take two fingers to bunny ears and I 'm gonna pop them right into my capsicum and I 'm just going to take that whole little seed pod right out so now what I want to do is slice my capsicum so I want to try to make this again as flat as so I 'm just gonna set it on the board and I 'm gonna give it just a little flat down go I 'm gonna set those into my bowl here ready to go in the pan this little guy get him chopped I 'm in the same thing with my zucchini again zucchini rolling around not a good thing you want to make sure you 're always finding a flat surface so I 'm just gonna take this little hat off and I 'm gonna pop that into my compost bowl here and I 'm gonna pop that into my bowl there so again we 're only gonna use half a zucchini for that as well so I 'm gonna pop those guys over there and then with my carrot I don 't want to cut my carrot I 'm going to grate my carrot so I 'm just gonna take the very very little tip off of the carrot now here 's a tip if you are grading or if your little hands with graders you want to make sure that you have a spot or a size we might be able to grate an entire carrot this big it 's usually better if the kids have a bit more of a manageable size so I 'm just going to cut him in half just like that because I really only want to use half the carrot anyway and then I 'm gonna grab my grater so much smaller piece much easier for little hands to manage and then all of my carrot is gonna go into my bowl here so just with a low heat to start I 'm gonna put a about a tablespoon roughly of olive oil into my nonstick fry pan here this is really great to use with a fry pan or electric skillet whatever you have at home and I 'm just gonna spread that oil around just a little bit so when you 're cracking an egg always faster crack an egg on a flat surface as opposed to the side of a bowl you get a lot less little fragments that way of the shell so I 'm gonna give it a good crack this is a really great thing eggs the the sense of accomplishment that they have when they get it right is a bar none they really really love it now if you do happen to get a little bit of eggshell in there you can just use the other side of the shell to dip the to dip that in there and you can get rid of that show that 's a great little trick so while my pan is heating up I 'm just going to beat my one egg here and then essentially what I 'm gonna do is make the tiniest little omelet that I 'm not going to fold but I just want some nice a nice set egg that I can cook up and then we 're going to slice it and add it to the final dish so I 'm going to add my egg to the pan and then I just want to spread this out pretty thinly so that way it cooks all the way through so you don 't want to scramble it that 's not what we 're after so it 's pretty much set all it a little roll up I 'm gonna pop it on to my cutting board here I 'm gonna let that cool slightly before I cut it because obviously that 's quite hot at the moment so now I 'm going to add my capsicum and my zucchini so still a little bit of oil in the pan plenty to cook with so don 't want to add my carrot just yet because they 're grated they 're not gonna take as much time to cook as the capsicum and the zucchini are so I 'm just gonna give those a little bit of a move around if it 's too hot you don 't want your veggies to be really really dark brown before they 're even cooked through so just control the heat lower it down a little bit if you need to and you want to make sure that the veggies are starting to cook through but crisp tender is what you want you want a slight little bite to them this shouldn 't be crunchy but you don 't want them soggy either you 're really 're looking really good so we 're gonna go on a little field trip over to the sink to drain the noodles so you just want to make sure that you 're getting all of that excess water out so they 're looking really good you can see that the zucchini is starting to take on a little bit of color which is great as is the capsicum so what we want to do now is add our carrot and then we 're gonna add our noodles as well this is gonna heat everything back through to get everything mixed in really nicely together again those carrots they 're gonna cook super super quick because they 're graded they 're so small and then I 'm gonna add my sauce so this is a soy and honey sauce we 're gonna use about a tablespoon of this this is really kind of what brings everything together super delicious tablespoon goes in and now to get everything a good mix so you want to make sure that everything is really nicely coated so at this point what I 'm going to want to overcook my veggies so I 'm going to turn my pan off and while that is sitting I am going to slice my egg up so it 's nice and cool now to touch so you can slice it up chop it up do whatever you want and then just sort of make it rain with the eggs looks so good and then mix that through one more time and now it 's time to serve it up so the good thing about this recipe besides the fact that it 's delicious besides the fact that it costs next to nothing to make besides the fact that it costs that it 's next to no time to actually make is that you can do anything you want with this you can put so many different types of veggies in there the kids aren 't crazy about zucchini add peas add corn choose-your-own-adventure do whatever you want to get some extra veg in and use up those little bits and pieces that might be in your fridge this is a really great way to use all of that up _"

    "text": "hi my name is Catherine and I 'm one of the education officers who works here in the beautiful Raven Street reserve in North Brisbane down below me is down Fall Creek down four Creek is one of the many creeks that cut their ways through Brisbane and like them all it starts in the hills and ends up at Moreton Bay down Fork Creek is actually one of the creeks in the downfall Nunda catchment why am I telling you this because today we 're going to talk about catchments but first see if you can spot a water dragon I saw them before down four creeks like every waterway in Brisbane is in a catchment when we talk about catchments we talk about the area of land that rain falls on that flows into a creek when rain falls on the Ravens Street Reserve we know that that water flows into downfall Creek so we can confidently say that Ravens stream is in the downfall Creek catchment area Wow well I have set up this highly attuned very scientific well considered experiment for you to show you exactly are surrounded by hills and have a river running through the middle of them or a creek now imagine sucker here is a raindrop admittedly not one you want to land on your head this slide here is a hill and down the bottom is down four Creek now water likes to move downhill so do balls so in theory when I let this ball go it 's going to move down our make-believe hills and into the waterway at the bottom the catches catchment so let 's go nailed it well if my really snazzy little experiment outside didn 't explain what a catchment is well enough for you maybe this diagram will help so as I said outside catchments are largely surrounded by hills and they have a waterway running through the middle at the lowest point let 's have a look at this map over here this is a map that shows the major waterway catchments around Brisbane so we 've got Moreton Bay out here we have the mountains over here and this blue line snaking its way all the way around through the map is bigger than a lot of these other rivers or creeks that 's because it has a lot of these creeks feeding into it and it eventually ends up in Moreton Bay so whatever goes into the catchment high up here will end up in Moreton Bay now where is the downpour Creek one oh here we are so this is downfall Creek the Creek that we 've been looking at it doesn 't join the Brisbane River but it does end up in Moreton Bay there are many catchments of the Brisbane area but it 's important to remember that no two catchments are the same water quality depends largely on where the water lands and also the natural and human elements in the landscape so let 's have a look at what a natural element is now natural elements in the environment are those things that occur naturally such as rivers creeks trees plants and reserves like this generally the more natural areas in a catchment the cleaner the water and here 's why when rain falls on natural areas like this some of it soaks into the ground as it moves towards the waterway it picks up dirt rubbish and other pollutants but there 's something on the edge of this creek which stops these pollutants entering the water can you guess what it is plants such as these on the edge of waterways play a really important role in keeping our waterways clean first they act as buffers so when water 's flowing really quickly they slow the water down secondly their roots act like big gloves and I hold onto the dirt really tightly which helps stop erosion third they trap a lot of the pollutants before they enter the waterway so natural things such as these plants play a big role in keeping our waterways clean but do human elements do the same thing let 's go find out human elements are humans and things humans make such as roads houses the school 's anything really now humans were funny things we like to build things with flat hard surfaces this is a bit of a problem when it rains because as the rain hits it it moves very quickly off that flat hard surface find in its way and heads to the nearest storm water drain like this one here so then where does the stormwater go I 'll show you gonna pick this plastic up first don 't want it ending up in the wrong spot the rain that falls on the roofs and the roads over there doesn 't soak into the ground because they 're concrete or smooth surfaces instead it rushes off the road into the nearby stormwater drains which then empty straight into the creek over here yeah great great excellent this is down Fall Creek this is the same Creek that we were looking at before but it 's it 's very different as you can see so creeks change as they move through the catchments this one 's been turned into a drain and you can see that there are no plants on either side of the bank it 's very smooth so what happens when it rains is that water rushes into the drain and then it rushes down the drain pollutants and all all the way through to Moreton Bay because it is a drain it because it 's shallow it means that our we can build up on the surface again adding to the pollutants in the drain Yaak found to be the plastic in the waterway it 's probably washed off somebody 's butt in out of somebody 's backyard or even concrete playgrounds a lot of these wash off from there now I know that it 's a plastic bag but to a turtle or to a dugong it actually looks like a jellyfish Turtles love to eat jellyfish and so they will swallow this plastic bag and it will get stuck in their stomach and if they eat enough of them they actually die from it but it doesn 't have to be like this I 'll show you how you we can we can change it there are a few simple steps you can take every day that will help improve the health of the waterways and our catchments number one plant a plant remember they 're really good filters and buffers and help clip out keep our waterways clean number two pick up dog poo everyone loves their dogs poo is full of bacteria when that washes into our waterways that creates all sorts of problems number three pick up three for the sea you may have heard of this catchy little slogan it reminds us that if we can pick up three pieces of rubbish every day we can make a really big impact on the qualities of our sea and in turn the waterways that run into it so there you go water is arguably a most precious natural resource without fresh water there 'd be no you know me and there definitely would it be our batty friends here who live in the Raven Street reserve water quality starts in our catchments so it 's important that we all play a role in keeping our catchments clean and pollution-free so remember take 4 the sea and hopefully I 'll see you out in nature again very soon bye _"

    "text": "hi I 'm Kirsty from Gotham City Library and today I 'll be running through a digital library laboratory session before we start today 's experiment comes from the book kitchen science lab for kids which is available in our physical collection but also available to borrow as an e-book from Libby you can borrow those items and download them to your tablets and smart devices so before we start our experiment I had a few science related questions what happens when you mix different liquids and why does some liquids mix and others separate what happens when you mix water and oil do they mix together what did they say a pot what about water and dishwashing liquid did they mix did they make bubbles what would happen if you swapped out the wood up for milk with the milk in the dishwashing liquid mix or would they stay about to our experiment today he uses both milk and dishwashing liquid and it 's called tie-dyed milk just there 's a warning before we start this one does use food coloring so it can stain and make a bit cloth on the surf doing the experiment on you wear some gloves and an old shirt or a lab coat like I am so let 's get started sorry for our experiment you will need a shallow dish or a salsa some milk it works best if you use full cream milk but you 'll get different results if you use a different type of milk some dishwashing liquid different types of food coloring I 've got three I 've got blue red and green but you only need two at worst and some drop is for pancakes so one for each color and it 's very handy to have some paper towels just in case you have a bit of a spill so we 'll start with pouring our milk so make sure you pour just a light layer to come at the bottom you don 't need much milk and then pick what if your food coloring colors you only need a single drop of each color and try to get the drop somewhere towards the middle of the plate Mogar with red next and our last color the food coloring so you don 't have a spill and this is where our dishwashing liquid comes in so make sure you open the lid and you only need a single drop in the middle there so tip it up pop in the drop and the colors start separating so you can see they 're moving around the plate so when we add the dishwashing liquid milk and food coloring the facts and the water separate from the milk the food coloring that we added full is alone with the fat molecules in the milk and you can see as they swirl around that this separating did you enjoy the experiment let us know the results of your own experiment at home my sharing of further in the comments below don 't forget to follow us on Facebook at Brisbane libraries for more digital content such as makerspace trivia and children 's literacy sessions don 't forget to check out our library catalog for more resources such as ebooks the audio books and children 's games thanks for joining us today _"
