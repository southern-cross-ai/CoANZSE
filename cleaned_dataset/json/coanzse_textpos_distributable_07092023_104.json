    "text": "um and there 's public participation we 've got no public forum presentations but we have a deputation by appointments we have Jamie Stevens done op tech sorry Roy matter and it 's my intention that will go straight to here we got yep yeah oh right okay so we 've got two fellow Roy matter regarding item 15 so it 's probably best that we move straight to their item as soon as the public presentation of uni and Jamie thank you we thank you for this opportunity to come today we 're here to support the animal essential Heath community boards recommendations to you for the need for a community led revitalization plan for the inner city East for those of you who don 't know me I 'm Ginny Smith and this is my colleague Jamie Stevenson we 're going to be shearing us this morning um funny voice matter for some of you who are maybe not familiar with our organization has worked in the inner city East for the last thirty years was initiated by the city mission and has been involved and facilitating a neighborhood has faced some of you may be familiar that is a d-cell 19 area and so a lot of the issues around marginalization have been present we want to make by way of background to key points the inner city East neighborhood has a unique history in the in Christchurch in the history of Christchurch since European settlement it measures particularly the unique historical role it 's placed played and housing single people right from the early settlement days through to particularly post-war and it 's a role that 's not found elsewhere in the in the city and yet it continues despite the damage that 's being done as a result of the quake so it 's a unique place that you say can 't_''_135.42 be found elsewhere community studies repeatedly are confirmed that the strong community as vibrant well-connected and supporters with the sizable number of people who 've lived in the neighborhood for 20 plus years some 50 plus years and that there is a large world as a number of social service agencies who 've been strategically located in this area and play a keys think Auckland of what has happened with the region traffic Asia with a beautification of those areas we are not at that point in that in the inner city based but that 's why we saying it 's a vital area that needs to be supported and not go down the track of say Auckland and Wellington so why the need for a plan mmm the UM pit of the Christchurch quakes and the losses that were experienced many of it has borne and first of all has flown under the radar of some of the other neighborhoods who 've been maybe more high-profile and advocating the issues that they 've faced but there 's being a significant loss of damage to the Lynwood village and also a significant loss of vital low cost housing as well as the neighbourhood theories and in little shops like that it 's resulted and the consequences have been the displacement of local residents many of them have filtered on to the streets and the increased use of public substance arm use it 's also the loss of those really important social networks because been well supported and well networked and what we 've argued as the market leader proach is not result of well it 's resulted and patchy uneven development in its replacement housing has largely been targeted at higher income earners while lower-income earners have struggled to get a foot on and now with social housing it 's starting to be a bit different but we were arguing that that there 's more work that needs to be done around it that the shops that have gone on are catering for the higher income earners and they 're not necessarily meeting the needs or the wants of the existing community as we 've already said it 's an area that locals feel concerned about announced in the recent survey but also confirm the deep attachment tool and we say that to you that this is a community that is well worth investing on in preserving so over the last 18 months from to for every matter we have advocated the need for such a revitalization plan driven by the local community through supported by local and central government to our community we 're advocating is a bottom-up community development process which acknowledges and respects the history and the traditions of the area gives positive regard to the existing community which needs to be the focus of any revitalization plan recognizes that there are underlying tensions that the marketplace is not going to be able to resolve easily and that what we hope out of this will be a 1-1 for all the various levels of the community that will build on the preliminary work that was begun in the community survey earlier this year and then will allow for the people of the inner city to be able to be involved in processes so we 're saying in the short time I 've got lived with um that we want to be able to highlight to the shortcomings of the market leader approach highlight to you and say that development any development is kind of which underpins it markedly proach as being better than no development we want to challenge that notion we want to say that we need to look at how we go about developing this neighborhood and we and protect people that have lived here and it 's not simply about ditching the the physical environment sorted neither is it about getting a top-down consultative process this is about engaging a marginalized community that often doesn 't participate in participatory processes and we need to be able to do alternate ways of reaching them they 've got obviously really good ideas about what they what they want to see so we 're asking you council to help fund a process that will help facilitate the inner city East community to be able to collectively develop its own solutions to be able to write vitalizes human community in line with a shared vision so we call on the powers of the regenerate generation act and the skills and resources of both the council and of a regenerate to be able to look at revitalizing the area and it doesn 't say you guys don 't have a role because as we point out to you your usual role around street scape the pictures of lane for common purposes than the pictures of pocket parts all those sort of things local community board and what it 's seeking today Thank You lovey thank you does anyone questions or comments that they might add to that um I just like to say thank you for your work that you 've been doing on this and getting to this stage and I think with the resolution that we 'll have today at also I can sort of move on and actually start seeing the process start to you know evolve and see how it actually is going to benefit this area that really needs it yonni yeah sure um could I thank Sony um I guess sort of some of the big projects that are taking place in the last sort of two or three years and especially focusing in Lynnwood village would be things like the stem ward book and post shop so the post shop which was the Berwyn who owned it for many years was having to retire and the loss of that shop was the loss of a very important service was in the Stanmore village in the Lynwood village but also a connection point especially for older gift the shop tooth a fuddy doughnut that we 're so it 's now being operated largely by volunteers and also operating a bit as a community hub there 's also sort of the many many things that the fedora Methos been doing well for many years and from Gloucester Street and from places like the wood Community Arts Center down our shop down in Wooster Street and the community lunches there we 've also been part of transitional projects like the coho et al cafe in Stanmore Road and many other things which I 'm sure I 'm missing Jenny but I guess it 's a it 's there 's we 've got our hands and a lot of and a lot of flies in that area and because the sort of as needs pop up yeah you know I think to answer that as well Yanni the reality is that it was going to die if we didn 't take on the pie shop what was going to be leaved a very popular on butcher shop but not a lot not a lot else that was going to that what 's been too far E 's role in the absence has been we recognized we needed to keep that little village going and how we could do it with us Jamie sees some of the transitional projects as well as some of the other developments that we 've been involved in like the pie shop well thank you thank you very much I think I first met you know must have been 1990 yeah when I became the MP for Christchurch central so I consider their tests of the work of to photo very much from what you 've been doing on the community over all the years and it 's very worthwhile so it 's great that we we can now deal with us which I think will be quite a step forward but remain very much a community lead process using having it you know support from both ourselves and regenerate Christchurch over a over access to planning tools that will help as well if necessary good thank you so look when we move straight to item 15 I think they would be appropriate would _"

item 13 and a declaration from Sarah Templeton in respect of a part of public excluded item 14 item 3 public participation we have three participants in the public forum this morning the first of which from the protec Home Center noise level of the chairperson of the Percoco sensor joint project committee regarding the proc echo Center in parklands so Morris if you 'd like to come forward to the table good to have you with us this morning and you 've got other people as well as Grace and the way this public participation works you have five minutes to talk to the council about any matter you choose Tim thank you thank you for the opportunity to come out in parkings one as I mentioned my name is Marlo I chair the group Jayne Marnie is with me as part of our organization group we 've been set up for four years looking at and flow on from the issues that area ahead after the parklands earthquake after the earthquakes in Christchurch we a number of groups didn 't have facilities available so we initially looked at building a purpose-built building for our community and soon after we 've been on that for a while realized that there was beyond our reach to be able to fund a project of that extent so then we had the opportunity to look at some looked at other options around and we came against the possibility of accessing buildings from the freewill school which was going to be demolished and that 's when we now so we 're are patterns as a joint venture between two East clubs in Christchurch they are the applicants bowling club which is a well-established club out there and the Parkins bowling club and you have seen hopefully you 've seen the video and our website I would encourage you to have a look at it together we 're building a sport and recreation facility for that community out there and we 've consulted widely over the needs with a whole lot of stakeholders both community groups and residents and our aim is to support and connect a healthy vibrant community by building a multi-use facility and welcoming and the inclusiveness of the community as well that 's this planet based on four stages Stage one is the relocation of a modern learning building from from Freegal school onto that site which we now have there and we are very near completion of that particular stage today the paint is finishing the internal pain starting the internal painting and we 're on target to open that building in November and a formal opening later on stage two is it were relocated the hall that was at the freewill school which we now have on site there when we will eventually and once funding is provided put that there and we 'll link the two buildings together by way of a Lee 's way and Stage four to enable a complete project here that meets the needs of our community and stage one is 1 but this overalls of our four million dollar project stage one as 1.4 we 've raised 1.2 at the present time stage 2 and with the relocation of the hall is 1.3 million and we currently got four hundred thousand relating to that stage 3 as approximately seven hundred and sixty thousand which is the joining of the two together to make a a vironment orally and artistically look pleasing looking complex and stage for us the six hundred sales and writing to the court facilities out there so progress right at this particular stage and we have relocated in May they buildings from the freewill site on to our site and much to the satisfaction a lot of the people that were connected with the Fievel site as well they were really pleased to see their buildings being reused rather than demolition which the other outcome so we worked closely with the Ministry of Education to enable this to happen so that is they building now on our site out there weeks volunteer labors will put a big around the outside of that and the internal fit-out is underway and as I mentioned before completion in November and so the fever hall as also is relocated temporarily on to that site at the moment and currently in the store there and we are embarking on a funding campaign to put that into operation so we have a website up and running in a Facebook page which connects the community we 've set up a good level page to have to enable the community to their buy-in we 've had a information session with all interested community groups and to be tried on as we were overwhelmed with the number of people groups and organizations not just supporting but community groups that come along and expressed an interest to either be involved in the project or we all keep an interest in what we 're going and recently we had one where we bought the local businesses along and had an information evening with them as well sharing their information so narrow and another stage of further applications for funding through corporates putting in a formal government structure at the moment and we hope to finalize that and shorten time what we do our aim is to make sure that as well as having an exclusive club we 've also need to having a sustainable model for our community this is not just about to sporting founding clubs the founding clubs of the Bowling Club and the Rugby Club but it 's very much a community club and we want to be up and running on okay great so you and remove the need for us to remind you that you 'd come to the end of our that 's because you clearly took over the care of that for yourself but some yeah thank you very much indeed for bringing this presentation to us this morning it 's great to know what you 're doing there will

of the hotel early next year and welcome to Canterbury and welcome to your wife back to Canterbury thank you very much indeed for taking the time to talk to us this morning thank you so our third public participation item this morning is Hugo Christensen 's from the South New Brighton residents Association who will address us regarding suburb boundaries and flood boundaries and the advice the South Shore matters which are already under consideration by the council so Hugo welcome thank you for joining us this morning and you have five minutes to address the council thank you Chiara and thank you very much for listening to our concerns Eve we are going to split this between us so you have a little bit of the changes with Paige 's Sheamus is going to start and so just to introduce myself Thank You thanks a lot I 'm Secretary of the residents association so will we have eight pages here we 'd split them between us one age most of the pages are connected with the fact that there seemed such bratton seems to be have been excluded from a lot of reports and there seems to be a lot of confusion between names and definitions for geographical areas the first page you see here in your copy is from the Jacobs multi hazard report for some reason such Bratton is not mentioned in that sighs brighten as you know was one of the worst affected areas after the Christchurch earthquakes the Canterbury Earthquake sequence in draft format but it contains very very interesting information on lots and lots of areas and such batten needs it very important day for the things listed for a proper land assessment for the definition of the recovery budget where it 's going to be spent for the use of rates for a coastal protection and for civil defense a lot of these things have been raised in the past when we look at the boundary you know our definition of the boundaries originates from the Council where we begin given the definition it 's the soft side of Sharon 's of Stroup marine power in the north side of Caspian state to the reserves in the West South Brighton 's of its significance of silence during the Canterbury Earthquake in fact the land sank sunk so much that black large forested areas sank into the sail and called coastal waters the subsidence were so significant that temporary stock banks were erected up to 120 centimetres higher than the subsided land here you see an illustration of some of the worst affected area there on page three we have 2011 but it does not include such Brighton which is again and remind you one of the worst affected areas the area covered by the study at the time it relates to were the eastern suburbs of christchurch along the Athan river but em sighs Brian has been left out again so where this was commissioned by the minister the ministry the next page is the mayor of task plot task force it reports on on a large area from pages wrote to all ends of South Shore and the area is referred to as the South Shore study area it refers to significant land damage but south of Brit Street and yeah believe it out that we have complained over this court in 2014 and so recently as well the following pages from the ministry for the environment Aven climate change case study in this case South Brighton is not excluded but such brightness located in South Shore so we 've been trying to find where the the boundaries are between the different suburbs this is another example of the confusion that arises if people give the wrong names impacts of sea level rise on floodplain management planning for the Haven River was the subject of the study and it was prepared by Harris consulting in conjunction with the Christchurch City Council in 2003 so things like this need to be cleared up so that we know exactly what we 're talking about and what and budget is being allocated to which area when we go to a document from the Environment Court since 2003 which the first will be cash flow case and in that particular document there is a map of the South Brighton coastal management area reaching from tun Street South at the South Shore spec this area is commonly known as South Shore and the following map there is one that we raised with the keyboard over the last few months these again are two maps published by the city council one of them shows South Brighton with extensive areas of the beachfront included in it that 's the one on the left and the map on the right shows the map that we are familiar with under our Constitution showing the definitions with it rates are being collected for each suburb what rates are being spent on coastal defence systems etc etc so this okay needs to be cleared up when you switch back to the last page with refers back to the Jacobs multi hazards report in the tsunami map on that particular report it appears that the risk which has been identified in South Brighton is not included on the on the Jacobs report this may reflect the civil defense responses etc and we asked that though the bomb distance off Brighton revisited in terms of the recovery and the following issues addressed accordingly the lanthum is budget assigned according to where the damage occurred hazard exposure and mitigation communicated and addressed civil defense response and community awareness of hazards addressed the use of r8 assigned according to agreed boundaries so that brings us to the end of the five minutes thanks very much indeed for the presentation we can certainly refer this document and the content of your presentation to to staff and clearly there is a linkage between some of the issues that you 've raised and and our ongoing 've raised to staff by way of this document thank you very much indeed for taking the time to talk to us this morning thank you thank you very much for listening so that brings us to the end of autumn 3.1 the public forum 3.2 deputations by appointments there are none and item for presentation of petitions there are none so that then leads us to committee minutes so items 5 7 8 and 9 which I proposed to move together I 'm aware that Vicki as chair of the innovation and sustainable development committee wanted to just make a comment regarding the minutes of that committing picking in relation to that the stuff that you 're deciding is reasonably straightforward and has come from the development forum as a means of actually helping the transition in the city and making sure that that people can get here and feel welcome here you noticed that the minutes refer to a staff briefing on cabin neutrality and this comes to the council in about two meetings time because what we had was a briefing on how the city could become then how the city as a whole could work to become carbon neutral but the information that we had in the briefing is not included in the minutes so it 's quite difficult for you to make a decision on the targets that we would like to see it for the City Council and the framework that we 'd like to set for the city so that will come to you with a full report in two weeks 2nd of November yeah yep great thank you very much indeed for that so I 'm happy to move items 5 7 8 9 the committee minutes do I have a seconder Sarah all those in favor against that 's carried so that now brings us to item 6 innovation of sustainable development committee Viki you made some comments on this was there anything further you wanted to add by introduction so that we can make it easy for lands there is vacant to be used in the interim for car parking and to make that as easy as possible for property owners to work with the council to make it happen you Jamie was there anything that you wanted to add no I Vicki 's oh what one thing and it was just really you recall obviously the one hour free parking initiative which they were tight britches around there for obvious reason so that went directly to council this followed the normal channels are going through Vicky 's committee because it wasn 't so under the pump of timing but it was it 's really the second prong to the approach is that we can 't we 're not just going to do one thing and then assume that everything else will fix itself so we do need to communicate and work with private operators and this is that second part of it yeah probably got a question around baby I just don 't know how if I can actually take this opportunity to have to hear it at the same time is Whitby hair if opportunities for making long-stay parking available for short-term stays after hours and on weekends just wonder if there 's contractual issues with that because the nature of permanent parks is that people of leased one 's going to work but if you 've got any comment on it that would be great so thanks for letting me double the intro onto a question yep great that was a nice sequential move into questions so yours is the first question Erin okay so I think Jamie your question you would probably have to be dealt with on a case by case basis because there 's such a wide range of these off street parks around the city and the various different ownership and lease arrangements so there 's no simple answer to that but I 'm sure if you cast our net wide across the city that there will be some things that we can do and there 'll be some good opportunities here for making some of those sites available when they 're not being used during the day especially for things like you know entertainment activities you know restaurants and bars and wyoming food yeah thank you further questions deal yeah it 's just um I was think she 's just gonna ask if you could explain I I know the report talks better standard with minute you know that I 'm but stick there around the state of the the gravel pits in the Central City so maybe we can just sort of let us all know what actually works going on yep yes so this is already quite a lot of work going on in that space and we understand that what some of the things that are occurring around the city aren 't conducive to an ideal recovery environment and so the main players we 've been working quite closely with them on resurfacing some of their sites looking at whether those sites need to be surrendered or converted from say commuter parking to short stay where there 's high demand for short stay and in areas where there has already been establishment of more permanent parking facilities that those sites are so bended or used for something else to try and uncover encourage redevelopment on those sites as well so so we are going through some tidy up exercises and they should start to become obvious Allen and Cedeno thank you again and then Paulie mine was a similar to clarify for me because I 'm not familiar with this but this will involve paid parking lots of toys that people pay for it and is there any mention in here of using car parts these say something like well II can that 's not used at night is unpaid parking but just become available at nighttime for the restaurants and things down there yeah could it be rolled into this anyway yeah I think that 's part of that so here 's a yeah it is well that 's good yeah so that would be an unpaid part of it there 's just a shearing of spaces yeah be good thank you any further questions so Vicki you 're happy to move this Jamie have it second okay so moved in second is ready to debate I 'm really happy that um this is actually going to start helping towards tidying up the Central City especially in those you know those gravel pit car parks the city starts to recover and actually it 's looking really good there 's a good vibe around there but bringing down the weeks ago we did a cleanup in the central study with keep christchurch beautiful in the most filthiest places in the central city where the where the were the gravel pit car parks in terms of rubbish and stuff like that so I 'm really pleased that as part of this that some work is going to be going on with talking to those owners and the operators directly to actually clean those up get the immunity better so that actually people can start to feel a good vibe in the central city I mean I think there 's just a really win-win for for the city 's glad to see a step moving forward on this thank you so I put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you so now moving to item 10 the revocation of delegation and the report makes this very clear essentially there was a process that some council put in place that because of a number of very practical reasons were wasn 't able to be rolled out in the way that we 'd anticipated this relates to the motion around changing the procedure which is well explained in the report so are there any questions on this deal so I 'll move Dion you 'll second all those in favor against that 's carried thank you so now we go to item 11 the resolution to exclude the public as set out on pages 35 to 37 of the agenda there 's nobody that we 're needing to allow to remain so our moves that we exclude the public for the reasons set out and report Mike Davidson the second all those in favor against that 's carried thank you so we

little about it but um methods for providing better standard with minute you know that I 'm a stickler around the state of the the gravel pits in the Central City so maybe we can just sort of let us all know what actually works going on yep yes so this is already quite a lot of work going on in that space and we understand that what some of the things that are occurring around the city aren 't conducive to an ideal recovery environment and so the main players we 've been working quite closely with them on resurfacing some of their sites looking at whether those sites need to be surrendered or converted from say commuter parking to in areas where there has already been establishment of more permanent parking facilities that those sites are so bended or used for something else to try and cover encourage redevelopment on those sites as well so so we are going through some tidy up exercises and they should start to become obvious out and sadena thank you good and then pulling mine was a similar question aside so you 're happy yeah fantastic Pauline just did clarify for me because I 'm not familiar with this but this will involve paid parking I suppose that people will pay for it and is there any mention and here of using car parks these say something like well II can that 's not used at night is unpaid parking but just become available at nighttime for the restaurants in tents down there yeah could it be rolled into this anyway yeah I think that 's part of that so here 's a yeah it is alright well that 's good yep so that would be none great this is the shearing station it 'd be good thank you any further questions so second okay so moved in second is is ready to vote I 'm really happy that um this is actually going to start helping towards tidying up the Central City especially in those you know those gravel put car parks the city still starts to recover and actually it 's looking really good there 's a good vibe around there but bringing down the Vipers those gravel pit car parks and three or four weeks ago we did a cleanup in the central study with keep Christchurch beautiful in the most filthiest places of in the central city where the where the were the gravel pit car parks in terms of rubbish and stuff like that so I 'm really pleased that as part of this that some work is going to be going on with talking to those owners and the operators directly to actually clean those up get the amenity better so that actually people can start to feel a good vibe in the central city I mean I think that 's just a really win-win for for the city so glad to see a step moving forward those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "the first of which from the ProCare Center Morris Lawler the chairperson of the particular Center joint project committee regarding the pachuco Center in parkland so Morris if you 'd like to come forward to the table good to have you with us this morning and you 've got other people as well as great and the way this public participation works you have five minutes to talk to the council about any matter you choose to thank you thank you for the opportunity to come here this morning to present what is a community project out in parkings one as I mentioned my name is Marlo I chair the group Jayne Marnie is with me as part of our organization group but we 've been set up for four years looking at and flowed on from the issues that area had after the parklands earthquake after the earthquakes in Christchurch we a number of what groups didn 't have facilities available so we initially looked at building a purpose-built building for our community and soon after we 've been on that for a while realized that there was beyond that extent so then we had the opportunity to look at some looked at other options around and we came against the possibility of accessing buildings from the freewill school which was going to be demolished and that 's when we need up so we 're our partners as a joint venture between two east clubs in Christchurch they are the applicants bowling club which is a well-established club a out there and the Parkins bowling club and you have seen hopefully you 've seen the video and our website there is a lot of background information if you haven 't already character to have a look at it together we 're building a sport and recreation facility for that community out there and we 've consulted widely over the needs with a whole lot of stakeholders both community groups and residents and our aim is to support and connect a health environment community by building a multi-use facility and welcoming and the inclusiveness of the community as well that 's this airplane is based on four stages and Stage one is the relocation of a modern learning building from there and we are very near completion of that particular stage today the painters finishing the internal pain starting the internal painting and we 're on target to open that building in November and a formal opening later on stage two is relocated the hole that was at the freewill school which we now have on site there when we will eventually and once funding is provided put that there and we 'll link the two buildings together by way of a breezeway and stage four is the development of our core facility such as courts to enable a complete project there that meets the needs of our community Stage one is 1 but this overalls of our four million dollar project stage one as 1.4 we 've raised 1.2 at the present time stage 2 with the relocation of the hall is 1.3 million and we can 't leave got 400,000 relating to that stage 3 as approximately seven hundred and sixty thousand which is the joining of the two together to make a a vironment orally and artistically look pleasing looking complex in stage for us the six so progress right at this particular stage and we have relocated in May those buildings from the free will site on to our site and much to the satisfaction a lot of the people that were connected with the free will site as well they were really pleased to see their buildings being reused rather than demolition which the other outcome so we work closely with the Ministry of Education to enable this to happen and so that is they building now on our site out there I mean which has been completely refitted in the next few weeks volunteer labors will put a big around the outside of that and the internal fit-out is underway and as I mentioned before completion in November and so the fever hall as also is relocated temporarily on to that site at the moment and currently in the store there and we are embarking on a funding campaign to put that into operation so we have a website up and running in a Facebook page which connects the community we 've set up a good level page to have to enable the community all interested community groups and to be tried on as we were overwhelmed with the number of people groups and organizations not just supporting but community groups that come along and expressed an interest to either be involved in the project or we all keep an interest in what we 're going and recently we had one where workers along and had an information evening with them as well sharing their information so narrow and another stage of further applications for funding through corporates and funding trusts we 're well down the track of putting in a formal governance structure at the moment and we hope to finalize that and shorten time because we do our aim is to make sure that as well as having an exclusive club we 've also need to have a sustainable model for our community this is not just about to spoiling founding clubs the founding clubs of the Bowling Club and the Rugby Club but it 's very much a community club and we want to be up and running in okay great so you and remove the need for us to remind clearly took over the care of that for yourself but some yeah thank you very much indeed for bringing this presentation to us this morning it 's great to know what you 're doing there

next year and welcome to Canterbury and welcome to your wife back to counterpoint thank you very much indeed for taking the time to talk to us this morning thank you so our third public participation item this morning is Hugo Christensen 's from the South New Brighton residents association who will address us regarding suburb boundaries and flood boundaries and the advice I 've had at this is a different topic than the South Shore matters which are already under consideration by the council so Hugo welcome thank you for joining us this morning and you have five minutes to address the council thank you Hyorin thank you very much for listening to our concerns Eve we are going to split this between us so you have a little bit there changes between pages Sheamus is going to start and so just to introduce myself thank you thanks a lot I 'm secretary of the residents Association so will we have eight pages here we 'd split them between the fact that there seemed such Braton seems to be have been excluded from a lot of reports and there seems to be a lot of confusion between names and definitions for geographical areas the first page you see here in your copy is from the Jacobs multi hazard report for some reason such Brighton is not mentioned in that and South Brighton as you know was one of the worst affected areas after the Christchurch earthquakes the Canterbury Earthquake sequence this report may never be released as it is still in draft format but it contains very very interesting information on lots and lots of areas and South that needs it very important before the things listed for a proper land assessment for the definition of the recovery budget where it 's going to be spent for the use of rates for a coastal protection and for civil defense a lot of these things have been raised in the past when we look at the boundaries we you know our definition of the boundaries originates from the council that we 've given very definition it 's the soft side side of Caspian state to the research in the West South Brighton 's of its significance of silence during the Canterbury Earthquake in fact the land sank sunk so much that mark large forested areas sunk into the salient Coast coastal waters the subsidence were so significant that temporary stop banks were erected up to 120 centimeters higher than the subsided land here you see an illustration of some of the worst affected area there on page three we have the Canterbury fact-finding project report that was published in August 2011 but it does not include such Brighton which is again and remind you one of the worst affected areas the area covered by the study at the time it relates to were the eastern suburbs of Christchurch along the Athan River but em such Brighton has been left out again so this was commissioned by the minister the Ministry the next page is the mayor of task task force it reports on on a large area from pages wrote to end of South Shore and the area is referred to as the South Shore study area it refers through believe it out that we have complained over this record in 2014 and so recently as well the following pages from the ministry for the environment Aven climate change case study in this case South Brighton is not excluded but South Brighton is located in South Shore so we 've been trying to find where the the boundaries are between the different suburbs this is another example of the confusion that arises if people give the wrong names to the wrong geographical areas so the assessment of the impacts of sea level rise and floodplain management planning for the Aven River was the subject of the study and it was prepared by Harris consulting in conjunction with the Christchurch City Council in 2003 so things like this need to be cleared up so that we know exactly what we 're talking about and what and budget is being allocated to which area then we go to a document from the Environment Court since 2003 which the first will be cash flow case and in that particular bottom end there is a map of the South Brighton coastal management area reaching area is commonly known as South Shore and the following map there is one that we raised with the keyboard over the last few months these again are two maps published by the City Council one of them shows South Brighton with extensive areas of the beachfront included in it that 's the one on the left and the map on the right there shows the map that we are familiar with under our Constitution showing the definitions with it extended coastal areas so this has implications for rates what rates are being collected for each suburb what rates are being spent on coastal defence systems etc etc so this okay needs to be cleared up when you switch back to the last page which refers back to the Jacobs multi hazards report in the tsunami map on that particular report it appears that the risk which has been identified in South Brighton is not included on the on the Jacobs report this may reflect the civil defense responses etc and we asked that though the boundary to soft Brighton revisited in terms of the recovery and the following issues the damage occurred hazard exposure and mitigation communicated and addressed civil defense response and community awareness of hazards addressed the use of r8 assigned according to agreed boundaries so that brings us to the end of the five minutes thanks very much indeed for the presentation we can certainly refer this document and the content of your presentation to to staff and clearly there is a linkage between some of the issues that you 've raised and our ongoing work so we 'll certainly refer the issues that you 've raised to staff by way of this document thank you very much indeed for taking the time to talk to us this morning thank you thank you very much for listening so that brings us to the end of item 3.1 the public forum _"

Peter 's no for the process we 're going to need it for the process for the for the long term claim right so so that 's been moved by Bucky it 's been seconded by butum any discussion I 'll put your mo yes I think is very happy to support this as I said from the previous iTunes debate I 'm happy personally to be donating directors fees to good causes and charities and this is most certainly one of them if the last item hadn 't have gone through I still would 've been donating every cent to this like I said and very happy to support it now and respect the council 's decision on the prior one and happy to see the start and just in closing the debate and just his this has come from I suppose the debate the the piece having moved it hey-ya does and and one of the things you 'll see in here is that we 've tried to make it as an embracing as we can because we can 't predict what innovations there will be and we 're also working with the sustainable initiatives fund trust and we 've got just under a million dollars left as well so that we work alongside them to to make sure that we can do more than we might otherwise be able to do I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried _"

    "text": "and don 't let me down right policy for the appointment and remuneration of directors to council organizations mr. Thompson thank you for all your hard work on this it 's fine please it would you would you go I I have been honored and I moved to the heart of this project into a brought this policy to you today thank you um would you like to just take us through some of the the main amendments from the paper that we saw last week but the food service rate yes when we clarified the legal liability around members who weren 't being paid there 's no difference there you 're still subject to the same rights and obligations as a director of a company we have modified the wording and paragraphs 510 and 511 just to clarify that the CCOs and CC TOS that there are no council directors on doesn 't include c CH oh he clarified that paragraphs nine ten nine eleven and taught nine twelve the evening immediate and that arose out of a discussion I think the point was it was raised by Jamie council organizations or council controlled organizations or CC tos then instead we 've got to recognize the element of public service referred to the council has resolved that a person appointed to the governing body of Annex organization in his or her capacity as an elected member or employee will not receive the remuneration otherwise payable which I think was was generally agreed was a better way to put it 6.2 of the policy you may recall that we had I had recommended we set up a small panel to deal with the appointments of elected members to council organizations it has been suggested that the members of the panel be the mayor and the deputy mayor rather than what I had in their initial e there 's also been some discussion around the recipients the first recipients of the proposal that elected members do not receive the remuneration they might otherwise be entitled to and the recommendation is that half of the fees from CC HL plus the fees from Christchurch New Zealand I think it is will go to the innovation and Christchurch indeed take place your chin around the wrong way I 'm just getting everyone used to the expression yeah okay a bit of read read my notes in make sure I get it right I don 't want to be in the same position again resolves that the organization 's I 'm sorry I haven 't got the latest thanks let 's dip sorry it 's not right it 's not right didn 't_''_241.04 we go back to my my original yes what what I 've got is the what we should have is the innovation and sustainability fund to receive half the remuneration payable to council directors appointed to the board of Christchurch City Holdings Limited and all of the remuneration paid to councilor directors appointed to the board of Christchurch in said and the mayor 's Welfare Fund to receive half the remuneration paid to councilor directors of CC HL and all of the remuneration payable to the director appointed to trans waste that was so that we need to change that I 'm sorry I 'm not quite sure how that happened Joe do you want me to bring this over to what I 'm happy to move this and sit in the back Andrew so are there any questions I 'm David Aaron and Phil given the oil all deemed by IRD to be self-employed what advice have we sought from IRD as to shipping from a position where directors fees are text in my mind correctly so to a position where directors fees still earned by count council of directors are directed by council resolution to be donated untaxed to council charities and CCAC CTAs are simply required to comply with my resolution that 's quite a detailed question David it would have been nice maybe if we had that discussed at the earlier sessions we had Carol you either able to answer that it 's a tax issue you know the part of the the question is is about instead of council of phase being paid to counselors who are self-employed and for which tax would therefore be paid that these are donations made and lower fee so episode directors foregoing fees and donations paid obviously without texts being paid into the well one 's a trust and ones as an alternative to paying fees which tax would be paid for so does that raise any issues with the onion revenue department because part of what started to all of us being challenging from the start was that question because there wasn 't an easy way for council laws to receive work out what the tax implications were and then pay and in fact this mechanism was designed in order to remove the problem so no fees are paid to council directors Council or directors they are paid there is a donation made and lieu of fees to a named source so but is that okay with Inland Revenue as the questioning the income no in the last four years I 've now donated one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to various things like the directors fees the accountants advice is that because I haven 't_''_497.289 received the income there is no tax liability for that and that was the advice I received from my accountant oh well I suppose I 'm a little disappointed that we 've had no real advice of that position conveyed in a proper to ask it 's probably a little convoluted as well I 'm aware of the chairman of at least a couple of our CEOs and CTO is being absolutely aghast about the resolution of proposed on their board whilst they 're obliged to comply what discussions have been held with the relevant board chairs regarding the implications of the directive and how does that directive comply with boards constitutions I would need to amend its constitution to legally comply with the directive should the letter of expectation for each board be revised to make provision for the resolution and the taxation issues that face each board as a consequence a consequence of this proposal me is welfare fun not for the yeah yeah pretty here okay alright so sorry was it with other Christians I 'm Erin and then Phil um so got a interesting one and it 's around number four it 's up there if we are making the decision today and I 'm assuming we aren 't making a decision which means that all members come in with a clear and open mind around making their decision a board or appointed to a board make a decision when it potentially has the financial implication to that member we have a weird like most summer questioners are we on safe ground doing that that 's not charged yes this is a policy that you 're adopting so that the other server the order to general draws a distinction between decisions of this nature and decisions that may be specific to a matter being dealt with by one of the CCOs or an organization that you might be part of so I don 't think there 's an issue with you considering and making this decision today not for me someone appointed on one side no the council as a whole right okay so that 's my question then my other one is a follow on on the taxation one and that would be around if councilor is making a donations pick a number of ten thousand dollars a year to one of these organizations can they not claim that takes on that cannot be set up differently that they would then get it back as a donation because or thirty a year there 's there 's a substantial claim back native restaurant no but that 's my point effort if it 's channel differently and you did receive it and pay tax aren 't you would then okay so there 's no benefit to do it that way no okay and fill in these may be in place what I just want to make I 'm supportive of of these proposals and I 'm just referring to 911 in in a bill and make sure is probably have we got or can we develop some processes so that in fact there 's no perception whatsoever the when it comes to making a decision about for example an application to one of the funds that there 's any perceived bias even on the part of counselors so the question really is do we have or should be here not here if we don 't should we not have some very clear processes around that part of it we can develop those prices yeah yeah all right so um is there any discussion about the with the resolution yeah but being one of significant interest of a self though obviously the current councillors and importantly also the future councillors I have an appreciation when I was elected that I was applying for a position where should I have the record school sit I may have the opportunity to apply for a position on the board with committee or remuneration it 's now about back into getting a job then the job spec changes and you 're told sorry you can 't narrow in what was that lined and the job spec when you applied for it I 've sort of had a discussion before about IRD determination I believe under the IRD determination I am a self-employed contractor if I was an employee of council I would expect to reimburse Y directors fees to my employer however I am self-employed so should not need to do so this directors and my opinion is an intrusion into the role of a self-employed person just talking a little bit about bullying dynamics council appointed directors will sit alongside independent directors who are paid all share the same liability for their decision making risk and exposure to actions that can be pursued should they make ill-founded decisions in some cases councillors sit on a board with members of other territorial authorities who are paid for their services that 's an extreme anomaly to pay some and not others which may in the long run create a situation where experienced directors both independent and counsellor will not make themselves available to a board where there is this inconsistency not to mention the taxation irregularities each board one here I actually consider this to be a rather Orwellian attitude the resolution has synergies with animal fun all animals are equal but eventually some animals become more equal than others now I was being asserted that some of us attend many meetings unpaid I 'm certainly out civil-rights a week and have numerous weekend engagements all unpaid and most were there the risk and liability that exists in a directorship the ability of a counselor who has relevant boardroom experience to sit on a council board and be remunerated and my mind is no different to an MP with experience being asked to be a cabinet term when the favored charity of one councillor was in strife and suddenly the rules changed in donations to a charity of choice was allowed personally I believe a director should be paid for their time and expertise recognizing the principles integrity legal responsibilities of the role and the qualifications and experience they have gained over long a long period however on reason be pragmatic enough to appreciate that I 'm expressing a minority viewpoint I 'm unlikely to win the day however I feel compelled to express my views there is a slightly more palatable solution that could be pursued should the desire to donate directors fees be pursued I would actually use that consideration be given to one the council director fees be paid to the that the councilor director sorry being paid for the board service he or she contributes that those fees earned are then subsequently text at source that the residual fees are donated that a list of appropriate donation recipients be established and that directors can choose where the ADEA fees are to be donated such a move I believe would certain or comfortably often news phrase I think this is a revolting proposition I will not support the resolution and each others not not to support it and to allow time to work a reason solution that 's it 's more comfortably with our CIOs and CTOs and with those who sit on their various boards both now and in the future thank you okay Dion so Jamie Sara there 's some good points actually there Dave I I appreciate the thought and I hadn 't actually heard of that option before which is actually quite handy but anyway so I will not be supporting number seven purely because if I 've tried to get this conversation head a couple of times but I 've people have just been too busy and never got it there but anyway I had signaled up the other day that I wouldn 't support there the reason is that I want to choose where I would be putting directors fees that I 'm well I 'm not on any directorships at the runt but that potentially could be paying into the future I 'm very strong advocate the mental health ward it was a shock that how little money they had to be able to deal with the needs that he would have needed to survive and so I would actually prefer to give my money to the Mental Health Foundation for that very reason so I mean I won 't support number seven and if you want to break it up they 're not support the first six because in principle I do support giving directors fees and our role to to to a charity of choice but that 's where I saw whether Phil Jamie Sarah Glen look ice I strongly support the recommendations actually my view is that as elected members to counsel Tilly as is in the report tone that component of in a very important component of public service and I think that an example of that is that the counselors around this table who have knowledge and skills more in the social and support supporting our communities area and in fact those schools just as important and equally important as for example counselors whether out financial skills which are acknowledged in and it where there are some equity around the table and and having fees paid into these funds I think helps achieve that rather than some counselor say meriting more than others so you know we have a slogan here at Council one council working together with integrity and passion and I think we all stand for that and not urge counselors to support these recommendations Jamie Sarah Glen thanks yeah I 'm going to vote against this and if the decisions made to reject this and indeed remunerated reduce any money reimbursed to me for the work that I 've done in these council dredge roles I will donate in their entirety to charity and I want to stress that so that my argument to be taken truly is objective and understand that my stance is based on principle and not financial gain if anyone 's going to quote me on any part of wise support company director remuneration they need to include that precursor because otherwise it 's completely out of context but I think it should be the individuals call if Dion wants to donate it to kid to school or pay for educational medical bills or reducer mortgage I think that that 's the call to make I ask that you do keep an open mind to this listen to what I 'm saying and please be open to change your mind if you think what I 'm saying is valid my first point around us is that you get what you pay for our policy as a city is that our company directors fees are 80 percent that of the private sector and this is to reflect the element of public service but to still attract quality candidates now what would it look like if you wanted to hire staff with a specialized skill set and experience and were that carried additional liability but the pay was zero a good and diverse council doesn 't need to have everyone with company director business acumen but you do need some especially if we think that having a CCO board link with the council is a value which we do the factors fear remuneration is affected and attracting quality candidates if the aren 't in quality ones pay but if one of them is a capable councillor derrida it makes it far easier for the public to get rid of them from both the council and from that board if they 're not performing the public can 't_''_1354.35 do that for independent directors my second point around this is liability Dave 's touched on the tax liability but honestly it does look like a nightmare some people being paid for the same job who pays the text on the income in the instance that it appears that you know loading up with a tax liability is the council liable for that with a company that 's paying it to Council Dave just questions also now raises can you claim on expenses related to that work or if not and the relationship between a company in the director is a private one so technically that current practice should have the fee the current practice should have the fees page the individual with a letter stating that the council wants you on the board and that they want the fees but they 'll undignified for your text liability and the net after tax amount but anyway leaving tax I think that just illustrates how complicated that is because it 's it 's hard to get some consistencies there you know that the law is different for company directors lenders for counselors it 's hard to sue someone for doing an incompetent job when I do it for free you know try complaining about beg coffee when it was given to you free of charge the inconsistency here is that all the real-world liabilities our company of a company director still applies if you 're on a board of a company you can be prosecuted under the Securities Act the Commerce Act or destruction new Health and Safety Act it 's almost certain that they will be company directors that will be prosecuted or go to prison over the coming years because someone died a poor due to a poor company board decision and that 's irrelevant to whether they might be a City Council but they will not be a City Council of prosecuted or go to prison because someone died due to the accounts of poor decision because when it counts their ex and their counselor capacity but not if they 're a company director so what I 'm saying is the law makes this distinction the outside world remunerated to this distinction and I feel it 's both commercially and morally wrong for us to not respect that the liabilities are extensive and why professional indemnity insurance if you think that professional indemnity insurance will stop you being personally prosecuted as director that is a complete fallacy that 's part of the reason why company directors are remunerated and my third and final point is if you want to board to perform you need to have a board of parity and peers imagine going to your work doing a job and a good job at that that 's required of you taking on additional legal liability and then for the other people that are doing the exact same job as you sitting next you to be remunerated but you 're not it breeds a clear a and a B team what about someone on that non-remunerated B team that slam with a pile of work they need that they 'll put an every ounce of effort like they should when they know that they 're literally not valued for it like the others are do you think they 'll put up your hands take on or engage over and above additional due diligence I would and I hope that others would too but I think there 's a far higher chance that not everyone will if a counselor doesn 't do the due diligence and gets it wrong they don 't run the rest of prosecution of jail time but a company director does there 's no out Clause like the res for counselors the only argument that I can accept around directors fees not being payable to the person doing the work as the parallel when a staff members appointed to a board and it goes to the company but I think the difference here is twofold one city councillors are legally not staff members as davidís said that 's why you pay additional taxes like ACC and can 't receive KiwiSaver contributions just like a director when the staff mean but isn 't remunerated it base salary of the job reflects that but in this role it does not know councillors appointed to boards is a right it 's not it 's not a a job that goes with the role did you know the counts there isn 't on CT HL they need to apply for it submit a CV go through an interview process with an independent recruitment company and if they 're capable they 're selected on merit and capability you know I can accept that the last term 's directors weren 't remunerated because a proper interview process didn 't occur however in this term it has been followed properly and it 's in keeping with the proper process so I think remuneration here would be consistent just finally I think that it 's a councilors choice that if they want to put the name forward for an additional role like this or not it is completely up to them but equally it should be the end of a jewels call if like me they want to donate that remuneration to charity or not if it 's going to medical bills and it 's no one else 's business I think the law makes it very clear the distinction between the roles and I just think that there 's some pirita that we as a council do thank you Sarah tingling thank you I 'd like to address a couple of points that I 'm both councilor a sting Gough who 've made I 'd like to start by disagreeing with councilor east and there I you know twelve months ago when we were going through the election campaign I did not see myself as applying for a job I saw myself putting my hand up for public service and I think that 's quite a different thing the change in the the directorship fees in and where they might go was well foreshadowed both in the previous term and prior to the election and I think that anyone standing in the previous election would not have been expecting to have renumeration for their directorships councillor Goff mentions that it as people 's choice completely as to whether they apply for these directorships or not and it is completely true and won 't be remunerated for it and that that money will go to a good cause I disagree with and the potential to choose where you put your money I think that that runs the risk over time of people poking in choosing charities or organizations within their own Ward and being perceived to be buying votes in some cases and I think that is a really dangerous path for us to go down I think that funds such as the mayor 's Welfare Fund in the last term the Imagination Station which is a metropolitan organization and now the sustainable development fund I think are really really good ones to be looking at for a citywide project rather than a perception of potentially buying boats and our Ward 's we are remunerate I think that counseling office was incorrect when he said that you know people would be taking on extra workload without remuneration because actually we are well paid I know that some people were you know took a pay cut but you know this is the most I 've ever int and I feel like I am 't think that the extra responsibilities that I 've taken on in various areas should be paid any more than that and I 've taken on ones for various organizations that aren 't directorships and probably spend just as many hours doing them and I don 't see that that that would mean that I should be paid any more it 's part of my job as a counselor to do those having staff on boards as very similar it 's part of the job and they like us are paid by the ratepayers to do our jobs and so that 's why I 'll be supporting this today so that we can enhance these funds for Metropolitan benefit and just get on with doing our public service jobs thank you Glen and Andrew okay thank you just three quick points just the first I think in point for recognizing the element of public service is the starting point for me that underpins what we do that our work is in fact not a job but a vocation and they 're out of that if we are appointed as a city councilor in the first place secondly just a something to consider is the dynamic that was prevalent in a previous council of which I was a part where certain councillors received additional renew Mauritian with the directorships and it really served to split the council and that was it 's not much fun looking in the annual report the public annual report to see which councillors are receiving additional enumeration on top of those that aren 't you know it 's fair to say there was a strong correlation between that and said in voting patterns and importance that this council 's similar to that the previous the previous council came in determined that it would be United and that it would work together for the city and we have to remain united aesthetic Galatea is Gillett Arianism that that phil was talking about which I 'm appealing to today and thirdly I 'm happy for the the trans waste fees to go to the mayor 's Welfare Fund there 's some people in real dire straits in the city the two standout features is as Vicki will we arrears so if you imagine people struggling to keep warm in the winter and whereas for us we may not think about that or a few imagine people struggling to pay the rent and we don 't think about that and and for many of those people that comes down between a trade-off between food rent arrears and heating and often they have to choose two out of three on some cases one out of three so you can 't live like that I mean I don 't_''_1938.789 I know there 's a range of views on this but to me a hundred and one thousand dollars it 's actually a pretty good you know the numeration for what we do I don 't need any more but I know a lot of people in this city who do so I please urge you to support these recommendations today Andrew thank you I totally support this proposal with respect to the comments from councilor east there are no surprises in my view that this matters before us today that it 's come before this council and I 'm also not expected rubbing his comments might have held some water in the last term of counsel however in this term given the history of the matter I don 't think there 's any surprise that we 're having this discussion today and I don 't think there 'll be any surprise at what I expect to be the outcome no Council is forced to go on any board they simply don 't have to do so there 's no element of arm-twisting here I don 't have an issue with the level of skill or confidence that any current councillors that have been appointed to boards have and I don 't think that an expectation that there would be no remuneration paid for those roles has resulted in a lower level of skill or competence or ability in the appointments that we 've made uncomfortable that that can and will continue to be the case as a result of this resolution today in terms of the distribution of the directors fees to charitable causes I think the breadth of needs individuals and organizations that can be funded through the two funds terms of the directorships and trustees ships that I hold on I feel valued exactly the same as the next person at the table and in terms of the effort that I put in I know that I put in exactly the same amount of work in preparation for meetings and contribution at meetings as I would if I was paid it makes absolutely no difference to me at all there are plenty of other things that I could go off and do if I wasn 't comfortable with the level of salary that this role paid me and I imagine that I 'm not on my own when I say that the money wasn 't my motivation for running for election that may well be the case for everyone around the table as regards gifting to a charity of choice and I 've got some sympathy for Darren 's comments earlier I could easily set up the Andrew Turner Banks Peninsula charitable trust as a charitable organization I could appoint some of my close friends as trustees in accordance with the trust deed that we all agreed with and organization and then distributed according to a distribution regime of which myself and my friends had been the architects that might have implications for the way in which people in my ward might view my of generosity my TB translates into votes as an election I know it 's an extreme example but I think it demonstrates why we need a reasonably tight distribution regime as we 've got in the report today so I 'm going to vote for this we all own a reasonable salary we all know the bread from the nature of the role and we all knew that before we decided to stand for election or at least I hope we did there are a limited number of hours in the week that are naturally limited by time different councillors spent those hours in different ways but there 's a limited number of hours that we can work I don 't think that that means that different councillors should be remunerated in different ways for that limited amount of time that we all have and we 're all very very aware of so I 'm I 've got respect for the different issues that have been raised and that 's certainly my position I 'll be supporting this this wholeheartedly and I implore others to do the same thank you okay I 'll just wrap it up first of all I sort of well what I want to thank everyone for the respect with which we 've debated the issues everyone 's entitled to have a view and we don 't all have the same view around the table but I think people have been very respectful and I thank you all for that I I 'm going to take a little bit of responsibility in this regard because I do want to apologize to councillors for not having this paper ready for the previous council to consider but now that it 's here on the table we have got an opportunity to establish a a framework for our future councils so if a future council wants to revisit this issue then they can do so but this is where we start we start each term with the decision that we make today and I actually run through the numbers but counselors are paid almost twice what it can members are paid that paid nearly three times or almost three times what selwyn counselors are paid and and well more than twice what why my career counselors are paid so I think when we 're doing comparisons between you know sitting who sat next to and decision making environments I just think that you know we 're in a reasonably different position here in Christchurch is a large city because those the remuneration Authority makes a decision based on the size of the council not the amount of work that people do there 's an assumption that there 's a correlation but actually every council around this table will know that there isn 't a direct correlation because there are issues that come up in your wards that suddenly just you know take your your work rate up a thousandfold and then at other times things that are quiet and down and that somebody else 's turn to sort of be involved in serious issues and there are some some councillors that just seem to am going to just acknowledge what Glenn said to direct paid directorships can be divisive they can be they don 't have to be but they can be and that 's the it 's the fact that they can be that has driven my view that we should have done this some time ago and there are complex issues and we have taken advice so that 's why it has taken so long my final point around choosing charities people have made the comment about us being self-employed we 're self-employed because you can 't pinpoint an employer but actually we 're all really employed on behalf of the people of Christchurch and as a when I was a member of parliament we were not treated as self-employed for tax payer so although we were we were self-employed there 's a statement and the legislation that covers members of parliament that sees that for tax purposes you will be treated as an employee and the decision to not treat counsellors and community board members and mirrors and chairs and members as as count as employees that decision was made by with councils around this country so if anyone wants to revisit the question of whether we 're employees or whether we 're self-employed it took me a while to work out of a self-employed because I was just so used to the environment of being treated as an employee then then it has to go through a process and would require a change of the law but that doesn 't make us any less accountable to the people of Christchurch in terms of choosing charities obviously there 's there 's some sympathy with that but under this proposal it 's not the councillors money and that 's the reason that I don 't support changing that but each each year when we choose the financial year this now requires us to come back and revisit it so it may well be that there will be a different fund that will be chosen in the future but at the options there so you know I 'd like to leave it like this for the 2017 18 year I think to get the innovation and sustainability fund off to a flying start Fund has enjoyed up until now I think really does enable both of those things to be achieved so again thank you very much for the quality of the debate and on that note I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so it 's David and Jamie and Dion vote against seven items yeah so Joe just if you can record dear David eye on the monitors yes please yeah yeah it will be figure it 's good so that 's carried thank you very much and look that um I think we might _"

    "text": "thank you but will regime do that for when I 'm here the next one is the metropolitan discretionary response fund who 's who 's leading this one is this user key now I got through a committee that here 's a glance remedy okay let 's come straight here right right I 'm sorry oppa man I 've misunderstood this I thought this has gone through a process already so we 're considering us for the first time is anyone got any questions Yanni Sarah mark as it might know I just I mean in terms of the kapa haka competitions I was just trying to understand given the the success that we 've had with these previously and we 'll what the nish you know obviously the national one was here a few years ago just why why would only recommend 10,000 and whether or not we 'd talk to crush it and said about co-sponsoring it just so you may like um that it 's it 's something that would would merit further support so just interested wave come up with 10,000 Johansson ahaha these they are the discretionary Response Fund as yes you know significantly less than our annual funding but gets it was felt that a ten thousand dollar contribution would enable the event to to happen as that correct whether the group you know having to we put a bit further work and making it happen but you know the council 's support would ensure that it does happen um I don 't think that this is a this isn 't a major event so probably wouldn 't fall under um the Christchurch E&Z guidelines for support from them and as a regional event that 's run every two years so and although it does have a large but as building its momentum with on the secondary schools for motor performing arts zero these of course our recommendations to counsel counsel as you know can but that 's gonna be held quite shortly so Kevin you 're satisfied if we give the amount that 's recommended it will still go ahead yes yeah he 's a question at the embarrass goals so this is that um project state government cut funding to some time had picked up more funding it 's when we were valued enough in the past to do multi-year funding and all the other local territorial authorities have pitched in funding as well it would seem that we should as well and I know that the Metropolitan funding itself was really stretched and we had lots of discussions about how to distribute the money in that this one was late I have a feeling meat while if this one had comment on time it would have got some funding through that process we to go through a process where many of the organizations that weren 't recommend because there wasn 't enough funding ended up getting sort of seventy seventy five percent through that process when we reallocated and redistributed I 'd really like to see this one get some funding and I 'm sort of purchasing maybe twenty thousand okay and that is the council 's prerogative Kantor to fund or not when we discussed this one at the you have to start penile yeah I was one of what you know there was a number of applications that either just felt that if we approve or recommend funding for these women you know this group although you know very very worthy as carrying some reserves and when you 're looking at its financials probably could cope through 20th year we just thought sitting that president as the DRF becoming a program for those that forgot or didn 't get applications into the ECM which is what does it mean that the discretion response fund could be extended all in one hope and we did defer some from metro to diaries ' receiveth has ability to Grant 's awaiting the outcome of the department yeah thing is that while some organizations carry some reserves that what that tends to do is give some certainty for the employees correct so what would happen I don 't know the extent of the reserves we don 't need to know the numbers here but if we didn 't give this and the reserves are so depleted that they weren 't go wouldn 't be able to give certainty to see the paid staff him some things they 've got what are the schools how did that work well I mean we we do have the the latest audited financials I won 't go into numbers I 'm if you don 't want me to but they are carrying enough and and the view of of staff they have looked at them you know as well as accumulated surpluses from the year before that they should be able to take a sum without being so to detrimentally okay but they would definitely need funding from us next year potentially later well I would reserve based on that the the the latest financials were chose off 31st December 16 they it 's a long time ago yeah they did then that this is why it 's difficult so you know but they also head arm carryover surpluses and and from the year before that as well my viewers not necessarily but it 's probably too soon to say without seeing the next lot of so there 's 27 Christchurch City schools that are involved in the program do you know how many from Waimakariri and Selwyn and the other areas that that those districts in unfortunately the Stacey the adviser who made this application as a network so that would be something I would have to come back with do we know how the other districts would see it if we weren 't pitching an hour part and you know whether that would mean that they sort of virtually subsidizing a skills not offhand again you know however we have contributed funding over the past few years this I guess like I said isn 't a direct reflection of the application it was the overall view that they do have money in their bank they must the application deadlines for the strengthen communities fund and I guess if we if we grant this wound in are we going to also look at all of the other ones edges so you know we do also think about the budget available and you know it 's it is until the 30th of June next year or until the money 's gone and there is no through the top up there is funding and therefore thus now if we chose to correct yeah well no I was going to ask a question as well because my my viewers the theity because I 've seem to recall this but I 'm I 'm my memories and it doesn 't act quite as well as others and my memory was was that if you look at the funding history 5,000 30,000 30,000 I think we 've really put them on a line item as a result of a decision to cut them and then a mess of plea from them actually yes I know but they 've coming back from 30,000 tell me what why were they late why don 't they miss the deadline um I just I don 't want to say they forgot but for whatever should they forget I I 'm not too sure again you know I 've picked this up at short notice with Stacy not being here today so that detail wouldn 't need to come back to you on hands we had talked to them obviously Stacy has had conversations with the group wouldn 't_:_544.02 they have a reasonable expectation of ongoing soon so would they confuse that they were no longer last year was their final year of the multi-year funding I 've got Pauline and Erin and then it will come back to you serious yeah Erin it 's around the other decline the Sanjana God there at the top would cease priority three but in the staff assessment that says the project is recommended as a priority one as it demonstrates best practice through highly titratable integrated service models blah blah blah yeah lists all the work they do which I 'm sure there 's not a person at the table that 's a human being would disagree with and then at the bottom the work usually applies through strengthen communities fund but started advised that they missed the deadline this year so bring you a story and then funding is not recommended as the group has sufficient reserves to continue their work or services but under other sources of funding there 's a big chunk of pending so to answer the first part of your question we try to present these so these go through our processes as as you 're aware that with the discretionary response fund staff make requests for these these ones they go to council still go through the staff panel process and the recommendation could be changed through that process so it has written from the point of the adviser without taking anything else into account other than you know the strength of the application then it comes to the description of response panel panel where other factors are discussed you know for example not getting the application and time how much money if they got sitting in reserves and the available budget that we have to allocate over the course of the year so we try to without change to the wording of the advisor have a little comment you know at the bottom that just basically reflects that it 's going through a process and there was some discussion and and then it changed but that doesn 't change the fact that it is the week they do a p1 being normally apply to strengthening communities they miss their deadline so they 're here and now they get bumped because they potentially got whereas if it had gone through the other hard question does potentially and likely I would think similar to envira schools yeah so then again it 's a matter of you know the available budget and the metropolitan discretionary response fund and you know we are aware of other applicants there must be application deadlines as well and I you know if we see it that precedent that they can come to the D Aria which there is nothing in the criteria to say that they can 't would just mean that the fund would be expended the sight of Christmas which has the council 's problem you know and as councils money to allocate and I would just mean that there would be nothing further to allocate until the 1st of July next year from this fund yeah I just have to note that because I looked it up on the one thing I have to declare an interest on the sanjana for one my sister 's the deep each year of the trust say I won 't be voting on that one so I 'm going back to Sierra then Jimmy a couple of things my its discretionary metro fund well before the end of the financial year I would do it before the end of the financial year I wouldn 't say often well before the advantage in the with the pickney miracles the audit accounts are from December last year we significant weight on from then in December would seem to be a time when the accounts would be full of the grants that they have received from places like the Christchurch City Council that the the incident near account and I used up for wages and other things over the year so by the time well the December accounts might look quite good we don 't we couldn 't really expect that they would be just as good now yeah not necessarily about you know me look like we 've only got a record of the 15 and 16 financials at the moment 2050 that accumulated surpluses of three hundred twenty one thousand sixteen they had accumulated surpluses of five hundred and sixty two thousand so it 's no low mean you know it 's we we weigh it all up I think and communities ideally yeah but you would have liked to fund of them through string communities yes yeah Jay King I remember last time when the council review metropolitan strengthen community fine but some of the items who even where highlight however the miss out these four is the only door for the kind or part of application bring to the visit is question your file for discussion or still have some other one where people in to release the discretion of fine review later on we still have other applications yes okay but last night particular I highlighted the song thanks to our my friend of society the the application your nation you 'd like to talk to me update status but I didn 't hear from you oh there may be print released this time you know now we haven 't actually received there I 'm happy to speak positively our sort of obvious medium I can catch up whether Law Review it 's fine thank you oh I 've got what knit you okay sorry I fell within poor lane Michael is going back to San John is one were they one of the organizations who would have previously had that multi-year funding and then it finished as a major organization category or they they world multi-year funding previously been like westrom so my question really is get government they 've had their previously would they pressive and it was coming to an end after three years because they 've assumed an effect they weren 't eligible then change their minds I don 't know I 'm not too sure I mean if they if they had got the replication and to the strengthening communities fund they could have applied for multi-year funding still apply they still could have applied through that fund or though you know council made it made it a different decision at the end of the decision meeting around there okay but then and then just following on Erin 's point under the other sources of funding that they haven 't got their met with there 's no confirmation they 've actually received those funding if other funding applications they applied through so you know they 'll have to await the outcomes of do carry significant amounts and they 're you know by way of cash equivalents in their bank deposits so they do have a reasonable amount of liquid money they had you know retained surplus of two point just under 2.1 million they do carry significant money though that money offshore is tagged and required for some things we just took the view that they can probably cope with not receiving funding carry those fund so that 's the main reason they were doing one of the reasons and you know also the recommending fun colorful groups that list a deadline okay opening up as well please Olivia thanks money Pauline and then sir again right well I just think that because the environment bio schools it 's almost like a partnership between you know iki and the other authorities between those two they put in a hundred and ninety two and I think that if we didn 't fund us something we would actually be leading that team down and and possibly risking their in mana so I 'd like to move that we fund them ten thousand dollars just support you and we part of the group that supports you I think would be very bad look if we didn 't give them anything so I 'd like to move that we fund them 10,000 I was just going to check um something someone else did treatment so while they 've been accumulating some surpluses do we know whether that 's tagged for so that 's the that 's the overall national organization not just the Christchurch section isn 't it yeah so it 's it 's over the entire organization for the whole country not just local funding and and that might well be taped to to arrange a things like you know building or you know you know place to work out of and things because we saw it increasing over the last couple of years that 's I guess was uniform part of the recommendation as well but you are correct that could be taken and it 's yeah so I 'm happy believing 20 the recommendation when we were looking to reduce expenditure in this area was not to fund them and we made a 's not the council 's that weren 't here to fund this is one of our you know you know we 've been talking about establishing a new way of partnering with community organizations and this is one of the ones that I think we should partner with with other others who are part of that funding pool because then it 's a genuine partnership between us again the other councils end to a matter of foundation on behalf of them by our schools so but we can we can take it I mean I was in favor of the thirty thousand so I 'm 20 okay all right so so you 'll move 20 and that 's thickened up by Yanni my I just want to check if Paul dents gonna foreshadow that ten thousand well look that let 's let 's

    "text": "good morning good morning I 'm out of to this go to a counselor sorry mr. manager it 's come straight to counsel so this is yeah I mean I 've obviously updated discussion with some of the counselors then I was excited by the English descriptor as I am so but certainly the gift of the name so I 'd really like to deal with that as as an item first and then if we 're able to deal with the descriptor then so be it but if we not it 's not as urgent as the as the gift might that be right thank you so would you like me to outline what is in the report around the the gift of the Maori name yep okay thank you so really we 've got think we 've got that in the probably the key points are in the context in background section so as the Muir has said multiple query and night to Hariri had gifted a Maori name Turanga for the library and in terms of the cultural narrative so they have been working with us to comes to the name as you can see in it some 5.3 that reflects the relationship with fatir a er the traditional name for the Cathedral Square so it 's very much firmly rooting that name in the place itself and in the oral tradition as you can see the fatir a was the name of Pi Kia 's house Paikea being the ancestor who traveled here on the back of a whale and Turanga was we have PI Kia 's house the location for PI Kia 's house so as I say it fits in with that whole cultural narrative and it 's very firmly placing our new facility in the heart of Cathedral Square which of course is where it is so that 's probably the the key element in the work that we did the research that we did in looking at a name in a naming convention the this approach of using the name the Maori name as that as the predominant name for that for the facility was very much supported by the research that was undertaken which involved looking at best practice and examples people in the community key key segments of the community around their ideas and Association it 's not about tutoring per se but what des libraries mean to them and where our libraries heading and how can how can we are firmly position of this wonderful new facility within within Christ huge okay Sarah who is that over there Yanni Andrew Phil everyone thank you I mean I really like do Donna and I can see from the report date with the descriptor a place of discovery the intention is that over time actually the building would just be called to Donna I mean while there 's the tagline for now actually it 's a it 's a case of just getting people used to using the Moldy name yes rather than calling it central ivory or something like that yes yes a very good point that I didn 't cover that so the intention would be that in terms of what is permanently on the building it would it would just be to Donna on the building so the estate that is the name and then using tag lines identify and connect that this is this is our new Central Library that is you know a new proposition for for libraries and and to help with it just the whole promotion wayfinding easy and quick recognition that this is a place you know to draw people as graphics you sorry I lost track I should have I was just trying to understand what to do means what 's the definition of it if it 's like a game at the place where the houseboat where for two hours yes that 's right so it 's little it 's my understanding is that is the location of where punky er Paikea being the ancestor who came on the back of the whale it 's where the house was located in 30 area which is the traditional maori name for cathedral square so it 's very much around identifying it as as being that in the play in that it in that location you 're just trying to understand how that relates to the library and what our library does yes and I think that 's we 're including an English in whatever we put together in terms of the information around this to inform and promote it we need to weave the the function of the of the building into that the given that it you know like I thought if you were looking for a literal English translation you just go on to a translation website and the fact that it means foundation you know that 's one of its actual meanings yes is ideal for describing what a library does it provides the foundation for anything innovation for the future foundation for who we are now I mean this is going to be you know each floor has got a different meaning yes or no do you want to run through those or four floors yes and and if I can just so because I think that 's a really good point too it 's it 's we have got the cultural narrative in the building so we 've got so many opportunities to actually expand on that foundation and location in taking referring back to essentially to Civ than the night are who myths and legend taking as a myth around knowledge acquisition and so that 's actually going to be incorporated into the integrated art some of the design features in the building and we 've got a wonderfully and we will we 've been building on that to tell the story and that 's part of our partnership to and particularly with night to early early voice in terms of art design and that kind of held that that story is curated in the building so just understand that and that you know that that 's fine but this I just would like something that actually describes the services and the offering in the building and so and we I think we talked about this morning like you 've got a place of discovery but is there any reason why we couldn 't just have like two donor and then library underneath or or next to it I mean we don 't have any options in the report so it 's kind of hard to to kind of ask all these questions now and try and find a resolution but it to me it 's that people know what it does and I don 't get there from the name that 's been proposed which is not a criticism of the cops narrative because I support that tool but I want to somehow to incorporate library into the name well I mean if we 're gonna have that debate today then then we will so I mean there will be some that agree with you and there 'll be others like myself who strongly does the gravesite yes sorry termed Phil one Andrew so I really like that what I already do so that it 's not the problem for me that the issue is really what Janice mentioned but this is going it for consultation is that right so this is going to go out to the public or just being decides we 're deciding now that it 's kind of a total at a place of discovery yes or we can just deal with two runners a day which is what I see that that again I would prefer just to deal with it and get there to prove cause I think there it and I think that where you really need some really good value discussion on that the rest of it but I don 't want to get light itself I don 't get the two mixed up because there I see them it 's totally sit through so yeah and I 've got Phil and Ruth in sarakin Thank You Carolyn and all the work that 's gone into this and I love the name Toraja um I guess my question and and I I think that 's what we should settle on today but the my question really is in relation to what might be the straight line but it it 's do you know the number of people who come into the library currently say currently who might be from outside christchurch and not know where it is or even know where it is for a start but it 's the questions really a number of people outside christ church you would go to the library as a percentage per se what we do know is totally we know him from surveys that we did when we were have a large number of visitors to the city whether they 're from overseas or elsewhere that they visitors from else.we as part of it you know it is a tourist destination and a positive destination as well as being for local residents and a couple of the questions I had have already been asked which has been helpful asked and answered so just in terms of if we were to split the two issues so the the naming of the library Tirana which I agree with I think that 's great and I think it 's um it denotes that sense of place it recognizes the cultural history and the cultural history of that part of the central city links past and future in a in a very good way if we were to approve that today does that then still give us the opportunity by way of a further decision because I noticed that that 's the naming so we would name the building tour on them but then the way that name is used any strapline any brand positioning that sort of thing if there was a a place of discovering that could be added by a way of a further decision we wouldn 't take the view that we named the building and that was the end of the naming conversation I I think that would be absolutely fine if counsel wish to take that approach yeah and in that case I 'm happy with approach proposed Sarah and then to Jimmy Page I was just gonna indicate that I 'm actually happy to move both one in two today and it may not be a goal but I 'm actually comfortable with by you know I 'm comfortable with both two but it may not pass I 've got some reasons but the reasons would come out and debate rather than a question time I 've you know I 've got reasons to but we can 't discuss them and is under the ocean whether it 's better to take it offline rather than have you know a discussion which is the real issue here is the gifting of the name to donor and I 'm getting the sense you know like to Papa we we say Papa so to get to accept the gift of the name I think is something that we can do beside ourselves and then any descriptors that are that are developed we can 't actually put that off to another day what I wouldn 't like to see is that we accept a gifted name and then add something like Central Library to it because we 've got to hang out the building that we 're in currently yeah but we currently call it Civic because we haven 't started out the life of the building but I try to but and if we if we put the tagline Central Library or something on then we add by default we would go to see it reliably but it 's not it doesn 't matter yeah because what either descriptor is a grade yeah it will not appear on the front of the boat I know we just got one word as to them if we agree to that today yeah so it doesn 't there 's no other descriptors we don 't it 's just the one roof isn I 've got people speaking Jimmy question one question Kernan the if we review the two point one point two we got into the scope and the process of the community engagement and consultation because in here you put a mention only probably I engage in consultation is night ah who in the proto creative but I remember the Tahoma the Josue Center in daytime we have a policy of for given the name for on the community and the public then we will prepare the tea Hungary 's most welcomed by the particle become popular and also citizen they are also get involved in it they thought that is all the kind of library or our kind of the knowledge synthesis but this time I know perhaps that the Torah is only the molle gift abilities to kind of over mata Mata poly in the night to hurt who lady whether the perfect you know community and health importance surely a blister at least the kind of so the approach that we took there was working with Plato creative to actually do some research and go out and talk and gather a lot of ideas from the community and from that they came back they collated all that and came back with recommendations I 'd be very happy to to share that with council you might find that we 've got a summary of the their results in their analysis of that and also the recommendations of for the naming convention including the use of Turanga and a enter descriptor and straight lines so it 's it 's a kind of a package and that that might be how I 've only just received that yesterday but I 'm very happy to share that if that would be helpful so really that was how the community were engaged [Music] we just heard that as a report it 's just been given to staff yesterday some of us were struggle with us might actually appreciate the opportunity actually be able to understand a bit more about it performing I 'm happy to receive the gift of one yes descriptor the English descriptor could change over time as it captures different groups and different people coming through but the idea is and that lives forever with the buildin and so well libraries and places evolve and there 's different uses and different services the descriptor will change to reflect that but the place in the buildin will always be to Donna and it will be symbolic because it means the place that means a stance and an attitude and it 's I think I personally think that 's incredibly symbolic and very important to Christ in our relationship with monthly yeah you but you you wouldn 't you wouldn 't have number two whatever it is on the face of the building the building 's one name the example said the exact I was saying this now so it 's one I as I can see once we do the permanent name that 's what appears on the outside of the way so I don 't yeah for sure though emotion okay well it 's hard because we don 't have options in the report like normally we 'd have options so I 'm happy to move that we call it the Christchurch library Public Library 200 if that 's what _''_1102.179 that we 're going to have a public library built in the city that doesn 't have library on the idea by approving one we 're also saying that name appears on it so many times used always a descriptor which is used for communications and marketing purposes what what goes on the building and I 'm certainly comfortable with adopting would allow you receiving gift but it 's the way that that 's used that we need to have discussions see this building just hits the one name it is the building time in Avatar yeah ensuring is more of just a marketing thing it 's a bit nebulous really the real issue is do we accept the gift or do we not and then we 've got a we marketing by line there which I 'm every now and again I think we have a tendency disarms overcomplicate simple things and this is a good example of it because I think it all looks pretty good and some people call it the library some people will call it Ranga and that 's great now it 's gonna be know where to go or where the library is so I just let me get on with it there 's more important things on the gingers looking to be received by a magnet eater so no offense to you but in the name of the mirror attorney I think that 'll be great okay it 's exact absolutely [Music] include I 'll see what damage a week is going to do we 've just heard that the staff have got a really good report into how these things have been arrived at which I personally would would welcome so learn it on the table for a week while we can get that report and I 'm just have a greater understanding around how this has been arrived at and coming up with a know consensus around what we can in 600 Christmas if you could I just think we just do this just to wrong and let 's do it and if we want to have a conversation around it 's fine but a vote you know he can 't hold up progress consistently so we 're just going to move that we accept with gratitude the gift of the name to honor from mutter potpourri and not to hurry thee yep sorry I 'm sorry but I 'm accepting that the point that was made yeah and I 'm going to do fear fear the discussion on on an English descriptor and in order to address the other issues note that through the discussion on an Angus to strip descriptor and how that will be used will be here put forth for the new Central Library dessert does that resolution actually prevent us from considering a further descriptor on on the building or not no it actually allows for a further two scopes discussion to be here note that through the discussion on an English descriptor and how that will be used will be here when I 'm here alright so it 's been moved and seconded I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "thank you so okay we 'll just skip new simple library and we 'll move to 23 taylors mistake vectors working party and I 'd like to invite Sarah to introduce this report thank you um so the working party has met three times end on a site visit to tell us and take Hobson 's Bay into Boulder Bay excess to Mota Gardens particularly difficult and rising from that and a lack of further information on Maori garden and the fact that it 's quite a different situation we 'd like to recommend a change to the initial set of terms of reference of the working party the initial resolution didn 't include Hobson 's Bay although that was the understanding that the working party would be looking at Hobson 's days I would like that specifically included in the resolution but also the the working party was of the view that Maori garden was different to the other places that we were looking at which have got high public interest have been through a very robust district plan and Environment Court process and so and we 've also beaches and other places around Banks Peninsula and that moldy garden would be beasts place with those and a new process after this one has finished and so we 'd like to have Maori garden removed from the original terms restaurants for the Working Party the other thing that has come up is that just at our last Working Party meeting which was after this report was written was that it 's clear that while the council has asked the Working Party to recommend whether or not to authorize and under what conditions there is no request for the working party to recommend what to do should we decide not to authorize the batches to stay and so there is some further wording that has just gone up on the screen so including a process for dealing with the outcome should the recommendation be to not authorize the batches and we thought that that would make sense if you were if you were looking for a resolution of the whole issue the other thing is that there was a 2010 resolution that council passed which hits and clauses are not that those ones be revoked they 're under the old district plan so all you 're putting on is or not on their second one so the so it changes takes out Lodi Gardens and puts in Hobson 's Bay yeah yeah no no it 's just the last after the words boulder bay and number two there it 's that last after the comma yeah is the new thing the new recommendation we just want to make sure that the process is really clean and so if yeah if the working party decided not to authorize batches there is nothing currently with our terms of reference which would allow us to make a recommendation to Council as to what to do well other than you would do what you would be recommending I mean I would be doing is recommending that you don 't authorize yet in what is the question right so did you wanna do the wit to work yeah what to do should we decide to recommend not to that 's all otherwise a new process would need to be set up and will likely hurt process for dealing with the outcome because it may well be that the council doesn 't accept the pipe solutely yeah I mean this way the tarika meters are at the very beginning of that paragraph anyway to recompute the council yeah yeah right so so you 'd like to move that yes seconded by andrew is there any questions you discussion Erin yeah I look forward to the outcome of this because it 's I 'm probably glad I 'm not on the working party to be honest but the going forward for a long time I 've always wondered why so many parts of Christchurch and Banks Peninsula are so boring by having a lack of things like beach huts and Brighton and how much that would change the waterfront if we allow the lease of land for that like they have in the UK and people living on badge boats on our rivers and and into boat houses along the edge the history like we could be such a more dynamic and especially of we as we have housing issues and the land affordability becomes the problem in and using our waterways and could be could be interesting so that 's why this is a steep that 'll get us some certainly determine a direction that we may take a lot further down the track for touch for that so I sound weed mom I yeah he only likes people living in boats I just make it clear is that the next stage from here is the community engagement on this so yep Andrew I just make a couple of comments regarding Maori Gardens which for councillors who may not know is on the coast line between rap Aki and Governors Bay at lyttelton harbour there are four small batches which are occupying what appears to be public land there but the issues of Maori gardens are more like the issues of batches and other structures of which there are a number probably an unknown number in many parts of Banks Peninsula many of which have been there for a very long time so the thinking is that the Maori Gardens issues a better dealt with as part of a process that maybe at some point addresses of the city rather than been dealt with as part of this taylors mistake Working Party the issues at Taylors mistake are quite different in as much as there are particular provisions in the district plan there 's the bachelor zone a tailor 's mistake which may form part of our consideration Maori Gardens is definitely more like some of the issues that we would end up considering in other parts of Banks Peninsula where the issues are the same as the Maori gardens ones so for a for all it was originally included in there the the working groups thinking is that Maori gardens that would be better dealt with as part of any process that would look at the wider issue across Banks Peninsula very good um yeah there was some discussion that the working party around that I mean I personally do raise concern that where we 've got batches and high hazard zones or with high risk that we do need a process to actually do do something I think the staff might like to just give a very brief description of the legal possibly the I think we need to set that process up for those others in the port hills ASAP given that some like Marty Gardens are and what I think would be pretty high risk zones for cliff collapse and we 're aware of that we 're aware of that through the district plan process so I think we do have to do something in that regard but I 'm happy to support the resolutions today I just think we also need to start thinking very urgently about what we do with those other areas that are at high risk all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no

    "text": "one performance report for the year in the 30 June 2017 well maybe I 'll get Andrew to introduce that as the tipping chair of the committee and then I 'll hand over to you yeah I mean I 'm certainly happy to introduce the report this is receiving the report it relates to capital carry forwards there are certain aspects of this report that have received some attention and that 's the reason that Carol 's going to make some comments as well just to clarify a number of matters so really it 's probably appropriate that we hear from Carol on on those messes great Thank You Carol I just wanted to clarify a couple of issues you 'll all be quite aware of the recent press article earlier this week and I just thought it 's really important just to highlight a couple of points and the first one is that the overall net operating deficit was only 0.5 million and this was after both additional revenues in additional expenditure which was largely off seats by the extra revenues the expenditure itself was the 29 million over and those carryforwards with some of those big projects that we 've been talking about like the museum redevelopment levy the mental health funding earthquake recovery and we 've also carried forward work with is been commitments in projects are underway so I 'm in the article it did refer to about 3.4 million of personnel costs being above budget and I just like to emphasize that that was not only contractors but it was also annual leave requirements and also recruitment and other costs in there and the council does actually have about 140 individual contractors and that 's quite a big decrease from two hundred and seven which we had in 2015 so this has been declining this has been an area of quite a lot of focus for us as an executive leadership team and across the organization we do have really strong rules around when former staff can be engaged and quite strong policies around that that they cannot be read as a contractor for at least 12 months so the council 's really mindful that we do pay at a higher hourly rate for contractors currently underway that reduces the number of contractors and our organization each month you see the chief executives financial summary report and on a quarterly basis and they there 's the reporting to the council 's finance and performance committee that has the detailed financials which is what you 're seeing in front of you today we also have got the strategic and capability committee that will be reviewing the internal summary of those internal service plans and part of that will be looking at um personnel costs so I really just thought it was important to clarify those few points for you do you want to comment further because I 've got a couple comments arising from the reporting you know I certainly support the comments that Carol has made nothing is good that the strategic capabilities committee will have the ability to to look further into the matters that have been raised I think that 's the the absolutely appropriate place to to have that conversation I guess for me because you know when you read a story that that doesn 't accurately reflect the advice that we of a legume request ender and in this information and this report but it did appear to me that maybe we need to kind of do a paint-by-numbers explanation and the report itself so that there isn 't any possibility of people misunderstanding the information that they 've been provided but through that the way that I 've read that was quite different from the story that I read the front page of the papers so so I 'm just I 'm and I know that you 're working with the chair of the committee to try and get the reporting more refined I think this report and I think this is a position that he 's adopted this report is too big and it needs to be broken down and to more focused reports on each element so that when you look at the elements then you can see the totality without any room for conflict I think you know and that for the sake of transparency and open opened us what we really do need to be thinking of these reports not just reporting to councillors you know at the meeting you know it might be better to think of them as reports that are going out to a general public who haven 't had the opportunity to ask you questions and sort of drill down and to the and to the inner layer so you know that that 's something that we would certainly supporters as having a very clear reporting but also break down I mean some of the some of the areas where contractors are used we fully understand why you need contractors I know one of the areas that the chief executive really focused on initially was to get as much of the legal work that was being contracted out at an enormous cost by increasing the number of full-time staff solicitors on the council 's books that actually reduced the amount we were spending on contractors probably a little bit hidden by the fact that we had the the district plan review which involved a lot of legal hours which we couldn 't possibly have managed from within our own resources there had to be contracted out so but the sitting services group on and and very interested and seeing whether we can look at a way of reducing the cost to the to the city of of some of these services that are that are provided by contractors thanks there any other questions green you just curious over the the policy here Carol would would there be us an operational matter as opposed to a governance matter if there we were seeking a policy change over though at the one year absolutely that 's a management issue right okay yep thank you yep Yani thank you um what was the one off interest payment for the crossing car park that was unallocated I couldn 't understand what that was which page are you on Yanni that 's just in one of the descriptions what was the question oh it was around there was a reference to the crossing carpark and an unallocated unexpected interest payment and yannis why don 't I come back to you on that that one okay I don 't need to check my time yes and then I just interested in terms of those three ones food you four point ten point six both interest expense and revenue we 're over budget with neat interest slightly over budget due to an unclean one-off interest payment for the crossing cap at higher interest costs also related to burrow and cost say yes I 'll come back with some one time okay that would be good and I was concerned about it was unclear around the housing for point ten point four there was an over spent on housing maintenance and then it goes to say that it was assumed that the trust would take on minor maintenance costs so is basically those cuz that cost neutral is the trust paid for that maintenance or are we in Korea through through the chair so in that year we met those costs the problem is that the budget reflected earlier plans and not the the actual reality of when we transferred their maintenance so that maintenance is now being transferred to the trust as a 1st of July but it was a cost neutral situation because the higher rentals through the period and then just the final question was around the skirt wash up happening mean how do we just how are we dealing with that which seems to be a number of yeah extra skirt funding is that being matched by governments are we just incurring it what 's happening there do you want to comment on it the weirdest Kiryat programs completely finished there is still a area of Nan skirt funding that 's going through so basically there is discussions between us and the crown any of that unscrew funded or any of that additional funding is matched by the crown and we 're just going through the final throes of trying to work out where exactly the final crown versus us payment there 's a few complications and the funding of renewals for example where that exactly lands the pain gained under the skirt contract then we are in the process of finalizing all those at this point in time but any of that we we put the full income in sorry the full expenditure in but we do get depending on whether it 's us and NZTA or us and the crown depending on what the stream we 'll get a full report on your school skirts so you 're asking a point 1 million extra permanent funding for full skirt so I 'm just concerned to get an understanding yeah I mean the point is is that you don 't actually have an understanding of us until we get the final report so there 's a still a lot of wash up to do I just got a blank check or what 's the control it just see that there has to be an analysis done of whether spenders whether it 's in the budget of which the government pays 83% or whether it 's the budget where they pay 60% I hope most of it said that 83 think it okay so do some of the 83 perceivers still to go because we 've got to run through these Sumner Road so this there 's some of that that 's extended beyond skirt there is also some work that we 're doing outside of skirt that is still subject to renewals and then there 's a discussion around the operating costs around the red of those things that are expending we did give you a position paper I think probably 12 months ago about where it looked and we are trying to finalize those figures to come back to you a big secret report with the whole scoot program what was funded what wasn 't what was the you know because I think there 's a public perception there everything that was broken by the earthquakes was going to be festive but was underground or if it was on the road and that is not the case it never was the case that wasn 't what the agreement said the agreement talked about the network costs or the civil defense costs and it turned out that what the council thought it was signing before our time was different from what the government knew it was signing and they were proved to be correct in its in that 's great legacy reports probably 90% completed yes an idea and the ambitious statements that we would ultimately have eight we first century resilient City are still of we way off so can we just so just and what I 'm worried about say is that was because there 's some parks that are not taken out just stuff that hasn 't had money spent on it opposed to take out a lot more car parks and what we have taken out so there is a italia about how many there are I think now just off the top of my head I think you 've given us a performance there 's got to be two and a half thousand within the for revenues don 't quote me on their figure I think that is and we report to you our quarterly on that so that 's where that thing when it comes come because those are still live car parks yeah as it would be quite just handy to know what ones potentially in the Ford works that may be taken out because obviously there are some that are planned and the other question I had is is at any stage are we looking at charging bicycles to park in the city I have not seen a paper or I haven 't actually had that idea point in time so good read for idea whose idea was there that 's not an idea it was just asking a question over sorted now right right Amy would you like to move this Yanni what if you put the 11 million of DC 's carry-forward cipro and I what what like my votre call it against that right okay so if you could record Yanni 's vote against item four I 'll push I 'll put the whole lot and we 'll just acknowledge that Bette has happened I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's Kerry thank you _"

    "text": "okay the next item on the agenda is the draft defense policy for framework also another report from the social and Community Development Committee l do so it thinks me and ope and terms should comment on this too but just to make it clear that we are going to change what there is an amendment I think to point that the number sexier it really is to make sure that the we get the feedback from the public consultation and and then that information community development Housing Committee and the strategic capability committee so the author of that will be changed so in fact it does go out to consultation first I hate that we instruct can we just change you to the ground request it 's just a sense dominating them did you want to yeah well I think this is really you know we can do major events and as consciousness has now been tasked with etc but the real value to a city is its community events which sit in between those and how they link because of a city 's not worth living working and is actually I think the most important work to be done and I have said all the way along that that major events in community events have to work hand in glove and and in the past previous to my previous life it was seeing that community events through the you know the second cousin if you like and it 's not that at all so it 's great to see that this is actually the the new policy and it 's been over Joe and so thank you very much I do have a couple of questions but I think it 's great to be moving forward well you don 't know yeah thank you I 'm point five but as a great two for the draft policy framework dadadada two alarm for framework to be released for public consultation but then on into point four we 've got that you 're working on a community events implementation plan shouldn 't that follow the consultation of the public because here can you mean to plan or come up with a plan prior to the consultation on TV oh yes has gone so it 's it 's really that we soon will begin working on it as long as it 's agreed to consultation and counselor doctor and I should know this because I 'm on the board of Christ returns it but I 'm going to ask the question anyway so on item two you know the combined vision for events and crisis between yourselves and crisis in Zed so that they would be going out to consult on their plan as well major events I realize they can be answered so the consultations so far on the major event strategy has been with a workshop with the events industry but also out to the wider of in century the draft plan will be presented to the board across eastern seaboard tomorrow afternoon yes engender crisis because the we own the public consultation is regarding to the event the policy framework is high they would a strategic direction but a moment in the same time that based on your information the purchase New Zealand they were established currently in major event the strategy changes are in the know is members all the way through announcers for Christchurch in Z does the name of the organisation thank you yet and also stop a moment developing a community event the information gained because this under this umbrella this my view if we get a feedback from the community of public they have a son some view you know it 's a different form of draft of what then we establish this to defend our church NZ the strategy then the council style is a community implementation plan but how how how how come we need to have a further amendment the a good question Jimmy they are the intention behind the workshop between the social and Community Development Housing Committee and the strategic capability committee will also include our Christchurch NZ and give the two committees the chance to workshop precisely that issue before our council releases any conclusions to the public so that will be debated but we just aim to do that with the benefit of public feedback I presume Tim would you like to move it would you like to sing into it any discussion I 'll put they know that 's carried thank you thanks for your good work _"

    "text": "relax the next one is the the new direction for heritage so so would you like to introduce that so look the council 's will be weird too from early discussions that the council staff have gone out for a very full engagement with the with the relevant heritage groups in their City and were some clear findings from there that they can elaborate on so what what in fact the the overall finding is that in fact the community groups want council to have a collaborative approach to work with them and date there 's clear indications too that they they knew they were like more support from Council and there was also a clear request really for community involvement in Heritage in lots of positive ways of actually them being involved in heritage trails I guess as one was one important example the other thing that came through from the from the engagement is in capturing their intangible part of history which are sometimes hard to pinpoint but oral histories will be an example also making sure that we take sensible and careful care of the city 's would leave to the staff to answer right and now we will relate those 1 edition yes you are making parameter it said something wrong place so I think it should be in the fourth bullet point so the words nothing coming oh no no that 's fine no it actually works so seek opportunities to improve an enhance local and community use and access I think you know that one of the issues that 's come up is that for example the and we 're going to follow up on this but some of the conditions that we 've put in place require you know community open days or community access in some ways like that like the Christchurch Club and it 's just a question of you know making sure that their excesses as one of these criterias so that they 're not hidden away you know we 've had those discussions about what we had about the pump house then as well you know how does the community engage with this heritage given that the community is essentially making a contribution to to the retention of the are opportunities to enhance local and community uses at the same time that 's great but it 's not it 's not a condition that 's a one of the things to be taken into account and our conversations right so you 're moving that full and clean seconding act yeah please do so you reach out to interested parties and consulted to get to this point as it curry is working everything that you see up there in terms of our recommendations has been driven by the results of the engagement and the consultation process we 've gone through we as staff went out with open-ended questions to ask people what do you value why do you evaluate what do you think is heritage what legacy would you like to leave so we went completely without any values or judgments to start with the recommendations we 've put in the principles of inheritance and legacy of tangible and intangible heritage of community and local identity and sense of place and of multicultural multi-generational heritage are all the messages that have come back from the community they 're not driven pulling them together and reflecting them back to you with regards to their I mean I won 't mention he knows where I was content was someone who was surprised at the calm the contact but very very pleased with the the actual process at Citron 's so I guess that 's really moved forward because they were surprised at the initial contact in the way that was done but really really hippy so with with us with this is up there now is it still in line as you believe with everything that was why what not by yourselves but died by those that you you involved in communicator I it 's extended slightly through the process obviously bringing in moveable cultural property as a separate item before it sat through our implementation plan I really pulling forwards the opportunities to improve and enhance this access and use they they work things that came through specifically from the consultation but they are messages that we can very easily fit in and work with during the implementation process thank you I think the process has been fantastic it really has really good feedback to term so it 's um you know well done thank you Jonnie I was just gonna thank the staff for the the work that they 've done on us and just to endorse that I went to the initial workshop that was held in New Brighton and you know it like it it 's it 's a really good model I think of us having two-way conversations with our community and it 's something I think we can learn from on a whole wide range of other areas that we work through as council whether it 's things like Early Learning Center 's volunteer libraries but when we get people together who have an interest in something and sit down and and listen to them and and put a process in place to work with them over coming up with solutions to what are our city 's challenges I think people really appreciate that so I just wanted to acknowledge that the stuff that a huge amount of work they they organize some additional mechanisms to feed back to the people that had been involved which about the next opportunity which is really formulating that strategy with those key people who have shown a king desire to be involved so I 'm really supportive of this I think this is you know it has been a long time coming and it 's you know post-earthquake I would love to have seen this done sooner but we 're in the situation we are now and this is this is a start I think of a really exciting journey excellent Oh Glenn Yanni oh sorry Dion Jimmy thank you I just wanted to back up Phil there with 4d so that I Telus eyes please seeking opportunities to improve enhance local and community use and access so obviously we all value what we 're doing here the overall project of heritage but we do have that creative tension of public funding in many cases for private dwellings so that 's what that seeks to actually get to to wrestle with that and to come out with some you know good outcomes where the community does have access to these places which receive grants so I 'm all for it up but it is really important that we consider it crucially with our stewardship of public money over private places down yeah I was actually going to talk about 0.4 day as well because it 's something that I keep talking to people who want to sort of be engaged with their heritage I think we 've lost so much heritage in our city that what we do have people are starting to sort of see that actually as we start rebuilding the city that heritage is important and people do want to see what was here in the past especially on the built heritage both the European and moldy heritage there I do have one suggestion and I think it 's not necessary to put it in but just as we 're starting to develop this further in point to the second are sorry the third bullet point there a story based approach I really like but that acknowledges all our culture 's I actually think we need to put both start thinking about respecting our cultures because a lot of times we do acknowledge things but maybe acknowledging it because that 's how you start building those cultures into our everyday life and actually start moving forward so me we could put it there but I 'm not too fussed but I just think we actually need to be thinking about respecting cultures because that 's how we 're going to move forward into the next sort of iteration of our world I think if the mover and seconder a happier whip because right on the word and respects I think you acknowledge and respect it 's a good point and there was good discussion with representives from night I who as well so I 'm sure they would appreciate it yep no Jimmy I just want to follow the under the candor of the crises you will review the paragraph to fully point of three we thought we acknowledge the respect or our culture by the paragraph five I think that 's most accrue shal and the important this way vehicle opportunity facility the workshop we recognize almost multicultural kind of heritage you know made her story visible or intangible asset or puppies nada just based all those the key stakeholders a community I assume a moment public and herbal rechannel Association because they settle in New Zealand and the wider may be Cantor requires public boundary in the sixty years we need to invite them to be the kind of partake of this OSHA and also public purchase multicultural council are on behalf of wider the what the culture the community we need to consider you madam as well to partake of least emotion to make this the kind of heritage strategy more kinda over-inclusive this is my recommendation that 's good thank you all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much much appreciated _"

    "text": "thank you very much now the next one is the Heritage incentive grant approval for the former pump house five four four charm Street filled would you like to introduce this report from your committee so stamp will speak the report to our committee basically certainly supported the application and because because the costs of the renovation and strengthening of the building are quite high like 1.5 million the the committee also makes a recommendation requesting council to support a further further applicator the funding of 200,000 at the time we do the long-term plan so that 's lit and contained in the in the second recommendation from the committee but the start the staff will speak to I 'm sure will speak to the importance that in the Heritage value of the pump house and its relation to and drainage for a city would you like to speak to them so basically the former pump house it 's a highly significant group one building scheduled in our district plan and it 's also listed category two with Hershey 's New Zealand and that significance is around the fact that and the individuals that were responsible for the design and construction of the Christchurch so its system it 's one of the few visible above ground excuse me one of the few visible above ground components of the city 's sewage system from from the 19th century and actually consisted of a complex of buildings constructed and brick and stone from that date so I can give you a quick resume on the overall sort of damage and costs if you wish to put do people want this or be quite comfortable all right would you like to move it move it yep not from the heritage staff though more on random items into around the 200,000 from the next financial year obviously subject to the long term plan if during the long term plan we actually reduced fund into that pot to say 200,000 basically what we do today would exhaust their whole fund in one head well I suppose the question that 's a bit that arises from there is if we if we simply allocated the 200,000 but didn 't approve they fear the 200,000 does that hard to say I mean obviously that they 're spending their spending phenomenal amounts of money there of their own money because there was no insurance yeah for whatever reasons I think we 're looking at over a million dollars of of their investment so I think every every bit of assistance that we can give them will help to secure that that work does actually happen and that the building has a an extended life into into the next next hundred years so I think it is key they did they did ask initially for that four hundred thousand mm-hmm and that was based on on I think even then a lower percentage than we normally provide a for for that for that grand scheme so it was well down in terms of percentage we can the smaller schemes go up to fifty percent obviously the biggest schemes we can 't we can 't_''_271.919 do that so I think we 've arrived at we arrived at four hundred thousand as a good compromise figure less than what we normally support offering support but but sufficient for them to get can see the difficulty that we 've got when we don 't know what next year 's their locations are gonna be like yeah I know we did this in other in in previous heritage incentive grants before the earthquakes where the grants were too large and we had to we had to somehow spread the load o out over a number of years we did that and and simples in cash L Street was the example of that unfortunate that building isn 't there anymore because we we were just starting the work when the earthquake struck so we lost that building was that that was an example of spreading the granite out over three years in that case is this gonna stay you know a second hand sort of the the assumption is at the moment yes that it will stay in that in that use the the owner isn 't new uses as yet but obviously that that building is it 's as Fiona says it 's a compilation of buildings yeah there 's lots of flexibility about future uses so that there are lots of options become a some sort of a a center for arts or crafts or something like that and the other the other point to note is that the Covenant is is still there if they do come along at some future date with their use that we 're not particularly happy with then the covenant means that it will come to you guys and you 'll be able to say well actually we 're not happy about that say for example if they wanted to make it into a into a storage shed or something that doesn 't suit with our our desires then we can we can veto that with the Covenant yeah I 'm just that because I 'm hearing from people to sort of saying that they are uncomfortable about the second allocation and if there isn 't any sort of comfort that they would proceed with the 200,000 then I 'm just wondering if we needed to fear the whole lot until next year well want one other option we could we could contemplate is that instead of making that resolution that we actually say that there an approved grant you have to wait five years possibly can we can we allow them to do another application next year inside the five year normal cutoff point it would mean it would mean breaking policy but that 's and that 's fine if you if you can see the benefits to do that so approve this grant and then allow them to or invite them to submit a further application within the five-year period yeah instead of making them wait for five years because that might then the whole project jeopardy yep [Music] because we we did absolutely foresee this problem becoming an issue and we 're at that point in the year where where funds funds have been allocated and we couldn 't we couldn 't we couldn 't give the the total four hundred thousand that they asked for yeah but based on on on an assessment we had we had the application in and the initial the initial crunching of the figures and what the applicants actually sought from us was was the four hundred but because of the limitations in funds we we couldn a as all these things are a compromise figure what could we afford based on what 's left in the fund and what 's sufficient to give them some form of impetus to do the works because obviously if they don 't get the funding then the whole works are in jeopardy so that 's what we it 's a difficult balance but there 's no doubt that the the buildings are worthy of our support that 's the key thing to remember you know that 's that 's the point of emphasizing all of this significance sorry I have one more question there obviously there 's there 's not a lot of visibility to this building from the road and when I 'm thinking about these grounds personally I 'd like to be able to have that public community value I suppose that were trying to protect here is have you had any conversations with them about there we could do that in the covenant-- we could make the buildings more more visible obviously they 're there they 're running a business in the buildings and they 've got and safety still so we 've got to have some sort of boundary security for that for that building obviously in the future that boundary treatment could change and you could have a much more open open and visually connected building the building used to be in an open field obviously development has built up around it and it 's a little obscured now but those kind of buildings that they can become the focus of of the community but if they have they indicated anything along those lines at all from the conversations no no we don 't we don 't sort of what we look at is the the value of the works and the securing of the building so that that potential can come at some point if we don 't save the buildings in the first place there is no potential it 's gone mmm so so this this is to do those necessary works to make sure that this building is robust and resilient enough to survive a future event and also resilient enough to to accommodate future uses so it 's actually building in but it may be five years from now it might be you know you just don 't know it but at the moment they 're running a business from it the building is viable and and it 's an important part of our our history yep yep I 'm happy with that mmm well look why _"

    "text": "and now we moved to the coastal board community boards report on the proposed lease to crush it 's called of gymnastics one-ninth Lee Travis wrote part of qe2 Park and I think councilor east you were going to introduce the report on behalf of the community board thank you this is a matter that 's been discussed at length by our community board it 's a consequence of the school of gymnastics losing their integrity their building following the earthquakes and the considerable cost of remediation of that building lead to them evaluating a number of alternatives to relocate these alternatives that have been assessed were in a variety of locations both within our Ward and within QEII itself we have engaged with their community and admittedly there were some hiccups with that engagement however as a consequence of that engagement we did undertake to further evaluate a number of other sites on the site which was done and ultimately it came back to the site that we are considering today as being the realistically only viable position that we could relocate this facility our community were offered further a number did and consequently having heard all all of those submissions the earlier on-site meetings and in the advice that board house re staff have given us on this the board at its last meeting recommended the approval of the granting of the lease to CSG on the site that 's shown in the document before you I think that covers most of the points in this and because in consideration of this lease application councillor Livingston may wish to add a few more points okay if you it 's to follow on from David basically that there has been good robust discussion with the local residents immediately adjacent to the qe2 Park there 's been an on-site visit you know as I said robust community engagement and consultation views have been freely aired we 've met on site with with board and staff is that is the the board of CSG as well as the community board and I think all the issues have been fairly freely aired and and taken on board so it 's been a bit of work to get to this point today but 'll see in the report the issues that we need to deal with today if we could do this it would really be another good step along the way for CSG and the community welljust I 'm just a bit confused about because you you want to I 'm a little unsure as to why recommendation two from the staff recommendations wasn 't included authorized the property consultancy manager to conclude administer the terms and conditions of release is it an oversight or should that as it 's kind of like the community board only recommended one or is it a mistake I think it 's a mistake because you were eyes the property consultancy manager to proceed wouldn 't you yeah I think you know there 's been a bit of debate around the the fact that about a line of black poplars a number of which are scheduled for either removal awesome severe maintenance as part of the issue that we 're dealing with the board was at great pains to stress that the granting of this lease and subsequent design and building consent for the building that a building is designed that suits the amenity value of the surrounding area and that in preparing the foundations for this new building there will be the requirement to remove an amount of soil and that that soil perhaps be used as a abundant along the eastern edge of the building on which mitigating replanting could be planted as well so perhaps you 're right with the 0.2 maybe it should be noting that the community board have expressed a desire to ensure adequate landscaping as accompanies this project so some alternative wording arriving anyway so the advices is that there 's enough with existing delegations but um I think it would be helpful if reports actually said that we were just also noting that the earlier resolution they resolved when the hearings panel report to the council was considered that the council allocate the proceeds from the sale of land towards the development and implementation of a master plan for the rest of QEII Park but what seems to be holding up the master plan as the as who here 's the delegation for that and it and so community board proceed with the development of the qe2 master plan and consultation of the community and then it then request that the community board works that to make decisions for proceeds what no I 'm confused that they probably should read some of our requests that the community board works with the council to make two simple decisions for the master plan and implementation using proceeds from the land so but we 're not delegating there yet we might delegate the implementation but we want to actually see what that is you know like so we need the master plan and then we can come back and say in terms of the delegation I think we 've already in two sort of indicated that the sale of land that converts proceeds from the sale of Glen will be used in the development and implementation of the master plan we 've already decided in it so I think we just need to give the authority to get on with it and then at a later date think about how we 're going to we want you to report back on put request the coast but proceed with the development of the qe2 part master plan and consultation with the community and report back to the council with recommendations on documentation and then and then we can delegate that at the time but it gives us an idea about what we 're actually signing up for yeah yeah it 'll be good um Jonnie qe2 is a metropolitan asset so I do think we need to be just careful and how we approach this is definitely ours laughs you looked at the criteria for our strengthening communities funding absolutely mate sir we 've been funding groups at a central level that come across a number of areas of the city and there 's very clear criteria so but that 's fine like I 'm happy with the community board developing it but I do think for example our boards had presentation from one of the schools that 's going there so it does have an impact on wider than just the board area and it would be good just to highlight that you know I think would be good to work 's a comment around the proposed lease around artistic impressions of the building plan together with a landscaping plan including replacement trees has that plan been done or do we need a resolution on here to make sure that that plan goes back before the lease is signed Tom yeah through the chair the plan hasn 't been completed yet a that 's going to be developed in consultation with the community and the board right they 'll answer and that is here okay so um and the reason that that wouldn 't come back to council there I think believe that the resolution reads for the board to approve it but if require can be brought back to Council for approval right I mean I just don 't know where we 're at with our delegations it would seem to me that delegations around the site would still rest with council particularly for a lease that was for 35 years so that we do need to be consistent confirming the lease today that 's what we 're doing granting a lease to graduate school of gymnastics yeah I understand report that talks about the board further agreeing to something as part of that lease and that 's what I 'm just curious as to why that 's how that 's been done well I 'm very happy for that to remain with the community board because they 're the ones who are working directly with the community on the development of the master plan so makes sense that they are responsible for this so so we need to have a phrase and they are about third also about the working with the community board in the Christchurch school of gymnastics as Edda sorry what section of the report seems it I did read that myself but wearisome 72 to suit like we 've been some sorts of benders with others configured on the city where we have a profile ace we 've thought that the design would be able to be accommodated and then it hasn 't and so we 've had a lot of public backlash for certain buildings that are on council land that we 've given the lace and the design hasn 't matched the community that there is a process by which that can be done so that people are really aware of what 's going to go there before the leases is so perhaps the last word agreement should be replaced for the pre wait yep and that happens before the lease is my last already made the following decisions if you go to page 68 Patsy they 've already made these decisions under delegation that they authorize the property consultancy manager to concluded administer the terms and conditions of release so once we grant release today they 've already authorized this to continue and they 've said requests requests that the community board has expressly desired the lease be approved to enter into an agreement to work with CSG regarding the building landscaping surrounding the building etc etc so it 's an accordance with consultation and agreement by the community board is detailed in item 5.23 and request that staff engage with the community board to develop a landscape plan in conjunction with the qet plaque master plan process noting that approximately so they 've already got thus under control they 've already car parking there were a number of similars that raised concern and when you look at the number of you the number of users of the gymnastics school of gymnastics it does seem that we we possibly have a huge shortfall of car parking so how is that issue being addressed all right we 're about to take because I read the report and completely the opposite way that the 55 car parks are in close proximity to the site that 's been chosen so sorry have I read the wrong part of the report well those who oppose the options it 's on the grounds of perceived parking issues yes but we were a tiny number of people who opposed there was a huge majority that was in favor so the parking 55 car parks were catered for and right next door from the car park if I got that wrong no there 's also further camping car parking being developed right at the moment for the recreation and Sports Center so if if there is a an overflow from time to time for events the whole site has you have a look at the connotation document I mean you just think of pond it when you get a pioneer think how hard it is to get a car pocket time so I just want to know what else we can do to mitigate have we got room for expansion of the car pocket we need oh absolutely and I think the staff the local community and the community board will take car parking and site access into consideration when considering the master plan I think their new packs will exceed the number of current parks yes they well counselor however keep keep in mind isn 't it that that we you know if you looked at pioneer example every hand the anisa does fall but it 's a wonderful thing of those who probably ignored the locals yeah but we can 't double the size of the car Pat because they figure the green space that 's lost in here it looked like a wasteland for so long Yeah right so we have a resolution in front of us and David up presume you 'd like to move so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried think _"

for presenting and making it fun my pleasure great way to start the day thank you next we have the the wisp Opera action Canterbury Julian sorry wait ma 'am tonight quick photo counselors we can 't match hula hoops but we can do sports so we 've come to ask your solidarity and support for West Papua it 's a piece sitting we ask you to stand with people who have declared the country a piece a land of peace and in the past the councillors have stood up for quite significant international that 's word trade events in particular we know from my experiences I work for Christian world service for get watch em get watchdog for the against free trade and for fair trade and helping to stop the and to some of the government 's free trade agreements and so we are aware of this international commitment and we are going from the local to the broadest possible thing and asking your support to see if we can raise the whisper porn flag on December the first the day whisper poor was to create independent from the Dutch in 1961 and we 're asking to use your flagpole the western half of Papua the pepper and Ireland Gloucester was has been controlled by Indonesia since 1963 when it was removed from the United Nations decolonization list which was reinforced in 1969 when the military hand-picked 1026 West Papuans who voted in a referendum called the act of free choice it was commonly known as the act of no choice opposition has been growing yesterday a petition carrying 1.8 million signatures was presented to the United Nations the signatures were largely gathered in whisper power which has very mountainous in very isolated the petition called for a free free vote on independence that was banned by the Indonesian government so the people risk their lives and a risk to done my own I did a master 's degree and I looked at New Zealand 's foreign aid to whisper Poirot speaks a couple of years and that Tago doing that and concluded that it 's been incredibly harmful effects so we sort of have used foreign aid to train the police force in West Papua so effectively the Indonesians to police whisper ones who have been fighting for independence as Julian said since not the sort of 96 early 1960s similar case in East Timor is many of you will know so the fact that the New Zealand government was supporting foreign aid in that country was something that wasn 't very publicly discussed and in terms of my own research was quite hard to get any information about they ended up canceling the program community policing program but they have I think recently restarted it which is very concerning so there 's a number of issues in West Papua they 've had their land of resources taken away from them the indigenous population have been pushed to the edge to a planned policy of transmigration where they basically numbers these tropical rainforests there which have been cleared for palm oil plantations and other types of mineral and resource extraction and there 's been a number of reports written about that report memorial made a deal giving Indonesian authorities effectively 51 percent stake in the world 's largest gold mine and the second largest cop of mine and policing is linked to that as well the Indonesian Constitution guarantees its citizens freedom of expression and freedom from torture and children to grow up free from violence and discrimination however every single one of those freedoms has been violated and in particular raising the morning star flag which is symbolic of whispered independence has been supposed than anyone whose attempt to do that there 's been evidence of torture in extra tissue killings almost you know most families and with whisper affected by their violence Joomla some non-government organizations are forbidden from entering whisper for so effectively there 's a media blackout in a number of news well and your radio New Zealand has covered this pretty well and effectively Pacific churches are supporting our campaign so we have strong strong Pacific and Maori support for this movement recognizing there digitus connection in New Zealand Pacific Sarah its leaders but this is the changing Pacific leaders like to find minister or Carol surveyor from one or two and also asserted or VF of the ceremony Ireland called for the investigation by the Human Rights Council this week mo selectivity are supporting these trainings but we are here to support and lead the ears of orders for thank you we wish to petition you to raise the morning star flag on December 1st not only as an act of solidarity but as a call to action we request this gesture from you know not just as citizens petitioning our representatives but as humans our conscience imploring you to recognize your own ingrain desire for fairness and justice we 're only asking for the most simple act of solidary this is a small sign of into the pop when people for them to know that they 're not alone this is we 're joining them in their call for self-determination and the human rights of the poplin people Chiara and najara thank me all right I 'm reasonably comfortable that if counselors are that we simply resolved to fly the flag on the 1st of December I know that there 's there 's usually protocols but I think they 're around public buildings that are government-owned rather than council buildings so I think as a council we 're entitled to take that up but it you know I don 't want to do that if people aren 't comfortable going down that direction but if people are well well I 'm happy to move that we fly the flag on the day you might have to assist us with the flag and seeking to buy clean yep so I 'll put that resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you thank you very much very much it would be good if you could send us some more information too because I mean a lot of us have obviously followed the West Papuan calls for a long time but not all councillors will have so it might be quite good if you could email through that over the next week while as well presume that we can get some contact details to get the flag nothing thank you and welcome flipping you were mentioned before no sure all right good morning everyone mere councillors what other people have yet to meet I hope you don 't mind I broke down I 'm gonna say today despite the fact that I 've talked to a thousands of kids throughout New Zealand and I 've worn this costume in public numerous occasions talking to adults still scares me the most for those in the room that don 't know me my name is flat man I started out in 2011 hoping students worse affected by the earthquakes through the delivery of food packages while started off is a very random late-night idea to help quickly grow into a full bronze superior operation where I was invited into people 's homes and schools to talk to kids about what it is I do in the community and the powers of kindness generosity and compassion at first I had no idea what I was doing but I quickly learned in in their eyes I was a real-life superhero so I started up conversations and discussions with them about ways that they can all be superheroes in their own community homes and schools and that you don 't need super strength or the ability to fly or even billions of dollars to be a superhero and they 're all you really need to be a superhero is kindness and love for each other and that was a little amount of either one of these can change someone 's day week or life we live in a world that is so buried in negativity it 's in the news social media workplace in schools you only have to look on Facebook or staff articles to see such horrible nasty comments from grown adults and children are picking up on this it shows in forms of bullying anxiety depression and worst of all suicide we 're not stupid or blind we all know New Zealand is appalling youth suicide rates and if by talking to children about kindness love and impairing them to be their own superhero it can save a life talking to as many views as possible in a way that 's fun relatable and just a little daft but at the moment I 'm limited I 'm limited by time and limited by financial freedom my goal is to create a school program that I can share into as many schools as possible and start discussions with youth about kindness generosity in compare compassion at the current minimum wage of 1575 in my wants to be able to have two days a week dedicated to be flat man this would come to a yearly cost of thirteen thousand one hundred and four dollars money I think would be well spent if it brings joy into people 's lives I 'm certainly not out to get rich I just want to live in a country where people put the needs and well-being of all people at the forefront of their own lives so as the council as business people as humans if you have any suggestions to excess of funds or no people willing to help you know how to reach me shine the flat man signal up in the to finish a speech on a famous quote but instead that I 'd like to finish on a few quotes from people I 've visited over the time from Joe hi flat man my son was in hospital the day your superior mates came to visit thank you for making his day it was incredibly stressful being in there and you help lighten the mood you are much appreciated from Sasha you 're truly amazing flat man my niece 's are a recipient of one of your acts of kindness today I just want to thank you so much for making the day on the in diversity of their fathers passing so much brighter it 's the little things that counts in life and finally from Melva wife late man I just wanted to say I 've been such a big fan of yours for so long you 're doing an incredible job and you just spread such hope thank you is a teacher I think what you do and what your show is possible is spectacular thank you so much Erika noe thank you much for your time and you very much and I really appreciated that I know that you 've hand written there but if you could I photocopied it or get someone to it or type it up and flick it through you know I mean it 's just such a a great story I mean I met you during well over on the east side after the earthquakes delivering food people 's doorsteps as a surprise you know so what you 've done you know has been utterly amazing and those those tributes that you 've just read out only touched the surface of what somebody who brings a message of kindness to a world that isn 't very kind is really quite powerful and moving so thank you do that III would like us to do some work on on on your request it really does fit within the whole concept of resilience and well-being that we 've been talking about as a council and I 'd like to ask the council staff to do some work and obviously work with you to come back with some proposal that we could consider in the a report after such a powerful presentation but it is the way that we can get some action person on on what you 're suggesting have to be the living wage they say if do we need a resolution or I suppose it would be helpful to have a look okay so that it 's going to be noted that that we request up yeah let 's do this relatively quickly and come back to us yeah yeah all right okay thank you very much um thank you for presenting today thank you yes thank you and now could we hit the Christchurch memorial area say this is although this is a public forum I 've invited RSA to come today and so the presentation that in terms of timing is ten minutes and so it 's more in the nature of a deputation to the count soldier on the particular subject of the christchurch citizens war memorial so thank you very much I 'll hand over to you thank you madam mayor and councillors on people see I 'm the president of Christchurch Memorial RSA on my left is is our master of ceremonies for our major commemorative events and on my right as general only an executive member of Christchurch Memorial RSA and the lead on our consultation and what have you in regard to the Christchurch citizens war memorial Cenotaph as otherwise known who are we close chief memorial outside was formed on the 14th of December 1915 with the first New Zealand soldiers to return home wounded from Gallipoli we 've grown from that date and we have a parent RSA in New Zealand which now has 182 RSA 's around the country and over 120,000 members we represent 2,000 2110 financial members of Christchurch memorial RSA and this is made up of 1,000 returned and services members and the remainder are associate and club members I should have said this before that looking at the first speaker today we didn 't realize that we had to bring bribes with us and we felt that any way that a bottle of whisky each was probably yarn passed down I mean if you come down on Anzac Day you might get a free one anyway but our document to our membership considering the future of the citizens war memorial a copy of this document is included in the flesh dorm that we just distributed to you today the result of that process is that we work with the council to and to investigate or instigate the pros of having the citizens war memorial for Senate I 've moved out of Cathedral Square our preferred option of all those people and consider them the discussions option document circulated is for it to be relocated to cram the square there are a lot of good reasons for this and we will discuss those we 've consulted widely with this although we haven 't gone out for public consultation for the last five months we 've been in meetings monthly with the Christchurch City Council Parks and Recreation manager mr. Andrews Rutledge and we have to say with very little progress until the 4th of September meeting which included a brief meeting with yourself the Cameo stated that the council will do I could do nothing until the CC CPT the Christchurch City Cathedral property trust and the church sooner Cathedral and we understand that our proposition was again brought to the attention of Council in May 2017 it was initially raised in 2012 by us it was proposed that the Anzac Day breakfast addameer this year that this would have been a great one hundred year legacy project to commemorate the end of World War one centenary which occurs on the 11th of November 2018 it 's a significant day that is Armistice Day the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month 1918 when the gun stopped and peace was declared a question is proper and chief property trust attended the September meeting with us and they gave us their support for our stance to move the Cenotaph off their church land they stated at that meeting that they had other proposals and the Cenotaph was sitting there where they want to put buildings around whatever the decision was made with the cathedral the Canterbury district RSA 's which is all of the RSA 's in Canterbury the proposal was put to the district annual general meeting and Ashburton in September 2016 the district RSA unanimously has written to the council and support of our proposal and have written to the council stating their support our own membership now total membership has been canvas with the proposal there were 1,350 minute annoying emails sent out and an abbreviated version was posted to 851 members who do not have emailed a total of 2210 members to date we have only received four replies that wish to maintain the status quo our media coverage in 2012 we launched a media campaign which resulted in a bit of a public spat with the property trust the church property trust it had the desired effect though that the suggestion of a move prompted a series of letters to the editor of the priests the majority and favor of some against since then the Christchurch Memorial RSA has not made any further comments out of the respect of the outcome continuing meetings with the council and other stakeholders to date despite considerable and consistent pressure from the media regarding the future of the Cenotaph we have maintained our media silence I know I can hand over the Paul O 'Connor_._1829.549 Fuhrer for relocating the Cenotaph the current location has now become untenable as the new concept plans for the square at this memorial overshadowed by large buildings and dwarfed by the Cathedral in a much reduced land space it should also be recognized that the rebuild of the Cathedral will be a construction site for the next five to ten years this will render the Cenotaph unusual for Anzac Day Services and other commemorative events during this time the attendance narrowed Anzac Day makes the use of Cathedral Square no longer fit for purpose as the current location cannot cater for the numbers attending since 2013 where the crowds have been between 15,000 and 25,000 people and that is Christchurch City Council sources the placement of the Cenotaph in 1937 on Churchland was in desperation as shown in the discussion documents the Christchurch City Council at the time stated that the square was too busy for a monument meant to inspire quiet and somber reflection the aftermath of the earthquakes and the future of the Cathedral had provided the ideal time to reconsider relocation to a more appropriate and honored site not returned from wars and conflicts it is recognised as the guardian of remembrance in 1937 the Cenotaph was erected in memory of 4199 Canterbury people our people the nation paced at the time that they and their sacrifice would not be forgotten today more than ever they deserve peace and tranquillity and a place where families can pay respects and a place more fitting than a busy thoroughfare the current practice for the last seven years of paying homage to apply wood to Senator and Kremlin Square is apparent to us the RSA expressed its disappointment at the lack of progress by the Christchurch City Council in an e-mailed date of the 30th of May 2017 after speaking with the mayor on Anzac Day 2017 the email stated that we had no tangible progress in the process and that was necessary to achieve our objects we stated that the memorial had been disrespected and neglected by the lack of maintenance and no access which were the responsibility of council we were upset that the council was responsible for this lack of action and in our opinion had failed an gave their lives for this country in our city in that war and wars and conflicts earners the relocation of the Cenotaph would allow the Christchurch Property Trust to more easily fulfil the restoration plan on the lend and as we know the Cenotaph will be unusual unusable during the restoration of the Cathedral the church property trust and September 2017 meeting with the Christchurch Memorial RSA and crushes City Council indicated their support for our position to relocate the citizens war memorial the relevance of our preferred site creme Square is proven by acceptance of creme squared by the public of Canterbury as shown by the support on Anzac Day services since 2012 it has historical significance and has been a military tented capture in the war and since 1922 for many years the soldiers formed up there and marched of the senator from the square so why change an error with the concept plans for the new square out in public arena it is obvious that as being developed by regenerate Christchurch as a green area in a place to hold small events to bring the inner city days I hardly affording a place of respectful remembrance and somber reflection now as appropriate time to engage with the public in consultation process at the beginning of 2017 we initially wanted this to be the centenary project for the city the council does not appear to have such a project in place for the 11th of November 2018 the Senate decision will require legislative legislative change to allow work on the Cathedral to proceed approval and principle from this council would have the same legislative changes embrace the citizens War Memorial as well to facilitate its relocation as part of the same process we anticipate that there are benefits and relocating the immediate benefit of support of Christchurch will be able to pay their respects on NZ day and another important commemorative occasions with the most iconic and war memorial sculpture in New Zealand it 's recognized as one of the most significant in the southern hemisphere it is arguably sorry change the pay is arguably the most important heritage piece of act and the city is responsible for on behalf of the people to relocate at the Kremlin that part of the city being on the tourist tram route it will become a spot for people to relax on the green and admire and pay their respects to the fallen at this Canterbury Cenotaph the relocation to cram the square is in the opinion of the RSA the most appropriate location for it and it 's the most cost-effective other sights suggested will require considerable investment to create a purpose-built area premise Square also provides an open green space where the monument is easily accessible to the community but not swamped by the vastness of other City open spaces the Senate would no longer be lost in the space and the Square and overshadowed and dwarfed dwarfed by the Cathedral the library and other tall buildings planned for that area but will become a feature of a significant green space in the city on its own and cram the square that will be a magnificent setting with the ancillary description boards and interesting history that it carries one only has to see the gunner 's memorial on the edge of the road at Hyde Park Centre in London should be remembered that in two weeks time we commemorate the greatest loss of life this country has ever known in just 270 minutes 846 young New Zealanders predominantly from the Canterbury and o Tago infantry regiments on the 12th of October 1917 gave their lives for king and country at Bellevue Roche Passchendaele in Belgium these were our people almost everyone in Christchurch was affected by this tragedy we promised that we would not forsake them nor forget them how often do we hear the words we will remain and lest we forget after the Second World War the Labour government at the time would not allow any more war memorials to be built they had to be community facilities such as halls and we give an example the Christchurch Polytech or IRA campus war memorial hall was pulled down without consultation nor consideration for re-establishment of that monument on the campus we have the old who old Hurst memorial hall under threat of demolition these are the memorials to the fallen that the locals of this city and our surrounding areas contributed and seeded them to the local a failing in our pledge as a city and as a nation never to forget those that gave their lives for a free freedom and democracy that has allowed us to be at this meeting today this we forget we are well aware that our legal process is to go through but now is the time for action we have met and taught for five months without any tangible process our progress we encourage you to look at the material and the flash drives you have been given that material will give you all the background information the alternative sites and the pros and cons for these the decision to start a process for relocation which we are well aware will involve heritage and New Zealand applications for resource conceits the reserve act and how it applies to kremlin square and lastly the consultation with the public needs to start now these are the tasks we urge you as our elected councillors to instruct your staff to commence we wish that you provide agreement in principle to this appeal so that we the people of Christchurch have a fitting location with this monument where we can truly say we will remember them thank you very much philosophy to us thank you very much that these timetables are not that easy to you know because there 's no time now for questions so what I 'm going to propose so I 'm just going to propose that we request staff to continue to meet with the Christchurch Memorial RSA to explore temporary and permanent options for the location of the Christchurch citizen 's war memorial and seek advice on potential legislative interventions that align with the legislation relating to the Cathedral and that 's picking up your point in relation to the legislation if we were to go through a resource conceived process it 'll be exactly the same as what the Cathedral would have had to have gone through in terms of the resource consent process so if there is a legislative option then it has to be agreed with across party lines which the Cathedral intervention has been agreed so it doesn 't actually matter who forms the government or what parties make up the government in the next because the officials will be providing advice to the incoming government as to what is to be included in the legislation so this needs to be in the mix and then if we ask to have to keep us informed on the progress on these meters I understand your sense of frustration around around the five months but I 've been back through our records and can 't find any official request from the RSA back in 2012 which obviously was considerably before my time to to put this on the agenda so it doesn 't seem to have been worked on by that organization until after it was raised with me at Anzac Day this year so you know staff have taken that issue seriously and we did need to know what the decision of the Senate was going to be and that was very much my my decision because there was no point making a a permanent decision or making a decision that was permanent without knowing what the future of the cathedral was its location as part of its heritage status so that 's why we need that this is not making a decision today and and we wouldn 't be able to on the basis of a presentation but now that we have your presentation and it 's officially received and maybe maybe we 'll have a separate one that says that at the beginning that we 've received the presentation that there will be an analysis of of your presentation done in the work that you have done in terms of working with your community the type of community engagement that we need to be involved in whether it 's on a moving decision or whether it 's on the location as is quite a legal framework under the local government edge and again I don 't think even I don 't think legislation would remove the requirement and and neither it should remove the requirement to have very you know strong public engagement over the over either decision or both decisions so if if I could move that we received the presentation and and thank you for it request staff to continue to meet to explore both temporary and permanent options and to seek legislation relating to the Cathedral and then request staff keep us informed driver seconder for that Andrew well we haven 't got time for questions I mean yeah okay for me to support it I would want to see either a timeline added or some sort of urgency around it for because of that looming date next year otherwise emotions leave in another hundred years yes the legislation is not going to happen overnight though so so yeah I kind of want to get this on the table it 's also smoke that with urgency if we use at least use that word in there just it 's a it 's an extremely important date next year okay can we put too agent Lee Explorer temporary and permanent options yep yep why it 's linked with the restoration of the Cathedral because if we are to if we are to have an alternative mechanism for addressing resource consent requirements it would have to be legislative otherwise the resource consent required for moving a category one heritage building that derives some of its heritage significance from its current location will take Justin said he 'll be taking yep right I 'm happy to second that I just think even if that 's not seeking the final solution at least just get an updated report yeah back on what progress has been made so we keep agent Lee exporter there okay and requests the staff report to Council on progress by the end of November 2017 said all right I would expect that report to have outcomes of where we 're going like a clear direction because at that point yet one year groundworks would have to be done before winter next year so this summer we can 't go to the endpoint until we 've done the that I mean if we 're in a position to report there but legislation will not be passed by November I 'm sorry but that 's not how Parliament works we won 't even government before the 7th of October when they count the specials so you know I do want to be realistic here there is a whole legislative timetable that needs to be established and implemented if we can get a report what direction we can be going on but if I 'm just warning people if we go down the track of a resource consent it will take years that will take years all right so that 's that 's um you know in terms of the it 's now officially received and it 's now officially acknowledged by the council and we are asking for urgent advice all right so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you for listening to us and thank you for that debate I 'd like to just say that we have been working along with the council would regenerate Christchurch I forgot to mention that yeah and secondly I would like to encourage and invite all of you here to join us on the 12th of October I understand you are going to be planting a

the community council meeting that we 're holding today and Maori language week so thank you one and all and welcome do I have any apologies I think we have everyone here declarations of interest I haven 't cleared of any public participation no public forum or deputations by appointment a day of presentation and petitions no petitions we 've had a request that phenol from my mighty Huard community board come first because both the cheer and the dips each year are not able to come today and we have Bridget Williams to present the community board report for this month welcome Bridget good morning everyone good morning so I guess the first thing to start off with is that there are no parties with what we have and we take the report as reach it 's clear any questions and we would like to mention some specific highlights of the report I 'd be very keen open it up thank you and so the first one is the village church and community center that 's opened well the opening was held on the 9th of August it was a yes so it fits very exciting for the ward and another exciting highlight has been Everly park playground upgrade so this was very exciting for for the area and a special mention to Peppa no ans this has been a really huge success and just to mention that the opening the people who hosted it were the original people who were against the playground and so yeah we see this as a really great success in a example of the community coming together and at being a young yeah an exciting facility for the area the look said Chester yeah um images just to mention a significant community issue one in particular as Glen dovey Road so we have constructed a working group with the residents the year and the reason for there is there are some issues with this particular row this is Glenda the address and straighten and this has been ongoing now for about residents in creating a working party to help facilitate with this yeah thank you um Jonnie thank you for the report just one quick question under 5.2 the rotary cutter who to reserve the entrance upgrade um that 's great do you know are there toilets that are proposed to go and there is part of it up correct no that 's something that the board 's considered or no not at this point but yeah we could definitely raise it okay I just know at our community board with we 've had the air show toilets come up and one of the things we 've asked for is a bit of a strategy around public toilets because this some areas that have gaps so I 'm you know I think that that 's really exciting with that reserving upgraded it is very popular as you say so no thank you for that I 'm suggesting you definitely we 've found it with Fischer down more yeah yeah public toilets are differently yeah something to think about okay thanks sir yeah I was just gonna add bits that 's up and this is one of the gems of the city this the the lakes that are out there the recreation lakes so this entrance this is just the influence upgrade it 's it 's no further and they 're not doing any work at this point but they 're Rangers have put on their list of things once they get a management plan for that reserve which they 're trying to tie into the groins as well then that stuff will come along and no doubt they will come along kept in hand to this council hopefully in the next financial year to ask for a few million dollars for a small toilet I just made that up he 's that way if you start in the millions when it lands in the hundreds of thousands of people going for car that was a saving must you 'll see it surviving my I just wanna thank Bridget for acknowledging the peppery innards bored with what we did over the Eberly perfect I think it 's one of the biggest disappointments we had the representation review was actually losing Everly Park in Christchurch but you know thanks to your board for actually so stuck in to the guns or what what our board has started and finishing that project because what we 've seen is actually a really good success story and sometimes we 've got to remember some of the people that are vocal against things are a minority and it was actually that the bigger community group was saying you stood and put it in as it was planned it 's actually a really good outcome for the whole community Thanks yeah I think that 's a really good point because I mean I 've I was going to acknowledge what you see because I hadn 't appreciated that from the report is that the you know that the the protagonist says that were actually hosted the opening now I 'm in bits an extraordinary achievement in terms of bringing community to give that so I wanted to acknowledge the community board for that and also to really echo what Mike said there to acknowledge the work that the previous community board had done it is hard when boundaries that time and energy to creating something and then somebody else gets to make the decision which is a little bit around you know sort of how a lot of the community boards feel about bringing the party to such as here so thank you very much are there any other questions with a little bit of time no but thank you very much purchase and thank you thank you for coming in and as I 'm making sure that the feed Orton here word why my voice was heard around the table today thank you thank you right and now we 'll move to Linwood central biscuit and here we also have a first-time caller I 'm sorry would someone like to move in seeking the report Jamie Aaron I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that it 's carried sorry I got carried away and his Darrell who serve presenting on behalf of the Linwood central health care community board I 'm actually getting much better at remembering the order of names as soon as somebody said to me they only yet we 're on good morning nearly an and good morning councillors Linwood central hath got community report and we 've got a logo that has just come up here I think Jonnie took when we recently went to to Fira Mead counselors and community board members were invited to attend Fira mean it was a wonderful afternoon and myself for one was a community board member I went along expecting to hear a case about trains and technology at fearing Mead most of which I already knew but as we came in the management Theory meet had arranged a mock wedding and I was pulled aside and I thought well I 'm going to get to relive my youth again and to be to be the groom but unfortunately I was asked to be father of the bride which made look the management that theory Mead has undergone change and what we observed that afternoon was a well-thought-out plan in terms of management they are really changing things they are working together as a team and this mock wedding was really symbolic in the sense that the underlying made Park and demonstrating to us how they are prepared to think outside the square they had caterers arranged to show us that they were able to coordinate weddings they put to us how change management could operate successfully all in all it was a wonderful day where I came away thinking that theory made park looking for support from counsel not seeking Oh Sam technician very much okay made it up so we 'll just go with the flow the video until such time as something else comes up that I can comment on I must say as a father of three daughters I would sum somewhat surprised as father of the bride find that I had a fourth so today do they hold wedding ceremonies here they are able to hold wedding ceremonies there and they have the facility and they have the venue and they were simply showing us through demonstrating in a very practical pragmatic way that they have the church available that they have the facility in terms of a venue available to host weddings and what might be called a very what 's the forest had been put on and look for all intensive purposes the folk involved and the role play here inclusive of the children you would have been hard pushed not to think that you were at an actual weeding so not to lose the once we have a sense of occasion here in terms of what is taking place the real heavy message here is that that theory made park management stepping up they are stepping out they want to work with the council they want to seek funding they were very keen to show us what they could do how innovative they were with the management and not necessarily sticking to what you and I might refer to as the status quo come to feeling me go for a ride on the train take a walk around the park very about two or three photos as well and if I could just add that um all the people that provided the services for that mock wedding all donated it free they gave up their time the catering everything was donated by a number of groups and that was really unfortunately can 't quite say don 't know what 's what the contrast on the phone and that was the Masonic Lodge that that turned into absolute magnificent function venue and so yeah I just thought it is nice to acknowledge there that the main organizer behind it was Susan Carson from events and wedding professionals and then there were a lot of other support from different local businesses but as Dave said it was really a really neat showcase of just the change and I guess approach that they were taking and really just for those that were there just and thanks to all the community board members across the city that attended it just blew a blow us away in terms of the hospitality and the professionalism with which they put the event together so yeah huge thank you to them for hosting us and also obviously they saw their relationship with council and the community boards has been really important and they just organized them what wedding to signify the fact that we were coming together in a new partnership which I thought was really lovely yeah for the community board presentation if we don 't move okay thanks Darrell thank you moving to the first slide Thea I would break it down we dealt with the wider spectrum of issues at the community Morden meeting and for us break it if I was to break it down into three parts part one would be parking parking restrictions and alteration to bus stops and taxi stands patio would be that we approved street layout and we investigated tree planting Street renewal for the project and griffiths Avenue and part three what was that the board approved grants from discretionary funding as outlined on this light so if we go to the second slide pave recommendations to the council with respect to the coastal pathway you 'll note via that the board 's recommendations to the infrastructure transport an environment environment committee to consider the christchurch coastal pathway as part of the major cycle weights routes project for funding the upshot of that I had a report back from a meeting held I think it was yesterday and the upshot of that is it makes no difference at route project as the council will support the coastal pathway regardless of its status and council will work with the with the coastal pathway to put on submissions for funding whether that be government funding or funding from other sources also council staff setting up a meeting which will involve the coastal pathway project leader from Council Kirsten Mahoney as well as Lynette Ellis and the community pathway chairman scott barrington so although the recent meeting was a positive and supportive meeting with respect to we are too here for the coastal pathways and the fact that links into the major cycle pathways funding is not necessarily the end of the road so to speak thank you significant projects and initiatives the opening of the Sumner centre look was just such a well received and happy occasion it was a cause for celebration in summer and my thinks as a community brewer member goes to merely an and the council any funding the community wins has had won any funding that comes from council council have to balance priorities so look there was a meeting of minds over this and is outstanding it has really enabled Sumner to get back on its feet and the it 's it 's provided that connectiveness within the community and such a wonderful event yesterday I spoke to my next-door neighbor who is roughly about 80 years of age and he showed me the books that he just been down to get from the Sunland library and and he was telling me what such a wonderful facility it is so I know I 'm articulating well done but the practical face of that is that the community appreciate us so thank you well done council next live significant community issues that community borne concern has been raised in relation to anti-stress the proposed liquor outlet in Phillips town we had members of the community come along they were hard-hitting and they grew confronting and they articulated the concerns and via message very well at the moment there is no application but from a community board perspective should an application be lodged the the community would will support the community and the it concerns with respect to the proposed liquor outlet at 375 theory road a local alcohol liquor planned to give the community voice and that was discussed at Council and it as a point of concern next slide thank you progress reports about against the community plan and you can go on to the next slide the plan has been adopted there has been a wide variety of community engagement and workshops we have agreed on priorities that 's been well debated and priorities in the war plan color-coded to match the council 's our long-term plan and the council 's wanting plan and that 's pretty much a oh I forgot the best community in matters of interest and here I think Yanni for drawing this one to our attention these are the toilets at Taylor 's mistake and I guess that 's probably when you look at these toilets that have been entered into the New Zealand beautiful lose competition and the results the winners will be announced at the gala dinners in Hastings on Friday to think 13th of October the point I 'd like to raise about this is when you look at these toilets here what a great 're easy on the eye there 's a wonderful surfboard music at the front it 's lateral thinking it does away with the usual ugly concrete bunkers and I wish these toilets all the best thank you thank you very much well we 've really come to the end of our time but one very quick point is the second or the the other really great thing about these toilets is that the use of a huge amount of vandalism since we put the art and built these toilets they 've basically been almost vandalism free so it 's just a really positive story and I just yeah wanted to say that hopefully the like rotor cutter who to toilets can also be considered for an award but no yeah I I don 't think that anyone should underestimate the value of aesthetics in terms of prevention of vandalism you know if you 've got something nice that 's valued by the community it 's much harder to be the first one to do anything to it I think these toilets have seen a real benchmark yeah it 's great 't do any of them no no no we won 't get it okay I 'll behave myself thank you very much Darrow and I mean you 're an Oprah already there so thank you nearly look we welcome you to another occasion thank you the next one is the Banks Peninsula Community Board I 'm sorry we 've need to move an exit net Jonnie Dee on put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they don 't know it 's just me good morning Lena counselors here again we 've just got a couple of things to highlight from our report in the first one as the little Tundra theme in the reprieve or gift of laned I know it 's in a report to Council today but we just wanted to highlight away but be at the Museum in that project which obviously the law community are very excited about follow support of so this slide here actually shows the called my museum before the earthquakes which was down on our okay unfortunately the building was ruined and the earthquakes and sneer the former saw it was it wasn 't big enough to actually showcase all the items stolen which he still stored a keener brave Museum at that particular time but one of the big things that was showcased in there was the entire techniques of a sudden obviously that everyone 's very proud of so it 's just a photo of the former museum in the next slide as all of all the items that were actually recovered from the museum from the Littleton for gage so in the museum staff over actually demential and getting those items and stored over at Wigram so they 're nice and safe waiting for a new home in these eight thousand five hundred items all together at the annex storage facility this just shows the site which is to the least enjoyed so the on the corner the place with the big regrowth as our librarians ever seen to so directly next to it on the right hand side as the site where the museum would have a priesthood it would be from a community perspective it would be absolutely wonderful if it foot traffic and it would here actually help boost the local economy which is really struggling at the moment there 's still a lot of empty lots along the area and you know with the museum going the hopefully it could trigger the economy also with the Pro Shops are tuning to little turn it would be a real good tourist attraction so you know we are hoping and fully support the museum go in India the next slide as a bit of a mock-up of what it would be like and be three stories obviously the basement on the ground floor would be the entrance to the museum which would also accommodate a bookshop and an Information Center in the other two levels would be for displays so I just really want to reiterate the work of the team on the historical museum committee the really dedicated a lot of scope although they haven 't got a building at the moment they stole an exhibit parts of the museum places around little turn aimed really just at the elite nice to know that there are only way back so the move on to public participation so we 've had to lots of submissions the feast is the joint consultation with sprayed in Kashmir community boards on the Summit Road proposed prohibited tines and this has been a concern for quite some time obviously you can say well the time Maxia that there 's a lot of boy racers up the earth and the evenings as we all know the area 's very vulnerable to fire every night from 2015 was the power that was experienced out the year the residents on either side of the summit are really concerned to be at the spades that the cars are traveling so they were asked to submerge end-all in oil between the two boards is 865 and submissions the next one is one of their disease or a mare which is on a third of Littleton at the moment staff have been working with the reserve management committee to and former plane and we 've just received we are we 600 submissions for late these obviously a lot of interest these bike tricks go and through the walking tricks there 's just a beautiful place as you can say the view over the harbor so obviously there 's you know a lot of interest here as well I think it 's one we just wanted to highlight and be exponential as oscillation and hair can hit them so quickly the main highway and too little revenue grow it can be flooded quite quickly as we experienced on August 14th where she here community board meeting and Little River aimed during the course of the meeting the row flutter than we were strained it over the year so or not everyone some got through I think pretty near was lucky to get through with a place escort I have to say oh they will review that decided to travel home for Pigeon Bay in Port levy so that took them two and a half hours to get hiring the rest booked until the silos until the water receded so we just really want to highlight that point of isolation there is we had briefing from aching and back in July just to show us the work that they 've been doing to a problem and then I saw it for myself and you know believable here quickly their area floods and I know that I 'm most experienced in other parts of a such a but particularly on the peninsula over you know small communities can be cut off so I just wanted to highlight beat in its up thank you are there any questions from Council damiana just um an on previous reports the board has raised concern about the lack of maintenance has the board had any issues around timeliness of maintenance yes well we 're actually waiting for another briefing from staff and Irene those are shows but your maintenance as a book Victor okay we 'll hear something song about it I mean obviously it 's right across the study and us our concern but I think the other thing too I know one of their board members is quite patient about educating for you know local contractors because of the peninsula situation and you know if we could have somebody yet you know particularly on the other side of the peninsula that could keep an eye on you know need maintaining would be really helpful because I know previously we 've had things I 'm just thinking of summit coming in a corolla we 've been showing a lot of slides of broken foot pars and these whole bunch of things so just is there a program underway to address those well at the moment we 're just waiting to have a brief from imagine that stuff as I understand correctly you may recall it just by additional answer to that question you may recall after the 2016 annual plan we put in place a ocurro issues working passing and that 's a working party that 's made up of community board members from that part of the peninsula Christine attends those meetings on a part of a working group as well and we 've actually moved forward in leaps and bounds in terms of some of the issues that were raised in submissions to that annual plan so been emptying and and and the general tidiness of the town there was a lot of work done after the recent floods to tidy the town and to we 've made some good progress certainly not saying there isn 't more that we can do but as a result of the work of that group I think hakuro is gonna be a lot better place for this summer season than it has been in the past thank you I mean it 's a good model wasn 't it things I 'm working party model oh absolutely and you know they 're very dedicated and we 're lucky these are good gloves guys fierce cold on that group too and we 've so you know is injury seed we try to get to those meetings because a lot of those people on that committee given up your time you know the businessman look have not be tired to be part of that committees know very fortunate yeah and the other thing is is that we did actually try to get a local contractor to take over the whole of the contract but that was not successful so I think they 've got sort of some components of the contract are now delivered locally which is better than what it would be great to see there that you know the contracts actually embedded in the local community because you don 't want to wait for the contractor to come over the hill by the time please you know when when there are urgent needs to be addressed but I think it 's it 's starting to be fixed and that 's much better than it was or just going to say this here it feels like things are really moving forward in a positive way so and explosions oh well the Mary pointed out there 's a memo yeah that 's currently gone out to cancel some years about the additional perks urban park rangers that are going to be on the ground and local and neighborhood parks to try and resolve those issues yes releases coming through the email system so that 's gonna be really helpful it might be good idea to get them to send that out and show the community boards as well yes oh no because what Mary had to draw it to my evolution because I was concentrating on that 's right I 'll to the sign of the bell bird on page 14 five foot ten point one the Harry L trust or whatever it is that oversees a lot of the work around there do they have you know sort of good ongoing funding streams for the work that they do a big fire on us don 't have to find out it 's a bit of a mix okay yep look thank you very much I 'm Andrew would you like to move that this report they received yes I 've remembered what summer night just sitting there Yanni Thank You Unni I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's scary thank you very much thank you thank you and the next one on the agenda is spray tan Kashmir Carolyn Potter oh and we 've got Melanie as well morning puron tato it 's a good thing those here today place I go off on a cotton fit I feel like I will just before we start I just wanted to mention heading to Nate Eddington it was one of the all our board except one person went to the annual general meeting the other night and they they 've got very smart leadership team and we are hoping that we can help them resolve some of the funding issues created by the drop in funding from the council and we are hoping that we 'll be able to be more optimistic about their future than they were for a day or two after their the funding was announced yep in yesterday Carolyn and I meet with this about a different thing but related to our long-term plan so we meet with some holes all residents from the hosel residents association and it was around the Lincoln Road widening that 's obviously been in the long term plan for quite a while and this sort of being delayed in our borders continuously opposed spending any money on that part between culottes and rights mill continue to do so but what they talked to us about was how they 're concerned about how in halls wall that it 's growing or will grow they see by the size of gas burns or town or you know numbers of people down Lincoln Road no they were not any serious sort of a four laning because they say that they 're not writing transport engineers they are those well residents so but but they 're also looking towards the future so they 're not necessary in support of it as far as I could tell they just want transport solutions that will work for them where we 're talking buses we were talking trams we were talking the future so it 's just something that we 're wanting to put on your radar and that also that they are planning to go to the halls we horrible Hornby record and community board to give a deputation and then to ask for our boards to actually work together to discuss this because we 're you have to obviously advocate for the residents of Eddington um that will always be our priority but I 'm just giving you a heads up and finally before we start the pictures on Friday I 'm going to respray to school we 're they 've got a formal opening of a program that we 've introduced about trying to get sports gear out of people 's are moored robes and into the kids hands because the cost of children going to sports activities is enormous the membership of tennis clubs for young people for instance is two hundred and forty dollars a year this is just kind of cost that people can 't afford swimming lessons or 148 a term that kind of thing so we 're trying to introduce this gear swap so that we can get the new gear old gear gear that 's still good and shoes sports shoes out of people 's wardrobes and into other people 's hands and so we 're putting things in crucial places including schools and then going along and doing the opening I 'm hoping to dress Apple look like an idiot because if the kids see someone with my hair color coming don 't think that i 'm inaudi is coming to see them they wouldn 't be true alright and so starting on our pictures here we go it 's not a great picture but this is paper they also get 10% off for old people they they 've been so proactive in supporting and the community board and being really positive about interacting with us just for example they gave prizes for our awards community awards ceremony they gave us prizes but they an extra prize which was Jake 's autobiography about his experience of surviving cancer can anybody remember Jake sooner Bailey that 's a bogus Jake Jake 's memoir of surviving cancer for our use of the woods as well as an additional prize and here 's their window that 's not clear I know but it 's for neighborhood week and it 's got good traffic and good and good interaction with the community because it 's a fun window and I just wanted to say local community initiative this the plants food we 've been consulting with them and you can see the kind of thing we want to put out the police have found intervening on Vista place almost impossible they haven 't got their cars to be sitting up there all day and all night they can 't get up there are we held a meeting with residents as I think I told you and now they 're insulting on the sign which says no stopping from 00 p.m. to 00 a.m. except for owners occupiers and their bonafide visitors and that 's closed now so we 're waiting to see the result of that and you can see over the page where it 's all at Robert Lee Road and arif on Terrace this is one of those places with Lou 's where where Alou is needed and it 's really hard for staff to put up lose and hit watch them being vandalized and then putting them up again and then watching them being vandalized but this issue at this time was the narrow street was very high parking demand it 's taken a long time this because there 's a full layout with other streets if you put in solid parking no parking on rocky then you 've got to think about Vernon Terrace and then you 've got to think about the next terrace and so on and it 's lives taken a long time to get I was thinking about this was the other thing you see on rocky road is carefully picked up dog poo in plastic bags delicately placed on this road before they get into their cars and the next one is the summit me I 'm on to the summit road as well the summit wrote consultations been out the figures are very high on the response lots of people for you learn ownership of the Summit Road and would like still to have access seven 7 and have said so in for various reasons and so the outcome of this will be interesting and and won 't resolve all of the issues at hand but as the is an attempt to see if we can maintain some kind of civility on the length breadth of the Summit Road so up here is a picture basically links to the South Library where that beacon home service center as as the old pump station in the distribute which is circled and read and there 's also the distribution center to the left of it and their photo so the old pump station sites as well so that that pump site we hadn 't really been thinking a lot about it but we had some residents from the community come along and suggest to us that maybe we could use that site where they could use that site as a community space just for a farmers market as well as lots of other things that we could do there 's a there 's a bike sort of BMX trick just to the right of the circle there which was there at the moment in a course that that whole site runs Mike our library does runs right next to the Heathcote River which of course is the problems of flooding plus the Thermage heath get learning a plan around it so when we asked could we use the distribution center site for potentially for a farmers market the first response back we had was we 'll know we can 't_''_3569.74 because of the heath get learning plan but but now we 've been told that actually it 's not inconsistent with it so there 's something that we our board is very keen to also to be looking at the distribution center and here we can paint the most you so that I suppose for the community and also I guess thinking ahead as well to win there appears of the the South Library happened to so so that 's why we 've put that in their long-term plan as one of our top priorities were for you to consider ah and here 's a seeking picture of the that 's that 's that they 're from the the road you know that goes along by the library this is Barrington mall entrance this is the bane of our lives and many respects and was the top priority in our long term plan and it was a agreed to for this financial year it 's very complicated and it 's hard to figure the pedestrian crossing to the spread and library which is just there in the upper left hand corner and as well as providing excess grease from the Barrington mall carpark and access for pedestrians along that footpath and people with disability it 's it 's not as easy as it looks of Barrington mall and we 're hoping to get it done this year we 've got a great traffic engineer that 's what I forgot to mention on the get there thing a map a V is our staff member who was relentless in pursuing some of the projects that we 've got and I just wanted to mention her name with regards to the get gear but getting great I never get it right that I bet that project Emma baby is leading on on this project John Doris our traffic engineer and he 's doing he 's has done a great job and catching us up on our traffic engineering and I 'm sure you 'll do great on this as well in just with us cuz the spreading libraries right there because we recently had the will toe of the librarians I 've seen from the spray-tanned mark we 're going to community meetings if you got people coming to come to different things I see swaps and various things but I asked them about you know do you look over there when people cross that that straight down over and that 's really scary to sit there and to watch people nearly get hit every day so that was some nice and a tolerance I suppose from council staff so images obviously of the flooding around the power Heathcote River we you know we hit him there was a workshop all with a with a public way back in May and it was really Grange took sort of explained to the people have been flooded multiple times along that stretch sort of we 're the council was that at that point and then of course we had the workshop when he will the one in here recently we 're the drainage staff and Peter crushed chitosan and Keith Davidson that 's not so um they talked about their plans and after that flooding that 's happened most recently and we had 17 people that were flooded over their floor level who had obviously felt like they 're being forgotten compared to flocked and basin and the people out and South Shore area so we were really really happy with I mean everyone always as when they together so succinctly and so clearly so we 're really pleased to hear that there 's the idea of purchasing 30 of those properties and then the plans for the dredging and obviously the the retention basins as well along aside this though as just recent over the weekend there 's been because there 's other areas that are flooded not over the floor but in hone hey which was close to where I live and my Garret does get flooded each time but then there 's Marion place in Copenhagen Marion Street and Copenhagen place that regularly get flooded very very badly and there was also we a place which is quite close to the heathcote River between hone high road and the Heathcott River and those people are starting to want to hear their voices heard let 's put it that way so they 've had a meeting with the local MP over the weekend and we 're going to hear more from them so it will be something to be thinking about because I didn 't mention about it previously and they haven 't come to our 's going to happen next but um as we need to think about because they do get flooded every single time there 's a heavy rain and even on my street we don 't get a bit of flooding but every time so um there 's other areas they 're sort of adjacent in between you know the Hendersons area and the Heathcott rubber that don 't get regularly flooded to it so that 's what is the space space yeah thank you absol thank you Karen Melanie it 's a very full report and I think some of those issues are big ones and I just want to refer to for example to Lincoln Road which you referred to and I think the your reference to having discussions around that issue is important because the challenge that we have as council of course is that the public the bus part the public transport part which you know it 's a Metropolitan Planning meta as well through the joint public transport committee we have to make sure that we get that right I think the property is a parallel of pleased that both the the both forwards are having discussions around there too that 's important right the only other thing I wanted to mention is to underline the reference that Carolyn made to Addington it I was also at the meeting as Carolyn indicated and you know that little organization which became metropolitan in fact has 28 volunteers working with them so that 's a sign that you know there are a lot of great organizations that we need to make sure we continue to support and I 'm happy to move though Tim you think you 're just also it 's an interesting thing that with Rebecca Trek that and it comes to you I guess I 'm self responsibility people will travel somewhere to go and get fit but if wherever you go with it for our you hunt spree river you go just maybe just think of we but about where you 're parking because it does seem ridiculous that you travel across town to try get a car park as close as you can to the place where you 're going to walk for five community you 're entering you know just pack a bit through their way and it 's just it 's ironic but you know its life and I just also reiterate about the flooding that is the number one thing for us at the moment it is absolutely heartbreaking for those families and we are going seeing them at citris yeah and thanks to the staff who are working on listening to the rain on the roof must terrify a whole bunch of people or something yeah sorry thank you for the work that you 're doing with the sports gear I think that 's fantastic that you are you recognize that that 's a barrier for young people and you have created a really great idea and project to address it so thank you for that work thank you sorry about here but this there might be depending on what happens certain cities so much on climate change yeah yeah yeah it 's nothing you need it maybe we would appreciate that because we think that the considered discussion with our community outside of the emergencies that we have would the hardest thing in this area is that fears there was such a mess of effect after the earthquakes there areas that were already exposed have been made further exposed and it has been a matter of priorities and we 've set the priority at flopson because I mean I 'm it was way more than 17 floor levels that was three and in that regard and I mean you know you it 's really hard to talk about priorities when people 's through level seven being breached and in some areas that will only get worse which is why we have to consider all of the options and we do have criteria around buying out but it 's a you know it 's still a process to go through and you know it 's something that the land drainage recovery program has been working on and they will report back through that as we committee to the council so you know it 's there is there is nothing that you have said that that as a surprise to me it is a major concern and it will remain at head cut River so no could no question about me notwithstanding the inevitable oohed certainty of climate change in my view Peter Christensen showed a photograph of st. Martin 's in 1941 flooded yeah and but the difference is the houses are there now yes and look if you actually look at the things like the Port Hills fire there was a fire yeah started virtually in the same place Becca what was that 40 years ago or 30 years ago yeah 30 years ago I met one of the guys that was a firefighter on that fire there was no housing that was threatened by you know like that you know we and and do we when we make these development decisions and this is one of the things that I feel passionately about one of the lessons learned is that we have to look at land use pattern decisions that were made prior to the earthquakes because there were decisions that were made after the early 90s report there were decisions made despite the risks around liquefaction and electro speed being perfectly well known and it 's all it off and saying well the Environment Court overturn them that isn 't the case with all of them in fact the Bexley subdivision known as Pacific Park when turned because the council wanted to build all the way down to the river and the environmentalist push back because they wanted to develop wetlands so there was a half a half a paragraph devoted to the known risk of liquefaction and nothing taken into account so I want us to go back over those decisions I actually don 't think that read zoning should be an excuse not to look at what we got wrong in order to fix it for the future exactly our areas of development I don 't think that some of the people who lived in the port hills knew that they were in a forest fire environment I don 't believe that they ever understood that and we have to be much clearer about assisting communities to understand their risks that is not something that we can do for communities that something communities must do with the expert support that we and the council can effort and it 's not going to happen overnight Jonnie I 'm sorry but we 've got to the end thank you very much right we 've had and moved and seconded so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they know that 's carried and I shall invite coastal village to come forward welcome good morning lien and counselors and staff in community it 's really great to be here thank you amazing advisers to help me out here thank you great so we had no part as for our 7th of August and 21st of August meetings but under the community board decisions and the delegation I 'd just like to highlight a couple of things as I knew Preston 's subdivision we approved two new or five new bus stops and it 's really exciting and they were already installed and the bus service 154 farms dispensable has started a week ago and the patronage has already increased but it 's really exciting for that area there next we have the delegate that board also approved the landscaping and south which is really exciting because this was an initiative by the Darlington community cottage trust and they 've gone and with a partnership with Council the Darlington cottage community cottage trust contributed forty five thousand dollars to this for this fitness here so there 's seven items there that we can get very carried away on shortly once they are installed so that 's really exciting because you can see up on the plan there where the fitness equipment is going to go but it 's also sits between a half basketball court in the Bua Tennis Club so that 's really very exciting for that community here so well done to them for that the other thing the board approved was the concept landscape plans and the footbridge removal and path alignment for the Horseshoe Lake Reserve a few months ago the community board just asked the staff if they wouldn 't mind going back to the community just to make sure that things were clear about the possibility of removing the bridge or keeping the bridge so that went out and we 're very grateful for that okay with the removal of that we footbridge and in a realignment of the path diverting around we were further and also we requested an accessibility that audit on that just to make sure things are all lined up there now it 's not a company it 's a little wooden bridge sorry I don 't have a picture of it but it 's it was a QT bridge but we 're very aware of those little unique assets and communities so we wanted to make sure that you meet you were okay with that being removed and something else put in this place so they 're going to have some stepping stones across where the bridge actually was but they 're realigning the path slightly closer to the road so if we really appreciate stuff going out and doing that and initiatives so this is really exciting for area we keep bringing it up because we are very grateful that this is actually happening in our area so we 've got diggers and we 've got fences up now and we 've got everything on site so it 's there and this looks like a bit of a war zone but we 're used to that and there 's peanut cones again but it 's for a very exciting reason so the project team of the era charging away and they 've also DCL of also produced this booklet here which has been they have delivered a six and a half thousand people it 's just a booklet that covers things like the vision and the just the really generation outcomes and some of the proposals and that are going around so we 've got one for all of you but we haven 't handed it round on purpose actually it 's just in case you readin don 't listen to me so a really nice way to actually inform the community they 're also the hot pools initial design and concept consultation has started getting the community involved at this early stage is really really great also some other little small community initiatives are starting through details creating momentum regeneration funds and there 's we haven 't got pet to say about the next time we 'll bring the initiative of outside their shops putting on planter boxes and standard trees and it really has just revitalize them visually some of the areas of New Brighton so fantastically community just coming up with these ideas and having some resources to do so qet recreational and Sports Center well this is well underway and Ben Dave and I we 've got our hard hats on their orange vests then we had a bit of a tour around it this week and it 's absolutely fantastic so that is on schedule to be opening about May next year so that 's very exciting and also the South you brought in Boardwalk update we might take yep there it is as we speak that as what it 's looking like right now so this is going to be finished in a week or two but look at that that 's what you 've contributed to as council in this community absolutely excited about it the contractors I don 't know how they 've actually finished it as they 're doing so quickly because they have so many people in the community looks and how amazing they are I don 't know how many scones I 've had and cups of tea that I 've had brought to them but they 've still got the job done and it looks amazing so well done to everybody for their the on the same side of town significant community issues as you know the South Shore floodplain management short term options report link back to us as a community board and we really appreciated the opportunity to be able to comment on that so thank you very much for that and our recommendation on behalf of the community will be coming back to the council meeting on the 28th of September and finally we 've got some open coming events so we just wanted to sort of showcase this booklet it 's actually something for all of us it 's the breeze walking festival booklet that staff and the community have put together and there 's just some amazing I 'm not sure but I could be wrong with it 's about 50 walking events happening around and in a city which is fantastic is The Gruffalo explorer for the little ones a little ones and it 's in the bottle lake on the 4th of October and then another one I 'll highlight in that area is meet in the middle which is the celebrating celebrating the opening of the tiara ot Cairo which is the transitional Aven River stop think trail from the city to the sea so you know well done to everybody for putting it together but all the information about the whoops in your own area there in this booklet and we have God words but I think it 's a really special thing to emphasize for our city apparently the news is that we have 348 have arrived in well by the time they travel live a thousand miles anyway so they 're actually on Charles with Reserve Brookhaven at the moment but we 've got about another 1700 expected so they must be having a little bit of a rest there before they just pop over to the South Shore split reserve and I 've come all the way from Alaska cuz that 's amazing and hence that god.what statue at the South frightened bridge which will be installed later this year and finally we just have some a slider in just to tell you that this is the Aven River beautiful picture and beer weather so thank you thank you look I just like to reinforce Kim 's comments around QE to come clean and myself had a visit there last Monday and you know when you look at the plans of a facility you sort of visually conceptualize what you think this may look like and the space that might be there but standing inside the building you get a totally different perspective and so standing in the for example and the pool area of this complex it 's absolutely huge and I got the perspective really that the children 's play area where there 's going to be some whip fountains and things coming up a lazy river and Hajus slide comes in that area alone in this new complex I believe is bigger than the whole of the Graham Condon completes itself and when then you 've got you know massive 25 meter or hydrotherapy pool and and sparkles all all further down in the complex that is quite quite significant and the recreation facility the spin rooms and the exercise things on the other side equally very spacious my limited IT and Facebook capacity I put a few pictures up on Facebook and they attracted something like a limited eight eleven thousand four hundred and ninety view so I think there is a huge interest in what 's happening with this facility on an air ward and and I do want to express my gratitude to all that were involved in the planning and particularly Apollo projects at the moment and the construction of it it is going to be outstanding I 'd like to move the adoption of the report yeah love to second and I think it yes david said probably qe2 will be a major stake in the ground for recovery in the east it 's the number one the marker I think for many people just the goblets arrived two weeks early than many other years so the eastery crust is a very fascinated over there what does change week who knows but it 's the first year the goblets have left is an under a trump president ellen trust it good kind of river carnival as well so it 's gonna be quite an event even 's done a great job and yeah we have a slide show today for LeAnn the official employer and members just where we get the technology see it up i do i do i do appreciate i do appreciate your your comments about climate change and i do feel for people who look down in the the heath State River area and I just wonder why the district plain as a layout 15 houses per hectare and the Hendersons Basin here we go on there feel good lead off the duck okay I just done great pleasure them that 's first slide you 've had slide show you 've heard from our community board and and that 's a a very very very very happy bunch of fun board members so come along to one of our board made yourself so you 'd be more than welcome okay moving on we do with their more daily business pack so we 'll come to bet through the through air presentation around community board decisions under delegations just highlight the the first one which is coming up as soon as some very presses the button is the villamaria college con brio choir and they got the silver award and the big sing finals so on very very why I bought a very very pleased that we could help those young people I 've got a conflict-of-interest mama two daughters wheat Davila but anyway they didn 't have the choir that those activities at that time who are you really good to support young people and that we 've also run if we go to the next slide and you can see there where our third priorities were the one on there on the left that you can see is is youth so that their priorities the next highest one is children and the the one on the right the highest pig on the right is community development and residents association support all that stuff so we 're very very community fact conscious in the years 52 organizations over the year and with that level of funding so when may it continue this year this year yep so moving on then to the Waterloo Business Park I just invite people to actually go out there and have a look at the Waterloo Business Park up on the top up on the top the first big yellow block up there is is quite a large area that 's been taken up by CWF Hamiltons are going to be relocating from there in X rayed site to to let and it 's one of Canterbury 's some well it 's a world famous company and so there 's some real significant things happening near and later on and the mayor report this there 's a request for the installation of the nighttime parking restrictions and day in the industrial area and the Hillsville Junction Road extension project which were really really keen on on happening and we know that there 's money in the budget snare plus the grant of the million dollars from the from the Waterloo business back towards that project and just like on on the pound Road Waterloo Road realignment so that 's that 's something that we 've been looking forward to for quite some time that was a community board lead project and it 's going to make a big difference I think to the traffic movement sitting around that area taken a long time to get there but we 've got thee so it 's just a matter of waiting for the lights to be tuned on there so we were going to be historic precinct in the Waterloo Business Park as well so packet part of the old buildings real old brick buildings in there it is are going to be retained for for community use and the the Waterloo building was part we want it to be a place for people to be active not only in working as but outside of work else with the green space and parks that they 've got available so yeah moving on then Gary now putting away the mall the milestones planting a 350 native trees well and there 's ought to be plundered and it was very pleased to 9th of August then the four that work to get underway that 's a it 's a there 's a lot happening there 's not only the development of the of the sports hubs and playing fields but also the the stormwater retention and detention systems and alright a lot of work happening in there but it will be really really great when it comes on board and there 's a lot more pest trees to be implanting to be removed and replaced with native planting as well so an all spoke gun earlier in the meeting about the the tree policy Working Party that we 've found that we need for um moving on sorry go we do we want to just keep jumping to these and then I can just wrap up later and some of those other bits and pieces the addressed them memorials all suffered quite a bit of damage post earthquake live during the earthquakes and there was some there was a resolution passed that we actually get perceived as a demolition of that but anyway what we 're doing now is reconsidering that and seminar with the halls will Fenton one re here would was going to be on the 18th of September but it 's been put put back two weeks so and we 're going to talk to the community again about what community partnerships we could have what you know what the options are so when we 're talking about war memorial hall war memorials we 've got to be a bit sensitive about it so that 's where we just want to be sensitive about is it retained here or not or then how does the Memorial factors going to be accommodated because the lane was gifted by the coil family to the paper are accounts a bit making the dike so that 's that 's a can progress they did um the bit wrote over it bus lanes and Division Street the issue so with him we we 've had feedback at our last board meeting from the working party on this them on these issues surrounding the wicket and Road and the the bus lands so that 's a work in progress as well so there will be there resolutions of the of the Working Party to our board and they 'll be passed on at their next opportunity I didn 't put the slideshow together I 'm sorry but it was one of the things that was looked at but the future options that does say future options and it still rightly or wrongly and the presentation if we 've got here today that 'll I didn 't see that until I got here this morning sorry yeah so they 're the south still away from Provost and there will be more recommendations coming to the council on that one okay and then then the community board plain it 's been them a long time coming and it 's uncompleted Nia so that 's something that is going to guide us for the next two years plus and thus them in the storm of their community board and into the future I just like to think and Carlo and the staff for um for putting this together and yeah it 's going to be yeah all community boards you got their planes done now so and just very very pleased with it so that 's their that 's their guiding document into the future and moving on then to the halls wall quarry buildings were Pierre the old stone houses mentioned there oh it just I was just saying to our community governments manage of the old star enhances not to be confused with the old star enhance that that 's in the neighboring ward of Kashmir sprayed so this one the house that we referred to here is the the managers recent pass but we had a um a site visit went on a bus trip and went and had a look at the work that 's being done there and the quality of the repairs and the in the restoration of those buildings is absolutely incredible so it 's going to be all it is a very very important part of our ward historically a lot of Christchurch a lot of Christchurch came from that horse will quarry a lot of Christchurch so it 's system that 's the learnings plan for the the fourth of October so just like to offer the opportunity to but I do understand there might be a conflict for something else that 's happening at Council on that date which is a bit disappointing so invitations had come up to everybody yes October it 's developed into very I can remember back in the day when them when the council decided to deploy the quarry and take it over and they fired the last shot of explosive than their counselor right was Ron right and they 're back in the day and I can remember quite clearly that he said that this is going to be a real asset to the Christchurch and it certainly is that 's developed really really well over the years so we 're very grateful it still is in public ownership that valuable piece of history 18 i am from recall before is we just wonder like it does seem kind of you know it 's a major facility and now it 's a community for say but it 's also a metropolitan one it would be good to try and find a time where it didn 't clash I read it so we to the HHR which is a hyper helpful random facts so that 's seven so it 's really interesting and we 're gonna we 're going to will be given you more facts every every month when we come to do their on-air board reports of the council so nearly 30 percent of the city 's workforce work and air an area or so the local government 8 you should be bringing alternative face as well carry on carry on you know like Southwest across just ran home being a it has been a variable working-class area you know for a long time and at least that 's moving into the future as showing that that 27 percent of the workforce in our area and when you have a look at the big development that 's happening like the the Hornby quadrant that called the Stuart development boy what isn 't in Shane 's Road massive massive area in there as well as the Waterloo Business Park as well as the growth around halls will residential growth in a new commercial growth so it is some it is a rapidly be sustained for quite some period of time and nearly 13% of us you have the work force so these workforces of the record and warden so they come and rip out of Rickett and every day with their sleeves rolled up distinctive the people in Christchurch exactly then the other the other thing is their communities all the other issues we want to cover I think really had the pas de recommendations that also mentioned south or be schooled proposed school speed zones I 'm just really really pleased with the that we 've been able to progress that through and so their home south or B schools relocating to the brenston and immediate site so that foods or door taken up enough of the going this morning and just quite happy to answer any questions you 've gotta there a very wonderful PowerPoint presentation thank you 've got to your end of your time that you 'd like to wonderful presentations thank you for staff in the chair only the regarding to Yoda item 10 the na hoona why yes five point one point two three pop either mistake in here is opening in March 2017 for radhika ni p 2018 that is probably correct well absolutely strong actually if i must be vigilant brother brother chain failure point area otherwise pretty cool I didn 't push I didn 't push the wrong button on the computer Sikandar bud McKeon a plucky one thing that you didn 't tell that was incredibly exciting at the last meeting this week and that was the board 's approval of the revised design of the represent community center which I know will come to the next meeting music but instead of doing the future proofing by way of creating capacity to build on and future what the board 's done as think very creatively and build from the start a two-story building instead of a single storey building so it gets 30% more space through and from from day one and that was the proved by the board at the last meeting and a really good process thank you excellent thank you thank you sir Bates Ben did that alter the deaf person okay excellent we like to hear that right that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried and now we 'll move on to your part a which is the next one multi business depart for post nighttime restrictions John a briefly introduced that it doesn 't meet you yes and then we will approach for the would early business park and to to consider putting in nighttime restrictions for activity in the in the area as you can see in the report there 's been all sorts of noises coming from that area and damage to to the roads and facilities in there due to bad behavior boy boy races and other people congregating in there so what we want to do is to do what we 've gathered done in other parts of the city is introduced those rules around V the weights of vehicles and weight restrictions and and parking times great so who would like to move this Jimmy n would you like to see him yes we 're whereabouts in the rest of the city do we have not time restrictions Oh as the chair of the knows its staff will know the answer to that but it 's not relevant to this decision so I mean we can get you the answer to the we can get you the answer to the question but we 'll get it through the appropriate staff member as to where the other restrictions are I mean it 's not relevant to this decision it 's um yeah I mean we 'll get you the information but it 's not relevant to making this decision okay so Sarnia is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no thank you thank you can you record councillor swags opposition to the resolution of that resolution is carried thank you very much and appreciate I really appreciate all the effort that 's gone into the presentation today so thank you thank you and now with a start okay I 'm thinking the staff Papa Nui owners community board welcome abi-maria wrong we haven 't got a presentation this week we have been hit by some illness at our community board and it 's been oh we 've got one part a actually which relates to a speed limit change in literally a state drive now originally this was a private road and the speed limit through there was 50 kilometres an hour residents had said that this was causing some issues because of the kind of environment that it 's always been always been there excuse me and so the proposal to put some traffic coming and there was put out and the consultation included 234 leaflets delivered to properties along revelry estate Drive and the immediately immediate surrounding streets including 34 absentee landowners the leaflets were also posted an email to 187 key stakeholders and it was on the council 's have your say well page 35 submissions were received back 28 were generally supportive and 9 weren 't supportive so there has been that 's what the Part A is today the recommendation to council is to reduce that speed limit to or revoke the 50 kilometers and put a 30 kilometer an hour speed limit in that area other parts of the reports today we have had quite a lot of in the ward one being the traffic speeds and how it 's affecting sant Albans primary particularly and surely a primary we 're working with a number of schools proactively clearing popular Street as well as the changes to our ward as far as traffic flow and congestion continues and one of the issues we 're finding which we have put in our long-term plan or considerations at this stage increase and funding so that we are able to deal with these issues around these schools because it doesn 't happen for free and I have to say staff have been very proactive and looking at ways to do this and the most cost-effectively and safest way one of the issues that might just bring home to you how serious this is particularly in Trafalgar Street is where the new bicycle lane or the cycle lane has gone in we have children standing in the middle with one of the swing out lollipops and a teacher standing on that same middle median strip with them so that they can push them out of the way quickly should a vehicle head someone who can help here I 've suggested some sort of remote control system for that middle lollipop there are three lollipops one on the outside two on the outside rather one on the central center median now if you use it like a garage remote control in some way to use that middle lollipop to go out by itself that would mean that that can be operated by a teacher or another student and there doesn 't have to be a child standing there so if anyone 's got a garage with a workshop and knows how to do these things it would be really interesting project to try and get some sort of automated system in there the Suburbans pavilion and park upgrade but we make no well we do make apologies for this to be honest it has taken far too long this well-used Park and soon Albans the Pavilion was destroyed pretty much in the earthquake and needs rebuilding there has been engagement with key sports groups and that has continued well and we now have a draft plan for the new pavilion filmed the entire there since the park was really established it is going to take around two years to actually grow that grass again and it 's a long time but which is why this is even more of an issue because it 's taken this long to get sorted but we 're underway now and in fact we are putting out some positive media and photo to the local media to give them the timelines because people in the area are wondering what is going on and there is really about it oh no we did have a and the six mill working party the sticks river rather catchment working party is going very well there was a meeting last night it 's a sketch me it 's a joint issue and it was chaired last night by councilor East Emma Norris from our community board went along with Joe Byrne and I believe David you have been elected chair on that I think and they will possibly be a co-chair vision for a coach here at the moment your two members that have attended have been happy for me to chair I hear you 're doing a marvelous job David so that 's fantastic thank you and thanks to staff too for pulling that together because it 's a major issue for people out there and it 's a real concern I think that is about it actually some great stuff coming through from the youth in our Ward and I have to say you know this is one of the issues that 's concerned us with the reduction in funding as you know when you 've got young people coming through that I represent in New Zealand at a very high level and sports are now four or five hundred dollars from the community waters helping make that happen it 's that 's why we do what we do that 's one of the main satisfactions so we don 't want to see that curtailed in any way I was going to pick up the sticks revocation living party and then the sense that every time a community ball comes to us and they they talk about an area where there has been you know sort of challenging issues to the difference in the world it 's working around the schools as well you know to be able to get police safety officers council parking compliance community board community governance all round a table with principals teachers and some parents we work out what the problems are look at how to fix those problems fix the problems meet again to see how it 's working and I have to say it 's surely intermediate it 's that 's round central government level we call that regulatory impact analysis and normally where it falls down as they don 't define the problem at the beginning that sounds like you 've got that nailed hmm Pauline Mike did you want to move second this yep Angus William the basketball player he says he 's 16 he might even be 15 maybe just 16 mr. duck to get out of the doorway he is sore but so driven and focused and you know that level sometimes I think really you know what we 're doing is really helping to make the difference but it 's quite clear when he comes and he says a difference and it 's amazing yeah that 's this voice representing New Zealand yeah yeah and to come in feedback to the boards is really important not just for us that for them and they come back with PowerPoint presentations and all these incredibly character building experiences they 've had on their trips overseas and it 's it 's just any parents come with them as well and you can sort of see them in the back you know and it 's it 's lovely to see the family there supporting him to all the children the young people that come along so we 've been posting sending those into the news line and the in the newsletter so that 's one thing that we 're feeding in and hoping that they making it I don 't know because they 're really good stories yeah so there any other questions we 'll move on to your part a after we 've done the report but there 's no question so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they know that 's move straight on to the next item which is the proposed speed limit change to rubble air state drive which you 've already introduced again Mike Pauline happy to move in sick that what the one comment that I wanted to make about this is that when I read it I realized that this was a a speed limit that existed when it was a private road but when it was assumed into the crash each network have picked up the default speed and the city and to me that indicates an issue that we should learn from because it seems to me that that should be looked at at the time of bringing it onto the network as actually is the default speed the right speed to apply or should we actually change the speed as we bring it unto the unto the city network so there because I doubt whether some of the problems that are there today would have been problems of the 30k have stayed all the way through so how do we do that well I 'm just going to talk to Mary about that I 've assumed into the network it was just this you wasn 't it so just this year so we have a there was a demerit rode 1993 yes so it was a little bit before my time I 'd only been an MP for three years at that point but didn 't even represent that area there so yes so it was quite a long time ago and I don 't know whether you know that I mean how often it happens but I think I would like to record and maybe a separate three is that sort of request staff and future when private roads are brought into the city network that a consideration is given to the operating speed at the time of the transfer so and and and that would just simply mean that they have to consider it it doesn 't mean that it 's a slam dunk to default or a slam dunk to retaining the speed that 's there but it 's at that staff will turn their attention to that fact before the transfer is finalized thank you that sound reasonable very any discussion I just like to thank Matt too as I mentioned earlier he 's working on two boards at the moment both the Pendleton etc etc and ours and you know it 's it 's and we 've got a lot of as I said sickness as well so I just want to say thank you to Matt for that thank you me so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Kerry thank you very much thank you so that 's the end of the community boards thank you all very much for your contributions this morning I enjoy these meetings insurance committee nuts I 'm happy to move that they be accepted seconded by Andrew I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they know that 's carried the next item is item 17 policy for the appointment and remuneration of directors to council organizations I 've asked Ian Thompson who 's been what about done odds missed out actually the see I actually crossed off the chief executives report lemierre item 17 I 've asked in to do some more work on the actual wording of the of the policy for us to consider so I 'm going to just leave this lie on the table until the council meeting on the 28th of September 2017 and can we just do the appointment of the hearings panel petal panel for the Littleton historical museum society and then we 'll come back to the chief executives report so would you like to move this Andrew seconded by bill any discussion I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we 'll work back to the chief executives report mindful of the fact that Mary is sitting in the chair replacing car Dean today I would say be gentle to with her but just you know ask her really hard questions if you feel like it so over to you Mary I 'll let you introduce the report thank you tena koe jacket or canoe to call me to her a hooker who he might na da total he kicked evoke even the mayor 's me we the week of to do Maori and the just some key things I will take the reporters read but some key things I want to highlight as the recent awards that Kelsey so the public information comms team there is world round emergency management communications customer services the three finalists and the local government customer service award and they 're a world by a transport team and the public engineering Institute of public engineering also want to highlight the work that 's being done across my council which is really looking at that digital transformation of the way council does services so that work is really trying to look at for those quick transactions for people they can be done online quickly and very cheaply and that also then head and hand with that they 're saying that we also have people doing quality engagement in the community so it 's not or it 's about doing those things in tandem and also the work that 's being done across our city 's program which is really looking at the future the digital future and that there 's no financials in this report and our first set of financials won 't actually be ready to September and in the recent report I think just highlights some of the progress that 's being made particularly across that capital and asset work a lot of which has actually been reported through two committees and through two council already but it 's just highlighting some of those no one 's got any questions um but okay Becky Jonnie just one and it doesn 't need to be answered now but could we get a definite date for when the up lighting of the patina guns will actually be in place I know that the parks have got so much on and I appreciate that there are some issues so I 'm fine with whenever it is but could we just have some certainty about it so those were just discussing there yesterday actually great so we will be able to come back with a few oxidate thanks Mary yonni given that the community boards had expressed a lot of concern over the flooding and the lent drainage I overview around what the next steps are in terms of coming up with some decisions so I might have bent over to Dave because it 's part of your team being able to give the next steps around the land drainage work I know there 's a public meeting at the end of October 17th around both principally around that middle Heathcote area and looking at those options which is what we are going to take out to the public I 'm not sure exactly what he only wants in the way of just air to that though we had not just the working group but there was a combined community board that he land drainage commute working group meeting all together in this chamber and we went through quite clearly what the options are in that meeting was about giving the land drainage team a steer on what those community boards thought would be the best way forward and the options presented and I think that from me we 've got a timeline we know that those options are going to be duh pin strengthened and brought to a to engage with the community we have to actually reinforce how complex the Heathkit is it 's a linear problem it 's not like flopped and where you could create floodplains and widen rivers it 's incredibly complex and so we 're just being progressed and I think we can 't rush this but it is happening Jonnie and you were there I asked for a really clear timeframe of when decisions would be made and I haven 't_''_7192.05 I mean I haven 't had that but I think the key thing is that there are community meetings organized in October and I mean I 've been told that I shouldn 't talk publicly about what the options are we 've heard people talk about some of the options this morning so I just think if we can put something that tells people when the decisions will be made about what 's happening because people are incredibly stressed out we 've just heard from the community boards and you know I 'm happy to talk about what we discuss and that px workshop if you want but I don 't management and it 's really helpful that contribution thank you very much for it because what it does is it enables me because I wasn 't at that meeting it enables me to address an issue that was raised before and I did you know there are several options for addressing all of the flooding issues that were confronted with if it was just if it was one set of problems that we were confronted with it would be very easy but they 're not all the same each of the catchments is different and yes priorities have been applied because of the level of exposure that has been identified flopped in '_''_7264.65 was absolutely the number one priority and nothing has changed and in terms of the and in terms of the decisions we 've made and what has been implemented in that area that makes me think that we made the wrong decision I believe we made absolutely the right decision to prioritize rockton that did involve some bias but it is also going to mean that we can sell it empty sections back into the market and levels so we 'll be in a completely different position than a then somebody who was living there before and wasn 't a rebuild who wasn 't able to lift the floor levels so the Heathcott has in the past had floor levels lifted with support from the council but it hasn 't been the council paying for the entire process there was a sharing arrangement that was many many years ago long time before a long time before I was in Parliament I think better lying on the council so you know all of these issues are aren 't easy they are complex and the Heathcott River is the most complex because there are multiple layers of actions that need to be taken one action that will make a difference a nolo flooding event so but so will actually not be effective in a high flood event so you know and because it 's not that simple and there is no magic wand there is no silver bullet it 's really important that we take people with us through it it is frustrating that is challenging it is difficult our communities in these challenging times and not to create unreasonable demands on timelines and decision making we have to go out to the community and talk to them in a very open way about what the options are and what that might mean for them personally it 's not just the catchment that 's how individuals homes are affected and that is always going to make it very very difficult so even though I know that you are motivated by such a powerful desire to support community sometimes the way as presenters can actually make people feel more vulnerable than they need to feel we are working really hard to make sure that people in that area are able to get the security that they 're looking for but it isn 't going to be one answer there 'll be a multiple series of answers down the Heathcott but we 've heard we 've heard from the community board we 've heard from individual councillors there isn 't a councillor that represents an area that the Heathcott River touches on that hasn 't raised this every single one of it 's a priority that is the next priority and that is what staff are working on but look I don 't want to you know I think it 's unfortunate to end up having this debated in this format we are going to have reports come to council we will be going out to the community they will know what we 're doing I can 't_''_7482.85 say that there won 't be another flood between now and then that 's the trouble you know you know you can talk about one on 50 year and one and a hundred year and one on whatever number of years but the truth is is that we 're exposed to the same level of risk every single day I 'm sorry but the I did mention the complexities but it 's no good stuff going out and without all the information you so they they wait him to get everything lined up and they 've taken a steer from that workshop we had Yanni and that will be when they 'll be prepared to face the community was really good robust information smooth got climate change to throw in there as well but I do think that perhaps that the message from those is that we do need to get you know sort of a newsletter out to people who live in the areas that are vulnerable to flooding telling them what we have done so far and what is happening next as I know that is hipper than this yes and and in getting a works notice is not the same as getting a yes yeah and they have been designed for the back purpose but anyway I 've got Phil I 've got look a big debate Liam but I just want to make some comments because we are I don 't want to get a whole lot of discussion around an issue that 's not really the subject there 's two paragraphs on land drainage planning and this report I don 't want to side track onto this issue so he 's gonna briefly say that we 've got the best staff I think probably in the country working on this flat out and and end date as Pauline modeling work which they are still doing so that in fact we we get accuracy yeah around the options thank you listen crib we had I 've been out to visit people with staff and it it 's really crucial that we 're all on the same page but yeah there is a frustration out there and it 's not even frustrated to fear and I think someone point out when some families here the rain that really does affect their children etc so that 's so important I 've been explaining to people the work that is done leads forward bleakly because one thing and one part of the Heath get can adversely affect another part it as an absolute bagger to try and get the whole thing right but we are moving forward I think that meeting on the our 17th 18th of October will be absolutely crucial to hip those options and the information clear when we talk about options we 're not talking about what we came out earlier on with a whole heap of options yeah these are now the options that council have to quite right there 's not one silver bullet there 's going to be a number of things that are interconnected that it 's not going to solve the problem in a sense it 's going to to reduce the effects and it 's really what we 're talking about and I think we should be very honest and clear about their day on ahead to well one question actually just on the flooding one though are we looking in when we get the report back the IFV and do V that people have had because obviously there 's been a fair bit of money chucked out from EQC on people who have got increased flooding vulnerability that was also included in in the lockdown situation in terms of the buyer is is Dana yeah because I don 't know these people some of them have have had considerable sums of money from EQC for the increased flooding vulnerability and I just don 't want us I got 500 dollars for me so I 'm solids they 're 5 once the once the I mean I just said I 'm just it 's taken into account good we do not pay people for what they 've already received just just also an to force that this metal wasn 't actually covered in the report debates outs outside the content of this report if you want to discuss this we could get the right people to discuss it with you or get a memo to you yeah I don 't think it 's for now so yeah but I knew there was on top of my head and otherwise I 'm feeling earthy but the main thing that I was asking or wanted to ask was and that whole debate has lost my oh yeah the building consents the new where was it there 's something news happened and there was it doesn 't actually say the new regulation that was what it was new regulation and we 've had to have him be here or something what was the new regulation it was that it was it 's all major yes if anyone it 's a new mechanism for measuring that we 've got a briefing on it a few weeks accreditations and how to decree that can you yes the one was intrusion on to site plans plans so those two things came in and which required council to review its fee structure bility to recover fees for those two things that was the principle one that I 'm aware of yeah but that there was a different we have had a nice visit yeah well but it sees recent changes to regulations meant that staff from MB were also here as observers and that 's because the measures have changed or the nineteen year so yeah when when you looked at a anions inspection in the last time they visited they may have a bit have issued what was known then as corrective actions required and they called them a cap so you may have had three or four maybe five cars issued now at this time around we have had nineteen general areas of non-compliance and they are sort of some of them are caught their paper trail stuff but previously we might have had five cars and each of them each car underneath them may have had the new style of an MBI and irons inspection there 's no corrective actions they are all individually listed so of the 1990 the relate to one small particular area where it 's just the way we document things and there was just suggestions that we should put hyperlinks and for example to go from a reference from one area to another so of those nineteen nine of them were related to issues such as putting a hyperlink in to be able to quickly cross-reference across a number of bits of paper we so whilst 19 seems high it is in fact if we looked at last time round and split out our cars we probably had somewhere 35 to 40 different things to deal with so I think it 's fair to say that when the iron 's team came in as the initial part of their report said how pleased they were with the the visit the cooperation of staff and the level of the high level to which this council has developed its building consenting process and and really what they have found is relatively minor we leading building inspection team in the country near which is a huge turnaround from before or five years ago when we lost accreditation so we 've gone from zero to hero and that they will still find a few little bits and pieces that need to be addressed and on court very comfortable to hear that most of them are of that sort of put a hyperlink and to be able to cross-reference things yeah so that was a very good question thank you Andrew thank you I 'm referring to page 8 of this report or page 75 of our agenda the paragraph relating to the crown completing its first annual review of the Greater Christchurch regeneration Act obviously that work is now completed no changes recommended but then there 's the comments at the end of that paragraph about the restriction on council making any changes to its district plan this can apparently occur once the final appeal against the district plan is settled what would be the process for that has there been any commentary on that or is there any thought within this organization on how sorry I 'm not aware that can I get better sentence right and yeah in the chief executive curve answer so what we 've been talking to central government about is changing the legislation because the legislation gives effect to the length of time for the order and council to apply everyone is agreed that it was only really ever intended to cover the period for which the that the replacement district plan process was in place so once the replacement district plan processes in it Esmond then we have reassurance because this was done across the parties that the legislation will be amended to allow again christchurch to have the ability to change its its district plan through normal RMA processes all through the regeneration export development we still have the power to change it through the regeneration the Greater Christchurch regeneration Act but that is a different process from the RMA process and in some instances we prefer to use the RMA crisis yep not a good question so just for clarification does that mean it won 't you see take the previous five years we could it I think yeah June 20 21 before we can basically amend our own district plan through an RMA process we can only use the regeneration act process I I don 't believe that was ever the intention the intention was to tighten with the conclusion of the replacement district plan and the replacement district plan will be in place once the final appeal as exhausted yes yeah but the remember that the Greater Christchurch regeneration actors there also so that is another mechanism for changing the district plan David I just like to reinforce a comment that came or subject that came up in the regulatory performance meeting earlier in the week where a suggestion was made when this is probably a suggestion to carry forward with carving when a when advice is given of a standing committee meeting and we 're all on a number of different committees and we don 't often you know have time to go to them all but if there 's an item of interest yes like this we would so just a suggestion that came out of our meeting was that when advice just the agenda items are published with that notice that the whole agenda is available on victim can 't_''_8219.29 yeah so that we can just see the item the items that are that 's a very good idea and so that we can then make it a quick decision without having to download the whole agenda to see what what it 's all about and make a quick decision or your ID and five already probably like to go along to that meeting and just check that out so we thought that would be a good initiative to add to just notification of meetings I don 't even think they can wait yeah for the chief executive anyways I 'm thinking that they can be actually there any other questions comments around the chief executives report all the comments are gone because of this report my personal view I have a feeling you know regarding the management the colonists see eat and the greater job because why if you review this information page what a City Council will receive the emergence management Public Affairs EP EMP a new Zenith Awards 103 finalists for the years the ultimate local government customer service sent a war sir the one is the I don 't think so every counselor in a maybe in a nationwide 76 of 78 we are 24 hours the service through our phone calls were email of social medium said so and also the here we try to you know to give the public community as as possible in the lake can assist another confidential information we try the for the house sales this is condo looks like before I didn 't cities like it so we we have January you know become the kind of try to know to although I say to take away or Mecca all the council as a new appearance new image this faintest before probably nine years so it 's very good so we should ask oven so should have recognized the college that occurring sir whether the leadership this is my view I own this quite foolish no it would you like to move that the report is possible I don 't know I would like to you can they enter speaker motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you and now we 'll move on to the mayor 's report yeah I 'm okay look I 've what I mean as you know in my report I must all of the events and meetings that I go to and I 'm always kind of shocked at the end of each month to see how many of those that there are but they 're all important for for a whole lot of different reasons I did highlight a couple of things which in some ways I would have gone to whether I was the mayor or not and one was the release of decline and fall on severed Street which is the fictional sequel to Villa at the edge of the empire a hundred ways to read a select City it was as Fiona Farrell 's absolutely fabulous post-earthquake book and I haven 't read decline and fall yet but I 'm going to and but you know whose style of writing and in the messages that are contained within it I just really earthquakes that you know I just really want to you know commend it to people and the others Berlin Lai exhibition you know Dion reminded me the other day that you know he was born and Manchester Street he was raised in Manchester Street on the corner of Peterborough Street and that little corner represents a part of his history and motivation as an artist he kept an old kerosene can that caught the light the flesh and his expression was were all stopped short by wonder sometimes and that 's when it first stopped me in its tracks I mean that story comes from you know Christchurch it 's a crusher story so I 'm just I 'm just saying you know I 'm you know not meaning to sort of focus on that over other issues but there 's just these things happening in our city that relate to our history and our future you know yeah excellent excellent it 's the a few it 's the north east northeast corner yes the honorary citizenship that was something new that came from a consideration by the council I the Dean of Christ Church Oxford and I did talk about them and also to Consul General John on his departure from New Zealand as our second consul general but somebody who 's just been a tireless and enthusiastic advocate for Christchurch but at both ceremonies I talked about where my motivation for it came from and I haven 't spoken about it other than those occasions because I wasn 't_''_8579.35 at the meeting we 're counselors past this but you know I went to New Orleans after the hurricane Katrina some years afterwards as part of my studying what happens and post disaster environments and I went to some bernard parish and they gave me honorary citizenship and well it wasn 't a ceremony it wasn 't it didn 't come with anything but i felt incredibly connected and and and i felt that it was more than just tuning up it was about the connection that we had i was a member of parliament at the time that it happened and it 's it 's it 's about a connection made meaningful by a shared experience which is from Martin PC was extraordinary and I 'll circulate it to you all he 's written quite a well it 's it 's it 's really you know it 's a page that that expresses what it feels like to be a citizen across a across our the history that that our paths cross it 's an amazing piece so and Consul General John was completely you know taken aback I just think that in terms of the connection that both of them represented was a really really good start so so thank you for that the Summoner center opening was just an absolute thrill and Sarah and Dion no not Dion Sarah and Yanni both really made that an incredibly special occasion and it was it was actually quite moving I met a woman who was working there at the time of the february earthquake in 2011 and it was the first time she was back she was there there is a volunteer making cups of tea and she was you know and I said to her I said you must feel incredible you know being back here now there that the library and the community center should be the same she worked in the library and to come back and then see the museum there as well she was just completely you know I don 't know move by the whole occasion it was it was fantastic so again it was just an incredible occasion now I 've been asked to talk about the Greater Kailash eh public transport Joint Committee and I have got some details here so one of the things that people have asked me about as is that there is is that although the the Greater Christchurch public transport Joint Committee put out a now actually I could write down for you okay so the committee is responsible for the public transport network review and we 're also responsible for the draft regional public transport plan 2018 to 2021 the draft will be ready for public consultation early next year so that 's what we 're working on as a committee at the moment the we 've shifted the meetings so that the meetings are now bimonthly and we have workshops every month so the second month that 'll be a workshop and a public meeting there isn 't much to be discussing in terms of the public meetings at the moment but we have deputations you know we had the summer field residents turn up to talk about their desire for a bus service change in their area so you know these things are sort of thrown into the mix and and then we 've also had the western people one to talk about how they are concerned with the lack of buses that go through the West End area which is our area here and so I 'm just going to talk about that in a minute but I 'll just say a couple of other things the amendment to the Local Government Act and the land transport management and Menma text that we have now got agreement from Parliament on didn 't pass the leap the wider legislative change didn 't pass before the election so it would have to be addressed post-election but we had cross-party support for to give became the power to devolve responsibility for public transport to the legal power to actually delegate it to the council but regardless of that this wonderful thing called the public transport operating model continues to exist no matter who does it so there 's a lot of work that we still have to do even if we get the law change and then if he can transfers it to us we are still bound by the public transport operating model so there 's a lot of work to do now that the the last but is actually really good news which shows that he can have gone out as a result of discussions that we 've had in relation to the Joint Committee for an expression of interest for that war a request for tender on a shuttle for the central city a which is which is very good and so as you 'll know a previous counsel with the Christchurch City Council before the earthquakes used to run one and and basically it was it was rate payer funded because it wasn 't part of the public transport system so in the excessive inaccessible city chapter it was expressed that said we 'd like to see a central city shuttle back but it should be part of the public transport system and not just the responsibility of the ratepayers of Christchurch it should be able to be funded through the the joint model of funding through the public transport system and so that 's why we are out there in the market to see what the market has to offer yep thank you requests for tenders have we specified or put a waiting on that being electric no we 've asked for expressions of interest I mean request for tender it 's not we haven 't gone out and said we want to have we want to hear people 's ideas I mean II can have done this off the back of the discussions that we 've had so it 's not it will be coming back to they 'll be reporting to us in October as I understand it they 'll be reported to the council no joint public transport committee so this for the Aoi stage rather than actual request for tender yeah yes no that apparently beyond an Aoi and had a request for tender process but it 's not explicit about the form of the sort of not said it has to be illiterate or you know let 's say ya know because we can 't we will come if for example the Joint Committee declines then we will have to consider it ourselves I don 't think so because we 'd have to vote for it we haven 't even started down the track of the wider public transport no but I think they the committee knows that the strong feeling for electric but yes that is that translated into the actual documents pre procurement yeah well can we just check because I don 't take things on blind faith no no it 's not a question of blind faith there is no there 's no it 's a report back that 's coming it 's not a decision that 's being asked for at this stage but I would get more information but I thought it was public knowledge that it had gone out for well I 've certainly known about it but I thought it was because I mean I mean I know great bus have put on a yes I know they have yes but that 's not it 's not secret anyway sorry well what they would have a that been at the meeting that we discussed it at in public so it 's being discussed in public at the joint public transport committee but I don 't think it 's the most exciting item on the agenda for the media to be there at every meeting so can I just raise a different issue that you raised in and which goes back to your comment about the excellent literature coming out of Christchurch yeah and the amazing books that are written here I just wonder if there 's a possibility if we could use our incredible library system to somehow showcase local literature because there is a huge amount now being published on Amazon do publishing so there 's a lot of local authors trying to get some awareness that they 're writing they 're able to publish they 're able to buy off Amazon but getting into the 're you know 10 or 80 or Fiona Farrell or anybody message it would just be lovely to four to have some means by which people know that our libraries provided the you know provided there are certain standard or don 't breach anything and cut that their books could actually be in our libraries yeah thanks position but just these were restaurant in Christchurch and I Christchurch people pretty cool but it 's so easy to do be really cool just have a roll in stock Mahoney and the other thing that we looked at possibly doing was the some time ago and hasn 't happened yet and that 's probably my hope is as actually teaching particularly kids about anybody how they can actually publish and market their own book because it is now a whole different ball game than what it used to be and you can do it for next to no cost on Amazon amazingly the older with the printing and independently I don 't know which yeah yeah somebody awesome oh all right so it 's someone like to move that my report received Glenn just the in Appendix B you describe that where you should have been a pin deck say I 'm sorry okay did you want to mention that I can do what what would you like well it looks quite interesting because it 's obviously a lot broader than sister cities so it 's oh sorry you 're talking about yeah one that should be Appendix B that 's your pin deck see yeah this it 's a it 's a region to region MoU with Nagano Prefecture yeah it 's um it 's it 's it 's a great and principle between the Mears of the region it would be a first but the Secretariat has been directed to work with crushed it she educated and the City Council staff to draft an MOU it 's not a sister city relationship it 's a it 's a it 's basically a cooperation agreement through memorandum of understanding I think it 's ideal did you like the comparison between the two if you take the two two once they were cement debate around the around the table as to whether was that the hot springs differently settled Authority so it was but I mean I just think it 's amazing when you look at the links seeing like hot springs winery terminal city of gateways that it might be better than too little don 't like the word terminal tramping ski resort compact city star watching which excited the mayor of tomorrow of course star watching forests and animals and nature natural energy I mean it 's just you 're really I don 't know that they 've done their homework in terms of what connects us as a region it 's obviously it 's hard to tell the distance from Tokyo the intersection of four tectonic plates but I guess that 's another kind of way yet with isolation opportunity intersection as well that yeah okay yeah yeah fast train pull up Shane reporting yep just on that to if any one keys to Google a documentary called strip to the city it 's on choice you can get it online it 's amazing they did one on Tokyo the other night and on its fault lines and what fascinating my ones on the the water thing you say you 've got on page your page one on the water mmm oh yeah it states that came to brief rivers there 86% swimmable do we do we accept that or does the forum discuss it I don 't know and the other question I have is on page five or is everything from the why take each other yeah that 's why and point duty for the government has established a technical advisory group to advise officials on the practical impact of different options for the water allocation program and David Cagle has been appointed the Technical Advisory Group will report back to government at the end of 2017 is there going to be any oversight of that report before it goes back to the government perhaps that might be worth finding out because I think that 's quite a it 's an important issue for all of us and be quite good to have a look at what the recommendations are yeah that I mean yeah the the government is yeah I mean this is a government piece technical advisory group so I don 't_''_9530.21 I don 't know that he 'll be there to report back to report through the Canterbury mural forum I doubt I doubt it would because there 'd be only be only one more meeting of the forum before the end of the year I think not sure but I 'm sure David 's very open to having that conversation so I just approached them directly and we could also raise it through the the next forum that we do with the n commissioners it would be good yes yep yeah Mike thank you apologies if you mentioned this before but I just like to congratulate you on your election to the National Council of the ogee and zedopp obviously it was a lot closer vote than your mural campaign and I 'm just glad I got the vote for well I 'd like to thank you for for agreeing to support me I was a bit worried there for a minute but no it was just one of those one of those elections which is exactly what happened last time and I which was that it came to a draw and but this time unlike last time my name was doing from the hip rather than the other the other one that I was drawn with so yeah there you go but at least Canterbury now has a voice at the lgonzi decision-making table and that 's a that 's a good thing I 'm going up there on the 5th of October for a strategic pairing day and I think that will be a good a good form actually and you 've just reminded me also because the CDM Joint Committee had this most amazing presentation on the potential impacts of an Alpine Fault rupture I mean it proposed nothing that I just said but it 's the previous item and my report a 30 percent chance of the securing in the next 50 years and that 's a salutary reminder of how we need to be prepared now I 'm arranging for the presentation to be made here at a council meeting so that it 's able to be live-streamed but you can go online and you can look at extraordinary I mean the thing is is that it 's we 're in this environment so we might as well know what could happen and it does depend where the rupture starts as to the nature of the waves and how they travel and the impact that they have but if you look at the video you can see you know that one 's starting down there that actually that the waves kind of spread out you know like it 's just it 's phenomenal so it 's it 's well worth looking at and I think you know that the whole of the South Island in the bottom half of the North Island is going to have to be really well prepared for what that will mean it 's interesting because we you look around non-guilty is this already relaxing I 've got one of months back up that aren 't tied down I 'm going to go home and sort that out now because you forget yeah yep in just a question up from the Mirror Mirror Forum report and in relation to the or the different aspects just noticed from that report there 's other like Department of Internal Affairs are also doing a review as well as ministry for the environment and it 's a whole lot of different parts I guess of government and so in local government and local government newzealand of course so I 'm just hoping that in fact for example it in ex forum we can pull all that together and terms of the national planning yeah look I mean the thing is is that we we actually you know have a government that has taken a particular approach around some of these things so I just you know I mean I wouldn 't rely on the Canterbury mural forum to be the be-all and end-all we get regular ports on the canterbury water management strategy and through our involvement and the zone committees we get regular reports now into the council so but we 're going to have to be very alert to this we had received staff advice on the department of internal affairs review and and i believe that 's where the technical advisory group comes in so of like we 're going to have to have a water champion around the table oh you 're putting a hand up good right just on it so i mean there 's a couple of things that come up on i 'm on one of the zone committee working groups this week that i think would be of particular interest to the councillors and now we 've pushed the reporting back to isn 't every two months yeah but I wondered if we hit a standing item if there 's nothing on it there 's nothing on it but if it was we could get the report yeah just just saying I don 't know you know I 'm just I 'm I 'm actually gonna give it some thought because I actually think that it a bit of a mind map around who 's doing what wouldn 't be a good thing so if you if you want to make a note of there and we 'll just follow that up but it might be through your committee Pauline that we 'd get that work done it could be University of Canterbury Ken and the City Council and some wonderful data that we got yesterday and it 's very very interesting yeah also reinforces the the success of the collaboration as well yeah anyway give us some pokey did you hear I 'm just I wonder if when we have the next quarter forum they tend to be sometimes avoid some of the major issues so could we perhaps actually get the information on the shallow boys around Christchurch that do not comply and that provide a threat to the reputation of Christchurch from weekend because they or Christchurch City there 's a great a Christchurch City there outside of Christ well I don 't know yet no no no no you know we that was raised last time and it was there was an attempt I think to narrow the focus and both Tom and I agreed that that was not the intention to narrow the focus you can 't talk about what 's happening in Christchurch without being aware of what 's happening in the wider region I 'm because I appreciate that Tom and you are some of the others yeah yeah no I 'm not sure if some of the others say that but make you know a bit bit bit that goes always look um is it necessary because air quality could be added to that next one the worst we 've got something organized underway and it 's in my report where I 'm sorry I 'm trying not to add things to the report that aren 't there so could we could we know it 's been moved and seconded so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so I 'll now move that we exclude the public know what what somebody saying what say what is it yeah I did I did everything else fees and there Rob Hall Steve Clark and Richard ball DCL remain after the public schools broad and blah blah blah blah as per the jinda awesome second bench by Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that it 's carried right to the media moment not hypothetically oh yeah you _"

    "text": "Carrie thank you and now we 'll move on to the mayor 's report yeah I 'm okay look I what I mean as you know in my report I must all of the events and meetings that I go to and I 'm always kind of shocked at the end of each month to see how many of those that there are but they 're all important for for a whole lot of different reasons I did highlight a couple of things which in some ways I would have gone to whether I was the mayor or not and one was the release of decline and fall on severed Street which is the fictional sequel to a villa at the edge of the Empire a hundred ways to read a select the city it was as Fiona Farrell 's absolutely fabulous post-earthquake book and I haven 't read decline and fall yet but I 'm going to and but you know whose style of writing and in the messages that are contained within it I just really do recommend this such good literature coming out of the earthquakes that it to people and the others the Lin lie exhibition you know Dion reminded me the other day that you know he was born and Manchester Street he was raised in Manchester Street on the corner of Peterborough Street and that little corner represents a part of his history and motivation as an artist he kept an old kerosene can that caught the light the flesh and his expression was we 're all stopped short by wonder sometimes and that 's when it first stopped me in its tracks I mean that story comes from you know Christchurch it 's a crusher story so I 'm just I 'm just saying you know I 'm you know not meaning to sort of focus on that over other issues but these just these things happening in our city that relate to our history and our future but you know yeah excellent excellent it 's the a few it 's the north east northeast corner yes the honorary citizenship that was something new that came from a consideration by the council I had the privilege really of presenting the honorary citizenship to talk about them and also to Consul General John on his departure from New Zealand as our second consul general but somebody who 's just been a tireless and enthusiastic advocate for Christchurch but at both ceremonies I talked about where my motivation for it came from and I haven 't spoken about it other than those occasions because I wasn 't_''_195.99 at the meeting we 're counselors past this but you know I went to New Orleans after the hurricane Katrina some years afterwards as part of my studying what happens and post disaster environments and I went to some bernard parish and they gave me honorary citizenship and it wasn 't a ceremony it wasn 't it didn 't come with anything but i felt incredibly connected and and and i felt that it was more than just tuning up it was about the connection that we had i was a member of parliament at the time that it happened and it 's it 's it 's about a connection made meaningful by shared experience which is what i said there that the response that I receive from you all he 's written quite a well it 's really you know it 's a page that Express what it feels like to be a citizen across across across our the history that that our paths cross it 's an amazing piece so and Consul General John was completely you know taken aback I just think that in terms of the connection that both of them represented was a really really good start so so thank you for that the Sumner center opening was just an absolute thrill and Sarah and Dion no not Dion Sarah and Yanni both really made that an incredibly special occasion and it was it was actually quite moving I met a woman who was working there at the time of the february earthquake in 2011 and it was the first time she was back she was there there is a volunteer making cups of tea and she was you know and I said to her I said you must feel incredible you know being back here now and she said that she always thought when she worked there that the library and the library and to come back and then see the museum there as well she was just completely you know I don 't know move by the whole occasion it was it was fantastic so again it was just an incredible occasion now I 've been asked to talk about the greater Christchurch public transport Joint Committee and I have got some details here so one of the things that people have asked me about as is that there as as that although the the Greater Christchurch public transport Joint Committee put out a no actually I would write down for you okay so the committee is responsible for the public transport network review and we 're also responsible for the draft regional public transport plan 2018 to 2021 the draft will be ready for public consultation early next year so that 's what we 're working on as a committee at the moment the we 've shifted the meetings so that the meetings are now bimonthly and we have workshops every month so one month it 'll be just a workshop and in the second month that 'll be a be discussing in terms of the public meetings at the moment but we have deputations you know we had the summer field residents turn up to talk about their desire for a bus service change in their area so you know these things are sort of thrown into the mix and and then we 've also had the western people one to talk about how they are concerned with the lack of buses that go through the West End area which is our area here and so I 'm just going to talk about that in a minute but I 'll just say a couple of other things the amendment to the Local Government Act and the land transport management Amendment Act that we have now got agreement from Parliament on didn 't pass the leap the wider legislative change didn 't pass before the election so it would have to be addressed post-election but we had cross-party support for to give became the power to devolve responsibility for public transport to a council at the moment the region doesn 't have the legal power to actually delegate it to the public transport operating model continues to exist no matter who does it so there 's a lot of work that we still have to do even if we get the law change and then transfers it to us we are still bound by the public transport operating model so there 's a lot of work to do now but the the last but is actually really good news which shows that he can have gone out as a result of discussions that we 've had in relation to the Joint Committee for an expression of interest for that war a request for tender on a shuttle for the central city hey which is which is very good and so as you 'll know a previous council with a Christchurch City Council before the earthquakes used to run one and and basically it was it was rate payer funded because it wasn 't part of the public transport system so in the excessive inaccessible city chapter it was expressed I think in a in a in an open way that said we 'd like to see a central city shuttle system and not just the responsibility of the ratepayers of Christchurch it should be able to be funded through the the joint model of funding through the public transport system and so that 's why we are out there in the market to see what the market has to offer yep thank you request for tenders have we specified or put a weighting on that being electric no we 've asked for expressions of interest I mean it for request for tender it 's not we haven 't gone out and said we want to have we want to hear people 's ideas I mean II can have done this off the back of the discussions that we 've had so it 's not a it will be coming back to they 'll be reporting to us and October as I understand it they 'll be reported to the council no joint public transport committee to this for the Aoi stage rather than the actual request for tender yeah yes no that apparently according to staff they 've they 've done it they 've gone beyond a nioi and had about the form of the sort of not said it has to be illiterate or you know let 's say ya know because we can 't we will come if for example the Joint Committee declines then we will have to consider it ourselves I don 't think so because we 'd have to vote for it we haven 't even started down the track of the wider public transport no but I think they they the committee knows that the strong feeling for electric but yes that is their translated into the actual documents pre procurement yeah well can we just check because I don 't take things on blind faith no no it 's not a question of blind faith there is no there 's no it 's a report back that 's coming it 's not a decision that 's been asked for at this stage but I 'll get more information but I thought it was public knowledge that it had gone out for well I 've certainly known about it but I hadn 't known that it was public knowledge well I thought it was put on a yes I know they have years but it 's not it 's not secret anyway sorry well they would have been at the meeting that we discussed it in public so it 's being discussed in public at the joint public transport committee but I don 't think it 's the most exciting item on their team for the media to be there Lehrer meeting so can I just raise a different issue that you raised Lynn and which goes back to your comment about the excellent literature coming out of Christchurch yeah and the amazing books that are written here I just wonder if there 's a possibility if we could use our incredible library system to somehow showcase local literature because there is a huge amount now being published on Amazon do publishing so there 's a lot of local authors trying to get some awareness that they 're writing they 're able to publish they 're able to buy off Amazon but getting into the libraries is not something that they know about whether they 're you know 10 or 80 or Fiona Farrell to have some means by which people know that our libraries provided the you know provided there are certain standard or don 't breach anything cut that there box could actually be in our libraries yeah thanks but just these were restaurant and crashed due to my Christchurch people pretty cool but is it so easy to do big really cool just have a roll in stock my home and the other thing that we looked at possibly doing was the some time ago and hasn 't happened yet and that 's probably my fault is as actually teaching particularly kids about anybody how they can actually publish and mark at their own book because it is now a whole different ball game than what it used to be and you can do it for next to no cost on Amazon amazingly the older will the printing and independently I don 't know yeah yeah absolutely awesome oh all right so it 's someone like to move that my report received Tim secretive T on any discussion put the motion Oh Glenn just the in Appendix B you describe that okay did you want to mention that I can do what what would you like well it looks quite interesting because it 's obviously a lot broader than sister cities South 's oh sorry you 're talking about yeah one that should be Appendix B that 's your pin deck see yeah that 's a it 's a it 's a region to region MoU with Nagano Prefecture yeah it 's um it 's it 's it 's a great and principle between the mirrors of the region it would be a first but the Secretariat has been directed to work with Christ she educated and the City Council staff to draft an MoU it 's not a sister city relationship that 's a it 's a it 's basically a cooperation agreement through memorandum of understanding I think that 's ideal did you like the comparison between the two if you take the two to once they were cement debate around the around the table as to whether hurinui should really have the wineries but the thing was was that the hot springs definitely set of the her so amazing when you look at the links seeing like hot springs winery terminal city of gateways that it might be better than too little don 't like they with terminal tramping ski resort compact city star watching which excited the mayor of tomorrow of course star watching forests and animals and nature natural energy I mean it 's just you 're really I don 't know that they 've done their homework in terms of what connects us as a region it 's obviously it 's hard to tell the distance from Tokyo the intersection of four tectonic plates but I guess that 's another kind of way yet with isolation opportunity intersection as well that okay yeah yeah fast train Bullock Shane reporting yep just on that if anyone keys to Google a documentary called strip to the city it 's on choice you can get it online it 's amazing they did one on Tokyo the other night and on its fault lines and what they 're doing to to give these city resilience absolutely fascinating my ones on the the water thing you say you 've got mmm oh yeah it states that came to brief rivers there 86% swimmable do we do we accept that or does the forum discuss it I don 't know and the other question I have is on page five or is everything from the Y tech each other yeah that 's why and point 34 the government has established a technical advisory group to advise officials on the practical impact of different options for the water allocation program and David Cagle has been appointed the Technical Advisory Group will report back to government at the end of 2017 is there going to be any oversight of that report before it goes back to the government perhaps that might be worth finding out because I think it 's quite an important issue for all of us and be quite good to have a look at what the recommendations are yeah that I mean yeah the the government is yeah I mean this is a government piece of work yes David Cagle has been appointed to a technical advisory group so I don 't_''_1146.84 I don 't know that he 'll be forum I doubt I doubted what because there be only be only one more meeting of the forum before the end of the year I think not sure but I 'm sure David 's very open to having that conversation so I just approached them directly and we could also raise it through the the next forum that we do with the in commissioners it would be good yes yep yeah Mike thank you apologies if you mentioned this before but I just like to congratulate you on your election to the National Council of the ogee and zedopp obviously it was a lot closer vote then your mural campaign and I 'm just glad I got the vote for us well I 'd like to thank you for for agreeing to support me I was a bit worried there for a minute but no it was just one of those one of those elections which is exactly what happened last time and I was about to say deja vu all over again and which was that it came to a draw and but this time unlike last time my the other one that I was drawn with so yeah there you go but at least Canterbury now has a voice at the lgonzi decision-making table and that 's a it 's a good thing I 'm going up there on the 5th of October for a strategic planning day and I think that will be a good a good form actually and you 've just reminded me also because the CDM Joint Committee had this most amazing presentation on the potential impacts of an Alpine Fault rupture I mean it propelled nothing that I just said but it 's the previous item and my report a 30% chance of the securing in the next 50 years and that 's a salutary reminder of how we need to be prepared now I 'm arranging for the presentation to be made here at a council meeting so that it 's able to be live-streamed but you can go online and you can look at the video so in the video as it 's actually extraordinary I mean the thing is is that it 's we 're in this environment so we depend where the rupture starts as to the nature of the waves and how they travel and the impact that they have but if you look at the video you can see you know that once starting down there that actually that the waves kind of spread out you know but it 's just it 's phenomenal so it 's it 's well worth looking at and I think you know that the whole of the South Island in the bottom half of the North Island is going to have to be really well prepared for what that will mean it 's interesting because we you look around non-guilty is us already relaxing I 've got one of months backup that aren 't tied down I 'm gonna go home and sort that out now because you forget yeah yep just a question up from the Mirror Mirror Forum report and in relation to that or the different aspects of water and we have our own forum and I just noticed from that report there 's other like Department of Internal Affairs are also doing a review as well as different parts I guess of government and so in local government and local government zealand of course so I 'm just hoping that in fact for example it in ex forum we can pull all that together and terms of the national planning yeah look I mean the thing is is that we we actually you know have a government that has taken a particular approach around some of these things so I just you know I mean I wouldn 't rely on the Canterbury mural forum to be the be-all and end-all we get regular ports on the canterbury water management strategy and through our involvement and the zone committees we get regular reports now into the council so but we 're going to have to be very alert to this we have received staff advise on the Department of Internal Affairs review and and I believe that 's where the technical advisory group comes in so yeah so they are connected but yeah it 's kind of like we 're going to have to have a water champion around the table oh you 're putting a hand up a couple of things that come up on I 'm on one of the zone committee working groups this week that I thought would be of particular interest to the councillors and now we 've pushed the reporting back to isn 't every two months yeah but I wondered if we hit a standing item and if there 's nothing on it there 's nothing on it but if it was we could get the report yeah just just saying I don 't know you know I 'm just I 'm I 'm actually gonna give that some thought because I actually think that it a bit of a mind map around who 's doing what would it be a good thing so if you if you want to make a note are there and we 'll just follow that up but it might be through your committee Pauline that we 'd get that work done it could be and this was this is a collaborative project between the University of Canterbury Ken and the City Council and some wonderful data that we got yesterday and it 's very very as well yeah anyway give us some pokey did you Heather I 'm just I wonder if when we have the next quarter forum they tend to be sometimes avoid some of the major issues so could we perhaps actually get the information on the shallow boys around Christchurch that do not comply and that provide a threat to the reputation of Christchurch from weekend because they breathe or Christchurch City as much toship City there outside of Christ well I don 't know yet no no no we that was raised last time and it was there was an attempt I think to narrow the focus and both Tom and I agreed that that was not the intention to narrow the focus you can 't talk about what 's happening in Christchurch without being aware of what 's happening in the wider region I 'm because I appreciate that Tom and you are on board with it but I 'm not sure about some of the others yeah yeah no I 'm not sure if some of the others say that but make you know that bet bet bet equality could be added to that next one the worst we 've got something organised under way and it 's in my report we 're sorry I 'm trying not to add things to the report that aren 't there so could we could we move no it 's been moved and seconded so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's

    "text": "what back to the chief executives report mindful of the fact that Mary is sitting in the chair replacing carbine today I would say be gentle to with here but just you know ask a really hard questions if you feel like it so over to you Mary I 'll let you introduce the report thank you tena koe jacket or canoe to call me to her Who am I to know da total he kept up with Q&A I 'm cured of Coto and just wanted to support the mares me he read the week of Duty or Maori um there 's some key things I will take the reporters read but some key things I want to highlight as the recent awards that cover the sea so the public information comms team there is world round emergency management communications customer services the three finalists and the local government customer service award and a world by a transport team and the public engineering Institute of public engineering also want to highlight the work that 's being done across my council which is really looking at that digital transformation of trying to look at for those quick transactions for people they can be done online quickly and very cheaply and that also then head and hand with that as saying that we also have people doing quality engagement in the community so it 's not or it 's about doing those things in tandem and also the work that 's being done across our cities program which is really looking at the future the digital future and the community with the services we deliver you 'll note that there 's no financials in this report and our first set of financials won 't actually be ready to September and then the rest of the report I think just highlights some of the progress that 's being made particularly across their capital and a suit work a lot of which has actually been porta through two committees into accounts already but it 's just highlighting some of those I don 't know if anyone 's got any questions um okay Vicki Yanni just one and it doesn 't need to be answered now but could we get a definite date for be in place I know that the parks have got so much on and I appreciate that there are some issues so I 'm fine with whenever it is but could we just have some certainty about it so those were just discussing there yesterday actually great so we will be able to come back with the oxidate thanks married Yanni given that the community boards have expressed a lot of concern over the flooding and the lens range I will just to give a kind of a very broad overview around what the next steps are in terms of coming up with some decisions so it might have bent over to Dave because it 's part of your team being able to give the next steps around the land drainage work no there 's a public meeting at the end of October 17 going through around both well principally around that middle Heathcote area and looking at those options which is what we are going to take out to the public I 'm not sure exactly what he and he wants in the way of progress on projects just group but it was a combined community board that he land drainage commute working group meeting all together in this chamber and we went through quite clearly what the options are in that meeting was about giving the land drainage team a steer on what those community boards thought would be the best way forward and the options presented and I think that from there we got a timeline we know that those options are going to be worked up in strengthened and brought to a tee and they will be a public meeting in October to engage with the community we have to actually reinforce how complex the Heath yes it 's a linear problem it 's not like flopped and where you could create floodplains and widen rivers it 's incredibly complex and so we 're just being progressed and I think we can 't rush this but it is happening Yanni and you were there may I ask for a really clear timeframe of when decisions would be made and I haven 't_''_284.68 I mean I haven 't had that but I think the key thing is mean I 've been told that I shouldn 't talk publicly about what the options are we 've heard people talk about some of the options this morning so I just think if we can put something that tells people when the decisions will be made about what 's happening because people are incredibly stressed out we 've just heard from the community boards and you know I 'm happy to talk about what we discussed and that px workshop if you want but I don 't feel that that 's my place I think it 's management and it 's really helpful that contribution thank you very much for it because what it does is it enables me because I wasn 't at that meeting it enables me to address an issue that was raised before and I did you know there are several options for addressing all of the flooding issues that were confronted with if it was just if it was one set of problems that we were confronted with it would be very easy but they 're not all the same each of the catchments is level of exposure that has been identified to optin was absolutely the number one priority and nothing has changed and in terms of the and in terms of the decisions we 've made and what has been implemented in that area that makes me think that we made the wrong decision I believe we made absolutely the right decision to prioritize Prop done that did involve some bias but it is also going to mean that we can sell it empty sections back into the market and they will be able to build at the higher floor levels so they will be in a completely different position then a then somebody who was living there before and wasn 't a rebuild who wasn 't able to lift the floor levels so um the Heathcott has in the past had floor levels lifted with support from the council but it hasn 't been the council paying for the entire process there was a sharing arrangement that was many many years ago long time before a long time before I was in Parliament I think bed alone on the council so you are complex and the Heathcott River is the most complex because there are multiple layers of actions that need to be taken one action that will make a difference in a low flooding event so but so will actually not be effective in a high flood event so you know and and because it 's not that simple and there is no magic wand there is no silver bullet it 's really important that we take people with us through it it is frustrating it is challenging it is difficult but actually as councillors we all have responsibilities to support our communities in these challenging times and not to create unreasonable demands on timelines and decision making we have to go out to the community and talk to them in a very open way about what the options are and what that might mean for them personally it 's not just the catchment that 's how individuals homes are affected and there is always going to make it very very difficult so even though I know that you are motivated by such a powerful desire to support community sometimes the than they need to feel we are working really hard to make sure that people in that area are able to get the security that they 're looking for but it isn 't going to be one answer there 'll be a multiple series of answers down the heath cut but we food we 've heard from the community board we 've heard from individual counselors there isn 't a counselor that represents an area that the Heathcott River touches on that hasn 't raised this every single one of you has raised this issue there is no question that it 's a priority is the next priority and that is what staff are working on but look I don 't want to you know I think it 's unfortunate to end up having this debated in this format we are going to have reports come to council we will be going out to the community they will know what we 're doing I can 't_''_575.48 say that there won 't be another flood between now and then that 's the trouble you know you know you can talk about on whatever number of years but the truth is is that we 're exposed to the same level of risk every single day I 'm sorry but the I did mention the complexities but it 's no good stuff going out and without all the information you so they they waiting to get everything lined up and they 've taken a steer from that workshop we had Yanni and that will be when they 'll be prepared to face the community with really good robust information and we 've got we 've got multi hazards we 've got climate change to throw in there as well but I do think that the hits that the message from this is that we do need to get you know sort of a newsletter out to people who live in the areas that are vulnerable to flooding telling them what we have done so far and what is happening next is yes and and in getting a works notice is not the same as getting a yes yep and they have been designed for the back purpose but anyway I got Phil I and I just want to make some comments because we are all I don 't want to get a whole lot of discussion around an issue that 's not really the subject there 's two paragraphs on land rental in it and this report I don 't want to sidetrack on to this issue so he 's gonna briefly say that we 've got the best staff I think probably in the country working on this flat out and and end date as Pauline is indicated and you have to that there 's some modeling work which they are still doing so that in fact we we get accuracy yeah around the options yeah thank you listen crib we had I 've been out to visit people with staff and it 's really crucial that we 're all on the same page but yeah there is a frustration out there and it 's not even frustrated to fear and I think someone point out when some families here the rain that really does affect their children at cetera so it 's so important I 've been explaining to people the and one part of the heath you can adversely affect another part it as an absolute bagger to try and get the whole thing right but we are moving forward I think that meeting on the our 17th 18th of October will be absolutely crucial to have those options and the information clear when we talk about options we 're not talking about what we came out earlier on with a whole heap of options yeah these are now the options that council have to make a decision on to move forward and Leanne 's quite right there 's not one silver bullet is going to be a number of things that are interconnected that it 's not going to solve the problem in a sense it 's going to to reduce the effects and it 's really what we 're talking about and I think we 've got to be very honest and clear about there yeah Dion I hate to well one question actually just on the flooding one though are we looking in when we get the report back the IFV and do V that people have money chucked out from EQC on people who have got increased flooding vulnerability it was also included and in the flock done situation in terms of the buyer is a standard yeah because I don 't know that these people some of them have have had considerable sums of money from EQC for the increased flooding vulnerability and I just don 't want us I got five hundred dollars so my solvents they 're 5 once the once they I mean I just said I 'm just thinking it 's not your on rate payors on it it 's taken into account good we do not pay people for what they 've already received just this rule so and to faucet this matter wasn 't actually covered in the report debates outs outside the content of this report if you want to discuss this we could get the right people to discuss it with you or get a memo to you yeah I don 't think it 's for now so yeah but I mean it was on top of my head and otherwise I 'd be happy but the was and then hold debate has lost my are you the building consents the new where was it there 's something news happened and there was it doesn 't actually say the new regulation that was what it was new regulation and we 've had to have him be here or something what was the new regulation it was that it was all major yes if anyone it 's a new mechanism for measuring the we 've got a briefing on it a few weeks ago on the the new measures for building consent Authority accreditation yes and how did it go hey that can you yes the other one was the intrusion onto South Plains plans so those two things came in and which required counsel to review its fee structure bility to recover fees for those two things that was the principle one that I 'm aware of yeah but there was a different we have had anions visit yeah well but it sees recent changes to regulations meant that staff from MB were also here as observers and that 's because the measures have changed the 19 anions inspection in the last time they visited they may have issued what was known then as corrective actions required and they called them a cap so you may have had three or four maybe five cars issued now at this time around we have had nineteen general areas of non-compliance and they are sort of some of them are caught their paper trail stuff but previously we might have had five cars and each of them each car underneath them may have had five six seven or eight things to address but under the new style of an MBI and ions inspection there 's no corrective actions they are all individually listed so of the 1998 one small particular area where it 's just the way we document things and there was just suggestions that we should put hyperlinks in for example to go from a reference from one area to another so of those 19 9 of them were related to issues such as putting a hyperlink in to be able to quickly cross-reference across a number of bits of paperwork so whilst 19 seems high it is split out of our cars we probably had somewhere 35 to 40 different things to deal with so I think it 's fair to say that when the irons team came in as the initial part of their report said how pleased they were with the the visit the cooperation of staff and the level of the high level to which this council has developed its building consenting process and and really what they have found us is relatively minor we are held up as one one of the probably the leading building inspection team in the country near which is a huge turnaround from the four or five years ago when we lost accreditation so we 've gone from zero over here oh and that they will still find a few little bits and pieces that need to be addressed and on our court very comfortable to hear that most of them are of that sort of put a hyperlink and to be able to cross-reference things yet so that was a very good question thank you Andrew thank you I 'm referring to page 8 of this reports the crown completing its first annual review of the Greater Christchurch regeneration Act obviously that work is now completed no change is recommended but then there 's the comments at the end of that paragraph about the restriction on council making any changes to its district plan this can apparently occur once the final appeal against the district plan is settled what would be the process for that has there been any commentary on that or is there any thought within this organization on how we would go about making that occur so and so I 'm not aware that can I get better signal right yep and in the chief executive curve answer so what we 've been talking to central government about is changing the legislation because the legislation gives effect to the length of time for the order and council to apply everyone is agreed that it was only really ever intended to cover the period for which the that the replacement district plan process was in place so once the replacement district plan processes in it Esmond then we have reassurance because this was done across again christchurch to have the ability to change its its district plan through normal RMA processes or through the regeneration export development we still have the power to change it through the regeneration the Greater Christchurch regeneration act but that is a different process from the RMA process and in some instances we prefer to use the RMA crisis yep another good question so just for clarification does that mean it won 't you see take the previous five years we could it could be decision it might the way the legislations drafted it still 2021 I think yeah June 20 21 before we can basically amend our own district plan through an RMA process we can only use the regeneration act process I I don 't believe that was ever the intention the intention was to tighten with the conclusion of the replacement district plan and the replacement district plan will be in place once the final appeal as exhausted yes yeah but the bit remember that the Greater Christchurch regeneration actors there also so that is another mechanism for changing the district plan David I just like to in the regulatory performance meeting earlier in the week where a suggestion was made when this is probably a suggestion to carry forward with Kelvin when a when advice is given of a standing committee meeting and we 're all on a number of different committees and we don 't often you know have time to go to them all but if there 's an item of interest yes like this we would so just a suggestion that came out of our meeting was that when advice of a meeting has put outside City Committee that the justy agenda items are published with that notice that the whole agenda is available on victim can 't_''_1311.929 yeah so that we can just see the items the items that are that 's a very good idea and so that we can then make a quick decision without having to download the whole agenda to see what it 's all about and make a quick decision or your item 5 already probably like to go along to that meeting and just check that out so we thought that would be a good initiative even think they can wait yeah for the jib executives anyway I 'm thinking that they can be actually up there any other questions comments around the chief executive support all occurred gone because of this report my personal view I have a feeling you know regarding the management the colonists see eat on the quadrature because why if you review this information page what a city council we 've received the emergence made him a public affairs EP EMP a new Zenith Awards second is also our customer service the T other one oh three finalists for the years the ultimate local government customer service center award sir the one is the I don 't think so every council you know you know maybe in a nationwide 76 of 78 we are 24 hours the service who saw our phone calls were email of social media say and also the here we try to you know to give the public community as as possible know they can assist another confidential information we try the for the house sales it is it 's kind of looks like before I didn you know become the kind of try to know although I say to take away or Mecca all the council as a new appearance new image this fan test before Poppi nine years so it 's very good so we should ask oven so should recognize the courage that occurring sir whether the leadership this is my view I don 't it 's quite cool on that night would you like to make the report yeah yeah is possible I don 't know I would like to you can move in Topeka go have a seconder in I 'll put that motion

    "text": "straight on to the next item which is the proposed speed limit changed to rebellious state drive which you 've already introduced again Mike Pauline happy to move in second um that what the one comment that I wanted to make about this is that when I read it I realized that this was a speed limit that existed when it was a private road but when it was assumed unto the crash each network have picked up the default speed and the city and to me that indicates an issue that we should learn from because it seems to me that that should be looked at at the time of bringing us into the network as actually is the default speed the right speed to apply or should we actually change the speed as we bring it unto the unto the city network so there because I doubt whether some of the problems that are there today would have been problems of the 30 K had stayed all the way through so how do we do that well I 'm just going to talk to Mary about that did 've assumed into the network it was just this you wasn 't it so just this year so we have a there was a private road 1993 yes so it was a little bit before my time I 'd only been an MP for three years at that point but didn 't even represent that area that way so yes so it was quite a long time ago and I don 't know whether you know that I mean how often it happens but I think I would like to record and maybe a separate tree is that sort of request staff and future when private roads are brought into the city network that a consideration is given to the operating speed at the time of the transfer so and and and that would just simply mean that they have to consider it it doesn 't mean that it 's a slam dunk to default or a slam dunk to retaining the speed that 's there but it 's it means that staff will turn their attention to the effect before the transfer is finalized thank you is that sound seconded there any discussion I just like to thank Matt as I mentioned earlier he 's working on two boards at the moment both Pendleton etc etc and ours and you know it 's it 's and we 've got a lot as I said sickness as well so I just want to say thank you to to me for that thanking me so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "thanking the staff Pappa Nui Ana 's Community Board welcome Ali Maria one we haven 't got a presentation this week we have been some illness at our community boards and it 's been a little busy so my apologies for that just hitting oh we 've got one party actually which relates to a speed limit change in literally a state drive now originally this was a private road and the speed limit through there was 50 kilometres an hour residents had said that this was causing some issues because of the kind of environment that it 's always been always been there excuse me and so the proposal to put some traffic coming and there was put out and the consultation included 234 leaflets delivered to properties along revelry estate Drive and the immediately immediate surrounding streets including 34 absentee landowners the left that 's were also posted an email to 187 key stakeholders and it was on the council 's have you 'll say well page 35 submissions were received back 28 were generally supportive and nine weren 't supportive so there has been that 's what reduce that speed limit to or revoke the 50 kilometres and put a 30 kilometer an hour speed limit in that area other parts of the report today we have had quite a lot of community conversation through social media on a number of issues in the ward one being the traffic speeds and how it 's affecting sent Albans primary particularly and surely a primary we 're working with a number of schools proactively clearing papadelis Street as well as the changes to our ward as far as traffic flow and congestion continues and one of the issues we 're finding which we have put in our long term plan or considerations at this stage increase and funding so that we are able to deal with these issues around these schools because it happen for free and I have to say staff have been very proactive and looking at ways to do this and the most cost-effectively and safest way one of the issues that might just bring home to you how serious this is particularly in Trafalgar Street is where the new bicycle lane or the cycle lane with one of the swing out lollipops and a teacher standing on that same middle median strip with them so that they can push them out of the way quickly should a vehicle head towards them and that is unacceptable actually there may be someone who can help here I 've suggested some sort of remote control system for that middle lollipop there are three lollipops one on the outside two on the outside rather one on the central center median now if you use it like a garage remote control in some way to use that middle lollipop to go out by itself that would mean that that can be operated by a teacher or another student and it doesn 't have to be a child standing there so if anyone 's got a garage with a workshop and knows how to do these things it would be really interesting project to try and get some sort of automated system in there the Suburbans pavilion and park upgrade look will make no well we do make apologies for this to be honest it has taken far too long this pretty much in the earthquake and needs rebuilding there has been engagement with key sports groups and that has continued well and we now have a draft plan for the new pavilion build the entire tooth needs replacing because of drainage problems that have been there since the park was really established it is going to take around two years to actually grow that grass again and it 's a long time but which is why this is even more of an issue because it 's taken this long to get sorted but we 're underway now and in fact we are putting out some positive media and photo to the local media to give them the timelines because people in the area are wondering what is going on and there is really about it oh no we did have a and the six mill working party the sticks river rather catchment working party is going very well there was a meeting last night it that scares me it 's a joint issue and it was cheered last night by Councillor East Emma Norris from our community board went along elected chair on that I think and they will possibly be a co-chair long vision for a coach here at the moment your two members that have attended have been happy for me to chair but if you attend Delhi or more than a village I hear you 're doing a marvelous job David so that 's fantastic thank you and thanks to staff too for pulling that together because it 's a major issue for people out there and it 's a real concern I think that is about it actually some great stuff coming through from the youth in our Ward and I have to say you know this is one of the issues that 's concerned us with the reduction in funding as you know when you 've got young people coming through that are representing New Zealand at a very high level in sports are now four or five hundred dollars from the community waters helping make that happen it 's that 's why we do what we do that 's one of the main satisfactions so we don 't want to see that curtailed in revocation of moving paddy and then the sense that every time a community ball comes to us and they they talk about an area where there has been you know sort of challenging issues to deal with the collaborative partnership approach seems to make all the difference in the world it 's working around the schools as well you know to be able to get Police Council 's safety officers council parking compliance community board community governance all round a table with principals teachers and some parents we work out what the problems are look at how to fix those problems fix the problems meet again to see how it 's working and and I have to say it 's surely intermediate it 's that 's around central government level we call that regulatory impact analysis and normally where it falls down as they don 't define the problem at the beginning that sounds like you 've got that nailed hmm Paul a Mike did you want to move seeking this yep one of the Angus William the basketball player piece as he was 16 he might even be 15 in he is so tall no but so driven and focused and you know that levels sometimes I think really you know what we 're doing is really helping to make the difference but it 's quite clear when he comes and he says thank you for the 350 400 500 dollars it is making a difference and that 's amazing yeah this voice representing New Zealand yeah yeah and to come in feedback to the boards is really important not just for us but for them and they come back with PowerPoint presentations and all these incredibly character building experiences they 've had on their trips overseas and it 's it 's just their parents come with them as well and you can sort of see them in the back you know and it 's it 's lovely to see the family there supporting him to all the children the young people that come along so we 've been posting sending those into the news line and the end the newsletter so that 's one thing that we 're feeding in and hoping that they 're making it I so there any other questions we 'll move on to your part a after we 've done the report but there 's no question so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and you wanted to stay there _"

    "text": "um okay if I move back now to the about eight the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee so I 'll move those and I 've got an amendment to and so do you mean if I 'm sorry I can run it down but it 's basically that the council requests staff to meet with members of hands off Hagley and other interested parties with a view to form a guardians of hagley park to assist meeting the objectives of the Hagley Park management team at end report to infrastructure transport Environment Committee thank you is there a seconder for they don 't falling ok so yep you can speak whatever you like per day item one lieutenant I I think this I 'm sure there 'll be strong support for the setting up of the trust which is clear a funding trusting for headley for the botanic gardens and it just seems to me that it 's also opportunity to ensure that we consider the wider sitting in context for the gardens by way of the whole park and so I think it we should work with people who have with other other council groups so so that in fact we can make sure that the Parkers held in good care and we work proactively with other groups so there is a reason for my amendment those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and then i 'll put the amended recommendation which has also been moved and seconded still okay to move and second it right I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried item number two and part b which is moved by phil and seconded by 10 can I ask a question please yeah just honor under 5 just a question if I could have response over the pages road bridge a status update we were at with it which okay okay on this one as well just um under six did you receive any information at the committee around their concern that businesses are having with huge amounts of road cones that have been put out and the need of impacts is having quite adverse impacts on local businesses it 's just an issue that um you know certainly where we 're seeing huge amounts of road cones having a you know huge salsa and a huge impact on local suburban centers and it seems like something I just want to be assured that someone is actually thinking about it and looking into it is so look to answer your Christian counselor Henson certainly that was part of the report and so there will be an attempt would be an attachment to our original report in relation to their although it was it was a vehicle was a verbal update but clearly see top that is one of the main remain concerns and held that is managed and the whole purpose is to I guess utilize the cones as part of a as part of that management so yep I guess with that with the scale and the amount of work being done particularly in a city that is concerned and something I understood that see tock are continuing to address the turmoil or any of the other names the committee might water weight today or any other staff also make clear giving information back how important it is into say Easter or Christmas or whatever or holiday anytime of holiday that the roadworks are planned around those so that there 's as little impact as possible and to those small urban shopping centers the only party has been taken up by the construction vehicles so the like the dearie on the corner of Haven side and gloucester street just has almost no parking and it seems really bizarre that the construction vehicles which could park a little bit further away and are they are some parking but also just ahead of question on that bridge can we get a status update on that bridge as well I understand it 's probably behind schedule but can stuff just do an update on that darlington bridge ok hiss bridge no no that 's at just that one I just went met with the business owners yesterday no affected by it mine 's just around item seven which is the central city parking plan it would be very useful I races of the briefing on Monday with regard to this here is the capacity for parking on the individual streets so that there are you know emerging plans of you know potential car parks and other streets and it 'll be just good to identify what the quantum of parks that can be handled by each Street and those various areas and also on top of that when these parking facility become available we need to consider quite carefully the ongoing use of beer land offering maybe cheap parking and putting it you know at risk these developers who actually are putting parking in you know the loss of revenue for them so we 're going to consider that actually going for can I just comment be a fair next infrastructure transport Environment Committee they 'll be a report on this theory item coming to a committee ball thank you thank you for leaving me have another question yeah sorry okay wait until next time no in the past we 've had in the previous to him and I think it was quite useful scoop reports on a break down on a ward by Ward basis by works and budget the actual works that have been undertaken across the city and that something we could look at and your wii and i felt they were good reports and so we knew that spend in each ward what was happening where is hit right yeah i think we just didn 't make sure not overlapping with the information community boards will receive but what we look at that we 'll we 'll make sure they 're not there 's no double up of course they should be not on the same detail not compared to that asked to okay yep yep yep okay and that the report is a whole be adopted those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the record _"

climate change and I do feel for people who look down in the heath state River area and I just wonder why the district plan is a layout 15 houses per hectare and the Hendersons basin here we go on their bill good lead off the duck okay just done great pleasure that 's fish slide you 've had slide show you 've heard from our community board and and that 's a very very very very happy bunch of board members okay moving on we only have the one per day and that 's to do with their more daily business pack so we 'll come to bet and through the through our presentation air community board decisions under delegations just highlight the the first one which is coming up as soon as some area presses the button is the villamaria college con brio choir and they got the silver award i bought a very very pleased that we can help those young people i 've got a conflict of interest monetary daughters went to villa but anyway they didn 't have the choir or that those activities at that time whether you will be good to support young people and that we 've also run if we go to the next slide and you can see there where our third priorities were the one on there on the left that you can see is is youth so that their priorities the next highest one is children and the the one on the right the highest pig on the right is community development and residents association support all that stuff so we 're very very community fact conscious in the the those are the organizations that we funded over the years 52 organizations over the year and with that level of funding so long may it continue this year this year yep so moving on then to the Waterloo Business Park I just invite people to actually go out there and have a look at the Waterloo Business Park up on yellow block up there is quite a large area that 's been taken up by CWF Hamilton 's are going to be relocating from their Enix Road site to to let and it 's one of Canterbury some oh yeah it 's a world-famous company in so there 's some real significant things happening near later on and the mayor report this there 's a request for the installation of the nighttime parking restrictions and day in the industrial area and the hosel Junction Road extension project which were really really keen on on happening and we know that there 's money in the budget snare plus the grant of the million dollars from the from the Waterloo business back towards that project and just like to virtually just waiting for the lights to be turned on on the pan Waterloo Road realignment so that 's that 's something that we 've been looking forward to for quite some time that was a community board lead project and it 's going to make a big difference I think to the traffic movement sitting around that area taken a long time 's just a matter of waiting for the lights to be tuned on there so there is going to be historic precinct in the Waterloo Business Park as well so packet part of the old buildings too real old brick buildings in there it is are going to be retained for for community use and the the Waterloo building was part want it to be a place for people to be active not only in workers but outside of work else with the green space and Parks that they 've got available so yeah moving on then Gary now putting away the more the milestones planting a 350 native trees well and there 's more to be planted and it was very pleased to be able to attend the the blessing gathering on the 9th of August then the for that work to get underway that 's a it 's a there 's a lot happening there 's not only the development of the of the sports hubs and playing fields but also the the spill water retention and detention systems and all right a lot of work happening in comes on board and there 's a lot more pissed trees to be implanting to be removed and replaced with native planting as well so an all spoke gun earlier in the meeting about the the tree policy working party that we 've that we need for moving on sorry Gary do we want to just keep jumping to these and then I can just wrap up later and some of those other bits of noises the adverse them Memorial Hill suffered quite a bit of damage post earthquake live during the earthquakes and there was there was a resolution passed that we actually get perceived with the demolition of that but anyway what we 're doing now is reconsidering that and we 're going to have a joint working party in seminar with the holes will fennel turn one re here wood was going to be on the 18th of September but it 's been done put put back two weeks so and we 're going to talk to the community again about what community partnerships we could have what you know what the options are so when we got to be a bit sensitive about it so that 's where we just want to be sensitive about is it retained or not we 'll then how does the memorial factors going to be accommodated because the land was gifted by the coil family to the paper are accounts a bit baked in the dike so that 's that 's a work in progress and then the Metro American bus lanes and Division Street the issue so with him we we 've had feedback at our last board meeting from the working party on this them on these issues surrounding the wicket and Road and the the bus lanes so that 's a work in progress as well so there will be some more recommendation it 's coming to the council from there resolutions of the of the working party to our board and they 'll be passed on their next opportunity I didn 't put the slideshow together I 'm sorry but it was one of the things that was looked at that the future options that does say future options and it still rightly or wrongly and didn 't see that until I got here this morning sorry yeah so they 're the so it 's still a work in progress and there will be more recommendations coming to the council on that one okay and then then the community board plane it 's been a long time coming and it 's completed now so we will that 's something that is going to guide us for the next two years plus unless them in this term of our community board and into the future I just like to thank Carlo and the staff for for putting this together and it 's going to be yeah all community boards have got their planes done now so I 'm just pleased to say that we 've got is done very very pleased with it so that 's their that 's their guiding document into the future and moving on then to the holes will quarry buildings repair the old stone houses mentioned there oh it just I was just saying to our community governments manage of the old stone house is not to be confused with the old Kashmir Bradon so this one the house that we referred to here is the the managers residence house but we had a um a site visit wouldn 't on a bus trip and went and had a look at the work that 's being done there and the quality of the repairs and the in the restoration of those buildings is absolutely incredible so it 's going to be all it is a very very important part of our ward historically a lot of Christchurch a lot of Christchurch came from that horrible quarry a lot of Christchurch so it 's s done that 's the gardening 's plan for the the fourth of October so just like to offer the opportunity to as many councils within interested parties to come to that but I do understand there might be a conflict for something else that 's happening at Council on that date which is a bit disappointing sorry invitations can come to everybody yes yeah yep both of October it 's developed into very I can remember back in the day Wyndham when the council decided to declare equality of explosives than their counselor right was Ron right with the ax back in the day and I can remember quite clearly that he said that this is going to be a real asset to the Christchurch in its it nears that 's developed really really well over the years so we 're very grateful it still is in public ownership then valuable piece of history 1018 I am from recall before if I just wonder like it does seem kind of you know it 's a major facility I know it 's a community safe it 's also a metropolitan one it would be good to try and find a time where it didn 't clash I read it sorry we did the the the date okay now moving on then to the HR which is a hyper helpful random facts so that 's seven so it 's really interesting and we 're gonna we 're going to be giving you more effects in the if we might become to do their on our board reports of the council so nearly 30 percent of the city 's workforce work local government eight you should be bringing alternative face as well just enjoy just enjoy carry on carry on you know like Southwest across just ran home being a it has been a variable working-class area you know for a long time and at least that 's moving into the future is showing that that 27 percent the workforce in our area and when you have a look at the big development that 's happening like the the Hornby quadrant that called the Stuart development boy what isn 't in Chains Road massive massive barrier in there as well as the Waterloo Business Park as well as the growth around halls will residential growth in a new commercial growth so it is some it is a rapidly growing area and and were and will be it will be sustained for quite some period of time and nearly 13% of us of the workforce so these work forces and the Rickett and warden so they come and do it out of Rickett and every day with their sleeves rolled up 30 percent of the people in Christchurch exactly and the other issues we want to cover I think really at the pad a recommendations that also mention the South won 't be scored proposed called speed zones I 'm just really really pleased with it that we 've been able to progress at through and so their home south on be schools relocating to the brenston and immediate site so without further ado I 'll take it up another corner quite happy to answer any questions you 've gotta they 're a very wonderful PowerPoint presentation thank you 've got to your end of your time but you 'd like to wonderful presentations thank you for star in the chips only the regarding to Yoda item 10 the Natuna watch this 5.0 1.03 pop either the hand of the opening take maybe a minor mistake in here is opening in March 2017 the whole Radhika may be 2018 that is probably correct well actually this one if you know absolutely if I must be vigilant brother I didn 't push the wrong button on the computer it 's Sikandar but McKean a plucky one thing that you didn 't tell that that was the board 's approval of the revised design of the represent community center which I know will come to the next meeting knew that but instead of doing the future proofing by way of creating capacity to build on and future what the board 's done as think very creatively and build from the start a two-story building instead of a single story building so it gets 30% more space to and from from day one and that was the proved by the board at last meeting and a really good process thank you excellent thank you sir Bates Ben did that alter the person okay excellent we like to hear that huh right so it 's been moved and seconded I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried _"

    "text": "I still fear word to come forward welcome good morning Lian and counselors and staff in community it 's really great to be here thank you just wait for my amazing Queenie board governance advisor Joe Wells to help me out here you may be great so we had no Perez for a 7th of August and 21st of August meetings but under the community board decisions and the delegation I 'd just like to highlight a couple of things are there new Preston subdivision we approved two new or five new bus stops so that 's really exciting and they 're already installed and the bus service 154 farms dispensable has started a week ago and the patronage has already increased that it 's really exciting for that area there next we have the daily thing they would also approve the landscaping and constant plans for a fitness trail at the Burwood park south which is really exciting because this was an initiative by the Darlington community cottage trust and they 've gone and with a partnership with Council the Darlington Cottage Community College trust contributed forty five thousand there that we can get very carried away on shortly once they are installed so that 's really exciting because you can see up on the plan there where the fitness equipment is going to go but it 's also sits between a half bus that were caught in a borough Tennis Club so that 's really very exciting for that community here so well done to them for that the other thing the board approved was the concept landscape plans and the footbridge removal and powerful lineman for the Horseshoe Lake Reserve a few months ago the community board just asked the staff if they wouldn 't mind going back out to the community just to make sure that things were clear about the possibility of removing the bridge or keeping the bridge so that went out very grateful for that and the community have come back and said they were okay with the removal of that we footbridge and in a realignment of the path diverting around a wee bit further and also we request an accessibility audit on that just to make sure things are aligned up wooden bridge sorry I don 't have a picture of it but it 's a I was acutely bridge but we 're very aware of those little unique assets and community so we wanted to make sure that community were okay with that being removed and something else put in this place so they 're going to have some stepping stones across where the bridge actually was but they 're realigning the path slightly closer to the road so if we really appreciate stuff going out and doing their projects and initiatives so this is really exciting for area we keep bringing it up because we are very grateful that this is actually happening in our area so we 've got diggers and we 've got fences up now and we 've got everything on site so it 's all go pipes everything I mean you go down there and it just looks like a bit of a war zone but we 're used to that and there 's peanut cones again but it 's for a very exciting reason so the project team of the era charging away and which has been they have delivered a six and a half thousand people it 's just a booklet that covers things like the vision and the just the regeneration outcomes and some other proposals and that that are going around so we 've got one for all of you but we haven 't handed it round on purpose actually just in case you readin don 't listen to me so a really nice way to actually inform the community via also the hot pools initial design and concept consultation has started getting the community involved at this early stage is really really great also some other little small community initiatives are starting through details creating momentum regeneration funds and there 's we haven 't got pepto so that next time we 'll bring them and just things like the community are getting into the initiative of outside their shops putting on planter boxes and standard trees and it really has just revitalize them visually some of the areas and you so fantastically community just coming up with their ideas and having some resources to do so QUT recreational sports centre we 've got our hard hats on their orange vests then we had a bit of a tour around it this week and it 's absolutely fantastic so that is on schedule to be opening about May next year so that 's very exciting and also the South you Brighton boardwalk update we might take yep there it is as we speak that is what it 's looking like right now so this is going to be finished in a week or two but look at that that 's what you 've contributed to as council and this community absolutely excited about it the contractors I don 't know how they 've actually finished up as they 're doing so quickly because they have so many people in the community coming up to them and telling them how wonderful it looks and how amazing they are I don 't know how many scones I 've had and cups of tea though if it brought to them but they 've still got the job done and it looks amazing so well done to everybody for their be on the same side Shore floodplain management short term options report link back to us as a community board and we really appreciate the opportunity to be able to comment on that so thank you very much for that and our recommendation on behalf of the community will be coming back to the council meeting on the 28th of September and finally we 've got some open coming events so we just wanted to sort of showcase this popular that 's actually something for all of us it 's the breeze walking festival booklet that staff and the community have put together and there 's just some amazing I 'm not sure but I could be wrong with it 's about 50 walking events happening around and in a city which is fantastic and one of them as you can see up there is The Gruffalo explorer for the little ones little ones and it 's in the bottle lake on the 4th of October and then another one I 'll highlight in that area is meet in the middle which is the celebrating celebrating the opening of the tiara otic arrow which is to the sea so you know well done to everybody for putting it together but all that information better works in your own area over in this booklet and we have Godwits which i think is a really special thing to emphasize for our city and apparently the news is that we have 348 have arrived in well by the time they travel a thousand miles probably anyway so they 're actually on tolls with reserve brookhaven at the moment but we 've got about another 1,700 expected so they must be having a little bit of a rest there before they just pop over to the South Shore split Reserve and they 've come all the way from Alaska cuz it 's amazing and hence this is why the South Brighton community have lobbied for that god.what statue at the South Brighton bridge which will be installed later this year and finally we just have a slider in just to tell you that this is the Aven River beautiful picture and beer weather so thank you thank you look I just like to reinforce Kim 's comments around QE Monday and you know when you look at the plans of a facility you sort of visually conceptualize what you think this may look like and the space that might be there but standing inside the building you get a totally different perspective and so standing in the for example in the pool area of this complex it 's absolutely huge and I got the perspective really that the children 's play area where there 's going to be some whip fountains and things coming up a lazy river and Hajus slide comes in that area alone in this new complex I believe is bigger than the whole of the Graham Condon completes itself and when then you 've got you know massive 25 meter learn to swim pool a teen Lane 25 meter pool or hydrotherapy pool and and sparkles all all further down in the complex that is quite quite significant and the recreation facility the spin rooms and exercise things on the other side equally very spacious and my limited IT and Facebook capacity I put a few pictures up on Facebook and they attracted something like so I think there is huge interest in what 's happening with this facility on an air ward and and I do want to express my gratitude to all that were involved in planning and particularly Apollo projects at the moment and the construction of it it is going to be outstanding I 'd like to move the adoption of the report yeah love to second and I took it yes David said probably qe2 will be a major stake in the ground for recovery in the East it 's the number-one marker I think for many people just the goblets arrived two weeks early than many other years so the eastery Trust is a very fascinated over there what does does that say something we don 't know so um I 'm a change week who knows but it 's the first year the goblets of leafed is under a prism I 'll tell the trustee good call River carnival as well so it 's gonna be quite an event even done a great job and yeah

    "text": "oh thank you and the next one on the agenda is its freedom Kashmir Carolyn oh and we 've got Melanie as well morning purohit oh it 's a good thing Mel here today in case I go off on a coughing fit I feel like I will just before we start I just wanted to mention heading to Nate Eddington it was one of the Metro organizations that lost the most funding and our bird all our board except one person went to the annual general meeting the other night and they 've got very smart leadership team and we are hoping that we can help them resolve some of the funding issues created by the drop in funding from the council and we are hoping that we 'll be able to be more optimistic about their future than they were for a day or two after their the funding was announced yep in yesterday Carolyn and I meet with this about a different thing but related to our long-term plan so we meet with some holes all residents from the hosel residents Association and it was around the term plan for quite a while and this sort of being delayed in our borders continuously opposed spending any money on that part between kerlix and rights and will continue to do so but what they talked to us about was how they 're concerned about how involve all that it 's growing or will grow they see by the size of gas burns or 30,000 people and how to get all those people into town or you know numbers of people down Lincoln Road then they were not necessarily supportive or laning because they say that they are not writing transport engineers they are all swill residents so both MIT but but they 're also looking towards the future so they 're not necessarily in support of it as far as I could tell they just want transport solutions that will work for them while we 're talking buses we were talking trams we were talking the future so it 's just something that we are wanting to put on your radar and that also that they are planning to go to the halls we horrible Hornby record and for our boards to actually work together to discuss this because we have to obviously advocate for the residents of Addington and that will always be our priority but I 'm just giving your heads up and finally before we start the pictures on Friday I 'm going to we sprayed in school we 're there they 've got a formal opening of the gear give give give gear geek right which is a program that we 've introduced about trying to get sports gear out of people 's are moored robes and into the kids hands because the cost of children going to sports activities is enormous the membership of tennis clubs for young people for instance as two hundred and forty dollars a year this is just kind of cost that people can 't afford swimming lessons or 148 a term that kind of thing so we 're trying to introduce this gear swap so that we can get the new gear old gear gear that 's still good and shoes sports shoes out of people 's wardrobes and into other people 's hands and so we 're going along and doing the opening I 'm hoping to dress Apple look like an idiot because of the kids see someone with my hair color coming don 't think that i 'm inaudi is coming to see them they wouldn 't be true alright and so starting on our pictures there we go it 's not a great picture but this is paper plus Barrington who have been so proactive in supporting our they also got 10% off for old people they they 've been so proactive in supporting and the community board and being really positive about interacting with us just for example they gave prizes for our awards community awards ceremony they gave us prizes but they gave us an extra prize which was Jake 's autobiography about his experience of surviving cancer can anybody remember Jake sooner Oh Bailey that 's their bogus Jake 's Jake 's memoir of surviving cancer for our use of Lord as well as an additional prize and here 's their window that 's not clear I know but it 's for neighborhood week and it 's got good traffic and a fun window and I just wanted to say local community initiative mr. platens believe we 've been consulting with them and you can see the kind of thing we want to put out the police have found intervening on Vista place almost impossible they haven 't got their cars to be sitting up there all day and all night they can 't get up there quick enough to catch anybody doing anything so there we are we held a meeting with residents as I think I told you and now they 're proposing on the sign which sees no stopping from 00 p.m. to 00 a.m. except for owners occupiers and their bonafide visitors and that 's closed now so we 're waiting to see the result of that and you can see over the page where it 's all at now peppy Road and air fond Terrace this is one of those places with Lou 's where where Alou is needed and it 's really hard for staff to put up lose and hit watch them being vandalized and then putting them up again and then watching them narrow street with very high parking demand it 's taken a long time this because there 's a full layout with other streets if you put in solid parking no parking on rabokki then you 've got to think about Vernon Terrace and then you 've got to think about the next and so on and it 's taken a long time to get where we are on this issue but the reason why I was thinking about this was the other thing you see on rocky road is carefully picked up dog poo in plastic bags delicately placed on this road before they get into their cars and the next one is the summit me I 'm on to the summit road as well the summit wrote consultations been out the figures are very high on the response lots of people for you learn ownership of the Summit Road and would like still to have access 7 7 and helps it so and for various reasons and so the outcome of this will be interesting and and won 't resolve all of the issues at hand but as the kind of civility on the length breadth of the Summit Road so up here is a picture basically links to the South Library where there be keen observer center as as the old pump station in the distribute which is circled and read and there 's also the distribution center to the left of it and their photo so the old pump station sites that we 've put this in our long-term plan as well so that that pump site we haven 't really been thinking a lot about it but we had some residents from the community come along and suggest to us that maybe we could use that size or they could use that site as a community space just for a farmers market as well as lots of other things that we could do there 's a there 's a bike so a BMX trick just to the right of the circle Lea which was there at the moment and of course at that whole site runs Mike our library does runs right next to the Heathkit River which of course is the problems of flooding plus when we asked could we use the distribution center site for potentially for a farmers market the first response back we had was well no we can 't because of the mid heath get linear plan but but now we 've been told that actually it 's not inconsistent with it so that 's something that we our board is very keen to pursue to have the space as a community space and also to be looking at the distribution center and how we could make the most uses I suppose for the community and also I guess thinking ahead as well to win there are peers of the South Library happen to so so that 's why we 've put that in there long term plan as one of our top priorities were for you to consider ah and here 's a second picture of the that 's the bit severe from the the road you know that goes along by the library this is Barrington mall entrance this is the bane of our lives in many respects and was the top priority in our long term plan and 's very complicated and it 's hard to figure the pedestrian crossing to the sprayed and library which is just there in the upper left-hand corner and as well as providing excess grease from the Barrington mall car park and access for pedestrians along that footpath and people with disability it 's it 's not as easy as it looks but we are looking to can the right-hand turn out of Barrington mall and we 're hoping to get it done this year we 've got a great traffic engineer that 's what I forgot to mention on the get gear thing a map AV is our staff member who is relentless in pursuing some of the projects that we 've got and I just wanted to mention her name with regards to the get gear again great yeah I never get it right um that I that that project mfab is leading on on this project John Doris our traffic engineer and he 's doing he 's has done a great job and catching us up on our traffic engineering and I 'm sure he 'll do great on libraries right there because we 've recently had the will toe of the librarians I 've seen from this road marker going to community meetings if you got people coming to come to different things like seeds some various things but I asked them about you know do you look over there when people cross that that crossing there and he said that they the office look straight down over and it 's really scary to sit there and to watch people nearly get hit every day so that was some nice indications I suppose from council staff so some urges obviously of the flooding around the power heathcote River we you know we hit him there was a workshop or with a with a public way back in May and it was really Grange took sort of explained how the people are being flooded multiple times along that stretch sort of we 're the council was there at that point and then of course we had the workshop when he will the one in here recently we 're the drainage staff and Peter Christensen and Keith Davidson is not flooding that 's happened most recently and we had 17 people that were flooded over there floor level who had obviously felt like they 're being forgotten compared to flocked and basin and the people out and South Shore area so we were really really happy with I mean everyone always is when they do their presentations are always and creative all this put their information together so succinctly and so clearly so we 're really pleased to hear that there 's the idea of pictures in theory of those properties and then the plans for the dredging and obviously the the retention basins as well along aside this though as just restin over the weekend is been because there 's other areas that are flooded not over the floor but in hone hay which was close to where I live and my Garret does give flood of each time but then there 's Marion place in Copenhagen Marion Street and Copenhagen place that regularly get flooded very very badly and there was also where place which is quite close to the Heathcott River between hunt a road and the hear their voices who has put it that way so they 've had a meeting with the local MP over the week and we 're gonna hear more from them so it will be something to be thinking about because I didn 't mention about it previously and they haven 't come to our board as such yet but um I 'm not sure what 's going to happen next but there 's something that we need to think about because they do get flooded every single time there 's a heavy rain and even on my street we don 't get a bit of flooding but every time so um there 's other areas they 're sort of adjacent in between you know the Hendersons area and the Heathcott rover that don 't get regularly flooded toget so that 's what is the space such as bats yeah thank you I 've felt thank you Karen Melanie is a very full report and I think some of those issues are big ones and I just want to refer to for example to Lincoln Road which you referred to and that issue is important because the challenge that we have as council of course is that the public the bus part the public transport part which you know is a metropolitan planning meta as well through the joint public transport committee we have to make sure that we get that right i think the properties of parallel the challenges have record and road actually so I 'm putting on please that both the the both forwards are having discussions around there too that 's important like the only other thing I wanted to mention is to underline the reference that Carolyn made two Addington it I was also at the meeting as Carolyn indicated and you know that little organization which became metropolitan in fact has 28 volunteers working with them so that 's a sign that you know there are a lot of great organizations that we need to make sure we continue to support and I 'm happy to move that Tim you think you 're just also it 's an interesting thing that with Rebecca trade that and it comes to you I guess I 'm self but if wherever you go with it for our Peggy hunts debris wherever you go just maybe just think a wee bit about where your pal because it does seem ridiculous that you travel across town to try get a car park as close as you can to the place where you 're going to walk for five or six miles well if you actually thought about the community you 're entering you know just pack a bit further away I mean it 's just it 's ironic but you know its life and I just also rewrite it about the flooding that is the number one thing for us at the moment it is absolutely heartbreaking for those families and we are going to seeing them at Sutra yeah and thanks to the staff who are working on listening to the rain on the roof must terrify a whole bunch of people there was something yeah sorry thank you for the work that you 're doing with the sports gear I think there 's fantastic that you are you recognized that that 's a barrier for young people and address it so thank you for for that work thank you sorry about here but this that there might be depending on what happened sir studies so much on climate change yeah yeah yeah it 's nothing you need it maybe we would appreciate that because we think that a considered discussion with our community outside of the emergencies that we have would be great I mean I think you know that the hardest thing in this area is that fears there was such a mess of affect after the earthquakes there areas that were already exposed have been made further exposed and it has been a matter of priorities and we 've set the priority at flopson because I mean oh that was way more than 17 floor levels that was three and in that regard and I mean you know you it 's really hard to talk about priorities when people 's through levels in being breached and in some areas that will only get worse which is why we have to consider all of the options and we do have criteria around buying out but it 's through and you know it 's something that the land drainage recovery program has been working on and they will report back through that as he committee to the council so you know it 's there is there is nothing that you 've said that that as a surprise to me that is a major concern and it will remain a you know that that it is the next priority of the head cut rubber so no could no question about me notwithstanding the inhibitive at salute certainty of climate change in my view Peter Christensen showed a photograph of st. Martin 's in 1941 flooded yeah and but the difference is the houses up there now yes and look if you actually look at the things like the portholes fire there was a fire yeah started virtually in the same place Becca what was that 40 years ago or 30 years ago yeah 30 years ago I met one of the guys that was a firefighter on that fire there was no housing that was threatened by you know like that you know we and do we when we things that I feel passionately about one of the lessons learned is that we have to look at land use pattern decisions that were made prior to the earthquakes because there were decisions that were made after the early 90s report there were decisions made despite the risks around liquefaction and lateral speed being perfectly well known and it 's all very well to quietly you know to sort of pass it off and saying well the Environment Court overturn them that isn 't the case with all of them in fact the Bixler subdivision known as Pacific Park wynton because the council wanted to build all the way down to the river and the environmentalist push back because they wanted to develop wetlands so there was a half a half a paragraph devoted to the known risk of liquefaction and nothing taken into account so I want us to go back over those decisions I actually don 't think that read zoning should be an excuse not to look at what we got wrong in order to fix it for the future exactly our areas of development I don the port hills movie that they were in a forest fire environment I don 't believe that they ever understood that and we have to be much clearer about assisting communities to understand their risks that is not something that we can do for communities that something communities must do with the expert support that we and the council can provide you heard it 's a it 's a joint effort and it 's not going to happen overnight I 'm Jana I 'm sorry but we 've got to the end thank you very much right what we 've had and moved and seconded so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and I shall _"

    "text": "it 's just me good morning Lena counselors eroge we 've just got a couple of things to highlight from my report in the first one as a little term museam in their approval gift of laned I know it sent a report to Council today but we just wanted to highlight away but be at the Museum in that project which obviously the logging community are very excited about follow support of so the slide here actually shows the former museum before the earthquakes which was down on our okay unfortunately the building was ruined and the earthquakes and sneer no longer the yes distinctly lot the one thing about the former saw it was it wasn 't big enough to actually showcase all the items stolen which she still stored a canary Museum at that particular time that one of the big things that was showcased suddenly was the entire exhibition obviously that everyone 's very proud of so it 's just a photo of the Palmer Museum in the next slide as well of all the items that were actually recovered from the museum from the Littleton and getting those items and stored over at Wigram so they 're nice and safe waiting for a new home in these eight thousand five hundred items all together at the and meat storage facility this just shows the site which is to the least inside so the on the corner the place with the big red roof is our library and see the center so directly next to it on the right hand side as the site where the museum would have a priesthood it would be from a community perspective it would be absolutely wonderful if it could go there because it 'd be a lot of foot traffic and it would here actually help boost the local economy which is really struggling at the moment there 's still a lot of empty lots along the area and you know I with the museum going the hopefully it could trigger the economy also with the pro shops or tune into little turn it would be a real good tourist attraction so you know we are ho pane and fully support museum go in India the next slide as like and big three stories obviously the basement on the ground floor would be the entrance to the museum which would also accommodate a bookshop and an Information Center in the other two levels would be for displays so I just really want to reiterate the work of the team on the historical museum committee the really data captures a lot of scope although they haven 't got a building at the moment they stole a but parts of the museum places around little term aimed really just at the it nice to know that there are only way beaks so we just could mean the work that they 're doing we move on to public participation so we 've had to lots of submissions the feast is the joint consultation with sprayed and cashmere community boards on the summit Road proposed prohibited torrents and this has been a concern for quite some time and obviously you can say well the tyre maxia that there 's a lot of boy racers up there and the openings as we all know in the areas very vulnerable to fire if we know year the residents on either side of the summit are really concerned about the space that the cars are traveling so they were asked to submerge end all in oil between the two boards is 865 and submissions the next one is one of their receives or ammo which is on a third of Littleton at the moment staff have been working with the reserve management committee to and former plane and we 've just received we are we 600 submissions for late these obviously a lot of interest these bike tricks go and through the walking tricks there 's a group that do a lot of ecological recap the just a beautiful place as you can see the view over the harbor so obviously there 's you know a lot of interest here as well the next one we just wanted to highlight be exponential as oscillation and how it can hit them so quickly the main highway and to little revenue grow it can be flooded quite quickly as we experienced on August 14th we hear community board meeting and Little River aimed during the course of the the year so or not everyone some got through I think potamia was lucky to get through with a place he scored I hate to say oh they were a few that decided to travel home for Pigeon Bay in port levy so that took them two and a half he has to get hoeing the wrist booked onto the silos until the water receded so we just really wanted to highlight that point of isolation there is we had they thing from aching and picking July just to show us the work that they 've been doing to mitigate the flood situation there but it really still was a problem and I mean I saw it for myself and you know believable here quickly the Erie floods and I know that I 'm experienced in other parts of a such a but particularly on the peninsula over you know small communities can be cut off so but just wanted to highlight bait in its up thank you are there any questions from Council Yannick just um an on previous reports the board has raised concern about the lack of maintenance yes well we 're actually waiting for another briefing from staff Irene those are shows but your maintenance as a book Victor I play ball he 's something sewing about I mean obviously it 's right across the study and that 's a concern but I think the other thing too I know one of their board members is quite patient very vacating for you know local contact us because of the peninsula situation and you know if we could hear somebody yet you know particularly on the other side of the peninsula that could keep an eye on things and you know just keep track of wind things you know need maintaining would be really helpful because I know previously we 've had the things I 'm just thinking of summit coming in a corolla we 've been showing a lot of slides of broken foot pars and yes whole bunch of things so just is there a program underway to address those well at the moment we 're just waiting to have a briefing from major that stuff as I understand you you may recall it just after the 2016 annual plan we put in place a a Carell issues working passing as a working party that 's made up of community board members from that part of the peninsula Christine attempts those meetings on a part of the working group as well and we 've actually moved forward in leaps and bounds in terms of some of the issues that were raised in submissions to that annual plan so been emptying and and and the general tidiness of the town there was a lot of work done after the recent floods to tidy the town to remove some land slips and that sort of thing so we 've made some good progress certainly not saying there isn 't more that we can do but as a result of the work of that group I think a Corot is going to be a lot better place for this summer season than it has been in the past thank you I mean it 's a good model wasn 't it things I 'm working party model oh absolutely and you know they 're very dedicated and we 're group too and we 've so you know it 's Andrew seed we try to get to those meetings because a lot of those people and that can we do giving up your time you know the businessman look have not be titled to be part of that committees know very fortunate yeah and the other thing is is that we did actually try to get a local contractor to take over the whole of the contract but that was not successful so I think they 've got sort of some components of the contract are now delivered locally which is better than whatever laws but I think in terms of capacity building it would be great to see there that you know the contracts actually embedded in the local community because you don 't want to wait for the contractor to come over the hill by the time he 's you know when when there are urgent needs to be addressed but I think it 's it 's starting to be fixed and that 's much better than it was it 's just going to say this here it way so the very there 's a memo yeah that 's currently going out to counsel some years about the additional perks urban park rangers that are going to be on the ground and local and neighborhood parks to try and resolve those issues it 's literally just coming through the email system so that 's going to be really helpful it might be a good idea to get them to send that out and show the community as well yes I know because what Mary had to draw it to my evolution because I was concentrating on that 's right I clean oh thank you Thank You Christine just that reference to the sign of the Bell boot on page fourteen five foot ten point one the Harry L trust or whatever it is that oversees a lot of the work around there do they have you know it 's a good ongoing funding streams for the work that they do what a big fought on us don 't have to find out I really come out so bait it 's a bit of a mix okay sorry problem like to move that this report they received yes I 've remembered what summer night to second there Yanni Thank You Yanni I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's scary thank you very much thank you thank you _"

    "text": "sorry I got carried away and his Darrell who said presenting on behalf of the Linwood central tech community board I 'm actually getting much better at remembering the order of names as soon as somebody said to me they 're an elf it 's called makes it much easier are we only yet we 're on good morning nearly N and good morning councillors Linwood central Heathcott community report and we 've got a logo that has just come up here I think that yoni took when we recently went to to Fira Mead counselors and community board members were invited to attend Faramir it was a wonderful afternoon and myself for one was a community board member I went along expecting to hear a case about trains and technology at theory Mead most of which I already knew but as we came in the management Theory Mead had arranged a mock wedding and I was pulled aside and I thought well I 'm going to get to relive my youth again and to be to be the groom but unfortunately I was asked to be father of the change and what we observed that afternoon was a well-thought-out plan in terms of management they are really changing things they are working together as a team and this mock wedding was really symbolic in the sense that the underlying theme was a union between that Council and fear in me Park and demonstrating to us how they are prepared to think outside the square they had caterers arranged to show us that they were able to coordinate weddings they put to us how change management could operate successfully all in all it was a wonderful day where I came away thinking that theory made park looking for support from counsel not seeking Oh a sound technician very much okay maybe I played it up so we 'll just go with the flow the video until such time as something else comes up that I can comment on I must say as a father of three daughters I was somewhat surprised as father of the bride find that I had a fourth so do they do they hold wedding ceremonies here they are able to hold wedding ceremonies there and they were simply showing us through demonstrating in a very practical pragmatic way that they have the church available that they have the facility in terms of a venue available to host weddings and what might be called a very what 's the term invigorating different type of environment catering was arranged a forest had been put on and look for all intensive purposes the folk involved in the role play here inclusive of the children you would have been hard pushed not to think that you were at an actual wedding so not to lose the whilst we have a sense of occasion here in terms of what is taking place the real heavy message here is that that fear amid park management stepping up they are stepping out they want to work with the council they want to seek funding they were very keen to show us what they could and how innovative they were with the management and not necessarily sticking to what you and I might refer to as the status quo come to fear he made go for a ride on the train take a as well and if I could just add that um all the people that provided the services for that mock wedding all donated it free they gave up their time the catering everything was donated by a number of groups and that was really lovely and they even decorated up the tram with flowers unfortunately I said oh no what 's the contrast on the phone and that was the Masonic Lodge that that turned into absolutely magnificent function venue and so yeah I just thought it is nice to acknowledge there that the main organizer behind it was Susan Carson from events and wedding professionals and then there were a lot of other support from different local businesses but as Dave said it was really a really neat showcase of just the change and I guess approach that they were taking and really just for those that were there just and thanks to all the community board members across the city that attended it just blew a blow us away in terms of the hospitality and the professionalism with which they put the event together so yeah huge thank they saw their relationship with Council and their community boards has been really important and they just organized them what wedding to signify the fact that we were coming together in a new partnership which I thought was really lovely yeah thank you um that we 're gonna run out of time for the community board presentation if we don 't move okay they think thanks Darrell thank you moving to the first slide Thea I would break it down we dealt with the wider spectrum of issues at the community Morden meeting and voice breaking if I was to break it down into three parts part one would be parking parking restrictions and alteration to bus stops and taxi stands part two would be that we approved street layout and we investigated tree-planting street renewal for the project and griffiths Avenue and part three what was that the board approved grants from discretionary funding as outlined on the slide so if we go to the second slide part a recommendations to the council with respect to the coastal pathway you 'll note via that the board 's recommendations to Christchurch coastal pathway as part of the major cycle weights routes project for funding the upshot of that I had a report back from a meeting held I think it was yesterday and the upshot of that is it makes no difference of the coastal pathway as part of the major cycle ways route project as the council will support the coastal pathway regardless of its status and council will work with the with the coastal pathway to put on submissions for funding whether that be government funding or funding from other sources also council staff are setting up a meeting which will involve the coastal pathway project leader from Council Kirsty Mahoney as well as Lynette Ellis and the community pathway chairman scott barrington so although the recent meeting was a positive and supportive meeting with respect to we are too here for the coastal pathways and the fact that links into the major cycle pathways funding is not necessarily the end of the road so to speak thank you significant projects and initiatives the opening of the Sumner center look that was just such a well received and and my thinks as a community Bergman that goes to merely an and the council any funding that community wounds as heard one any funding that comes from council council have to balance priorities so look there was a meeting of minds over this and the some of the community the feedback that I 've had is outstanding it has really enabled Sumner to get back on its feet and the it 's it 's provided that connectiveness within the community and such a wonderful event yesterday I spoke to my next-door neighbor who is roughly about 80 years of age and he showed me the box that he 'd just been down to get from the summer library and and he was telling me what such a wonderful facility it is so I know I 'm articulating well done but the practical face of that is that the community appreciate it so thank you well done council next live significant community issues that community borne concern has been raised in relation to anti-stress the proposed liquor outlet in Phillips town we had members of the community come along they concerns and their message very well at the moment there is no application but from a community board perspective should an application be lodged via the community board rules port the community only concerns with respect to the proposed liquor outlet at 375 theory road one of the concerns was there is an absence of a local alcohol liquor planned to give the community voice and that was discussed at Council and it as a point of concern next slide thank you progress reports about against the community plan and you can go on to the next slide the plan has been adopted there has been a wide variety of community engagement and workshops we have agreed on priorities that 's been well debated and priorities in the board plan color-coded to match the council 's our long-term plan and the council 's long-term plan and that 's pretty much it oh I forgot the best community all in matters of interest and here I think Yanni for drawing this one to our attention these are the toilets at Taylor 's mistake and I guess that 's probably when you New Zealand beautiful lose competition and the results the winners will be announced at the gala dinners in Hastings on Friday to think 13th of October the point I 'd like to raise about this is when you look at these toilets here what a great place to spend a penny they are aesthetically pleasing they 're easy on the eye there 's a wonderful surfboard music at the front it 's literal thinking it does away with the usual ugly concrete bunkers and I wish these toilets all the best thank you thank you very much well we 've really come to the end of our time might one very quick point is the second or the other really great thing about these toilets is that there used to be a huge amount of vandalism since we put the art and built these toilets they 've basically been almost vandalism free so it 's just a really positive story and I just yeah wanted to say that hopefully the like roto cutter who to toilets can also be considered for an award but no yeah I I don 't terms of prevention of vandalism you know if you 've got something nice that 's valued by the community it 's much harder to be the first one to do anything to it I think these toilets of see the real benchmark yeah that 's great I could think of lots of puns but I 'll wait I won 't do any of them no no no we won 't get it okay I 'll behave myself thank you very much Darrow and I mean you 're Oprah already there so thank you nearly looks very well and you counsel another occasion thank you the next one is the Banks Peninsula community board oh sorry we 've need to move an exit Nick Jonnie Dee on put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they know _"

    "text": "petitions we 've had a request that phenol to my mighty Huard community board from this because both the cheer and the dips each year are not able to come today and we have Bridget Williams to present the community board report for this month welcome Bridget good morning everyone good morning so I guess the first thing to start off with is that there are no parties with what we have and we take the report as read and if there are any questions and we would like to mention some specific highlights of the report I 'd be very keen to hit the highlights first and then then we 'll open it up thank you and so the first one is the village church and community center this opened well here the opening was held on the 9th of August it was a yes so it fits very exciting for the wort and another exciting highlight has been Everly park playground upgrade so this was very exciting for for the area and a special mention to Pepin or ENS this has been a really huge success and just were the original people who were against the playground and so yeah we see this as a really great success in a good example of the community coming together and at being a young yeah an exciting facility for the area looks interesting yeah and it is just to mention a significant community issue one in particular as Glen Dovie Road so we have constructed a working group with the residents of the year and the reason for there is there are some issues with this particular row this is Glenda the address and strivin and this has been ongoing now for about 18 months so yeah we are in communication with the residents and creating a working party to help facilitate with us thank you um Yanni thank you for the report just one quick question under 5.2 the rotor cutter who to reserve the entrance upgrade gee that 's great do you know are there toilets that are proposed to go and there is part of it up great no that 's something that the board 's considered or no not at this point but yeah we can board with we 've had the issue of toilets come up and one of the things we 've asked for is a bit of a strategy around public toilets because there 's some areas that have gaps so I 'm you know I think that that 's really exciting with that um reserving upgraded it is very popular as you say so no thank you for that I 'm suggesting you differently we 've found that with Fischer down more yeah yeah public toilets are differently yeah something to think about okay thanks Erin yeah I was just gonna add bits that 's up in the wood that I 'm lucky enough to represent and this is one of the gems of the city this the the lakes that are out there the recreation lakes so this entrance this is just the entrance upgrade it 's it 's no further and they 're not doing any work at this point but they 're Rangers have put on their list of things once they get a management plan for that reserve which they 're trying to tie into the groins as they will come along cap in hand to this council hopefully in the next financial year to ask for a few million dollars for a small toilet I just made that up is that like if you start in the millions when it lands in the hundreds of thousands of people going for car that was a saving yeah I 've missed your sense of irony my thanks I just wanna thank Bridget for acknowledging the Pepin area in its board with what we did over the everly perfect I think it 's one of the biggest disappointments we had the representation review was actually losing Eberly Park which is probably one on the best neighborhood parks and in christchurch but anyhow thanks to your board for actually so sticking to the guns or what what our board has started in finishing that project because what we 've seen is actually a really good success story and sometimes we 've got some of the people that are vocal against things are a minority and it was actually that the bigger community group was saying you stood and put it in outcome for the whole community Thanks yeah I think that 's a really good point because I mean I was going to acknowledge what you seed because I hadn 't appreciated that from the report is that the you know that the the protagonist says that we 're actually hosted the opening now I mean that 's an extraordinary achievement in terms of bringing community to give that so I wanted to acknowledge the community board for that and also to really echo what Mike said that to acknowledge the work that the previous community board had done it is hard when boundaries change and you 've completely devoted all at that time and energy to creating something and then somebody else gets to make the decision which is a little bit around you know sort of how a lot of the community boards feel about bringing the party to such as here so thank you very much much are there any other questions with a little bit of time thank you very much bridges and thank you thank you for coming in and as I 'm making sure that the table today thank you thank you right and now we 'll move to Linwood central yes Kurt and here we also have a first-time caller oh sorry would someone like to move in seeking the report Jamie Aaron I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that it 's carried sorry okay _"

aye those opposed they know that 's carried we 've got no decorations of interest and the open agenda so we 'll move on to public participation and welcome to is us know and Gretchen LaRoche from Christchurch Symphony Orchestra thank you both for coming thank you very much for asking us here this morning we 've really been looking forward to the coming today to tell you about the really exciting plans we wanted we 're here to talk to you is one of our major stakeholders and we 've been sharing this great vision with our other stakeholders creative New Zealand as well in the foundation of the CSO so what we 're really talking about is I suppose the changing role of orchestras globally where they 're broadening their purpose they 're extending out by beyond the concert hall getting out into their communities using the great knowledge and resources that are housed within the orchestral infrastructure and that 's what we 're talking about we actually have a vision to be at the forefront of this movement to be absolute world leaders in this so currently we 're operating as you probably aware quite a dynamic community engagement program already but we believe we can do better so what our vision is is a 50 orchestra so what this means is half our time is spent performing and giving concerts and half our time is actually spent out in the community delivering community engagement programs now we 've arrived at this idea simply based on needs and demand so meet about a third of the requests that we 're fielding for people to participate in our community engagement program so this is very much driven by need and just to give you an idea practical sense of what does a 50 orchestra look like so a snapshot of the 7 days and the CEO so right now on Saturday we had a concert at the Charles Laney auditorium with a visiting international cellist Wolfgang Schmidt it was a great concert in the critics say that was packed with energy and vitality and animation and this week and this week we 've got musicians that are spending the entire week at banks of school and Darlington and they 're working with all of the students in the school each class creating projects that they 'll perform at the end of the week now we 've particularly picked banks ever were very interested to go and work there because we we 're very keen to actually evaluate the impacts of music especially long tail impacts especially with young students that are suffering post-quake impacts and so big there was a good Liberty and some of you may have seen some of her research that came out to the other week talking about some of the impacts on young students so we 're looking to actually be able to quantify the benefits of these music programs but give you a practical sense of what we 're talking about here of some of these outcomes that we believe we can get from these programs on day two the teachers were already commenting that there 's a palpable change and dynamic within the school there was a lift in the school and this is the creative pursuit of everyone working together but also on day two we saw quite a turnaround one of the young students there who suffers quite significantly from autism and is very socially isolated within the school struggles as very sound sensitive and also doesn 't communicate a lot they weren 't sure how he 'd get on by day two the student was actually sitting in front of the drums and not only was he getting stuck in and working with the others and the breakout sessions with the really encouraging the others coming up with lots of ideas and helping them get on and come up with activity so we can see that actually these sorts of music programs were offering has profound change so what we 're talking about with our new vision is using music as a platform to contribute to enhance social outcomes for the city and that includes working with people on the margins of society there 'll be an emphasis on equality of opportunity identifying and reducing barriers to experiencing and participating in the arts enhancing the quality of life through the arts and in particular music in responding to the areas of need so that 's not us developing programs and taking it out that 's looking at where can we help in assist the program itself we 'll have six strands encounter providing audiences of all ages with opportunities to experience live music in a variety of ways our cutter fuya letsplay program this is intensive creative residences based and primary and intermediate schools platform creative music based programs within prisons in justice facilities this builds on the work we 've with a particular focus on youth mental health and the aging community including those with dementia amplify this is building on our existing partnerships to work alongside the disabled communities providing opportunities to experience and participate in music based arts experiences and the sixth string is tuned up and this is developing skills of musicians of all ages in abilities so perhaps if you 've played an instrument in your past and their instruments still under your bed we want to work with you and have you come and join our rusty musicians Orchestra except the recorder so we have a two stage plan and we 're looking to start to implement this from 2019 now we 're actually not planning on coming to the council to ask for more money to fund this we actually will believe that we 'll be going out into the private sector for this we 've already Road tested this and we think there 's very good response and potential support for this we believe in this program so strongly that the foundation of the CSO has committed to significant seed funding for the the council to continue their commitment to the CSO we want to work with you and partnership to ensure that we can really deliver the best possible outcomes and make the best contribution that we can as an orchestra to the city and its residents we 'll be very happy to come back and to dig down into this in more detail and also to work with the council staff so this new vision will enable us to establish deeper and more meaningful connections building ongoing programs not just the one offs that we tend to offer now this year so we have a saying that music belongs to all of us and we really want to do our best to make that a reality for everyone in this city thank you thank you very much we 've got some time for questions but but thank you for a very for presentation I 'm a great believer that music within music we find a number of solutions that and nothing to do with learning an instrument and but it 's about it 's about working as part of a team also about being realizing that unless you 're in tune with everyone else that doesn 't sound quite so ugly thank you have you looked at these Systema I said or model which has been used in Southall yes have and in fact actually I went over to the UK as well in the Winston Churchill Memorial Fellowship earlier this year to actually look at what orchestras over there are doing in their communities and they operate a program that takes some of the ideas of Systema but they 've abetted it more for the UK schools this is actually a very interesting program they 're offering called in harmony and I 'm very interested to look at potentially a hybrid model here so the main differences stemmer works outside of the school environment and harmony works within a school environment so you can utilize the existing community in infrastructure of a school I think that actually something like this could be a very very beneficial thing to happen in Christchurch there 's incredible social outcomes that comes from this program and incredible benefits for the wider neighborhoods as well to delve into this so I did actually do a 360 around this talking to students talking to parents talking to the arts organisations delivering this but also talking to the principals about why they 've gotten on board with us some very Tarin talented young people and other Nui would be great to connect up with Graham Waldrop Miri chitti others you know the Salvation Army also has used their brass base right chose to bring young kids from not just out of know about a wide range of quite low set low socio-economic areas and they have flourished in that environment so I 've seen it first and so just in terms of those connections I don 't know if you 're aware but there 's a group of music therapists have set up to work particularly were that older people have dementia and I 'm just thinking that the work you 're doing could give them wonderful backing yet we 've actually been working with them and attack them so yeah I think this is really key as part of the vision what we 've discovered to doing this work we 've built up a lot of connections partnerships and relationships and the beauty of what we 're talking about here it gives us certainty to really grow and build on those existing connections that we have so we 're not starting from from zero here we 're building on 17 years of firm work but actually this gives us the flexibility to look at adapting it further I think thank you very much and and in you know thanks to the foundation for making that strong commitment for the seed funding for the four years I had a meeting with creative New Zealand just recently and they talked about the the model of their support which has cornerstone organizations that they support and also so the the Torah and in looking for that leadership and then that kahikatea which does which you are on the that track with with cnc 'd and I 'm just thinking that part of our review of our funding streams ought to be looking at that idea of what is the cornerstone for a city and certainly I view the CSO very much for your presentation and thank you for having the vision for taking it out out of the comfort space of the orchestra performance to the wider community thank you very much right now we have Bob Wayne Walker with a five minute presentation good morning I am Lane Volta a long-term resident and strong community advocate for the community of Phillips town thank you for allowing me this time to address the City Council over my concerns and regards the proliferation of alcohol outlets wanting to open up in Christchurch at the present time there is a serious concern for me that they are currently targeting the eastern side of town with a proposal for a new liquor lanes being considered in Philips town as many know Philips town is regarded as a low socio-economic community in Christchurch it is rated annoying out of 10 on the government 's current deprivation scale this on its own then serious issues for the community to deal with without without having to deal with an overexposure and the easy access of alcohol to many vulnerable people living in Philips town we metres from the proposed site we have identified at least 18 liquor license sites within an approximately 2.5 kilometre radius of the proposed site we as a community are saying enough is enough and while we will firmly lodge an objection to any license application being lodged we are to some extent limited and what we can object to to the fact that there is no formal local alcohol policy in place that would actually add considerable strength to any objection furthermore there is very confusing guidelines as to who is entitled to lodge a formal objection anyone who wants to reject must prove that they have a greater interest in the general public and put it in a submission and this is where the confusion lies it appears you must have clearly closed to any proposed site to be a person or be a person with for special involvement involvement in organizations such as churches schools community or noise Asians etc to have a chance to be considered as someone entitled to object but it appears to me that what is seriously making is the opportunity for one of do so that voice is that of victims who have been harmed in some way by alcohol surely of anyone they would have the greatest interest over the general public and there should be something included in the local alcohol policy to recognize suspect or the council could ensure that their local licensing authorities are given guidelines to include objections from such people I have read online the counts of provisional local alcohol policy date of the 29th of September 2016 I like the intent of what what you are trying to achieve and I am aware there is a process that has to be followed but then we as ratepayers what are we going to have when are we going to have this policy in place to give us as communities more teeth to take on those who wanted to continue to flood our communities with liquor stores just because they can my understanding there were appeals against some aspects of the provisional moissan policy when it was presented but this did not involve the section regarding off licences Azir anyway the council consider can consider formally adopting impact which in a common ground place with those who oppose in the other parts of the policy this ruling dub community such as Philips Town the teeth we need to take on head-to-head businesses that want to continue to flood communities with alcohol because at the present time does he protect in their favor thank you thank you very much I mean obviously that LLP is going through a process there are appeals and no you can 't implement part of that ahead of the rest of it in there are appeals on the off-license as well so I 'm sorry but that 's that 's the way it is so thank you very much for your presentation right now I 'm going to move to deputations by appointment which we haven 't received any presentation of petitions and we 're moving now to item 23 which is reckless park and reckless school proposal ends well sir hearings panel report in front of us and I 'd like to invite the chair of the hearings panel to present the report thank you very much so the hearings panel has supported will you 'll see are picked up in the resolutions which are in front of us today so recommendation two picks up matters raised in submissions relating to particularly amenity values and it means that the project around view shafts are at Melbourne cave can be picked up in a joined up way and with the work that the ministry are doing and obviously the aspirations of the community expressed through the master plan recommendation 3 allows council staff and the community board to consider structures which exist on the school site at the moment which may have value to the park so that there 's the opportunity for council staff to work with the ministry and obviously work with the community through the community board to ensure that where there are structures which have value to the park those can be retained and the commitment from the ministry is that the area of demolition in the park will be grasped and made good so that what the council gets what the community gets by way of the new Park is a finished site with as many of the structures to remain there so that they add value amenity to that new park and we 've also raised expectations that the ministry will contribute to the costs which are incurred by council as a part of the transfer of the park from the existing park sites of the existing school sites and of course there are items which need to be added to the park which are replacements which wouldn 't necessarily be in programming for renewal at this time so there may be depreciated values which wouldn 't be as much as the cost of replacing for example playground equipment but our expectation is that the ministry would contribute so that difference in cost and there are pedestrian safety and traffic management issues which are brought about by the remove of the school to the new school site existing park sites and again the expectation that 's raised by the hearings panel is that the ministry should contribute to those and certainly comments made by the ministry at the hearings suggest that those are realistic expectations on our class we were concerned by submissions from users of the park there may be a time at which the existing park wasn 't available to them and that the new park wouldn 't yet be finished we 've certainly picked that up my wave recommendation 9 and our hope is that the timing of the development on both sites can be such that there is some period of crossover so that there 's no drop in the level of service and no break in continuity of service for those sports groups some of that may of course relate to timing when there are times of the year that particular sports codes are not needing to use the park as well this has been a really difficult issue for the Red Cliffs community over a long period of time it 's been well canvassed in in the media and and councillors will be very aware of the frustrations and sometimes anger in that community which has been going on for some time one of the things that we heard loud and clear from submitters was that there 's a need for certainty and in many ways as long as the outcome is one of the most important things and there were other options that have been put forward that could possibly have been considered it became very clear when we heard the verbal submission from the Ministry of Education and certainly when we read the detailed information in the report and there the papers were put in front of us that if Red Cliffs is to get certainty around getting its school back and if we 're able to do what we need to do to provide that certainty of the community to the community then approving what 's in front of us approving the committee 's and the hearings panels recommendation is absolutely the way that we can do that to do anything other than that not only risks early certainty but also risks that a replacement school wouldn 't in fact be built in Red Cliffs at all and there were some submitters who were submitting against the proposal who did prefer alternate sites or who hadn 't been happy with the process which had been undertaken by the ministry in the earliest stages but in many ways those submitters the way to get that school is to support this proposal and swap which is in front of us today so in I 'm speaking to the recommendations from the hearings panel I strongly recommend those two counselors today this is an important step in the process that gets the school back for red cliffs that sees a school rebuilt and in fact this is the only way that we can provide certainty that red cliffs will get a school and that that can happen within a time frame that we know that the community are comfortable with my belief is that this is supported by a broad section of the Red Cliffs community and that this is the way that we can show our commitment to that community in terms of providing that and that new school for Red Cliffs don 't you 'd be happy to move the recommendations very happy to move the second Sarah Templeton would you like to speak who who wants to speak to the ask a question of whom all right didn 't_''_2581.53 I note that there 's a number of submissions that school site and even I think the Board of Trustees of the skull and the information that we 've been given had made that request to the Minister so did the hearings panel consider the possible change of government and the uncertainty around perhaps a different outcome in a few few weeks time the hearings panel certainly considered uncertainty and providing certainty to the community was one of the drivers in coming up with the recommendations that we did yes we did consider the possibility of going back to the existing school site the ministry through them their submission made it very clear that that was not an option which was being considered by the ministry and that the proposal by the ministry to rebuild the school on the park site was the only proposal that would bring the certainty that the community made it very clear they wanted so we considered other options but we did rule those out quite quickly because all of them were surrounded by a level of uncertainty that I don 't believe the community would be comfortable with no we didn 't consider what broad context of our considerations all that did was lead to more uncertainty and an inability to make a strong recommendation as we needed to coming out of this process so I mean that may be something that councillors want to take into account it wasn 't something that hearings panel took into account to a great extent because our motivation was to provide certainty of the community that was what we heard through a lot of the other submissions well in fact if you read all of the documentation that was attached supplementary to this advise the ministry said that if we said no to this they would immediately start looking at their banner Park option so I know what the ministry have said but I also know that the ministers have been directing the ministry it 's been very clear that the ministers have been making these decisions and I just wondered with a new the possibility of a new Minister for the sake of two or three weeks a government will be formed in two or three weeks again the Board of Trustees and the principal of is in front of us today and we certainly heard those submissions loud and clear and then just the question I had for counts for councils staff all for the hearing Sparrow as I couldn 't say that it wasn 't very clear what the bulk in design of the school would be on that Park in terms of the intrusion the visual amenity impacts there was some comment to it being quite high off the ground so did you get any shading models or any sort of diagrams of what the visual impacts would be other than you 've got very indicative ones and here that don 't seem to give much clarity over that the panel was concerned about the sort of issues you raised particularly in the context of some of the submissions from neighboring residents and certainly some of the submissions relating to the immunity that the park offered to the wider neighborhood some of the things that they were picking up in those submissions we also took quite a lot of legal advice as a panel as to what was within the scope that we and of course the recommendation is around the land swap there are planning requirements and planning regulations that pick up the issues around built form and and the the look and feel of the new site and we were certainly provided with a level of confidence as a panel that those planning requirements would pick up exactly the sort of issues that you raised but we also in our discussions with the ministry and in hearing what they said to us were provided with the level of confidence that the ministry was at least cognizance of the issues around amenity and the the built form and an urban design of that new site but the advice that we received as a panel that were was that those were matters that would be considered as part of the planning requirements rather than that that was something that we should consider as a substantive issue for the panel I 'm clean no more questions okay yeah okay Sarah that by acknowledging the principle and Board of Trustees members who are here today sitting in the audience they are watching and waiting and school have been through in the community and the enormous amount of work and effort an energy that 's gone into keeping the school intact while they wait for a decision while our decision will be today there 's still a long way to go to actually keep the school open again and so I wish them all the best for that work as well there 's been misconceptions around rockfall risk expressed on social media and in the media like to make sure that everyone 's really well aware that actually there is no rockfall risk for the for the old school site or the new park site and that the ministry are going to be building a fence to define the the new park site and differentiate that between that and the the the other area that we won 't be taking on there was also some anger in the community at the minister 's original decision but that 's not something that we have control over and I 'd like to acknowledge Johnny 's point on that as well and that the potential for a change in over that and in fact while there 's been no word from any of the other parties that they would change anything to do with this process we also have support from the local Labour MP elected MP for the land swap today and her submission all the reasons that make reakless Park on the waterfront they 're a really great place for a park also make it a really good place for a school it 's going to be a wonderful environment and the children talk to us about the potential for more eastery studies and working on environment meters and things like that as part of their normal school day and that 's going to be a real benefit for them the main road site will be a good spot for a park it will be much more visible more highly utilized and that will be a really good counselor is it going forward for what for the community I 'm looking forward to conversations that with the community and the community board about how that new park looks and what assets we might like to retain on the corner and that could become a community facility and potentially the playground equipment and those kind of things and so I really look forward to those conversations and would urge people to vote in favor Thank You Glenn it was good to be part of the panel with my colleagues particularly in light of the qe2 experience and so recommendation number 10 is along the lines of that kind of negotiation at the highest level to ensure that the recommendations that have come out of the panel are adhered to so we know that the negotiations will be conducted in good faith but that is just a way of underlining that it is important today that we do do our part to ensure that what we heard was the heart of the community is put back so the school is that heart it 's and it 's important we put that back today and that I think we pushed the Go button and give them certainty so that the panel was very cohesive it could be some of the kind of grievances we heard was cathartic that was important think we did it quite well a guy I can 't support this today I will be abstaining my preference would have been to leave this on the table until after the election because I can 't see what we have to lose from waiting for a few weeks or another month because it just seems to me that there 's a number of concerns that have been expressed and I would also was on the qe2 Hearing Panel and one of the issues that came up was the lack of detail from people being able to make submissions to know what the impact would be and you know I think if people are being asked to make submissions on the loss of or the disposal of some green space and they can 't see exactly what 's going to be proposed to be put back in its place then it it 's really difficult to make an informed decision and from the diagrams that I 've seen again it 's like qe2 you just get this very big kind of generic kind of blobs on a map that you going to go there I also think that you know fundamentally there 's a real risk of putting a school from what was one high hazard area to another and this huge risk around flooding and I think tsunami so I can 't quite see the logic and putting it here other than the fact that the minister was determined not to go back to the existing site so perhaps with if there 's a change of government I think there would be new opportunities to explore it and I can 't see why we shouldn 't wait a few more weeks or a month to just see what the outcome of that is before agreeing to this I have to say that I have huge sympathy for the school remaining in recourse I 've always been a strong supporter of it staying in ricklefs that 's absolutely essential and important I think the other thing there 's a few other things and these resolutions today which do leave me with a bit of concern previously when we did qe2 we actually had the report around the sale but there to the chief executive around the arrangements and what we saw with qe2 is that the arrangements changed once we 'd already made an agreement the ministry came back and said they wanted to remove more trees or different trees and so I just would have preferred that we actually have the whole documentation in front of us today to be able to actually see what the valuation of the land was and to sign off on that agreement if that 's what at the same time as we make this decision so it 's it 's again I appreciate the huge amount of work and effort that the community have put into this as I said I 'm very supportive of the school remaining in Red Cliffs but I think actually we should wait a little bit longer to find out what happens with the general election given how much of this has been the minister 's refusal to look at the existing site I would say a couple of words and came back to the the mover of the resolution but I simply want to really focus on of trustees who wrote to the council and said right at the get-go when this was on the table do the both together don 't leave the community to make a decision about relocating the school without making the decision about giving back a park and I think with that encouragement it was it was an enabling position that the community took it enabled us to actually bring this paper today the second element of the process that I want to talk about as the hearings panel I think it was an exemplary process I think it enabled the different points of view to be expressed in a way that was I think good for the and healthy for the community they 're always challenging decisions when you want something that isn 't on the table it 's hugely difficult but leaving this matter to lie on the table was not an option not at this stage it just would I think be such a huge disappointment after people have invested so much for many it is a compromise but you know that 's what life can be like sometimes degree of compromise and I should have acknowledged the the local Member of Parliament the Honorable Ruth Dyson who would have been here other than another commitment but so I should record her apologies because she would have been here otherwise and you know to have that degree of support across the board I think as there 's also very good I don 't think that we can wait for for a general election and the outcome of the outcome of which is uncertain this community has asked us for certainty and I think we should give it to them today enjoy and really just echoing those comments and picking up a couple of things that have come up in the discussion since I introduced the item we absolutely heard from this community that they want to school back in Red Cliffs we absolutely heard from this community that they want certainty they want early certainty in fact they want certainty now we can 't expect a detailed design of buildings at this stage when we haven 't yet approved the transfer of the land to allow this to happen now but we need to have confidence in our own planning rules around issues of built form urban design natural hazards which pick up the sort of things that we talked about at the panel and which have been mentioned today inundation flooding tsunami risk and so on but we have planning rules that take all of those things into a place into into account so waiting is not an option we 've got a responsibility to this community and it 's a responsibility that I believe we need to exercise now I also would like to acknowledge the the school board of trustees the school community and the Red Cliffs community who have really been through the mill with this but this is our opportunity to provide them certainty we have an opportunity to do that today and I encourage you to take that opportunity I know how happy people were in the room at the hearings panel when we made this set of recommendations and I 've got every confidence that the Red Cliffs community will be very happy when we make a very clear and certain decision that that 's what counselors are going to allow us to do thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no abstentions Jonnie thank you very much that 's carries right the next item on the agenda is the Heritage incentive grant approval for the Corps mustn 't Luc 's for the package 185 former Street Christchurch it 's been to the social and Community Development Committee site and fight feel clear also to introduce this item look happy to introduce it and I 'm sure the staff will comment on it too and answer any questions but like it 's clear in the report that in fact at the committee level this was a tied vote in terms of the of the of supporting the application I just want to refer to the fact that at yesterday 's can committee meeting we had discussion around the review with a review of the fund and a discussion around the strategy and while there are some aspects including accessibility which might impact on this application in fact it 's essential that because deal with it that way under the current criteria so just think it 's important that we in making our decision keep that in mind and X Christians out there there 's there was a question I think raised Brynden in relation to the the funding table just to clarify that that was the only point of clarification perhaps said I needed it was just the date of that funding table yes that on the two tables the financial implications the first one is in under point six point seven it 's just those those last figures the total available funds the figure there is is is 2016-17 it should be 17 18 it 's that there 's mistake yes obviously the same on table in 7.1 so apologies for that enough just thank you simply sorry um I don 't know to focus on central government funding in different funding options rather than just looking at the funding option that it 's in front of us my advice is that this particular building has applied for a grant from the Canterbury Earthquake heritage buildings fund but were unsuccessful as had to one project only rather than to several separate projects so that fund appears to be now exhausted the second was the equipt fund ministry of culture and heritage but they 're not eligible for funding from this fund as they 're not on the council 's earthquake-prone building list as this list only relates to commercial buildings is that right yep and so the food fund as the Heritage New Zealand pull here a Tangra grant funding which the owners applied to about the same time as they apply to us and they 've just been awarded 60,000 from hnz DPT towards their project so would date given that they 've only just been awarded there would that impact on the recommendation that you 're making to council today no because the the funding that they are seeking from us is still relatively low percentage-wise of the works that they 're actually doing they 're doing something in the order 1.2 million dollars worth of work they didn 't apply through discussions they knew that they weren 't going to be able to apply for 50% of that as to what they put forward for funding so the the 200,000 approx there were we 're supporting here is is still much lower percentage wise than a normal gram that we would have we would have we have the ability to formed up to 50% but this is something like 26% but say that the granting are presumably you didn 't know about the 60,000 being granted but you knew that they were applying to other fans so but it so it makes no difference to your recommendation okay other questions Yanni if we were to reduce the grant to a hundred thousand and light of the other funding commitments we have on so the other funding pressures we have on the Heritage grants what would be the covenants that we could expect well yes you would drop from a full covenant down to a limited covenant so you would have to put a time limit on that usually it 's around 20 years somewhere between 10 and 20 years whereas with a grant of over a hundred and fifty you get a covenant as in perpetuity right so that you 're aware off to have a covenant attached to that funding I 'm not aware of any covenants are usually between the council and owner okay and the force of what I 'm not sure so the minimum amount that we could expect the cover would be 150 yes covenant there is a partial Kevin it 's time limited for any um grant they are they are different covenants the wording is not the same a limited covenant is not as as all-encompassing as a full covenant no hang on Mike um so if we were not to fund this project what would happen to it would it continue and be completed or would have fall out qualified as staff to answer that question it 's a it 's a question for the owners so another question cuz obviously this is a significant amount hundred thousand once this property was completed through the works and the owners the leptons received the ground could they then just sell that property on without any come back that covenant is in perpetuity so it remains what 's the property it isn the title and I understand there but it basically means technically they could sell that property for the money that it costs to do the full works and particularly just put that two hundred thousand dollars in their back pocket and walk away potentially and also know what the potential could do it but that 's the same with any grant that you know this is a significant grant of 200,000 yes but as we said percentage-wise is it 's they 're they 're investing 1.2 million give us two hundred thousand dollars of right past money it 's on your side potentially they could do the work and then sell the property and that two hundred thousand dollars could go in their back pocket of rate payers money they 've done the work I think it 's important give you as that if they 've done the work they 're two hundred thousand dollars of rate payers money has protected heritage because the building will have been seismically strengthened it will have had all of that upgrade provided for heritage protection is seeking yeah I 'm not disagreeing with funding and the potential outcome of that for these people yeah and I fell I 'm happy to move the staff recommendations that 's all I did wasn 't sure there other questions yeah well we would do questions first um Dion sorry as part of the grant that we 're looking at giving them what was it the other stuff that they were talking about that they were looking to do to actually make sure that public are able to view the heritage fabric of this building that was there other stuff that they 're looking at doing like helping make sure that the vision or the visual effect of the building they 're still been able to things seen by called Wall Street or anything like that yeah it 's not seen as a key issue that then remains that you can use to to preserve that the visibility between the road and the building so we could we could put items in the Covenant there is a a portion of the Covenant which allows you to put things in like that that would allow protection of the owner it 's a covenant is a an agreement between two parties and so they would have to agree to that as well obviously they they would have to weigh up the benefits of whatever restrictions there are in the covenant to the financial gains that they get from from the grant we don 't we have done that before I mean other than building that 's actually keeping the you know from the road side that that view was very much a part of your own pricing well I mean this is this is a beautiful building from from kill Wall Street and and from a heritage perspective it 's a very important building for the city and I 'm just wondering if we can give a steer to that effect somehow but I don 't know the process to me how to do that so um it would you could be specific in to the recommendation I would also staff have a clear understanding that this is something that the committee are seeking in when we workshop the any grant review process with the committee and would be so we 're able to put something as an amendment into this to actually clear you know clearly stipulate they 're dispersed or ask staff to make sure that that 's part of the condition to the Covenant yeah you could have a resolution to say that that you believe that the the comment should include some some mechanism to preserve the visibility of the building from there from the road so that could include for example obviously don 't want something like a big fence along the road boundary or big garage pull in front of the building and and the road and so you okay we haven 't got a mover and a seconder yet so I 'm gonna move to that in a minute but Mike did you have another question okay did anyone any other questions Pauline is very quickly just on six point one six in the last bullet point that the owners are committed to the continuing use in maintenance of the building is better feeling that you hear from these people that they 're actually committed to staying in yeah absolutely they fell had to to have taken it on to be honest because it 's it 's no small commitment that they have made too late for them to do if you 'll move that she 's also currently inhibitor a killer eight the amendment that that kid I said in that dearness you 're happy to include that yeah in Canarsie okay well so can we request that the Covenant include a mechanism for so Phil Clearwater Dion slugs include a mechanism to preserve the visibility of the property from the street is that good enough we 're doing today that 's yeah I think we do instead of making asthma condition yeah okay cult so filthy water Dion slugs right and now Yanni has an amendment yeah um say amendment number one is to reduce the it well to yes at the amendment is to reduce the heritage grant to what is a hundred fifty thousand one hundred and seventeen hours for full calm covenant so it 's really it 's really just that we 're amending the first line or the first amount to a hundred and fifty thousand yep as here a seconder for that amendment another thing about I would second it if he dropped it to 75,000 is there a second dose of ammo meaning is there a second to reduce it to 150 thousand it 's gonna fail for want of a seconder yeah say and you want to reduce it to 75 do I have a seconder for that no no no no we 'll be moving the buyers by staff that he can 't so that fails for wonderful seconder should have done a pro forma you know anyway yeah so I 'll open it up for debate Phil Dion glean in three so counsels witness came to the committee I voted against the four hundred five thousand dollars and that there the question I guess about accessibility but also particularly as Mike Davidson has referred to that question of sort of private gain versus public benefit that that was raised however I met I met you really clear to now support the the whole 205,000 and I think that having the additional and the additional recommendation there about visibility that then that to move their discussion around community involvement with our heritage you know I in we 've received a number of on the committee received and you know from from the applicant and I thought it was quite telling and I 'm not going to quote wove it at all there 's some lines that I think are really significant one is they they write we do feel a responsibility to make sure that any public funding we may get will have a return for others and she also adds we 're doing what we can to preserve the bits of history that the house tells and we 're came to find ways to give back the support will make it through public funding you know I think it 's with their kind of accountability really but also that in fact that the there is a there is a there 's a clear indication there that in fact these the applicants are open to to how in fact the community may really utilize that will be the their home that goes back to the the original condition of the building of by a family it 's held in high regard in terms of the Heritage qualifications it 's a very strong strong historical history both the knight ahoo and for the for the church so I 'm now fully in supportive of the recommendations which I 've moved okay I 'm Dion no I 'm very in favor of this and the reason I 'm in favor of this is we know when it first came to light about the decision and in the in the owners emailed us all I actually took it upon myself to go and actually meet with them and go on site and have a look at this building it is absolutely amazing what they having to do to keep the Heritage fabric of this building and for us to think that they 're going to take public money and then on sell that and make a profit out of it it 's just it 's just not possible because the amount of money that they 're needing to spend on top of what would normally be spent just to protect the heritage here is phenomenal moved the whole building off site and they 're doing the Foundation 's but they have to have an archaeologist or they 7 with somebody 's actually touching the ground just because of the that the the massive amount of significance this has to not oh who in the site their car had always been there to bless the site they 've been involved with the church to actually document the whole building as they 're starting to rebuild it and stuff like that the amount of energy that these people have to protecting this building and actually making sure that it survives through this earthquake and actually tells the story of early Christchurch and even blending that into the to the to the native Christchurch story as well as is really quite phenomenal and I really appreciate what they 've to try and do this so in that respect I really you know I would support this and I 'm really keen to see that you know that the the visual amenity has actually kept on sites so that people can actually start to appreciate that building I actually into debate at two weeks ago a hundred thousand people actually looked at that post that I put there it 's one of the most amazing things that 's happened on my Facebook page we 've had dozens of messages from people who have either lived there or excuse me lived there who some people were born in their building in the stories that they were telling about that the building itself and all those kind of things was was awesome and it was really cool to sort of see how just one building actually brought so many people to actually having a conversation about their memories of Christchurch in this you know the happiness that actually sort of come from there so I think that 's actually a really good story and actually I think we can incorporate it into the story of Christchurch and actually it 's one of those things as we look back we will have things that we 're run that will then tell a story of what Christchurch has gone through and what it used to be so I 'm really supportive of this that from meeting the people that they will do everything in their power to to make sure this building lasts for another hundred and fifty two hundred years thank you Green I thank you I 'm came to see a public return for public money so I stood this up at the committee because I was pretty concerned over the substantial amount of public money going to what ostensibly looked like you know a private sitting I take on the the point made by Dion there over the the visibility of the property but I think that that 's only part of it it 's it 's about the community openness and accessibility to it know is it going to be part of a heritage trail so I 'm satisfied with the new information we 've received the owners have heard that what we 've said it at committee level and on that basis I 'm happy to go with the recommendation today having voted against it first at committee level and thank you through the excellent engagement process with the heritage strategy bit the team have done the community legacy and an end inheritance that we have a duty to retain and protect it for future generations so we are giving money to this project not just for these people but for this building actually because these people may not always own this building it may be sold on and this building belongs to all of us so we really we 're putting money into making sure that this building that we but we own and we belong to and we have an investment as as cared for and in preserved for all of us so really in favor of it Andrew then Mike thank you I think we need to be careful that we don 't confuse consideration of this particular grant application with consideration of what changes we might want to make to our heritage grants policy and I 'm certainly aware that there was some discussion has been referred to already at the committee around the requirements of these grants particularly around public access and and public value from the spending of public money and I certainly acknowledge the note that we 've had from the and others around the realization of public money and the will to make sure that there 's a much public benefit from that as as there can be on the part of these owners but any consideration of what requirement for public access or public benefit there might be in line with these grants is something that would be more properly considered and I 'm sure it will be by the Committee on good staff advice as any changes to to these grants and the way that we administer them made the building clearly is one that 's got high heritage values and the report makes it very clear that this is a building that certainly meets the criteria for this fund and the environment in which we 're working of course is one that the fund rules are what they are and the application has been made under those rules I believe that we 're fortunate to have owners likely owners of this building who have got the commitment to preserving heritage that have got the vision to preserve heritage and in fact are willing to take the risks kind of project isn 't something that 's risk free in anybody 's language the the nature of these projects is that they 're frustrating and long and and their and their arduous so I think we 're very fortunate to have owners that are willing to invest in these kind of buildings and it 's great that we 're in a position as a council to be able to support those owners in caring for our heritage in making sure that it 's preserved for future generations and certainly in this case making sure that there is a good recognition of ways that they can bring about public good as a result of what I believe is is good spending of public money which after all has been set aside for this purpose my keen Yanni thank you first of all I 'd just like to correct councillor Galloway we do not own this property it is a private residence and it was bought as as where as so they sort of knew what they were gonna be getting into and this is a large sum of may and the right thing to do I understand that we created a pot although for 700,000 to go towards heritage night value heritage in our city and I know it does have a very strong place the problem I see here is we already started this financial year behind the eight-ball by having to approach things last year to take away from that money this is 28% of the funds for a year and I already know that the social and Community Development recommended another approve of 200,000 from this fund another twenty eight thousand dollars twenty two hundred thousand dollars twenty eight percent will be going on shortly to October with only 19 percent left of that funding pot just 19 percent with nine months still to go I think we need to look at the bigger picture to me we 've got a problem with this policy the way it is actually distributed without having a cap amount in there and I know that meets the criteria of the policy but I 'm not here just to rubber stamp stuff I 'll need to have a look at it city and for the whole year it is not going to work for the whole year we 've seen it time and time again when we 're approving things this year for a next financial year because we just don 't have the money we need to be a little bit more smart of how we 're doing this heritage I was happy to approve this heritage grant if it was actually at a lower amount so we can actually make this go out further through other communities to get more heritage value out there because there is a lot more heritage projects out there and there 'll be a lot more people coming to the council for this fund which will be soon empty because we 're giving out two hundred thousand dollar grants two hundred thousand dollar grants the private residences I had to fight core over nails to get a small amount of money for a community facility that is going to put huge value into the community huge value and there was a small amount this is two hundred thousand dollars of rate payers money that I don 't think that is acceptable and I do not think that is right yeah I share the concern with the quantum of funding and I 've read the Heritage grants that exist from central government and for category one heritage buildings that are listed by Heritage Museum which this one is one of the theory that you know that will probably come in front of us it does qualify for financial assistance so I think the critical thing is to get the full government because and a limited covenant obviously for a time when you 're spending a lot of money doesn 't make a lot of sense so I was happy to reduce the amount which wasn 't supported so I can 't support this quantum of funding I have real concerns about the whole as as where as where we seem to be picking up the costs that people incur because of this whole as as where as business that 's going on in the city particularly around a heritage I just want to remind councillors that there 's even with a full covenant there 's earthquake that this building won 't become as as whereas again and people will be back asking for money to fix it and we won 't have recovered anything and this is what 's actually happened in us that he posted it quite well with pop heritage grants under buildings they 've been demolished or sold as as we rose and we haven 't recuperated any of that money so we do need to be cautious about the Quantum 's that we 're putting in I do support heritage I think it 's really good that you 've asked for the visibility from the street because if you look at this there 's actually a huge amount of vacant land but I just think that this grant is there 's too much it should have it should be reduced in light of all the other priorities that we have we 've also got our own heritage buildings so I love the fact that counts as a passionate about heritage we 've put our own heritage buildings on hold because we don 't have enough money to fix them and yet private heritage building owners so I do think we need to look at the strategy around heritage in a study our welcome when that report comes to council for this particular grant I think this is too much I won 't support her I 'll just say a couple of words I 'm supporting us they the amount that the this building received from the Heritage New Zealand fun despite its category 1 status was 60,000 in terms of a 1.2 million dollar contribution it 's not sufficiently significant and and the advice that we have received and I 'm accepting that advice to reduce the amount of the Heritage incentive grant that we had before us but does want to remind people that this site has will heat up over at registration it is the it has historical significance obviously for its 120 26 year association with the flickers of st. Luke 's Church in high cultural significance as a place sacred to Mari as the burial site of renowned Knight ah who chief tota he now I don 't want to go into the fact that whether that the place of totally but that is what people refer to Christ Church as this is a hugely significant site and to think of a demolition occurring on this site is not something that I would want to stand by the vicarage has obviously the architectural significant is one of Roberts significance as one of Roberts speech Lee 's most highly regarded surviving domestic weeks at end and end and of course that as the report says the contextual significance as of that risk mid 19th century dwelling that stands as a reminder of the loss of sand Anglican as looks in Luke 's Anglican Church after the earthquake so but the one that just came to mind is that the form of the coach was designed by Robert speechy the architect who came to Christ Church with his pupil William crisp to oversee the construction of the Anglican Cathedral I mean in light of the decisions that are going to be made this weekend I think this is a significant contribution to the heritage of ersity so I 'll be supporting the recommendation so on that note I will opposed say no and that 's Mike Davidson the eonni Oh handsome thank you very much that 's carried the next item on the agenda is the proposed names for new park and new legal Road in the east brain can I hand over to the chair of the social and Community Development Committee mr. Phil Clearwater mr. Phil Clearwater who 's in a conversation with a colleague associate chair could you please introduce the the next report for place names for new park a new legal Road in the East Frank 's so look I will but I 'll be brief because I think that Russell can explain some of the complications more clearly than I can because in the report at each sort of stage following the working group there 's never been full consensus around the names and that 's why but in effect the the committee at the committee level we did have consensus in it was he actually hand them a set that we have row or a park and through an e line but I 'll leave the obviously the questions and some bits forth for the park one is rot war which means which quarter as the community well-being and the second one is to Laura which refers to an individual well-being what they never wrote again those two names before word one was Liverpool Lane and it was in relation to the connection to the past history of a crush notion of Wall Street and the second one is her nary Lane which came the first for community 's well-being so both of those may different Ford and the social environment community committee voted on Aurora and who are no Lena winery actually any questions there are any questions on this at yonni thanks um it just wasn 't clear from the report the fate what the Fae that was from the community board so my recollection was that the committee board prepared love up all line which was the preferred name at that point from the working group and that their other preference was for two to aware sorry I 'm just trying to follow to what yeah can you just confirm what the community would say that was certainly the and it 's a seminar there was an informal version and have been form of wrote the community board quoted therefore for a to order and for for aura there were equal for a livable a nose fire full of Elaine and it was true for her new Elaine a time that I was presented to the community board my recollection was that the working parties do as a lover Paul Lane was the perfect one is that correct yes yes other questions someone like to move the recommendations though seconded Sarah is there any discussion now Sarah then Yanni thank you I 'm I 'm really pleased the Aurora and who noe have been recommended by the committee here and but it was really disturbing I think for me to see in the report and 4.3.2 that in 2017 we should be saying that rora couldn 't shouldn 't put it with a disadvantage in choosing Aurora because some people might find it difficult to pronounce and in 2017 where people don 't have any problem with Waimakariri with her de nuit and with with multiple names that we Maori names gifted as well I don 't think that there could be that should be a consideration the central city is full of English bishop Brooks and there is very very few chances that we ever have to rename streets and to recognize actually what is a much earlier history for Christchurch City then Liverpool Lane and other Bishop Brooks and so I think there 's having a Maori street name in our Central City is a really important step forward for us and really huge ear and to support it today thank you Yanni and support the current recommendation yeah unfortunately I wasn 't actually at that community board meeting so my preference would have been for what 's actually they 'd recommended to us today so from that perspective I support the recommendation okay all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a post saying no just Yanni and David East thank you that 's carried next item on the agenda review at the terms of reference for the social and Community Development Committee and housing task force move introduce fell so the major changes with these is we 've especially because of the importance of housing for people are homeless but housing altogether we have established a as you 'll see on the report a housing subcommittee it 's strict it 's strengthened and set that is really the main change and accordingly some some of the terms of reference are altered too and there 's clearly reference here though in the report that if in fact those changes in were to impact on any of the other committees well though changes could be made accordingly so I 'm happy to move the recommendations it 's going clean you 're supportive of this we need to one of the reasons we 've needed to do this is to bring it in line with LGA requirements but it also serves to give housing issues a greater profile in the city and there 's a lot of work going on the background early meeting this morning over you know future homeless models for instance we we still will I personally what it was hew subject to the common in Wellington their hold of that so there 's a lot in there and we just want to get cracking very good any other discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you next one is impact on business from council works I can 't remember rec whether you were clearing that meeting or whether Andrew was Andrew was Andrew can you present the report yep I 'm certainly happy to and introduce this item so there was some good discussion at the committee and there was a variety of views expressed the committee was quite rightfully concerned about the effects of roadworks on businesses and it became quite clear as the discussion progressed that a significant amount of work has already been done and that there 's a clear commitment from staff to continue to engage with businesses and to improve engagement not only during construction projects but also prior to construction works taking place including matters like alternative pedestrian access car parking considerations and so on the committee by majority did agree with the staff recommendation but the we had from staff regarding requirements for liaison and engagements by staff and by contractors as part of the procurement process so that 's reflected in paragraphs 3a to 3c in the recommendation and requests a report back a regular report back in conjunction with the capital watch list which is expressed at item four in the recommendations so once there was a desire at the committee on the part of some to go further than this it became quite clear that any way that we could or would do that may turn out to be quite unworkable what we have tried to do is to work with the staff recommendation but I think to strengthen that to the greatest extent possible so that we can have a good level of confidence that where business is our affected by roadworks we and the contractors do everything that we possibly can to make sure that those effects are mitigated and that we work with the businesses including work before the roadworks take place and picked up in procurement processes to ensure that that happens as well so you 're happy to 's on me it 's it 's I 've just got to move in and second over there are questions first did you do did you have a question or no Jonnie there 's something in the media the other day about contracts being signed where contractors don 't have to work under a certain temperature and I just wondered whether we 'd considered any sort of requirements when we give their licenses to roads around the reasonableness or unreasonableness of certain conditions that that tend to lead to huge delays as we 're seeing in the accessible city and the reference temperature is probably related to sealing work you can only seal down to a certain temperature and then the work that you undertake will will not be effective because of because of the level of the cold level basically that the bitumen will go off too quickly in terms of the three processes we have formally in place for temporary traffic management license dr. Paula Road Reserve and the corridor access requests which are when people dig holes in the road were limited in terms of the conditions when we do review the impact on adjacent property and can put conditions on whoever holds that permit to abide by but that wouldn 't extend as far as the conditions we were put in there conveyed may put in there contracts for a company like kinetics etc that 's a contractual arrangement between them and whoever 's doing the work for them but they would be expected to comply with any conditions are on would you ever consent they get do we look at that 's right the time of year in which they propose to do the work and whether it 's reasonable to do it eg a construction program over the middle of winter when temperatures mean that it 's a lot less likely that you can do the work in the time again we are limited by the corridor access legislation and in terms of service providers we we are basically just custodians of the road corridor in that environment and we are required by that legislation not to impede on this on unreasonably the service providers using our road reserve look I realize you still I 'm just interested with a lot of our road weeks there 's been a tendency for contractors to put out their equipment and their roads towns and everything and then they might sit there for four days before they start and the other thing is we will have half a kilometre of cones for a very small bit of work how are we managing that sort of process at the moment the overkill of of Road counts in relation to the size of the project and in the previous two times of setting things up and then not doing anything today 's certainly sea talk are increasingly working with the applicants to util Proactive traffic management and which really is exactly what you described rather than just sitting out the worst case scenario and then leaving it there for six weeks being proactive about reducing it when it 's not necessary such times as weekends and we 've had recently we 've had complaints because of signs being left upon the soil the face down and so on that was a result of that proactive management that that contractor weekend I guess it wasn 't fully understood the reasoning behind it but certainly see talk are more working with contractors about putting that effort extra into changing the arrangements when it 's not necessary to protect their workers but we do have to be mindful that there are has some motorists on the site even though the workers might not be there there are still open trenches and so on so we can 't_''_6098.19 so this is the two aspects to the health and safety side there 's the safety of the workers and the safety of the road users they have to bear in mind now hopefully we can get over the overkill at times you mean one lives several hundred meters of cones for a small road repair and the Miller just yeah yeah a bit frustrating at times right again the contractors have their own health and safety plans we try and work with them herb is their responsibility and so frequently lays the the handbook of temporary traffic management is seen as I carry of a good practice throughout the country so a lot of might expose them to risk should there be an event of some form about and review on are laid off i was certainly very comfortable with the committee 's recommendation on this i think it 's a pragmatic approach to something that we know has been a big problem i also think it 's important that we look at this in in different context as well we 've heard a lot recently around the way that roadworks have impacted in the central city but of course urban projects are also significant when it comes to the effects of roadworks on small businesses I 'm comfortable that we can pick this up through the procurement processes uncomfortable that we can work proactively with businesses the solution for one business might be quite different to the solution for another in terms of alternative parking or what excesses are needed and there may be things that we can work in around times of day there may be businesses which are busier in the evenings and there 's something that we can do while the roadworks are actually not taking place so this certainly which has been a hope a high-profile issue at the committee and I think we 've got to a reasonably pragmatic solution and I certainly be looking forward to getting those report backs that are referred to in item four so that we can continue to monitor the way that this is working at deal make sure we just got one it before I start echo something that councillor wrist was just saying that on so necessary over the last weekend there was a smooth work site and the footpath and they closed off the entire Road and made it one way because there was a small hole there 's a long I see a part of the street that 's close to where I live so I actually had to go it was really it was actually really annoying because they closed off the entire street made one small spot just to do a footpath little hole and it was covered over by a piece of metal and lift like that the whole weekend these things are actually happening in our city and it actually is absolutely disgraceful that actually common sense makes it just seem unreasonable and that 's where unreasonable what maybe needs a bit of definition this is this is a compromise from my point of view which is good for us to start thinking about how we deal with roadworks and the works on our street I still would like to go further so that from my point of view this won 't be the end I 'm still going to research some of these like rental systems that they use it around the other parts of the world to actually say what does a road corridor or public use corridor do you pay a rental that 's the input into the team de processes and you know just a money go around but it incentivizes people to get these things done fast and decent advisors and to do them slowly so it 's not the end of it it 's not the end for me but there 's more work to do for me behind the scenes and what not but this doesn 't necessarily also excuse me this doesn 't also we take doing work on our roads at the moment and the two big ones in Christchurch that are caused probably the most disruption and it 's probably going to create a recovery on top of a recovery as Dan Street and Manchester Street they are revolting and I 'm surprised that there has been an ally I 'm surprised there hasn 't been a revolt on the time it 's taken to do those two roads like driving down Manchester Street I look at the plate I 've got plans I mean I 'm in a privileged position I could look at the plan and try and work it out but for every you know many people you drive down there you just have no idea what 's going on and it 's taken so long it 's been a year and a half there being roads been closed I mean two two-way traffic this doesn 't go as far to address that issue and that 's where I think the sort of if we looked at a rental system in the future that would actually address those kind of system on notice to get that work done because it is starting to upset our see the Herefords streetcar part that we will talk about later has 52 people on the we keep going and using it because people can 't get to it it 's just not on and that 's what they 've been saying down the the people who are in the heritage streetcar part because of all the roadworks and stuff around there they just don 't know how to get to these places and for having that there for a year and a half is just not on and it can 't happen in our city ever again but so this goes a wee way to starting doing that from our own perspective so it 's good to sort of get our own camp in a good place but would need to take responsibility for the other users that are using the roadways and actually doing this disruption but I 'll support myself thank you Yani yeah I agree with the comments that have been made um I think we really do need to to look that oh and maybe it 's a communication thing because I mean there 's another article that record and Road and people just don 't get a sense of contractors working when maybe there 's reasons because of the weather or the reasons has been diverted to coke or whatever it is there is a frustration like councilor east and councilor swigs of races is that people see a whole bunch of stuff blocked off and then very little activity and it 's been something that you know I think we if we can improve it through the communication about why things aren 't happening if they 're not or if things aren 't happening and we 're monitoring it more to make sure that more things do happen then that will be hopefully a better outcome I too can continue I 'll work with councilor swigs over to because I do think we at some stage need to consider where businesses are being unreasonably affected by delays to roadworks that there should be some mechanism for in you know cases of hardship that they can actually apply for some seen post earthquake it wasn 't the earthquake that did the damage but it was the roadworks that put some businesses to huge financial pressure because of the length of time taken just to do what appeared to be pretty straightforward and simple things so but I think it 's a good start and awesome and Jamie and Ray Jesus I 'll be quick with this but I just wanted to say that you know very seldom does chucking money blindly at something ever sold what not and I think that the recommendations and three are really what is going to make the difference and it 's about communication and collaboration and they 're not just buzzwords but they 're the answers to to a genuine question and whilst we share these frustrations the answer is not robbing Peter to pay Peter because these businesses are ratepayers so whilst taking money you know from from the same person in giving it to the McKean I think it 's a nonsense I think you know the the other issue around this is definition if we want to go if we wanted robbing Peter to pay Peter Road then you 'd essentially be trying to define what is affected by the earthquake you know is there anyone that that hasn 't been affected by the earthquake and I would argue that there wouldn 't be a person in Christchurch that you know it hasn 't been adversely impacted as a result of the quakes so I think there is an answer to this and it 's about doing things smarter in doing things in partnership with the community but I think we 've got a pragmatic scene set of recommendations there and I think it 's a better way to go because the the blindly checking money at things as just would be a very dangerous precedence and I don 't think it would solve anything right yeah I mean I think the key here and the feedback I 've had from businesses especially around Durham Street is communication so we can 't rely on just popping information into a letterbox we have to make sure that we speak to everybody who is potentially affected that 's really important and second him is room to consider maybe there 's deal on and yah you 've mentioned that when we let contracts around works that when we look at things like penalty clauses this could be part of a penalty clause so there 's an agreement this is how long the projects going to take the businesses that are affected understand how long it 's going to take and are okay with that but if it goes beyond that there needs to be some kind of penalty so we have penalties for contracts over running and perhaps compensation could be part of the penalty clauses around contracts that 's something that I think is worth looking at now Tim I 'm a lot of the feed bit and it rips through our so Jamie you can 't throw money at something solver because I think there are some issues with some of our streets with regards to finally surprises when you you lift up the road and some of our streets there are like old houses when you kind of buy an old house and you do it up you never pull down thought it just doesn 't happen so but I will mention a staff in my area and some others Ross here it was absolutely outstanding and I 've had fantastic feedback because it does come down to communication and the key to the communication is when things have gone wrong or when things have been discovered that weren 't there like Tran checks you would think that we would know where all the old trim checks are but surprise we don 't_''_6715.85 that that debt communication and I have to say that the staff member Ross hereit has been absolutely outstanding in that area so I think if we can find a mentor or someone that can guide their which we have at our hands that would be the way to go for the penalties to only work when there has been a delay that should not have been to put on fear timelines on something then there 's been a surprise that just doesn 't work so thank you Becky I wonder if we could just as a very simple mechanism do the communication do you recall we looked weren 't bossy and we were actually telling people why we were doing something so for example Rickson road which has been dug up for I don 't know what year we started what feels like a very long time has very long potential areas that we could put a sign that says we 're digging up the road because the water pipes underneath a 98 years old and really in danger of collapsing and we really want you to have a really good water supply and waste water and sewage but we haven 't told people that along the way so so a lot of people just get frustrated and I wonder just where we are actually in front of people 's businesses houses on particularly on very busy roads if we could just tell them for a start why we 're doing it because there are very good reasons why we 're doing it but we tend to keep them slightly secret and I wonder if we just couldn 't get I 'm sure some people have got some old election posters oh you 've got some caramels I just want to kind of wrap up the the debate Oh Mike I guess after so many years we 're all now suffering a lot of rebuild fatigue it 's very clear obviously that although we 're running the study there 's obviously other agencies involved and oetiker is obviously leading the repair of of Jesus Street and Cambridge Terrace which has actually caused a lot of their frustration with and with in Christchurch and I think everyone probably around this council chamber has been absolutely frustrated of what we 've been through and what the city 's been through but in terms of some of the actual projects that we 've been delivering especially around my ward with this cycle way the council staff have gone to great efforts to actually work with the businesses affected and I know everyone is not happy and but they did do a lot of work and they tried to provide I can wherever possible and I think really we the people of Christchurch just need to have a look at these businesses that are been affected and perhaps if you need it still park there and walk yeah I think this is a problem we 've got to in society where we just become lazy and if we can 't park outside of business we just won 't go to all these businesses need our support so therefore if you 've used them in the past keep using them just Park and walk to the business the debate now and I just wanted to say that I mean it was interesting when this came to finance and performance it wasn 't a unanimous vote but what we did round the table was I think work with staff to come up with some recommendations that we could bring to council it became very clear during the discussion that the solution to the big problem zone procurement policy and that 's still coming back to Council and were then that I mean Dion has raised the issue of the rental mechanism which is how it 's done in the UK and some big projects and and you know I think that all of these options are worthy to explore in that context so communication but whoso lifts the ongoing question of disruption in the public realm into a governance monitoring role in a much clearer way than it was before so it 's been a really good outcome that this was brought to the table that we 've kind of worked through the issues and today I think we can agree to a pathway forward and it will take our sitting forward so thanks to those that originally raised it so I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you are we going live in 17 cooking on gas it was dangerous to say this the next item is item number 10 and that 's there we cheering that meeting to you yeah these old Canton the same meeting so this is simply the corporate finance report for the period ending 30th of June 2017 the only thing to note really the ongoing Treasury policy breach regarding the repricing of interest is noted at paragraph four point five in the report has been historic and that 's previously been approved by the committee the reasons for this are noted in the report as well so the committee remains comfortable with this advice and I 'm certainly happy to move the recommendation thank you Dioner you seconding it yep in a question thank you in my question while I 'm sorry I didn 't ask it at the meeting but I was it 's just something that 's sort of been popping into my mind a little bit recently around the market and our overdue debtors are increasing if you look at page 127 of our agenda is this a trend that you 're seeing pop up at the moment so a sec would you dis is a Tricia 's realm okay and on the right report yeah I 'm on the right gosh we would normally see a similar trend so the Griff 's and that rapport would actually show a couple of years trend and over to did us yeah quickly do get a bit of a peek around joan but you do remember these are a trade did us they 're not they tend to not be individuals except for libraries and normal business debtors mmm and actually if you look at the graph on page 127 were actually lower than will be HIPAA icing from when we 've had some big peaks back in april 16 you know I was just looking at the last financial year is all from the position we were in and June 16 okay so there 's nothing all right it 's any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's scary thank you next item on the agenda the final statements of a team intent in Andrew and again this is just noting the receipts of the final statements of intent for the organizations that are noted in the resolution some changes were made in response to counsels comments and CCH else comments these are noted at paragraph four point eight in the report and an attachment a the staff recommendation was approved by the committee unchanged again I 'm happy to move this today do I have a seconder not Jimmy chin any questions any discussion I 'll put the motion all those carried development Christchurch next month progress report and we have Rob Hall here so rather than Bob do you want to just make an overarching statement on which is largely focused on works in New Brighton just by way of equipment has purchased contractors on site initial significant ground works be undertaken next week to get holding tanks put in for water storage we remain on track for a substantial part of the facility being open for this coming summer a lot of work going on behind the scenes around the commercial core which is progressing well Christians have Yanni Phil but what you 're doing just in regards to their community involvement I think this is kind of a request that we asked previously with the playground have you been able to John can you elaborate on any sort of initiatives to get children or local community involved in the construction or the so we had so we 're not going down the route of having children community involved in the construction of the park we did involve heavily in terms of that feedback for the final design that with with a couple of local schools the opportunity to have some some community facility with the children involvement in things like I don 't know in some Park we 've put in murals with put on tiles the schools of you know been have contributed as any yeah it 's gonna be a bit challenging first up because it 's gonna be heavy heavy groundworks big 10-ton big is putting in some pretty big holes then construction building works for the main part of the of the ship in the middle of the playground and in fitting of equipment so there may be something around potentially around murals we have a look at it the certainly leave and we have had community groups offer to donate park benches to to the area as well and just fund it as the illustrate art provision being looked at has he has there been any provision for street art no not at the stage now I 'd certainly encourage theater and I just I 've been to so many developments whether whether the schoolkids from the local area have you know like and the tiles together make up the mural and it 's not it 's not not an expensive option but it 's a really engaged option and the kids and the parents are always so proud of seeing the the either the artwork or their palm print as part of the permanent design of it you know yeah I mean when the pier was being fundraise for you 'll notice all of the paving stones leading up to the the building itself you know they 've got people 's names businesses names people that contribute to the pier they brought they literally bought a brook in the ground on and and so there are permanent reminder of having contributed to their community so if there is something that can be done in their space that it doesn 't cost anything but it produces way more than the financial value now thank you for that on notice it might be so um I just wanted like under New Brighton in the Imagination Station and 700 people in two weeks seems a really good number and nearly 80% of those when you a New Brighton and I 'm just wondering was there any other evidence that in fact they might have followed through on that in fact that that has been sort of like a regenerating or developmental effect of the imaginate the people coming for the Imagination Station and then shopping more widely I think that we 've had from other shop owners in Carnaby Lane be a lie and the other shops there and our paper plus opposite has been an upturn in business so we 're looking at how with imagination station how extend their time there and you would have noticed through the other work that we 've done around just upgrades to carnival Lane in partnership with the local shop owners all the planting boxes a new amenity have gone and this week which is really look great thanks Ron I 'm clean thank you actually are you able to say about with the multiple owners and and the carpark see at the back would you hit any progress on that or is that on the list maybe we can pick up on that in the px at Andrew and said Phil would you like to move to proceed to the report seconded by David East I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much next item Memorandum of Understanding council crusher Cinzia and crushes city holdings yeah also going to that 's also something from that same financial performance committee meeting and so this is the MoU between Christchurch NZD CHL and the council the MOU reflects the way that Christchurch and Zed will report in to the council 's through the finance and performance committee including that committee receiving the draft statements of intent and running the letter of expectation statement of intent process but it also includes a regular quarterly briefing to see CHL so that there can be a joined-up approach to what you might think is more strategic matters across the two organizations so that it is linked up there also important to note that this MOU has also been approved by the boards of CC HL and Christchurch NZ so this is the final step in approving it ref will move up and it will be seconded by someone who 's not on the either the boards David East is there any discussion I 'll put them sure sure because this is three company the titration newsela in the NZ fashion NZ yes in the City Council and also CHEO but in here we separate the crisis NZ four to two different entity yes this is an image what is holding it is why isn 't Holdings company yes we 've always had a separate Holdings company and but a child is one entity why we just separate to size signature yes there are separate companies there 's two companies counselor chin yes two companies Christchurch in seed Holdings Limited was formerly known as transition Holdings Limited and about this time last year CDC ADC Holdings Limited so that you still actually a Holdings company and then we have Christchurch in seed which is the new entity hmm all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried Thank You Watterson risk order proposal looser it also now ready to move it and seconded by Andrew any discussion I 'm gonna sign the document I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carries and how 's that for efficiency I 've just signed up right Thank You Watterson risk management committee minutes or move that seconded by ref put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carries normally we do the minutes yet the becoming report from innovation and sustainability Development Committee and I 'll hand over to the chair Bucky buck um so we had a really interesting meeting and with the committee room absolutely jam-packed full of people coming to listen to the supermarkets on waste minimization and not using plastic bags as single-use plastic bags um interestingly now the food stuffs nor progressive opposed to living on plastic bags they just wanted it to be uniformly applied throughout the country so it was a national reliving really interesting to hear what they were doing by way of sustainability foodstuffs particularly were doing some quite neat things electric delivery vehicles and more coming the first New Zealand had the first non polystyrene meat tray so that it could be recycled and they were doing a lot in the waste minimization field they 've asked us to look at within our procurement policy and ensuring that plastic recycled plastic is included so that there is a market for what they 're doing and there was a land in eto central outlined although what they were doing and their particular area that they 'd like to get into is lithium batteries which obviously becomes much more of an issue an action bicycle club presented and they had been looking at trialing people being allowed to trial electric vehicles for electric bikes for a couple of weeks which enabled them to try them before they bought them you 'll see there the small DC 's rebate as suggested to continue we went through the master plan prioritize what we felt should be there the innovation and sustainability fund comes to us on the 28th and the next meeting looks at achieving climate change target for the entire city and so that Christchurch becomes get there so things like electric transportation modes including buses and trucks and things as well as cars will come to the next meeting yesterday so you 'd like to move this yeah and seconded by Sarah any discussion one question for home you have a hole in here it 's a no powers you know that 's the so we went through every item that was on the master plan list and Carolyn see as she knows the more of her had and went through the ones that we felt were high priority medium priority and low priority and have suggested a range of the ones that should be in the long-term plan that will come back to the long-term plan for discussion anyway so you 'll get the chance to say yes no or maybe to all of those anyway but they needed something to put forward into the draft long-term plan and so that 's what they have those were the ones that we didn 't think were the highest priority that sixteen point four million and and in some areas weren 't being sought by the 't recommended but very low so I can 't find the page that you 're talking done the whole thing [Music] in minutes can you read I summon number 20 which is that the council receives the minutes from the innovation sustainable development committee meeting how the 28th of August 2017 so just just cut and paste bring it up and we 'll deal with it now as one resolution so you completely lost now it 's going this this this doesn 't have anything more than one recommend watershed and it 's not yeah so I couldn 't find the page so I just did all four and an answer to Jimmy 's question yes we do though no no that 's good but but so it ain 't you ain 't heard the last of it eat is more to come and the LTP yep so just for clarification on my page 203 with the innovate the sustainability fund establishment that information about field information about the development of that would come to a store come to council yes it comes to the council on the 28th of okay so that 's been moved and seconded I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried next one development contributions for residential unit rebate which the chairs passionate about would you like to know I covered everything right down to I 'm now okay 21 okay so yeah I think I some number 17 do I miss the one who will move this Jamie Sikandar by the Glen any discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they no that 's carried development contributions policy review 2017 do I have a mover Jamie seconded Bucky any discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carry this is a mark of a good committee I have to say this is a good committee yeah um except for these items but we 've minused these master playing capital projects priorities with someone like to move these mic sikandar 's beyond any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a person no that did we do the two items of minutes it was my mistake I should have included them both so the key moves seconded Dion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried next item as the implementation plan tsunami report and if me reason comes to the table and I will just quickly introduce this that it seemed to me when I became mayor that there wasn 't a structure and place there automatically switched on in a post-event environment in order to conduct a review of what had occurred and regardless of the success or or perception of of otherwise it 's really important that we do there after every single event and we have had our fair share of events but that we we 've had to review and I actually believe that we 're getting better it 's putting in place the the mechanisms for reviewing events after they occur and one of the things that we 've done as is to ensure that when the review is done that we actually speak to a broad range or responding to the event and and then bringing together the recommendations about what we might do to improve in the future but more importantly to embed that into both action plans or into standard practice for the future and I honestly believe that this is something that we have failed to do nationally in response to major events and I 'm thinking of the Canterbury Earthquake sequence as the glaring example of where individual organizations have reviewed events from their perspective but there still hasn 't been the the sort of synergy synergistic what 's the right word yeah but the bringing together of all of those in order to develop a really lessons learned that then gets built into the national framework into the local frameworks throughout the country so there are some incredibly positive things that we learned from the Canterbury Earthquake sequence and we 've seen some of them implemented and Kokoda so the obviously the the that the funds that was made available to businesses so that they could continue to pay staff at a time when there was a high degree of uncertainty you the government also set up a fund which enabled exporters to go overseas and actually reassure quite quite troubled and worried markets and that degree of reassurance that some of our exporters could give directly by fronting up and talking through the challenges that they were facing but also the advantages that they could bring to the to the supply chain and with just-in-time supply chains it 's you know it was hugely challenging for a lot of exporters it was gold it was a magic thing for the government to do but there are other things that were done that I would regard as not best practice and something that do need to be investigated and you know I guess that in an election year it 's not a good year to be looking at what you got wrong and so you know as soon as this is out of the way it 's something that I think we really do need to focus on because you lose I personally think more from your mistakes than you do from your successes and you really don 't want to see with the but what this particular earthquake that that 's that 's sparked off this review and I remember reading in the paper a headline that said that you know the most earthquake-prone streets had dodged a bullet and I really fear that fear as a belief that if you dodged a bullet you 're bulletproof and you know so I can see some of the concerns that were evident after the September eighth quake leading to some of the well contributing to some of the events after the February eighth quake we really do need to learn those lessons and make sure that they are embedded not just in Christchurch but across the nation so I 'm really appreciative of this report I 'm very happy to to move it and and in fall second it and now I 'll hand over to Mary to speak to the to the to the report generally just to pick up on what the mayor said is that we do now have a very structured and so after every event within three months we are aiming to door of your enter corrective that is implemented in float on to future events and also the activities in between for our large event such as this we as you know we did a full external review and develop this implementation plan so that we can ensure that we formed community preparedness and resilience for for events but also learn from what 's happened and other events for our sports role have seen hopefully the lessons that were learned from this this event in the fire event by what we did in the flooding event which was totally different in terms of how we improve that communication both to affected parties and more end people in more generally the way the EOC was managed and operated and also how we actually had people out on the ground at all times to particular those first few days so residents had somebody to see and connect with and also how we ensured our contractors response teams and everybody that interacted had the same visitors to give to people so those were things that have hopefully improved since these but today we 're actually talking about this implementation your previous morning you wanted a structural diagram we were 200 this each for what you meant by that but what was good this data for the board which just outlines walking through from that we had the event within undertook a review which was a review that was done extremely of the CDM team and then the cerium team have worked with others to develop this implementation plan and it 's probably appropriate that I hand over to Sonali who 's a I 'd work on this tonight to walk through those the key elements in mutation plan thank you and good morning and so if I was to take you through from the left side which is the sirens what we 're really looking to do here is review how we 're going to sirens in an event and comments I combined it with the key public messages and resources that we have so for example how women use to write the sirens in relation to the evacuation zones but also look at other communication ways for looking at voice capability for silence particularly and we 're going best option for the communities that they 're building on that is the evacuation plan home three prompt that is looking at how we can update the technical side on tsunami evacuation zones but also the maps and the modeling that has gone into it so it 's a really good time to review those technical details and align it with our national standards but also relaying that to the community side how we can work with communities to get the best information out in the way that they see fit and how we can work with the communities to get the messages out and then look at the words and one of the things that we 're working at the moment is looking at specifically tsunami evacuation planning so working with communities and community boards in our community development advisors just prepare the community on some of the specific actions that we can take to help and enable the community to look after themselves better and building on that is a community response resilience plans that encompasses other hazards as well as tsunamis which builds on two operational side before and following the July event who have incorporated a lot of the recommendation that has come out from operations point of view and for example having the staff training having people on the ground consistent public messaging so everyone got the same message and then that is reflected in our changing policy and civil defense centers so we look at that taking a stocktake of what we need and the civil defense centers identifying what are the other buildings and and services that we can use as civil defence centers and encompassing that with volunteer training so who are the volunteers they can be at the civil defense training and and and hope we can kill them and give them that opportunity and lastly it 's the communication which is about registration so if you 've got evacuates how we can register them with as we 've done in the July floods and give them that opportunity and also the public messages it just keeps coming back to it how we can get communication methods out in more than one ways so the public feels informed if they get we 've also aligned this with the Macomb national messaging so everything feeds upwards and they 're all streamlined with us so we haven 't gone through it 's okay because the implementation plans quite long so those are reporting back on giving a sort of update about the implementations which wouldn 't we 've asked for that well the committee asked for that to be earlier rather than waiting till next year which some of these have you know 2018 Jena 2018 for delivery but I thought we 'd have requested a report their progress oh yeah no sorry I was looking at ours we recommended a report back on progress by the end of 2017 and with request to fear the report on tsunami siren options and include information on tsunami risks because I mean oh I still think that that was a you know that was it that 's an area where we need to get right I mean if we 're going to have tsunami sirens then with they 've got to be voice voice command because if you don 't tell people why they 're you can educate as much as you like but if people are in a state of panic and we have to get people to rely on the long strong get gone so people don 't have to wait but what we don 't want is 20,000 people jumping in a car at the same time so that local evacuation plans have to be local and they have to be owned by the community and well understood and that means that the weird people have to go to has to be well understood as well because and that 's my inevitable from frustration with mcdhh in who says long strong get gone as far as you possibly can oh well I 'm sorry but that 's I think we 've got to change the message to as far as necessary and people need to understand what that means in each locality because they will mean different things if you 're up at all they 'll mean different things that that if you 're you know outside the area of risk and I think that there needs to be much better understanding and nationally generators you know the other side of the world generated tsunami what the risks are and what the timeframes are in terms of response because you know I guess that I mean nobody wants to leave the shelter of their home and then sit on the bridge that is much more exposed than the how civil wars because they 're stuck in traffic and the the neighbor who has no method no way of hearing the tsunami siren because the you know sort of partially deaf and and has no idea that this is going on and nobody 's knocked on a door or rang her doorbell flesh delights or whatever to get her out of bed you know it 's just you know so this is so much that needs to be done at the local level to make this meaningful and the other thing is is that we 've focused here on civil defense centers but there are some areas that won 't have civil defense centers because they 've got something that 's way better and way more community embedded you know like the little know civil defense centers or appropriate local yeah facilities or thanks so Daggett 's you 've got your hand up Phil yarny I 'm thinking I 'll endorse everything that the mayor has just said and one of the big issues tsunami affected area was a lot of people as you say got on their cars and disappeared to DA field or or further and so in the evolving development of this plan I think I have seen some preliminary mapping but it would be very helpful to to say if you live in this area here that is advisable you know the long strong get gone you need to move beyond orange acres here okay my Tahoe neither high school although Lin wet or beta yes the the the sheer geography of of their coastline and the limited access egress points that would have been created a walk out and then advance of segment right some people should have should have yeah and it 's just creative endless traffic jams and a lot of people look probably didn 't need to move and created all sorts of pandemonium for the use of the sirens themselves and knowledge Portland 's analysis there too that they were put in primarily for the long distance earthquake event and and really when they were turned on and this event if there were if we had had a tsunami from kaikoura would have been in gone by the time the sirens are even turned on so we need to look at that sort of methodology as well as looking at the short short the local event as opposed to the long-term event and when we use the sirens and thirdly at a local level we had a an annual meeting for one of the residents group the North Shore residents group recently were in the last couple of months and there was a presentation given my staff member from he can name escapes me at the moment but it was probably the best tsunami presentation that I have seen which clearly sort of differentiate people that close event scenario right through to the Chilean scenario scenario and and I think a lot find out what her name was but certainly a presentation that needs I 'd say it would go a long way to reinforcing what you are trying to develop here so I 'd like to commend what you 've done so far but you know there are some areas I think that we could really firm up and make this a good example of how we would react in terms of tsunami sort of varying location origin so great work so far and I just like to see some of those other things so thank you for them just just in response the evacuation planning is going to include the wind where where to go to and how to get there and and working with the police about transport planning to help is to effectively move people out the sewing report will come back on those issues you raised about the sirens and sirens and using them for different events and the team is working it quite closely with her and from ekn and sometimes doing joint wish you present stuff we work so you went green with your excellent presentation yeah it 's great yep well it might be a good and a live-streaming session but also to actually do a video of it and get it online because both those sorts of presentations are like gold and if people can just you know watch it when it suits them and and absorb it but I mean keep using it for public meetings that 's great they 're great for this easement and filipiniana thanks for all this Mary and David is referred to you know like a community meeting where people really involved with some good information and I just really want to ask you and the whole theme of working with communities so in terms of the preparedness plans and just how we get there in terms of you know I guess it 's and in this clear reference for involvement of community boards in presumably I 'm just presume you know and theirs is the potential here for a whole community development project so that in effect this whole area of of preparedness is really targeted by us as a council so in fact yeah I guess we have or vert community engagement and community development people on people in the community resilience team and civil defense that they are working quite closely and having with the Community Development advisors and committee governance advisors so that actually it can be a cross go joint team response that can work on this but also in different areas will be different issues so holistic response of the community do you want it yes it 's really working with the other community groups as well and said everybody coming to the table and understanding what that risk is and and using the resources that we already had in a community to look after ourselves and getting that shared perspective I think it 's really cool so we are definitely planning to bring other community groups community boards as well as please yep sorry um yummy um thank you just wanted we 're the fundings coming from to do this and if there 's any funding available for those community groups to be involved in developing community resilience plans so so and there 's said some resources within the community development team in terms of this community of resilience workers way to will also be doing that but there are also resources available that will support some of the initiatives that had come out from local communities with the community resilience plans and we 're looking at other ways to get more resources for that so as a community and we know having and I don 't know he 'd already done one a belfast already doing one another community 's return they often come up with initiatives that they want to run themselves and resources such as booklets or posters so there 's some limited resources for that and we look I think the startup of the Lewis project say are you able to give some relief to the community boards that are funding some of these resilience plans yes we 'll discuss with your community governance managers about which what community residents projects you 're having brought into the community boards and look at we for those to give them to one package or one stream of funding into the community service recipients area so we 'll talk we 'll talk to your teams and find out what 's coming 't aware that you were being asked Atika near board level for funding for community resilience clearance so little cog might get some money back for unity forward so stopped are going yeah so we 'll do some work and develop a responsibility you know the Mount Pleasant project I think they 've met with with you on a number of occasions my understanding was that they were getting funding from Red Cross that 's the advice I got just a couple of days ago so they weren 't asking Council for money then I think it does you 'll find it there was a resolution from the funding report unto them to see if there was money attached to the tsunami response funding for their things so you 're looking at this yeah I guess there 's some communities that are very well organized and there 's areas that are at risk that don 't have the same community infrastructure in terms of residents groups or some other yeah that they 're in a different they 've got different strengths so I just what I don 't see in that haven 't_''_9643.96 been as well organized or connected as if anything that you 're considering around the areas that may be more vulnerable because they don 't have active residents groups or neighborhood support or this this report as purely the implementation of the recommendations from the review so there wasn 't identified in the review there 's a action so this hasn 't addressed it but broader side of this implementation review as the team is looking at areas and also that 's something that our community development staff are looking at and it 's also something the community response fund is looking at about actually developing and supporting those local communities to develop to activate the communities and connect them so they can respond and do things such as community resilience plans and other responses and this the final question I think you mentioned it but I couldn 't find it in the report but are we doing I Drive past a school the other day that had an old sign that said you know faded yellow seedy sector post Oh are we doing any work around posts were the kind of Community Information hubs because I know we had a project and I thought in terms of lessons learned post earthquake there was a collaborative group of information community groups that gave us a lot of feedback about what worked well and what could be improved but I didn 't see any discrete action around reviewing those sectors posts all those like the other one I 'd say it 's the welfare Center like yeah but this is rising your question doesn 't arise from the tsunami event that 's where people went no no no no no because it doesn 't arise rise from bed because at that stage when we asked people to evacuate we hadn 't called a state of civil emergency so it 's not it doesn 't come to play there 's a whole lot of combined issues here but it 's a lesson lead from the Canterbury Earthquake sequence which is that the sector post sign outside the school hall means nothing yeah so and it might be actually a good idea to just take them down unless they are to that no let 's not stop tape and the welfare Center was method into the review yes let 's review yeah sure me and so we 're doing two things so I 'm looking at taking down the sector for science because I 'm under the new review and it is no longer it 's all been disestablished at place of that is the community hubs and the civil defense centers and we 're doing two things they 're identifying what are the other civil defense centers that we could potentially use but also looking at community hubs where communities can actually literally gather for their cup of tea to be with other people and working with this community to find those facilities I 'd also connect back to whatever the the the coordination function is because I think the real gap and and both September and February was that there was no way that the community could connect unless they were a sort of a recognized civil defense you know group within the structure set out by legislation rather than set up by the community yeah good all yes it has smear and counselor clear I 'll put that motion who is impaired to say hi though the place they know it 's Carrie and thank you both very very much it 's much appreciated big steps forward delegations and you are ma fees but this has come straight to Council but I 'm still gonna invite the video of the regulatory performance committee to introduce them no thank you this is a resume of some minor changes to the Resource Management Act and John hands briefly brought me up to speed with that yesterday that 's it just centers around a couple of change as well as say as permitted boundary applications which essentially allows someone to to build closer to a boundary provided they 've got the adjoining neighbors consent and the other one is marginal or temporary non-compliances which that one sort of went over my head of it John might have to elaborate this but essentially this would normally have gone to the regulatory performance committee but because these measures come into force on the 18th of October it 's coming straight to Council authority to implement the two new aspects of the Resource Management Act and allow staff the delegated authority to for recovery of fees which sit heaven here associated with these applications John may want to elaborate elaborate a little for what particularly pips on the marginal or temporary non-compliance side of it but that that 's a brief overview of we 're we 're we 're tracking thank you David I 'm John some I live in kick off it 's a bit of an overview okay um so there 's sort of two parts to the report and I do apologize for not going to committee fees but we in a bit of a conflicting advice from the ministry for the environment about time frames but there 's a bunch of changes that come into force on the 18th of October in some of those involved the two sets of new fees which is what David was referring to so we do want to get the fees and place as soon as possible as close to their 18th of October and we do have to do a special consultative 's the fees part of the report the other part of the report relates to delegations and it just perks up on the recent amendments to the Resource Management Act which has which we through about three or four months ago so we do need to change our delegations to reflect those legislative changes and again some of those will actually come into force today if you agree to the changes in others will come into force on the 18th of October and they 're outlined in the attachment for you to see their questions so I 'm not gonna move it I 'm happy to move David seconded by Sarah any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you annual planning contribution to crash X yacht club margin 25 this one is open port back to Council fulfilling a council resolutions so could I invite staff to present no just two I 'll give you a brief summary yep so it determine your queen some deliberation service discussion with regard to the contributions to supporting the York Club which is part it which is on this coastal pathway so the treats for budgets have contribution of 327 yes and going towards the traits port elements and the request was to support and some underfunding that they at the your club head to the order of two hundred thirty nine thousand so that was allowed for an annual plan and this report backers the options on how to Exim it which is either to provide them with a grant with no conditions or from negotiate a grant with the condition of hearing and during public access through that site down to the beach that 's it in a nutshell very good let 's see would you like to move this yes and who would like to see conduct Yanni any questions any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you so it was a great presentation ya know what everyone 's full II debated here off-street free parking Jamie 's just lifts the room what an idiot alright Jamie Jamie would you like to throughout the annual plan for staff to go and provide a report on numbers of free parking for people in the council off street carfax in central city the development forms essentially a JV committee with private private sector and councillors the paper is pretty straightforward and there 's been significant media interest I guess on that too so I won 't rehash that or debate its merits or in fact in the introduction there was robust consideration at the development forum and the recommendation was for one hour free parking to be provided and the council off street car bikes for four months coinciding with the opening of the new 800 space Litchfield carpet building in October so the development forum felt the the city needed help they felt that it was a good opportunity for the public to experience the new roading layouts help provide reasons to experience the central city again and they thought it would help the Central City we can 't become competitive with the free parking of the malls so there 's essentially four parts to this and the development forms recommending that all one hour free parking is trialed and implemented and that some wider work should occur around a possible extension considering a targeted rate or parking validation systems and finally that a joined-up approach is undertaken between both the council and the centricity businesses to promote this initiative and ensure there 's a consistent message so there are some time in considerations hence why this has come directly to council just because we think it makes perfect sense for it to coincide with the opening of the Litchfield car back hey goods and so would you like to move it yes I 'm happy to move the committee recommendation and you 'll second it are there any questions Yannick thank you for the report I just looking at the table on page 5.6 particularly 105 was so straight and Aldersgate have quite high levels of occupancy already and when testing as those are private spaces that we 've leased to provide car parking so we 're incurring the cost and I just wondered if you considered if there was an option just to make it the art gallery and the literal quite well and are bringing in some much-needed revenue to pay for the cost of providing them in the first place yeah Rolleston Eve has sung a number of spaces that are at least out there 25 lease spaces at and Wollaston air about one hundred and sixty-nine dollars per month but Worcester Street and Aldersgate don 't have any leased car parking spaces there but they are they do have an all-day rate on them so that 's why the occupancy is quite all day so sorry I just don 't understand why we would make those ones free for an hour if we 've got good occupancy because it doesn 't what we 're trying to do is accommodate short stay and try and promote people to come in to the Central City and use short stay parking so those spaces like we could fill the whole city up with commuter parking if we made every one of our sites a cheap all-day rate that doesn 't encourage people to come into the Central City to carry our activities during the day all you do is filling them point of view this is quite expensive scheme so with your Betty displacing people into other car parks yeah I mean I must have met that um are you are you sure that that converts or council-manager paid off street parking to short-stay are you sure that 's what you want to do I mean don 't we have contracts yeah and well we only have one site that has some leased car parts places on us too yeah no it 's Wallace Taniya well it 's what I made I 'm sorry lease right and leave those go with a month 's notice what ideally what we want and maybe we want to do that given that that whole site 's going to be developed I mean why go to all that trouble to muck up people with arrangements it 's not going to make a huge contribution to the issue so what we want to try and do is to make sure that short stay parking in the central city gets priority so ideally what we really want as a parking operations team is to keep the site got two sites and my original recommendation was to convert those two sites that are at very high occupancy Schwartz Dana because we know from our parking occupancy surveys and using our parking dashboard we 're demanders for short stay and we just need to have a little bit more short estate capacity in these locations so but it 's not gonna last when that whole site 's going to be closed for development at some point one on Roloson err yeah yeah that 's true but we don 't know exactly when they like what I don 't understand is there is there an issue with the lack of short-term parking in the Central City because it doesn 't I can 't see it from the report some locations in the central city where there 's more pressure on short stay and we have fairly accurate data that tells us which blocks in the Central City have high occupancy for short stay and we know that in some of those locations there are long stay or all-day commuter parking sites that could benefit the city by being converted to into account the new West End building that 's opened anything converters us the second question which was around the the marketing campaign and that we 've said this at approximately a hundred thousand and I just we 've really got a central city transport campaign underway we 've given the CCPA a huge amount of money to do central city campaigns how can we reduce the cost that 's proposed in here around it I have some certainty that it 's not going to be that much can we get dye up to the table on that one because it 's the marketing people that becomes people that have got to plan around there but there 's no way that it 's going to be a 100k so yeah so to the logic behind proposing a marketing campaign no no the discussions about the money I mean everyone agrees that we want to have a marketing campaign to get people buzzing bacon to the central city so we 're agreed on the outcome we 're not setting aside a hundred K to do this that 's a she died in no way will be spending a hundred K or marketing parking in the central city what we will do is we will have a campaign if this has passed and we 'll be doing it through very cost effective means such as social media and you know using our existing networks just fear literally of getting people back into the central city we 're working with partners such as Oh Takeru it can and also regenerate Christchurch on an overall campaign for the central city again no money has been approved or allocated for that I Croatian see it as involved also Central City Business Association is very involved but that 's sort of looking at events for the central city and it was something I think that I mean the business people have come and talked to us they 're very keen for this to happen but again no money has been allocated or committed to it so did you have a follow on question and the in the table and short page this is on page 3 a page 363 and in terms of the rates per much of a current disincentive those rates are there 's my first question and also though wondering can you tell us how those rates say compared with the central parts of other cities like for example Auckland or Melbourne yep so yeah we are about to review the rates and time for Litchfield Street building opening they haven 't been reviewed for a few years now what 's happening in Christchurch and it 's really difficult to compare a market and another location and say that we should apply the same regime here Oh can I just make a comment about the the offer or the suggestion to have a marketing campaign it wasn 't a suggestion to have a parking campaign marketing campaign it was a simple City marketing campaign and the reason for that was to offset the effects of providing one hour free to council only science because we 're going to draw people out of private parking facilities and if they don 't match share offer that 's right yeah yeah so I mean almost human that the market may respond anyway it 's okay just concerned about the quantum of money expended we were very clear that it 's not about telling people about parking it was about telling people about what 's going on in the central city and Vicky Dion Mike Jimmy it 's just a really simple question probably for Dave do we have an opening date for the little street kept up yes or no pasaran Tyrone okay 27 fall so I need to tell you they 're only this morning and the project manager advised us that there 's a risk to that date so I have to go away and just see what that risk is and we 'll be pushing hard to make sure we meet the date that we said that we were going to open up say that which is that 's now the 27th of October it 's possible I get my question yeah I 'm the total cost to do this over what the total I 'll go monthly cost the total monthly costs 135,000 for litchfield is that just the lost revenue or is that what I 'm trying to say is will revenue that they 're going to potentially generate from like run over something because it sound realistic to expect people to stay there for one year they 're going to stay for maybe an hour and a half or two hours of something so they will be living you coming in is there any idea about how much ribbon you may come in so that it actually offsets the cost that we 're seeing here because I mean this cost isn 't I mean there 's real but it 's for the luxury of it doesn 't exist at the moment so we 're not actually even generating an academy at the moment yeah that 's right we don 't have any baseline at the moment because we haven 't operated the building so we don 't know what people 's behaviors will be in here what might drive the use of the building we have only been able to estimate it so that that 's our best estimate that I 've put in that report our revenue figures for the building and when we calculated revenue for the building will be higher than what we 've currently estimated but we needed to make sure that we had you know and the right revenue equation against our costs for operating the build if we got a cost for pure on that yet we 've we 've had initial conversations we haven 't landed a cost okay yeah so sorry is it is it is it safe to assume that potentially would be cost neutral there from an outside versus if we operate this as a four-month trial and the trial is not extended then over the first 12 months we will cover our costs effort extends beyond four months then like there 's uncertainty around there it 's likely there we won 't recover operating costs for the building in its first year it 's possible that by the second year once occupancy is high and that we may start to recover cost but it just depends you in with it is this going to be for all spaces because they 're much is there any for the Litchfield street car park is there any leases that you 've got this we have a tenant that 's in the building as a small rental car company they 're taking ten spaces that they 're paying for em we also have 30 of the Yugo fleet vehicles in our building and they 're on a lease arrangement so all of the other car parks will be short stay well what we want to do is keep the building for so short stay will take priority and then we 'll offer along today parking offering that as the Schwartz state demand goes up we 'll start to reduce that long stay it has there been any detailed analysis on the cost or what the balance would be to keep this cost neutral between having the one hour free for short stays and then how many would we need to have as long stay or leased spaces just coming back I don 't think you can call us cost neutral it 's costing us 135 hundred fifty five thousand a month to give this you gotta appreciate that that our everyone goes that first hour so there 's no way it 's cost park we head in it in a middle e4 550 car parks 800 as we 've got we needed a revenue to cover our cost of 3,200 pure now this takes the first bite of everyone and if you have a turnover of say 4 people per car park and I think about when I go into town in the weekends I 'm there for usually over now but very seldom over a couple of hours by the time you wander around shop you 're taking that first kind of that 's the kind of cost that will cost so this costs are actual costs that all will cost to put this in however what we 're trying to do is to encourage the rebuild of their and if you look at the grow the benefit for that forget community and there that 's really where they immediately this is what 's respect Dave I mean this is a paper cost I mean it 's it 's it 's a paper cost they 're exercising and I mean I 'm just putting my my finance hat really there 's a amount of balance there we can actually make the it will could become cost neutral it 's not going to be that the paper here with a trial so and I think the advice that Stafford giving is is that they 're really reasonably certain if it remains a trial but not so certain in the first year of operation if it 's not because they don 't have baseline data for touch field street cause it 's not open yet so I mean I think I think you 've made a good point with your questioning but I 've really liked and then more question though what is there any reason why we couldn 't extinct what have this trial till the long term plan so that we can actually ask our communities why how they want this to be funded potentially it 's not a question for the staff that 's a question for debate I mean that 's what we 're here to decide is whether we proceed with the trial this was what was discussed at the development forum the development forum has referred a recommendation answer I would like to extend it out so the long-term plan that 's fine but we 've not went on debate we 're asking questions so Mike and Jimmy thank you I 'm I don 't know the feedback I actually get is is actually around the fact there people are having to pay for minutes not used so they 're going over there half an hour or an hour and they 'll get it I 'll charge that next half hour when they 're just there for another couple of minutes do we have the technology to actually install sang so you pay for the minutes used not four minutes not used and could that be actually put into this the show car parking building through an amendment to this resolution that we have in the building exactly has that capability if you park to the airport and that 's kind of how it works near so you 'll pay by the minute in the future if we implement an app we can do that for all of our parking so that the parking machines on the street can pay for but you know a system where you pay as you leave has the capability to to do that 's the only payment for the time that you 're there an app has a stop-start function so you pay for the time you part I just tried to clarify one thing when Aaron says if we yeah we 'll probably if we do it only for the first quarter of the year we 'll cover operating costs there 's operating costs our actual operating cost doesn 't cover principal and interest on the money that you have put in there so I just want to make clear that they are operating costs actual operating cost no not total I suppose so therefore would we need to include something today to sort of make that happen to actually start charging per minutes use not full minutes not used because I you can 't I can 't do this as part of this report I mean it 's we would require a report on it but we 're giving a report on the face hitting for litchfield so we could note that that it 's part of the report she come back of how the as charged will be over when you back a report on the technology used and the ability that we can do in different regimes that you 'll be bringing that back well anyway won 't_''_11351.899 you because you bringing a paper for setting the phaser touch field will have two years yeah yes so can we just put some where it does that it could be right down the bottom just just so number five mmm five notes as part of the report back on fee seating for Litchfield car park Litchfield Street car park but it will include different consideration calculating the charge is it that kind of pick it up right okay um Jimmy regarding to the paragraph read recommendation how much the additional cost to convert all the management pay off street parking to a short stay if a five weather is occurring the five the off street parking the facility and 363 the parking places all right how much additional cost we can put the cost compared to be reasonably sure the meters that are all programmable so the cost is reasonably insignificant to curtail them to from long term to shorten it 's a few notices we 've got those signs around so like I don 't we haven 't done a cost but it 's not actually a big cost okay thank you clean you know just wonder just curious how thus it 's worth our priority over encouraging active travel and especially around cycling so we 're providing an incentive over getting your vehicle in over this one but nothing better than that working on these games so so our objective is to convert people who are coming into the central city that 's been the day in here two different modes of travel we want people to still have a reasonably good choice around coming in to carry out daytime activities coming in to shop do business etc where they might be in you know for the sports day and that 's why we want to give some priority to shorts day they understand you know piping provision for cycles but a parking building I guess for well we 've committed to an eight hundred and five car park buildings and now we 've just got to decide what the best way to use that building is you know we can optimize its use the focus is on shorts today yeah not on Long 's day and yeah so that I can make this an actual question I 'm gonna say is it right that I 'm part of the purpose of us is to get people away from the on street parking that people have said that they rely on outside individual shops and get their behavior change so that if people do choose to drive their car they look for an off street option and that leaves us more Road space for things like cycle lanes and things I need there 's a very good question so it was equally a very good point so the initiatives that we want to use support there okay now because the paper itself sees a comprehensive marketing plan excluding television advertising as estimated to cost around at 100k I think that the councillors are looking for something that maybe we need the word cost-effective although you know cost-effective between a and joint so it says a cost effective joint Central City marketing campaign between private sectors use is that because I mean I don 't want any comfort taken that we are authorizing spending a hundred cake or not totally when I 've got the marketing you know when we 've sorted out what we 're going to do around comms from marketing I 'm very happy to bring it back so you can actually see what we 're doing yet yeah yeah good I think we 've probably got good people around the table who 'd love to you know contribute some ideas to just clarity on that are you taking out of existing budgets or is there additional funding that you 're seeking for that campaign there 's no budget set for it at the moment so I presume it will come out or well it 'll coming out of some budgets but really it 'll get offset by potentially revenue that we 're um getting in so it isn 't it sorry isn 't there crush agency there is a central city promotions closure that has gone to crush you Cynthia wouldn 't we be calling upon him I just don 't to spend any additional money given that we 've just given the CCPA a huge grant for exactly this sort of marketing and we 've got crushes and zero I 've got funds I can honestly reassure you show you that we will not be spending a heap of money on marketing on a parking Kim you know the spike in campaign we are looking at working with other partners on bringing you know a bit more life they can at the Central City and getting people to come under the Central City more but again know money 's been committed we 're looking at a key and around public transport in just some of these other partners as to what they 're doing so we can have a concerted effort instead of it being piecemeal between the partners we had again no I 'm a nice pink emotive and know many allowed for in crash you Cinzia as involved in those discussions since it wasn 't_''_11715.41 that for promotion when there are international or major events I 'm just trying to clarify so I know we did have a city promotions budget and that included events but it was that 's also around banners Christmas decorations or get sort of activity to the banners brew around like the golden oldies and things and rather than say well though we did put up banners for example to promote the West End and you know we have had other been yeah been a slight bit to you but I mean if you 're going to come back to us then maybe oh we have to resolve to no not yet I will almost done so if we could just turned editor and after the after the word count saw one number two just say in report back to Council with you know details in about it you know when they 're available so I 'm not we 're not putting pressure on but we 're just know that it 's a good wanna know what 's yeah yeah yeah cool all right so that right so who moved it you go do you want to set off the debate a lot of people on a talk oh hang on we 're gonna hear how we 're gonna have to move or move that the council result has been standing order 4.2 relating to the meeting duration to enable the meeting to sit continuously for longer than three hours without a 10-minute break yeah do I have a seconder Pauline I 'll put that motion all there is about as opposed they know that 's carried not we 're going straight into Peaks after this papers done so just reflect on that when you 're debating alright a few a few people are wanting to speak to that so just in the interest of time how about I reserve my right of reply that 's fine Dion and then who else was a Yanni Enfield um I would actually I don 't know how do we even do this but I actually want to sort of ask the counsel of will actually look at extending this out to the long term plane which is June do that is actually it gives some certainty to people in the central city that the central city is still evolving but there 's a long time where people can actually come in without their barriers that they 're starting to tell us and finished who are struggling with what you 're trying to achieve Queen there isn 't an amendment on the table to deal is that before you just sort of went home I don 't know how to do it but wouldn 't you put that into a review and three months if you want to move that this be held over for consideration and the long term plan then there 's no no no that 's not what I said I said I want this to be extended because what I 'd like to do is actually July 7th have it available now well it 's going to be open about November let 's think November that 's till March next year there 's a whole lot of stuff that opens anywhere on March next year Heights there 's there 's more to the retail precinct go through to the 31st Jay you have siddattha Joan yes yeah review is just I don 't think it 's I don 't think that 's giving the city enough boldness that our central city needs to actually say we 're gonna do this we 're committing to this to the long term plan however we need to have a conversation about how we do fund this yeah and I think the long term plan is the actual time where we do cuz I was at the development forum there were some discussions about different methods of funding us yes I know I was there yeah so the idea there and there for months we can look at those different options of funny but I don 't what I do not want to have is that we start looking at those things and there get implemented potentially in the long term plan or whatever it is when we look at that but between the period of March and June it just sort of sits in limbo and I don 't want that to happen I actually want there to going to happen which will be November right up until June when we actually really seriously look at this over there probably that period when we do go to consultation I don 't want that to sit in limbo land and people sort of get mixed messages about what we 're actually doing we do need to have a conversation about how this is funded but I want to make sure that our central city has some some seat and stone thing that this is what it 's going to be so that it the people understand that we get some good momentum in the city what you 're trying to achieve I 'm trying to help here I hadn 't appreciated that you wanted to do this by way of an amendment of the actual resolution rather than you know sorry I just miss what you 're trying no no no no what I 'm relying what I 'm trying to do is to find the appropriate weaving of an amendment to help the debate I guess what it 's saying is eight months and City four months okay four months to go to the to the end of June 2018 can I get the review that remains reporting back by the beginning of April I wondered to help Dion here I 've just realized he probably can 't move into me because he 's seeking baby substantive so is he could be suggesting in addition the only thing is I get a sense and I could be wrong that this is looking like it could go through you 're wanting to add a bit more to it and I don 't ever want to run the risk of biting off more than chilling in losing it so I don 't know if maybe you lien could suggest a way that Dion could test what he 's saying to see if there 's an appetite for their extinction to the 30th of June I 'm gonna hang on I may not get a second day yet I know that but can you help me out here I 'm just trying to deal with us 2 to the 30th of June with the with the review taking place within 4 building and I appreciate what Pauline saying about the review but what I 'm not going to I 'm just gonna say I 'm moving this as amendment do I have a seconder for this amendment that 's failed for the want of a seconder so now we 'll move to debate and bed as Dion okay snow the next speaker was Yanni and Phil and Pauline I can 't support this I would have thought that we should actually be looking at gallery and Litchfield and we 've just heard that lets you have Maine the opening when it 's hope scheduled so I think we 're going to get a report back on Litchfield charging anyway so why not do it as part of that we 've asked for more information around the marketing campaign there 's been a request to look at extending it for a longer period of time so I don 't see why we should rush this today if we 've got a few things that are still uncertain and we can get a better outcome but the one thing I know is that city to provide public car parking that has got good occupancy that we 're now going to be changing and giving an hour free parking on in it to me I think this should apply to council owned car parking buildings but not the sites that we 're privately owned and we 're paying a huge amount of money leasing and then having even greater subsidy going there 's sufficient off street parking in the Central City at the moment that is a fair question I think around what is the cost of some of that it 's quite hard to decipher sometimes in some of those buildings it 's not just things like the cost per hour it 's the Penal is that people pay if they overstay in some cases as well that have been quite hard on people so I think we should be looking at what we can do to make it easier for people to come to the Central City but this is a huge amount of money with a lot of uncertainty and there 's a lot of other things that we could be would suggest getting the roadworks finished first we the best thing we could do like Manchester Street Durham Street that would be a lot more attractive for people to come into the Central City than having to come in at the moment and being putting up with just complete incomprehensible legibility of where to go with a park where to turn so I think there 's some mirror and some of us but it should be much more limited I 'm fortunate this council was not in a position to keep offering public subsidies to these sorts of things and we have a limit with our finances and I can 't see why would we be excluding such a huge financial subsidy to to these off street parks that are potentially not on our own council buildings and Phil well I 'm also opposed to these resolutions or I actually think it 's unfortunate development community development forum didn 't consider the issue more widely the issue around attracting and inviting people into our city before we started with subsidizing the cap off street car parks and I think it of options or ways to achieve that really apart from the marketing part which in terms of report would be an addition to the current costs it seems to me that a marketing campaign itself leaving the set the the car parking subsidy aside may well have achieved similar objectives but the development forum didn 't ask us for that and I think that 's unfortunate so we 've really got no comparison to make it to make a decision on and I think it would be useful still in the future to explore other options in ways we can really develop air-air in the city so look one example might be in effect I would support that we keep car parking charges down so in fact they they don 't inhibit people from coming in it also references be made for recycling this is going to be starting in October in fact air sitting air city is encouraging in supporting by October but nothing like to the extent of this the subsidy would do we must support cycling as well will it be equivalent I doubt it and it months is going to cost set the the right pair 600,000 and his indications of a witty that this be extended if this is extended by popular demand to a year we 're talking about nearly two million dollars of rate payers money and with that in mind I cannot support these recommendations Pauline thank you originally I was not supportive but I really think that we do need to get people into our city and we do need to actually facilitate a shift a mental shift and the old attitude that we expectation that we have in Christ you because I can drive into town and park side the shop I want to go to in the next one in the next one so people are really I think a little bit resistant to parking buildings the ones I 've been into I 've found them pretty much empty I think this is a really good way to actually try and you know you know galvanize then get something happening there but I would not support it probably for an extension I think it 's good for a temporary people to discover the parking buildings to discover where they are and how to use them and just get their change in expectation what I am interested in to is this developing an app or something that people can readily find we have the vacant spaces are so they 're not driving around and of course the other thing with on street parking is they very hard to to access it them over with all the roadworks so on a temporary basis I 'll support this for today thank you Andrew thank you I think we need to get better at doing things rather than putting things off clearly there are businesses which have established in the Central City which would benefit from additional footfall there are people who would enjoy the Central City who would benefit from a real opportunity to come and experience the the Central City the way that it works now and a real reorientation and a reconnection with the central city and there are people that haven 't had the confidence to come and spend much time in the Central City even since the earthquakes this is a subsidy but it 's a subsidy using our own assets our own car parks which are owned by Council to bring about a benefit for the for the central city if we didn 't own those car parks we wouldn 't be able to do that it 's something we can do for a short time and I think it 's important that we remember that today we 're making a decision assuming we do to do this for a short time and energy sitting about an extension will be taken at that time I would hate for councillors to oppose this today because they don 't agree with an extension when we 're actually going to be making a separate decision about an extension at that time and I think the important point to make about any extension consideration is that we need to be using the four months of this trial or to capture good data so that we can make a well-informed decision at this time but what we 've got in front of us today as I see is an opportunity and an into town and reconnect with the central sitting clearly there 's an opportunity for the Central City businesses and there are some of those businesses absolutely need that opportunity but it 's an opportunity for the people of the city and to have an incentive to to come back and reconnect there 's a an education and behavioral change element I think to this as well preauth quake on street parking was was the norm post earthquake using parking buildings is the norm and that 's something that people perhaps need to have an incentive to have that experience to become used to where the parking buildings are how you get to them how you use them when you get there where the entrance is where the exit is all of that sort of thing just so that people get over the the change between on-street and off-street parking that they 've actually got the confidence to drive into that building and front up to the barrier knowing that they 're there confident to use that particular facility I actually think this is a really good idea I think the Christmas period and the summer period when the city would naturally be busy and we hope that this would make it busier gives us time to run a trial gives us time to capture the data that we need to have a really sensible conversation about whether this is something that we would want to continue beyond that or whether there are in fact other things we could be doing to help the regeneration and revitalization of the central city okay in ceará and I think that we actually need to take people along with us in terms of changing the dynamic of the central city we 're altering it so that it is prioritizes pedestrians bikes public transport but we need to ensure that people who live in the city actually feel confident about coming into the central city and had the chance to explore all that the central city has to offer I love the 30k speed limit in the central city because I find so much new and exciting that I couldn 't possibly be traveling any faster while I 'm looking at all the changes that people don 't feel so confident about where those car parking buildings are how they as Andrew said how those car parking buildings operate how you get from the car parking building to their shots or the coffee shop that you want to go to and I think it 's really important that we recognize that the Central City is the central city and we want people to be part of it so I like the short term nature of this it will take us into a Christmas shopping it will take us into summer times and into the buskers when a whole lot of people will be coming into town I think we are it actually to the people who 've been brave enough to develop in the central city particularly retail developers in the central city to actually make it easy for people to come in and explore all of the amazing things that the central city has to offer I tried the suit new supermarket that 's I 've opened by the bus exchange the other day and watch people coming in and out of the crossing 't realize that they were going to buy it 's such a lovely supermarket into the car several different journeys because there are lovely things that you will excel file in the central city that make it so worthwhile and I think we have a sort of a sort of Christchurch bias against paying for car parking and once we overcome that and become familiar with what 's here we will so want to come into the central city that the work will be done but I I really think in terms of helping the Central City after such a long period of not being as open and vibrant and available to people where 's that as we 've had I mean I was shocked when we opened imagination station and because we didn 't had any have any staff I had to work for the first week or 10 days and those people coming into imagination station had not been into the centricity at all and we 're still finding that I think it 's really important that we actually advertise the fact that it 's easy to get to come by car and yes there are options and yes it 's way worth the journey yep Sarah thank you um those who know me and follow my Facebook page will be really surprised that I 'm in favor of subsidizing parking because it 's not my normal behavior but it should I am in favor of this and I 'm in favor of four months that will see us through that Christmas and in buskers period for me the the key thing is about that behavior change in getting people away from the mindset that they need and on Street Park outside the shop that they visiting and into an off street car parking building is really important the key thing with litchfield street actually is that it 's really familiar you know people used to go and park at Litchfield Street pre quote they used to go into that inner space used to going into a car parking building there and once they 've done that in a familiar space they will work out they are the other car parking buildings that are are on offer the will be really useful it was it 's really interesting that some of the discussion is around the fact that some of the other car parking operators were concerned because they thought that an hour free at Litchfield Street would draw people away from a car parking building that might actually be closer to the shop that they want to go to and that means we 've actually come a long way because people are recognizing that people walk for a good offer you know you don 't go to a mall and park outside the shop you want to go to you drive around looking for a park and then you walk through the mall to the shop you want to go to and people will do that in town because the offering in town is really special hmm so having that behavior change getting people away from the mindset that they need a park on the street close to the shop into the Litchfield Street car parking building will be really really good we know from evidence all over the world that like a 5p or a Tenzing 75% and it 's a tiny amount of money imagine what a dollar is gonna do you know in our free parking once people get away from the mindset that they need to be on the street they 're gonna argue this about the removal of on street parking and so as we make our city more cycle friendly more pedestrian friendly people will be the least resistant to that and so that 's why I 'm in favor of this thank you I guess the lots already been said so I 'll be supporting this and it is a shame that we saw went to a bit of a s cycle vist car debate partway through this because I 'm fully supportive of cycleways and what we 're doing to actually move people in that direction but we need to be realistic and realized people need to drivers as well there is quite a large percent of people that will not be able to use bikes will not be able to use public transport and we 'll be using cars and and I have never ever thought that we of transport or two modes but actually just try and create a modal shift and realize that there is a demand and need for full car use it like councillor Templeton said what we need to do is actually incentivize people who have to drive into town to actually go into the car parking buildings and not use the on street car parks because once we get used to doing that then it 's going to be a lot easier to actually create a much more accessible City that 's free for walking and biking and we remove women remove these cars off the roads it 's happened overseas all over the place once they incentivize actual off street car parking the removal of on street car parking is actually really really easy so I 'll be supporting this it 's good to see it 's only for four months that we can evaluate and see how how it went when I look forward to seeing it Jamie do you wanna wrap yeah love to we we have a central city that right now is still one-quarter vacant you know we had a city that was in lockdown and it 's open now and whilst we 're not quite there yet we are moving in the right direction and I 'm really encouraged by it our city 's really world-class and there 's some very cool pockets already but people need to come in to experience it and I think that when they come into the city and triad it might pleasantly surprised them look 80% of people do travel by car that 's the today and it 's not to say that we can 't encourage ultimate modes of transport or that we can 't aspire to to change those habits over time but that doesn 't happen immediately and right now today it can never can never be an either-or otherwise we 've failed before we 've already begun I obviously strongly support this approach because the right thing to do it 'll help build back the habits of people returning to the central city it 'll help ensure that the car parking prices aren 't being gouged it 'll help build those habits for people to actually a park right outside where you want to go but to get off street and it will help introduce people to some new roading layouts that are in all honesty considerably different than what they used to be all from what a lot of people who may have been used to we have less car parking buildings council car parking buildings than we did pre quake in sadly it 's probably probably costing people more money to possum guard to park in the central city than it did before the earthquake as well so this isn 't carte blanche free like the suburbs it 's not even two hours free like it was pre earthquake but if we do our job right and the offers compelling in the central city you know I see that this as being something that could be even self-supporting is that the revenue recouped at the back end of it well hopefully offset the incentive or the cherry on top of at the beginning because if their offering is good you know hopefully people do so longer than 60 minutes and they come in here has to offer and stay for 2-3 hours so the priest ran a poll on the stage he had a really large response and it was 48 percent of respondents say yes they want one-hour free parking 47 percent said yes but they want more so that it 's 95 percent support this is what our people want 5 percent of respondents said no it 's not fear on the private car parking operators so yes this does mean the food park e food party parking operators will have to lower their prices to remain competitive so funnily enough although not unanimous the majority of even the car parking operators supported us as they appreciated the greater good and they felt that this would be good for Christchurch and good for everyone as it grows the pie so my view is that we always need to be looking at the greater good you know and for a central city to work we need people to come in and experience it so this isn 't a silver bullet it 's a simple initiative but don 't underestimate the difference that I the central city if you prove this it will ensure that a full report comes back to us about whether or not it could be 16 extended it will have a baseline that will be established within these four months so we 've got some real data to work with you know and like I said this this allows people to change the habits of coming back into town it helps create a reason for people to come back and to change the perception that you just need to park right outside the shop so I say give price future Christmas present of one hour free parking for the city and also I think it shows real support and backing to all those brave people that really took a punt against all the naysayers and some of those naysayers were professional institutions that told them not to go into the central city hall that wouldn 't fund them to come into the central city you know I think there are a tremendous number of real heroes in Christchurch post-earthquake in the commercial space and a good chunk of those have Central City and they 've done it tough so I think gives us a go and I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised great I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they know and abstentions so though abstention opposed yawning that 's lobby that 's carried thank you very much I 'd like to now move that we go into the px ' part of the agenda with rob hall of development Christchurch remaining for the progress report that was referred to earlier I 'll move that seconded by Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed so no that 's carrot good work everyone one o 'clock so we 'll be back here at 2 o 'clock you _"

    "text": "and I will just quickly introduce this that it seemed to me when I became near that there wasn 't a structure and place there automatically switched on in a post event environment in order to conduct a review of what had occurred and regardless of the success or or perception of of otherwise it 's really important that we do there after every single event and we have had our fair share of of these but that we we 've had to review and I actually believe that we 're getting visa it 's putting in place the the mechanisms for reviewing events after they occur and one of the things that we 've done is is to ensure that when the review is done that we actually speak to a broad range of people that have had some involvement and and managing or responding to the event and and then bringing together the recommendations about what we might do to improve in the future but more importantly to embed that into both action plans or into standard practice for the future and I honestly believe that this is to major events and I 'm thinking of the Canterbury Earthquake sequence as the glaring example of where individual organizations have reviewed events from their perspective but there still hasn 't been the the sort of Senator synergistic what 's the right word yeah but the bringing giver of all of those in order to develop a really a lessons learned that then gets built into the national framework into the local frameworks throughout the country so there are some incredibly positive things that we learned from the Canterbury Earthquake sequence and we 've seen some of them implemented and Kokoda so the obviously the the that the funds that was made available to businesses so that they could continue to pay staff at a time when there was a high degree of uncertainty you know that that 's like gold after the Canterbury earthquakes the government also set up a fund which enabled exporters to go overseas and actually reassure quite quite troubled and worried markets and great degree of reassurance that some of our exporters could give directly by fronting up and talking through the challenges that they to the to the supply chain and with just-in-time supply chains it 's you know it was hugely challenging for a lot of exporters it was gold it was a magic thing for the government to do but there are other things that were done that I would regard as not best practice and something that do need to be investigated and you know I guess that 's in an election year it 's not a good year to be looking at what you got wrong and so you know as soon as this is out of the way it 's something that I think we really do need to focus on because you learn I personally think more from your mistakes than you do from your successes and you really don 't want to see them repeated elsewhere by look at what happened in Wellington with with this particular earthquake that that that 's sparked off this review and I remember reading in the paper a headline that said that you know the most earthquake-prone streets had dodged a bullet and I really fear that there is a belief you 're not so I can see some of the concerns that were evident after the September 8th quake leading to some of the more contribution to some of the events after the February earthquake we really do need to learn those lessons and make sure that they are embedded not just in Christchurch but across the nation so I 'm really appreciative of this report I 'm very happy to to move it and and and fall second it and now I 'll hand over to Mary to speak to the to the to the report generally [Music] so they 're just to pick up on what the mere said is that we do now have a very structured and full so after every event within three months we are aiming to door of your enter corrective action report and make sure that what we 're going from that has implemented and flowed on to future events and also the activities in between for our larger events such as this we as you know we did a full external review and develop this implementation plan so that we can but also learn from what 's happened and other events for our sports you know of scene hopefully the lessons that were learned from this this event and the fire event by what we did in the flooding event which was totally different in terms of how we wanted to improve that communication both to affected parties and more end people in more generally the way we OC was managed and operated and also how we actually had people out on the ground at all times to particularly those first few days so residents had somebody to see and connect with and also how we ensured our contractors response teams and everybody that interacted had the same visitors to give to people so those were things that have hopefully improved since these but today we 're actually talking about this implementation plan we had research that you wanted a structure from your pre booth this morning you wanted a structural diagram we went a hundred percent sure what you meant by that but what was good this data for the board which just outlines walking through from that we had that was done extremely of the CDM team and then the cerium team have worked with others to develop the implementation plan and it 's probably appropriate that I hand over to Sonali who 's a I 'd work on this to walk through those the key elements in mutation plan thank you and good morning so if I was to which is the sirens what we 're really looking to do here is review how we 're going to use sirens in an event and coincide combine it with the key public messages and resources that we have so for example how women used to write the sirens in relation to the evacuation zones but also look at other communication ways for looking at voice capability and for science and we 're going through the process of reviewing that and what 's the best option for the communities that they 're building on that is the evacuation plan humm three prongs that is looking at how we can update the technical side on tsunami evacuation zones but also the maps and the modeling that has gone into it so details and align it with our national standards but also relating that to the community side how we can work with communities to get the best information out in the way that they see fit and how we can work with the communities to get the messages out in their neck of the woods and one of the things that we 're working at the moment is looking at specifically tsunami evacuation planning so working with communities and community boards in our community development advisors just prepare the community on some of the specific actions that we can take to help and enable the community to look after themselves better and building on that is a community response resilience plans and that encompasses other hazards as well as tsunamis which builds on two operational side which is the Emergency Operations Center and as Mary said before and following the July event we 've incorporated a lot of the recommendation that has come out from operations point of view and for example having the staff training having people on the ground consistent public messaging so everyone got the same message and defense centers so we look at that taking a stocktake of what we need in the civil defense centers identifying what are the other buildings and and services that we can use as civil defense centers and and encompassing that with volunteer training so who are the volunteers they can be other civil defense training and and and how we can scale them and give them that opportunity and lastly it 's the communication which is about registration so if you 've got evacuates how we can register them with as we 've done in the July floods and give them that opportunity and also the public messages it just keeps coming back to it how we can get communication methods out in more than one ways so the public feels informed they get in the up-to-date information and they are feeling reassured and we 've also aligned this with the Macomb national messaging so everything speeds up words and they 're all streamlined with us so we haven 't gone through it 's okay because implementation plans quite long so those are reporting back on giving a sort of for that will the committee asked for that to be earlier rather than waiting till next year which some of these have you know 2018 june 28 een for delivery but I thought we 'd have requested a report back oh yeah no sorry I was looking at ours we recommended a report back on progress by the end of 2017 and with requests to further report on tsunami siren options and include information on tsunami risks because I mean I I still think that that was a you know that was a that 's an area where we need to get right I mean if we 're going to have tsunami sirens then we 've got to be voice voice command because if you don 't tell people why they 're hearing a siren then that 's that can be meaningless you can educate as much as you like but if people are in a state of panic and we have to get people to rely on the long strong get gone so people don 't have to wait but what we don 't want is 20,000 people jumping evacuation plan plans have to be local and they have to be owned by the community and well understood and that means that weird people have to go to has to be well understood as well because and that 's my inevitable from frustration with mcdhh in who says long strong get gone as far as you possibly can oh well I 'm sorry but that 's I think we 've got to change the message to as far as necessary and people need to understand what that means in each locality because they will mean different things if you 're up at all they 'll mean different things of that if you 're you know outside the the area of risk and I think there needs to be much better understanding about what the risks are in terms of local regional and nationally generators you know the other side of the world generated tsunami what the risks are and what the timeframes are in terms of response because you know I guess this I mean nobody wants to leave the shelter of their home and then sit on the wars because they 're stuck in traffic and the the neighbor who has no method no way of hearing this an army siren because the you know sort of partially deaf and and has no idea that this is going on and nobody 's knocked on a door or rang her doorbell flesh delights or whatever to get her out of bed you know it 's just you know so there 's so much that needs to be done at the local level to make this meaningful and the other thing is is that we 've focused here on civil defense centers but there are some areas that won 't have civil defense centers because they 've got something that 's way better and way more community and better to you know like the little term project and places like that so they can you know civil defense centers or appropriate local yeah facilities or things so David 's you 've got your hand up Phil Jonnie um thank you look I 'll endorse everything that the mayor has just said and and one of the the big issues to you say good on their cows and disappear to DA field or or further and so in the evolving development of this plan I think I have seen some preliminary mapping but it would be very helpful to to say if you live in this area here that is advisable you know the long strong get gone you need to move beyond orange acres here okay might I might high school very Len wet or beta yes the the the sheer geography of of their coastline and the limited access egress points that would have included a walkout and place of segment right some people should have should have yeah and it 's just created endless traffic jams and a lot of people look probably didn 't need to move to and created all sorts of pandemonium for the rest the other area I think is actually the the use of the saurons themselves and not who support the ends analysis there that they were put in primarily for the long distance earthquake event and really when they were turned on and this event if we had had a that time the sirens were even turned on so we need to look at that sort of methodology as well as looking at the short short the local event as opposed to the long-term event and when we use the sirens and thirdly at a local level we had an annual meeting for one of the residents group the North Shore residents group recently were in the last couple of months and there was a presentation given by a staff member from he came name escapes me at the moment but it was probably the best tsunami presentation that I have seen which clearly sort of differentiate people that close event scenario right through to the Chilean scenario scenario and and I think a lot funnier at what her name was but certainly a presentation that needs to be wider delivered and the understandings of that delivery I would say it would go a long way to reinforcing what you are trying to develop here so I 'd like to commend what you 've done so far but you know there are some areas I think that we could really firm we would react in terms of tsunami sort of varying location origin so great work so far and I just like to see some of those other things so thank you for then just just in response the evacuation planning is going to include the wind where where to go to and how to get there and and working with the police about transport planning to help is to effectively move people out the sewing report will come back on those issues you raised about the sirens and sirens and using them for different events and the team is working quite closely with Marian from ekn and sometimes doing joint wish you pretty it 's tough when we work so you went green with your excellent presentation yeah it 's great yep well it might be a good idea to get that presentation in front of a council and a live-streaming session but also to actually do a video of it and get it online because both those sorts of presentations are like gold and if people can just you know watch it when it suits them and and absorb that 's great great for 2013 eonni thanks for all this really and David is referred to you know like a community meeting where people really involved with some good information and I just really want to ask you and the whole theme of working with communities so in terms of the preparedness plans and just how we get there in terms of you know I guess it 's and this clear reference for involvement of community boards in presumably I 'm just presume you know and that there 's is the potential here for a whole community development project so that in fact this whole area of preparedness is really targeted by us as a council so in fact yeah I guess we have all of our community engagement and community development people on board what their community 's regarding this there are three people in the community resilience team and civil defense but they 're working quite closely innovates were met with the Community Development advisors and community governance so that actually can be a Costco joint team response that can work on this but also in different of the community do you go to it yes it 's really working with the other community groups as well and so everybody coming to the table and understanding what that risk is and and using the resources that we already had in a community to look after ourselves and getting that shared perspective I think is really important so we are definitely planning to bring other community groups community boards as well as please yep sorry um yummy um thank you just wanted where the fundings coming from to do this and if there 's any funding available for those community groups to be involved in developing community resilience plans so so and there 's said some resources within the community development team in terms of this community of resilience workers here to work with communities and some of the Community Development advisors will also be doing that but there are also resources available that will support some of the initiatives that had come out from local communities with the community resilience plans and we 're looking at other ways to get more resources for that so as a if already done one a belfast already doing one and other communities through so they often come up with initiatives that they want to run themselves and resources such as booklets or posters so there 's some limited resources for that and we looking at we I think the starter Bubba Wallace project say are you able to give some relief to the community boards that are funding some of these resilience plans yes well we will discuss with your community governance managers about which what community residents projects you 're having brought into the community boards and look at we have for those two give them to one package or one stream of funding into their community service recipients area so we 'll talk more talk to your teams and find out what 's coming in and how we can pull those together we weren 't aware that you were being asked attacking a board level for funding for community resilience clearance so commlite gets the money back for Europe you know energy board so stop tugging yeah so we 'll do some work and develop a response for 've met with with you on a number of occasions i am i understanding was that they were getting funding from Red Cross that 's the advice I got just a couple of days ago so they weren 't asking Council for money no not think that you 'll find it there was a resolution from the funding report unto them to see if there was money attached to the tsunami response funding for that thing so you 're looking at this need yeah I guess there 's some communities that are very well organized and there 's areas that are at risk that don 't have the same community infrastructure in terms of residents groups or some other yeah that they 're in a different they 've got different strengths so I just what I don 't see in here as a kind of plan to target those areas that haven 't_''_1456.94 been as well organized or connected as if anything that you 're considering around the areas that may be more vulnerable because they don 't have active residents groups or neighborhood support or this this report as that wasn 't identified in the review there 's a action so this hasn 't registered but broader it outside of this implementation review as the team is looking at areas and also that 's something that our Community Development staff are looking at and it 's also something the community response fund is looking at about actually developing and supporting those local communities to develop to activate the communities and connect them so they can respond and do things such as community resilience plans and other responses and this the final question I think you mentioned it but I couldn 't find it in the report but are we doing I Drive past a school the other day that had an old sign that said you know faded yellow CD sector post oh are we doing any work around the hole here that we are other civil defense sector posts were the kind of Community Information hubs because I know we had a project and I thought in terms of lessons weren 't posted earthquake there was a collaborative group of information community groups that gave us a lot improved but I didn 't see any discrete action around reviewing those sectors posts all those like the other one I 'd say it 's the welfare Center right yeah but this is rising your question doesn 't arise from the tsunami event that 's where people went no no no no no no because it doesn 't arise arise from there because at that stage when we ask people to evacuate we hadn 't called a state of civil emergency so it 's not it doesn 't come to play there 's a whole lot of combined issues here but it 's a lesson lead from the Canterbury Earthquake sequence which is that the sector post sign outside the school wall means nothing yeah so and it might be actually a good idea to just take them down unless they are genuinely civil defense sector posts but but can you respond to that well it 's an idea stalked a physician and the welfare Center was given to the reviewers yes this review yes you 're looking at taking down the sector first science because them under the new disestablished at place of that is the community hubs and the civil defense centers and we 're doing two things they 're identifying one of the other civil defense centers that we could potentially use but also looking at community hubs where communities can actually literally gather for their cup of tea to be with other people and working with those communities to find those facilities but also connect back to whatever the the coordination function is because I think the real gap and and both September and February was that there was no way that the community could connect unless they were a sort of a recognized civil defense you know group within the structure set out by legislation rather than set up by the community yeah good all right well it 's been moved in cylinders is it right here sit here smear and cancel at Clearwater I 'll put that motion who is impaired to say I know the place they know it 's Carrie and thank you both very very much _"

Polaroid Reserve and the corridor access requests which are when people dig holes in the road were limited in terms of the conditions we put on those but obviously when we review them when we do review the impact on adjacent property and can put conditions on whoever holds that permit to abide by but that wouldn 't extend as far as the conditions we were put company like kinetics etc that 's a contractual arrangement between them and whoever 's doing the work for them but they would be expected to comply with any conditions that are on would you ever consent they get do we look at that 's right the time of year in which they propose to do the work and whether it 's reasonable to do it eg a construction program over the middle of winter when temperatures mean that it 's a lot less likely that you can do the work in the time again we are limited by the corridor access legislation and in terms of service providers week we are basically just custodians of the road corridor in that environment and we are required by that legislation not to impede on this on complete the service providers using our road reserve look I realize you still live under an increasingly health and safety oriented environment but I 'm just interested with a lot of our road weeks that 's been a tendency for contractors to put out the equipment and their roads towns and everything and then they might other thing is we will have half a kilometer of cones for a very small bit of work how will we managing that sort of process at the moment the overkill of of Road canes in relation to the size of the project and in the previous two times of setting things up and then not doing anything today 's survey sea talk are increasingly working with the applicants to utilize proactive traffic management and which really is exactly what you described rather than just setting out the worst case scenario and then leaving it there for six weeks being proactive about reducing it when it 's not necessary touch-tones as weekends and we 've had recently we 've had complaints because of signs being left on the side of the road face down and so on that was a result of that proactive management that that contractor would in it just turned all the signs round of the weekend I guess it Wilson fully understood the reasoning behind it but certainly see talk are more working with contractors about putting that extra effort into changing the arrangements when it have to be mindful that there are hazards motorists on the site even though the workers might not be there there were still open trenches and so on so we can 't_''_373.85 so there 's the two aspects to the health and safety side there 's the safety of that workers and the safety of the road uses they have to bear in mind now hopefully we can get over the overkill at times you mean my lives several hundred meters of cones for a small road repair and the middle of just yeah yeah a bit frustrating at times right again the contractors have their own health and safety plans we try and work with them a bit is their responsibility and so frequently lays the the handbook of temporary traffic management is seen as I carry of a good practice throughout the country so a lot of contractors are reticent to go below those recommendations because it might expose them to risk should there be an event of some 400 you are not laid off I was certainly very comfortable with the Committee 's recommendation on this I we know has been a big problem I also think it 's important that we look at this in in different context as well we 've heard a lot recently around the way that roadworks have impacted in the central sitting but of course suburban projects are also significant when it comes to the effect of roadworks on small businesses I 'm comfortable that we can pick this up through the procurement processes uncomfortable that we can work proactively with businesses the solution for one business might be quite different to the solution for another in terms of alternative parking or what excesses are needed and there may be things that we can work in around times of day there may be businesses which are busier in the evenings and there 's something that we can do while the roadworks are actually not taking place so this certainly allowed us to have a very good discussion about something which has been a high profile issue at the committee and I think we 've got to a reasonably pragmatic solution and I certainly be looking forward to getting those report backs can continue to monitor the way that this is working a deal make sure we just go one lit before I start eco something that council arrest was just saying that on say necessary over the last weekend there is a small work site and on the footpath and they closed off the entire road and made it one way because there was a small hole there 's a long ice jail no it 's not a part of the street that 's opposed to where I live so I actually had to go it was really it was actually really annoying because they closed off the entire street made one small spot just to do a footpath little hole and it was covered over by a piece of metal and lift but the whole weekend these things are actually happening in our city and it actually is absolutely disgraceful that that disruption that the stuff causes for people when it actually common sense makes it just seem unreasonable and that 's where unreasonable maybe needs a bit of definition this is this is a compromise from my point of how we deal with roadworks and the works on our street I still would like to go further so that from my point of view this won 't be the end I 'm still going to research some of these like rental systems that they use it around the other parts of the world to actually say what does a road corridor or public use corridor do piyo rental that 's the important to the team des processes and you know just the money go around but it incentivizes people to get these things done fast and decent devises and to do them smoothly so it 's not the end of the it 's not the end for me but there 's more work to do for me behind the scenes and whatnot but this doesn 't necessarily also excuse me this doesn 't also we take into consideration the other people the other parties who are doing work on our roads at the moment and the two big ones in Christchurch that are caused probably the most disruption and it 's probably going to create a recovery on top are revolting and I 'm surprised that there has been a lobby I 'm surprised there hasn 't been a revolt on the time it 's taken to do those two roads like driving down Manchester Street I look at the plate I 've got plans I mean I 'm in a privileged position I could look at the plan and try and work it out but for every you know many people you drive down there you just have no idea what 's going on and it 's taken so long it 's been a year and a half that the end roads been closed I mean to two-way traffic this doesn 't go as far to address that issue and that 's where I think the sort of if we looked at a rental system in the future that would actually address those kind of system that that problem but that organization needs to go on notice to get that work done because it is starting to upset our see the Herefords streetcar part that we will talk about later has 52 people on the we keep going it 's just not all and that 's what they 've been saying down the the people who are in the heritage streetcar part because of all the roadworks and stuff around there they just don 't know how to get to these places and for having that there for a year and a half has just not on and it can 't happen in our city ever again but so this goes an alleyway to starting doing that from our own perspective so it 's good to sort of get our own camp in a good place but would need to take responsibility for the other users that are using the roadways and actually doing this disruption and I support myself thank you Yani yeah I agree with the comments that have been made I think we really do need to to look at how we can improve and I know you know that oh and maybe it 's a communication thing because I mean there 's another article that record and Road and people just don 't get a sense of contractors working when maybe there 's reasons to coke or whatever it is there is a frustration like councilor ace and councilor swigs and races is that people see a whole bunch of stuff blocked off and then very little activity and it 's been something that you know I think we if we can improve it through the communication about why things aren 't happening if they 're not or if things aren 't happening and we 're monitoring it more to make sure that more things do happen then that will be hopefully a better outcome I I too can continue I 'll work with councillor swags over to because I do think we at some stage need to consider where businesses are being unreasonably affected by delays to roadworks that there should be some maker for in you know cases of hardship that they can actually apply for some relief and certainly some of the stories that I 've seen post-earthquake it wasn 't the earthquake that did the damage but it was the roadworks that put some businesses to huge financial pressure because of the length of time taken just to do what I think it 's a good start and awesome and Jamie and Rick cheese I 'll be quick with this but I just wanted to say that you know very seldom does chucking money blindly at something ever sold whatnot and I think that the recommendations and three are really what is going to make the difference and it 's about communication and collaboration and they 're not just buzzwords but they 're the answers to to a genuine question and whilst we share these frustrations the answer is not robbing Peter to pay Peter because these businesses are ratepayers so whilst taking money you know from from the same person and giving it to the mckeon I think it 's a nonsense I think you know the the other issue around this is definition if we want to go if we wanted to go down a track of like I see the robbing Peter to pay Peter Road then you 'd essentially be trying to define what is affected by the earthquake you know is there anyone that that hasn 't been affected by the earthquake and I would that you know hit hasn 't been adversely impacted as a result of the quakes so I think there is an answer to this and it 's about doing things smarter in doing things in partnership with the community but I think we 've gots a pragmatic seat set of recommendations there and I think it 's a better way to go because the the blindly checking money at things as just would be a very dangerous precedence and I don 't think it would solve anything right yeah I mean I think the key here and the feedback I 've had from businesses especially around dharm Street is communication so we can 't rely on just popping information into a letterbox we have to make sure that we speak to everybody who is potentially affected that 's really important and second him in terms of the the penalty aspect I mean there is room to consider it maybe there 's Dion and Yana have mentioned that when we let contracts around works that when we look at things like penalty clauses this could be part of a penalty clause projects going to take the businesses that are affected understand how long it 's going to take and are okay with that but if it goes beyond that there needs to be some kind of penalty so we have penalties for contracts over running and perhaps compensation could be part of the penalty clauses around contracts that 's something that I think is worth looking at now Tim I 'm a lot of the feed bit and it rips through our so Jamie you can 't throw money at something solve it because I think there are some issues with some of our streets with regards to finding surprises when you you lift up the road and some of our streets are like old houses when you kind of buy an old house and you do it up you never pull down a wall say oh surprise it 's better than I thought it just doesn 't happen so I 'm but I will mention a staff member in my area and some others Ross here it was absolutely outstanding and I 've had fantastic feedback because it does come when things have gone wrong or when things have been discovered that weren 't there like Tran checks you would think that we would know where all the old trim checks are but surprise we don 't_''_991.54 that that their debt communication and I have to say that the staff member Ross hereit has been absolutely outstanding in their area so I think if we can find a mentor or someone that can guide their which we have at our hands that would be the way to go forward the penalties can only work when there has been a delay that should not have been to put on fear timelines on something then there 's been a surprise that just doesn 't work so thank you Becky I wonder if we could just as a very simple mechanism do the communication do you recall we looked at changing the tone of our communication so that we weren 't bossy and we were actually telling people why we were doing something so for example Rickson Road which has been dug up for I don 't know what year we started work areas that we could put a sign that says we 're digging up the road because the water pipes underneath a 98 years old and really in danger of collapsing and we really want you to have a really good water supply and waste water and sewage but we haven 't told people that along the way so so a lot of people just get frustrated and I wonder just where we are actually in front of people 's businesses houses on particularly on very busy roads if we could just tell them for a start why we 're doing it because there are very good reasons why we 're doing it but we tend to keep them slightly secret and I wonder if we just couldn 't get I 'm sure some people have got some old election posters oh you 've got some I just want to kind of wrap up the the debate Oh Mike I guess after so many years we 're all now suffering a lot of rebuild fatigue it 's very clear obviously that although we 're running the city there 's obviously other of Jesus Street and Cambridge Terrace which has actually caused a lot of their frustration with and with in Christchurch and I think everyone probably around this council chamber has been absolutely frustrated of what we 've been through and what the city 's been through but in terms of some of the actual projects that we 've been delivering especially around my ward with the cycleway the council staff have gone to great efforts to actually work with the businesses affected and I know everyone is not happy and but they did do a lot of work and they tried to provide parking wherever possible and I think really we the people of you just need to have a look at these businesses that are been affected and perhaps if you need to park 20 metres away from them to go to it still Park there and walk yeah I think this is a problem we 've got to in society where we just become lazy and if we can 't park outside of business we just won 't go to it well these businesses need our support so using them just Park and walk to the business yeah well debate now and I just wanted to say that I mean it was interesting when this came to finance and performance it wasn 't a unanimous vote but what we did round the table was I think work with staff to come up with some recommendations that we could bring to council it became very clear during the discussion that the solution to the big problem is own procurement policy and that 's still coming back to council and within that I mean Dion has raised the issue of the the rental mechanism which is how it 's done in the UK and some big projects and in you know I think that all of these options are worthy to explore in that context so it 's kind of like this really focuses on the communication but also lifts the ongoing question of disruption and the public realm into a governance monitoring role in a much clearer way than it was before so it 's been a really good outcome that this was brought to the table that we think we can agree to a pathway forward and it won 't take our city forward so thanks to those that originally raised it so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "right the next item on the agenda is the Heritage incentive grant approval for the former st. Luke 's for a package one eight five formal Street Christchurch it 's been to the social and Community Development Committee site and fight feel clear bullets to introduce this item not happy to introduce it and I 'm sure the staff will comment on it too and answer any questions but like it 's clear for in the report that in fact at the committee level this was a tied vote in terms of the of the of supporting application I just want to refer to the fact that at yesterday 's can committee meeting we had discussion around this the the review in a review of the fund and a discussion around the strategy and while the a summary aspects including accessibility which might impact on this application in fact it 's essential that because the application was made under the existing criteria that we deal with it that way under the current criteria so I just think it 's important that we in making a decision keep that in mind Christian I think raised Brynden in relation to the the funding table just to clarify that that was the only point of clarification prep said I needed it was just the date of that funding table I guess that on the two tables the financial implications the first one is in under point six point seven it 's just those those last figures the total available funds the figure there is is is 2016-17 it should be 1718 it 's that there 's mistake yes and that 's absolutely the same on table in 7.1 so apologies for that enough just thank you step 3 sorry a little no to focus on central government funding in different funding options rather than just looking at the funding option that that 's in front of us my advice is that this particular building has applied for a grant from the Canterbury Earthquake heritage buildings fund but were unsuccessful as the fund decided to allocate all the remaining funds they had to one project only rather than to several separate projects so that fund appears to be now exhausted the second was the not eligible for funding from this fund as they 're not on councils earthquake-prone building list as this list only relates to commercial buildings that right yep and so the third fund as the Heritage New Zealand will hear a Tangra grant funding which the owners applied to about the same time as they apply to us and they 've just been awarded 60,000 from hnz DPT towards their project so would date given that they 've only just been awarded that would that impact on the recommendation that you 're making to council today no because the the funding that they are seeking from us is still relatively low percentage-wise of the works that they 're actually doing they 're doing something in the order of 1.2 million dollars worth of work they didn 't apply through discussions they knew that they weren 't gonna be able to apply for 50% of that that degree of of a funding so they they were quite selective as to what they put forward for funding so the the 200,000 approx there were we 're supporting here is is still much lower would have we have the ability to fold up to 50% but this is something like 26% but say that the granting presumably you didn 't know about the 60,000 being granted that you knew that they were applying to other fans so but it so it makes no difference to your recommendation okay other questions Yanni if we were to reduce the grant to a hundred thousand in light of the other funding commitments we have on so the other funding pressures we have on the heritage cards what would be the covenants that we could expect well yes you would drop from a full covenant down to a limited covenant so you would have to put a time limit on that usually it 's around 20 years somewhere between 10 and 20 years whereas with the grant of over 150 you get a covenant as in perpetuity right so in terms of the government funding is there any requirement that your we 're off to have a covenant attached to their funding I 'm not aware of any covenants are usually between the council under allocate and the amount that we could expect the cover would be 150 yes covenant there is a partial Kevin it 's time limited for any uni and grant and they are they are different covenants the wording is not the same a limited covenant is not as as all-encompassing as a full covenant hang on Mike okay um so if we were not to fund this project what would happen to it would it continue and be completed or Waterfall qualified to answer that question it 's a it 's a question for the owners so now the question cuz obviously this is a significant amount 200,000 once this property was completed the works and the owners the electrons received the ground could they then just sell that property on without any combat covenant is in perpetuity so it remains what 's the property it isn 't it it isn 't it 's it 's on the title and I understand that but it basically means tentatively they could sell that property for the money that it cost to do the full works and potentially just put that 200,000 in their back ten about their potential for doing it but that 's the same with any grant awarded this is a significant grant 200,000 yes but as we said percentage-wise it 's it 's they 're they 're investing 1.2 million give us two hundred thousand dollars of rate payers money it 's on your side potentially they could do the work and then sell the property and their two hundred thousand dollars could go in their back pocket of rate payers money they 've done the work I think it 's important give you as that if they 've done the work they 're two hundred thousand dollars of rate payers money has protected heritage because the building will have been seismically strengthened it will have had all of that upgrade provided for heritage protection is seeking I 'm not disagreeing with it I 'm just looking at how much made with funding and the potential outcome of that for these people yeah and I fell I 'm happy to move the staff recommendations that 's all it wasn 't sure there other questions yeah we would do questions first AMD looking at giving them what was it the other stuff that they were talking about that they were looking to do to actually make sure that public are able to view the Heritage fabric of this building that was their other stuff that they 're looking at doing like helping make sure that the vision or the visual effect of the building they 're still been able to things seen by cool more straighter than that yeah it 's not seen as a key issue that then remains that you can use to to preserve that the visibility between the road and the building so we could we could put items in the Covenant there is a a portion of the Covenant which allows you to put things in like that that would allow protection of of the visibility and on obviously that requires the agreement of the owner it 's a covenant is a an agreement between two parties and so they would have to agree to that as well obviously they they would have to weigh up the benefits of whatever restrictions there are in the Covenant to we hope we have done that before I mean other than building that 's actually keeping the you know from the roadside that they 've you know it 's very much a part of a grant process well I mean this is this is a beautiful building from from kill Wall Street and from a heritage perspective it 's a very important building for the city and I 'm just wondering if we can give a steer to that effect somehow but I don 't know the process to me how to do that so um it would you could be specific in to the recommendation and I reduce staff have a clear understanding that this is something that the committee are seeking in when we workshop the any grant review process with the committee and would be exploring the it is part of their workshop process okay so we 're able to put something as an amendment into this to actually clear you know clearly stipulate that as opposed or ask staff to make sure that that 's part of the condition to the Covenant yeah you could have the covenant should include some some mechanism to preserve the visibility of the building from the from the road so that could include for example obviously don 't want something like a big fence it 's on the road boundary or big garage pull in front of the building and on the road yep and so you okay we haven 't got a mover and a seconder yet so I 'm gonna move to date in a minute but Mike did you have another question okay did anyone any other questions Pauline is very quickly just on six point one six in the last bullet point that the owners are committed to the continuing use in maintenance of the building a better feeling that you have from these people that they 're actually committed to staying there yeah absolutely they fell enough of this building I think they would have had to to have taken on the real visits it 's no small commitment that they have made sorry Peter I can with the amendment that that kid are saving that dearness you 're happy to include that yeah yeah covenant include a mechanism for so Phil clear water Dion swags include a mechanism to preserve the visibility of the property from the stages they 're good enough waiting for they because my questioning that 's yeah I think but yeah instead of making as my condition yeah okay cult say Bill Clearwater Dion swags right and now Yanni has an amendment yeah um say amendment number one is to reduce the it well to yes the amendment is to reduce the Heritage grant to what is a hundred fifty thousand one hundred and seventeen analyzed for a full calm covenant so it 's really it 's really just that we 're amending the first line or the first amount to a hundred and fifty thousand so the risk would remain the same Suraj yeah yep is he a seconder for that amendment another thing about I would second it if he dropped it to Sydney for a thousand is there a second up for the moment meaning and is there a seconder to reduce it to one hundred and fifty thousand it 's gonna fail for want of a 75 do I have a seconder for that no hey hey no boobies with even advised by staff that he can 't so that fails for wonderful seconder should have done it pro forma you know anyway yeah so I 'll open it up for debate Phil Dion glean in memory so counselors we witness came to the committee I actually voted against the four hundred five thousand dollars and that there the question I guess about accessibility but also particularly as Mike Davidson has referred to that question of sort of private gain versus public benefit that that was raised however I met I met you really clear to now support the the whole 205,000 and I think that having the additional and the additional recommendation there about visibility that then that helps why particularly why I 'm changing in mind is that we 've there discussion around community involvement with our heritage you know I M we receive a number of us on the committee received and you know from from the applicant and I thought it was quite telling and I 'm not going to quote all I think are really significant one is they they write we do feel a responsibility to make sure that any public funding we may get will have a return for others and she also adds we 're doing what we can to preserve the bits of history that the house tells and there came to find ways to give back the support we 'll make it through public funding you know I think it 's with that kind of accountability really battles so that in fact that the there is a there is a there 's a clear indication there that in fact the these the applicants are open to to how in fact the community may really utilize what will be the via the home that goes back to the the original condition of the building the purpose of the building was a vicarage used by it used by family it 's held in high regard in terms of the Heritage qualifications it 's a very strong strong historical history both the night Tahu in for thee for the the church so I 'm now fully in supportive of now I 'm very in favor of this and there is I 'm in favor of this as we know when it first came to light about the decision and in the in the owners emailed us all actually took it upon myself to go and actually meet with them and go on site and have a look at this building it is absolutely amazing what having to do to keep the Heritage fabric of this building and for us to think that they 're going to take public money and then on sell that and make a profit out of it it 's just it 's just not possible because the amount of money that they 're needing to spend on top of what would normally be spent just to protect the heritage here is phenomenal I mean right now there 's sort of they 've moved the whole building off site and they 're doing the Foundation 's but they have to have an archaeologist or they 7 with somebody 's actually touching the ground just because of the that the the massive amount of significance this has always been there to bless the site they 've been involved with the church to actually document the whole building as they 're starting to rebuild it and stuff like that the amount of imaging that these people have to protecting this building and actually making sure that it survives through this earthquake and actually tells the story of early Christchurch and even bending that into the to the to the native Christchurch story as well as is really quite phenomenal and I really appreciate what they 've done to try and do this so in that respect I really you know I would support this and I 'm really keen to see that you know that the the visual immunity is actually kept on site so that people can actually start to appreciate that build I actually put it on my Facebook page we 're going to debate it two weeks ago a hundred thousand people who actually looked at that post that I put there it 's one of the most amazing things that 's happened on my Facebook page we 've had dozens of messages from people who some people were born in their building in the stories that they were telling about that the building itself and all those kind of things was awesome and it was really cool to sort of see health just one building actually brought so many people to actually having a conversation about their new ways of christchurch and this you know the happiness that actually sort of come from there so i thought that 's actually a really good story and actually i think we can incorporate it into the story of christchurch and actually it 's one of those things as we look back we will have things that we 're run that will then tell a story of what christchurch has gone through and what it used to be so i 'm really supportive of this and i hope people are supportive I 've got confidence that from meeting the people that they will do everything in their power to to make sure this building lasts for another hundred and fifty two hundred years thank you I clean I thank you I 'm came to see public return committee because I was pretty concerned over the substantial amount of public money going to what ostensibly looked like you know a private sitting I take on the the point made by Dion there over the visibility of the property but I think that that 's only part of it it 's it 's about the community openness and accessibility to it you know is it going to be part of a heritage trail so I 'm satisfied with the new information we 've received the owners have heard that what we 've said it at committee level and on that basis I 'm happy to go with the recommendation today having voted against it first at committee level in thank you through the excellent engagement process with the heritage strategy that the team have done the community clearly stated that it wanted to see heritage is a legacy and an end inheritance that we have a duty to retain and protect it for future generations so we are giving money to this project not just for these people but for this building actually because these people may not always building belongs to all of us so we 're really we 're putting money into making sure that this building that we but we own and we belong to and we have an investment as as cared for and in preserved for all of us so really in favor of it Andrew then Mike thank you I think we need to be careful that we don 't confuse consideration of this particular grant application with consideration of what changes we might want to make to our heritage grants policy and I 'm certainly aware that there was some discussion has been referred to already at the committee around the requirements of these grants particularly around public access and and public value from the spending of public money and I certainly acknowledge the note that we 've had from the owners of this building which was referred to by Phil and others around the realization of public money and the will to make sure that there 's a much public benefit from that as as there can be on the part of these owners but any consideration of what requirement for with these grants is something that would be more properly considered and I 'm sure it will be by the Committee on good staff advice as any changes to these grants and the way that we administer them made the building clearly is one that 's got high heritage values and the report makes it very clear that this is a building that certainly meets the criteria for this fund and the environment in which we 're working of course is one that the fund what they are and the application has been made under those rules I believe that we 're fortunate to have own as likely owners of this building who have got the commitment to preserving heritage that have got the vision to preserve heritage and in fact are willing to take the risks inherent in dealing with these kind of buildings because this kind of project isn 't something that 's risk free in anybody 's language the the nature of these projects is that they 're frustrating and long and and their and their arduous so I think we 're very fortunate to have owners and it 's great that we 're in a position as a council to be able to support those owners in caring for our heritage in making sure that it 's preserved for future generations and certainly in this case making sure that there is a good recognition of ways that they can bring about public good as a result of what I believe is is good spending of public money which after all has been set aside for this purpose Mike Vinny Ani thank you first of all I 'd just like to correct councillor Galloway we do not own this property it is a part of it residence and it was bought as as where as so they sort of knew what they were going to be getting into and this is a large sum of may and I just don 't actually accept this as a right the right thing to do I understand that we created a pot of over seven hundred thousand dollars to go towards here tonight value to Heritage in our city I know it does have a very strong place the problem behind the eight-ball by having to approach things last year to take away from that money this is 28% of the funds for a year and I already know that the social and Community Development recommend another approval of 200,000 from this fund another twenty eight thousand dollars twenty two hundred thousand dollars twenty percent will be going in shortly to October with only 19 percent lift of that funding pot just 19 cent with nine months still to go I think we need to look at the bigger picture to me we 've got a problem with this policy and the way it is we distributed without having a cap amount in there and I know that meets the criteria of the policy but I 'm not here just to rubber stamp stuff I 'll need to have a look at it make sure it 's going to work for the city and for the whole year it is not going to work for the whole year we 've seen it time and time again when we 're approving things this year for next financial year because we just little bit more smart of how we 're doing this heritage I was happy to approve this heritage grant if it was actually at a lower amount so we can actually make this go out further through other communities to get more heritage value out there because there is a lot more heritage projects out there and there 'll be a lot more people coming to the council for this fund which will be soon empty because we 're given out two hundred thousand dollar grants two hundred thousand dollar grants the private residences I had to fight for over now is to get a small amount of money for a community facility that is going to put huge value into the community huge value and there was a small amount this is two hundred thousand dollars of rate payers money that we 're going to be giving to a private residence I don 't think that is acceptable and I do not think that is right yeah I shared a concern with the quantum of funding and I 've read the Heritage grants that exist from central government and Museum which this one is one of the few that you know that will probably come in front of us it does qualify for financial assistance so I think the critical thing is to get the full government because and a limited covenant obviously for a time when you 're spending a lot of money doesn 't make a lot of sense so I was happy to reduce the amount which wasn 't supported so I can 't support this quantum of funding I have real concerns about the whole as as where as where we seem to be picking up the costs that people incur because of this whole as as where as business that 's going on in the city particularly around a heritage I just want to remind councillors that is even with a full covenant there 's no there 's no assurance that if we have another earthquake that this building won 't become as as well as again and people will vac asking for money to fix it and we won 't have recovered anything and this is what 's actually happened in us that 've been demolished or sold as as we rose and we haven 't recuperated any of that money so we do need to be cautious about the Quantum 's that we 're putting in I do support heritage I think it 's really good that you 've asked for the visibility from the street because if you look at this there 's actually a huge amount of vacant land but I just think that this grant has there 's too much it should have been it should be reduced in light of all the other priorities that we have we 've also got our own heritage buildings so I love the fact that counts as a passionate about heritage we 've put our own heritage buildings on hold because we don 't have enough money to fix them and yet we 're giving out money huge amounts of money to private heritage building owners so I do think we need to look at the strategy around heritage in our city our welcome when that report comes to council for this particular grant I think this is too much and I I 'm supporting this they the amount that the this building received from the Heritage New Zealand fund despite its category 1 status was 60,000 in terms of a 1.2 million dollar contribution it 's not sufficiently significant and and the advice that we 've received and I 'm accepting that advice to reduce the amount of the Heritage incentive grant that we had before us does want to remind people that this site has waahi tapu Ridge at registration it is the it has historical significance obviously for its 120 26 year association with the Booker 's of Saint Luke 's Church in high cultural significance as a place sacred Temari as the burial site of renowned nature who chief tota he now I don 't want to go into the fact that whether that was the correct name for Christchurch or toto he the place of Toto he but that is what people refer to Christchurch s this is hugely significant site and to think of a demolition occurring on this site is not something that I would want to stand by the vicarage has obviously the architectural speech Lee 's most highly regarded surviving domestic weeks at and and and and of course that as the report sees the contextual significance as a picturesque mid 19th century dwelling that stands as a reminder of the loss of sand Anglican as Luke 's aunt luke 's anglican church after the earthquake so but the one that just came to mind is that the form of the courage was designed by robert speechy the architect who came to Christchurch with his pupil William crisp to oversee the construction of the Anglican Cathedral I mean in light of the decisions that are going to be made this weekend I think this is a significant contribution to the heritage of ersity so I 'll be supporting the recommendation so on that note I will put the recommendation all those in favor say aye those opposed say no and that 's Mike Davidson the eonni Oh handsome thank you very much that 's carried _"

    "text": "any presentation of petitions and we 're moving now to item 23 which is reckless Park and reckless school proposal ends well sir hearings panel report in front of us and I 'd like to invite the chair at the hearings panel to present the report thank you very much so the hearings panel has supported the proposal and with some additional recommendations and requirements which will you 'll see are picked up in the resolutions which are in front of us today so recommendation two picks up matters raised in submissions relating to particularly amenity values and it means that the project around view shafts are at Melbourne cave can be picked up in a joined up way and with the work that the ministry are doing and obviously the aspirations of the community expressed through the master plan recommendation three allows council staff from the community board to consider structures which exist on the school site at the moment which may have value to the park so that there 's the opportunity for council staff to work with the ministry and obviously work with the community through the have value to the park those can be retained and the commitment from the ministry is that the area of demolition in the park will be grasped and made good so that what the council gets what the community gets by way of the new park is a finished site with as many of the structures which are currently there which are desired to remain able to remain there so that they add value amenity to that new park we 've also raised expectations that the ministry will contribute to the costs which are incurred by council as a part of the transfer of the park from the existing park site to the existing school site and of course there are items which need to be added to the park which are replacements which wouldn 't necessarily be in program for renewal at this time so there may be depreciated values which wouldn 't be as much as the cost of replacing for example playground equipment but our expect the ministry would contribute to that difference in cost and there are pedestrian safety and traffic management issues which are brought school site existing park sites and again the expectation that 's raised by the hearings panel is that the ministry should contribute to those and certainly comments made by the ministry at the hearings suggest that those are realistic expectations on our class we were concerned by submissions from users of the park particularly sports groups who were concerned that through ten transition there may be a time at which the existing park wasn 't available to them and that the new park wouldn 't yet be finished we 've certainly picked that up by way of recommendation nine and our hope is that the timing of the development on both sites can be such that there is some period of crossover so that there 's no drop in the level of service and no break in continuity of service for those sports groups some of that may of course relate to timing when there are times of the year that particular sports codes are not needing to use the park as well this has been a really difficult issue for the Red Cliffs community over a long period of and and councillors will be very aware of the frustrations and sometimes anger in that community which has been going on for some time one of the things that we heard loud and clear from submitters was that there 's a need for certainty and in many ways as long as the outcome is that Red Cliffs gets its school back certain C is one of the most important things and there were other options that have been put forward that could possibly have been considered it became very clear when we heard the verbal submission from the Ministry of Education and certainly when we read the detailed information in the report and the other papers were put in front of us but if Red Cliffs is to get certainty around getting its school back and if we 're able to do what we need to do to provide that certainty of the community to the community then approving what 's in front of us approving the committee 's and the hearings panels recommendation is absolutely the way that we can do that to do anything other than that not school wouldn 't in fact be built in Red Cliffs at all and there were some submitters who were submitting against the proposal who did prefer alternate sites or who hadn 't been happy with the process which had been undertaken by the ministry in the earliest stages but in many ways those submitters in the end realized that they supported a school and the way to get that school is to support this proposal and swap which is in front of us today so in I 'm speaking to the recommendations from the hearings panel I strongly recommend those two counselors today this is an important step in the process that gets the school back for red cliffs that Caesar school rebuilt and in fact this is the only way that we can provide certainty that red cliffs will get a school and that that can happen within a time frame that we know that the community are comfortable with my belief is that this is supported by a broad section of the Red Cliffs community and that this is the way that we can show our commitment to school for red cliffs don 't you 'd be happy to move the recommendations very happy to move sticking to Sarah Templeton would you like to speak who who wants to speak to the ask a question of whom all right I note that there 's a number of submissions that talk about going back to the main school the existing school site and even I think the Board of Trustees of the school and the information that we 've been given had made that request to the minister so did the hearings panel consider the possible change of government and their uncertainty around perhaps a different outcome in a few few weeks time the hearings panel certainly considered uncertainty and providing certainty to the community was one of the drivers in coming up with the recommendations that we did yes we did consider the possibility of going back to the existing school site the ministry through them their submission made it very clear that that was not an option which was being considered by the ministry and that the proposal by the ministry to rebuild the school on the certainty that the community made it very clear they wanted so we considered other options but we did rule those out quite quickly because all of them were surrounded by a level of uncertainty that I don 't believe the community would be comfortable with no we didn 't consider what the outcome of the election would be because in the broad context of our considerations all that did was lead to more uncertainty and an inability to make a strong recommendation as we needed to coming out of this process so I mean that may be something that councillors want to take into account it wasn 't something that hearings panel took into account to a great extent because our motivation was to provide certainty of the community that was what we heard through a lot of the other submissions well in fact if you read all of the documentation that was attached supplementary to this advice the ministry said that if we said no to this they would immediately start looking at their banner Park option so I know what the ministry have said but I also know been very clear that the ministers have been making these decisions and I just wondered with a new the possibility of a new Minister for the sake of two or three weeks till race you think a government will be formed in two or three weeks yeah the Board of Trustees and the principal of the school submitted strongly in support of the proposal which is in front of us today and we certainly heard those submissions loud and clear cool and then just the question I had for counts for councils staff or for the hearings federal as I couldn 't say the it wasn 't very clear what the bulk in design of the school would be on that Park in terms of the intrusion the visual amenity impacts there was some comment to it being quite high off the ground so did you get any shading model or any sort of diagrams of what the visual impact would be other than you 've got very indicative ones and here that don 't seem to give much clarity over that the panel was concerned about the sort of the submissions from neighboring residents and certainly some of the submissions relating to the immunity that the park offered to the wider neighborhood some of the things that they were picking up in those submissions we also took quite a lot of legal advice as a panel as to what was within the scope that we were to consider and what was outside of the scope and of course the recommendation is around the land swap there are planning requirements and planning regulations that pick up the issues around built forum and and the the look and feel of the new site and we were certainly provided with a level of confidence as a panel that those planning requirements would pick up exactly the sort of issues that you raised but we also in our discussions with the ministry and in hearing what they said to us were provided with a level of confidence that the ministry was at least cognizant of the issues around immunity and the the built form and an urban design of that new site but the advice that we received as a panel that were as part of the planning requirements rather than that that was something that we should consider is a substantive issue for the panel no more questions okay yes okay Sarah that by acknowledging the principle and board of trustees members who are here today sitting in the audience here watching and waiting and all of the difficult times that the day in the school have been through in the community and the enormous amount of work and effort and energy that 's gone into keeping the school intact while they wait for a decision while our decision will be today there 's still a long way to go to actually keep the school open again and so I wish them all the best for that work as well there 's been misconceptions around rockfall risk expressed on social media and in the media like to make sure that everyone 's really well aware that actually there is no rockfall risk for the for the old school site or the new park site in fact that the ministry are going to be building a fence to define the the new park other area that we won 't be taking on there was also some anger in the community at the minister 's original decision but that 's not something that we have control over and I 'd like to acknowledge Johnny 's point on that as well and that the potential for a change in government could potentially change things but we have no certainty over that and in fact while there 's been no word from any of the other parties that they would change anything to do with this process we also have support from the local Labour MP elected MP for the land swap today and her submission all the reasons that make reakless Park on the waterfront they 're a really great place for a park also make it a really good place for a school it 's going to be a wonderful environment and the children talk to us about the potential for more eastery studies and working on environment matters and things like that as part of their normal school day and that 's going to be a real benefit for them the main road will be much more visible more highly utilized and that will be a really good councillor is it going forward for what for the community I 'm looking forward to conversations that with the community and the community board about how that new park looks and what assets we might like to retain on it it 's the potential for attaining a building in the corner and that could become a community facility and potentially the playground equipment and those kind of things and so I read it up for today 's conversation and would urge people to vote in favor Thank You Glenn it was good to be part of the panel with my colleagues particularly in light of the qe2 experience and so recommendation number 10 is along the lines of that kind of negotiation at the highest level to ensure that the recommendations that have come out of the panel are adhered to so we know that the negotiations will be conducted in good faith but that is just a way of underlining that it is important today that we do do our part to ensure that put back so the school is that heart it 's and it 's important we put that back today and that I think we pushed the Go button and give them certainty so that the panel was very cohesive it could be some of the kind of grievances we heard was cathartic that was important to but we had a job to do and I think we did it quite well yay I can 't support this today I will be abstaining my preference would have been to leave this on the table until after the election because I can 't see what we have to lose from waiting for a few weeks or another month because it just seems to me that there 's a number of concerns that have been expressed and I would also was on the qe2 Hearing Panel and one of the issues that came up was the lack of detail from people being able to make submissions to know what the impact would be and you know I think if people are being asked to make submissions on the loss of or the disposal what 's going to be proposed to be put back in its place then it it 's really difficult to make an informed decision and from the diagrams that I 've seen again it 's like qe2 you just get this very big kind of generic kind of blobs on a map that you don 't get much fine detail around what 's actually going to go there I also think that you know fundamentally there 's a real risk of putting a school from what was one high hazard area to another and this huge risk around flooding and I think tsunami so I can 't quite see the logic and putting it here other than the fact that the minister was determined not to go back to existing site so perhaps with if there 's a change of government I think there would be new opportunities to explore it and I can 't see why we shouldn 't wait a few more weeks or a month to just see what the outcome of that is before agreeing to this I have to say that I have huge sympathy a strong supporter of it staying in Red Cliffs that 's absolutely essential and important I think the other thing there 's a few other things and these resolutions today which do leave me with a bit of concern previously when we did QE 2 we actually had the report around the sale but there hasn 't come to us and we 're Gela gating to the chief executive around the arrangements and what we saw with qe2 is that the arrangements changed once we 'd already made it the ministry came back and said they wanted to remove more trees with different trees and so I just would have preferred that we actually have the whole documentation in front of us today to be able to actually see what the valuation of the land was and to sign off on that agreement of that swap at the same time as we make this decision so it 's it 's again I appreciate the huge amount of work and effort that the community put into this as I said I 'm very supportive of the school remaining in Red Cliffs longer to find out what happens with the general election given how much of this has been the minister 's refusal to look at the existing site I would say a couple of words and aim back to the the mover of the resolution but I simply want to really focus on pro C 's 1 I want to express gratitude to the board of trustees who wrote to the council and said right at the get-go when this was on the table do the both together don 't leave the community to make a decision about relocating the school without making the decision about giving back a part and I think with that encouragement it was it was an enabling position that the community took it enabled us to actually bring this paper today the second element of the process that I want to talk about as the hearings panel I think it was an exemplary process I think that enabled that the different points of view to be expressed in a way that was I think good for the and healthy for the community they 're always challenging table it 's hugely difficult but leaving this matter to lie on the table was not an option not at this stage it just would I think be such a huge disappointment after people have invested so much for many it is a compromise but you know that 's what life can be like sometime you seek to get a resolution and that involves a degree of compromise and I should have acknowledged the the local Member of Parliament the Honorable Ruth Dyson who would have been here other than another commitment but so I should record her apologies because she would have been here otherwise and you know to have that degree of support across the board I think as there 's also very good I don 't think that we can wait for for a general election and the outcome of the outcome of which is uncertain this community has asked us for certainty and I think we should give it to them today enjoy and really just echoing those comments and picking up a couple of things that have come up in the discussion since I introduced want to school back in Red Cliffs we absolutely heard from this community that they want certainty they want early certainty in fact they want certainty now we can 't expect a detailed design of buildings at this stage when we haven 't yet approved the transfer of the land to allow this to happen and on hoping that we 're about to do that now but we need to have confidence in our own planning rules around issues of built form urban design natural hazards which pick up the sort of things that we talked about at the panel and which have been mentioned today inundation flooding tsunami risk and so on but we have planning rules that take all of those things into a place into into account so waiting is not an option we 've got a responsibility to this community and it 's a responsibility that I believe we need to exercise now I also would like to acknowledge the the school board of trustees the school community and the Red Cliffs community who have really been through the mill with this but this is our do that today and I encourage you to take that opportunity I know how happy people were in the room at the hearings panel when we made this set of recommendations and I 've got every confidence that the Red Cliffs community will be very happy when we make a very clear and certain decision on the back of these recommendations today and I hope that that 's what counselors are going to allow us to do thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no abstentions Yani thank you very much that 's carries _"

    "text": "five minute presentation good morning I am Wayne Hawker a long-term resident and strong community advocate for the community of Phillips Town thank you for allowing me this time to address the City Council over my concerns and regards the proliferation of alcohol outlets wanting to open up in Christchurch at the present time there is a serious concern for me that they are currently targeting the eastern side of town with a proposal for a new little ain 't being considered in Philips town as many know Philips town is regarded as a low socio-economic community in Christchurch it is rated annoying out of 10 on the government 's current deprivation scale this on its own brings serious issues for the community to deal with when out without having to deal with an overexposure and the easy access of alcohol to many vulnerable people living in Philips town we already know that there is a liquor store approximately 30 metres from the proposed site we have identified at least 18 liquor license sites within an approximately 2.5 kilometre radius of the proposed site we as a community are saying objection to any license application being lodged we are to some extent limited and what we can object to to the fact that there is no formal local alcohol policy in place that would actually add considerable strength to any objection furthermore there is very confusing guidelines as to who is entitled to lodge a formal objection anyone who wants to reject must prove that they have a greater interest in the general public and putting in a submission and this is where the confusion lies it appears you must have clearly closed to any proposed site to be a person or be a peer for special involvement involvement in organizations such as churches schools community organizations etc to have a chance to be considered as someone entitled to object but it appears to me that what is seriously lacking is the opportunity for one of the most powerful voices that could object being able to do so that voice is that of victims who have been harmed in some way by alcohol surely of anyone they would have the greatest interest over the general public and there should be or the council could ensure that their local licensing authorities had given guidelines to include objections from such people I have read online the counts of provisional local alcohol policy date of the 29th of September 2016 I like the intent of what what you are trying to achieve and I am aware there is a process that has to be followed but then we as ratepayers what are we going to have when are we going to have this policy in place to give us as communities nor teeth to take on those who wanted to continue to flood our communities with liquor stores just because they can my understanding there were appeals against some aspects of the provisional moissan policy when it was presented but this did not involve the section regarding off licences is there any way the council consider can consider formally adopting impact the local alcohol policy while kenyan continuing to work on leach in a common ground place with those who are opposed in the other parts of the policy this ruling give communities such as Philips Town the teeth we need to take with alcohol because at the present time does he really staked in their favor thank you thank you very much I mean obviously that LP is going through a process there are appeals and no you can 't implement part of that ahead of rest of it and yes there are appeals on the off-licence as well so I 'm sorry but that 's that 's the way it is so thank you very much for your presentation yep right _"

    "text": "thank you very much for asking us here this morning we 've really been looking forward to coming today to tell you about the really exciting plans that the orchestra has so um I guess really what we want to we 're here to talk to you is one of our major stakeholders we 've been sharing this great vision with our other stakeholders creative New Zealand as well in the foundation of the CSO so what we 're really talking about is I suppose the changing role of orchestras globally where they 're broadening their purpose they 're extending out by beyond the concert hall getting out into their communities using the great knowledge and resources that are housed within the orchestral infrastructure and that 's what we 're talking about we actually have a vision to be at the forefront of this movement to be absolute world leaders in this so currently we 're operating as you probably aware quite a dynamic community engagement program already but we believe we can do better so what our vision is is a 50 orchestra so what this means is half our time is actually spent out in the community delivering community engagement programs now we 've arrived at this idea simply based on needs and demand so what we have at the moment we can only really meet about a third of the requests that we 're building for people to participate in our community engagement program so this is very much driven by need name just to give you an idea practical sense of what does a 50-50 orchestra look like so a snapshot of the seven days and the CEO so right now on Saturday we had a concert at the Charles Laney auditorium with a visiting international cellist Wolfgang Schmidt it was a great concert in the critics say that was packed with energy and vitality and animation in this week no I wasn 't playing and this week we 've got musicians that are spending the entire week at banks of school and Darlington and they 're working with all of the students in the school each class creating projects that they 'll perform at the end of the week now we particularly picked banks ever very keen to actually evaluate the impacts of music especially long tail impacts especially with young students that are suffering post-quake impacts and so Beck said was a good school to look at this we 're working with Kathleen Liberty and some of you may have seen some of her research that came out to the other week talking about some of the impacts on young students so we 're looking to actually be able to quantify the benefits of these music programs but to give you a practical sense of what we 're talking about here of some of these outcomes that we believe we can get from these programs on day two the teachers were already commenting that there was a probable change and dynamic within the school there was a lift in the school and this is the creative pursuit of everyone working together but also on day two we saw quite a turnaround one of the young students there who suffers quite significantly from autism and is very socially isolated within the school struggles as very sound sensitive and also doesn 't communicate a lot they two the student was actually sitting in front of the drums and not only was he getting stuck in and working with the others and the breakout sessions with the other students he was actually learning that he was actually really encouraging the others coming up with lots of ideas and helping them get on and come up with activity so we can see that actually these sorts of music programs were offering his profound change so what we 're talking about with our new vision is using music as a platform to contribute to enhance social outcomes for the city and that includes working with people on the margins of society there 'll be an emphasis of equality of opportunity identifying and reducing barriers to experiencing and participating in the arts enhancing the quality of life through the arts and in particular music and responding to the areas of need so that 's not us developing programs and taking it out that 's looking at work can we help and assist the program itself we 'll have six strands encounter providing audiences of all ages with opportunities to experience letsplay program this is intensive creative residences based and primary and intermediate schools platform creative music based programs within prisons in justice facilities this builds on the work we 've already been doing this year flourish health and well-being through music with a particular focus on youth mental health and the aging community including those with dementia amplify this is building on our existing partnerships to work alongside the disabled communities providing opportunities to experience and participate in music based arts experiences and the sixth string is tuned up and this is developing skills of musicians of all ages in abilities so perhaps if you 've played an instrument in your past and their instruments still under your bed we want to work with you and have you come and join our rusty musicians Orchestra expect the recorder so we have a two stage plan and we 're looking to start to implement this from 2019 now we 're actually not planning on coming to the council to ask for more money to fund this we actually will believe that we 'll be going out into the private sector for there 's very good response and potential support for this we believe in this program so strongly that the foundation of the CSO has committed to signal to concede funding for the first four years of this but we are looking for the council to continue their commitment to the CSO we want to work with you and partnership to ensure that we can really deliver the best possible outcomes and make the best contribution that we can as an orchestra to the city and its residents we 'll be very happy to come back and to dig down into this and more detail and also to work with council staff so this new version will enable us to establish deeper and more meaningful connections building ongoing programs not just the one offs that we tend to offer now at this year so we have a saying that music belongs to all of us and we really want to do our best to make that a reality for everyone in this city thank you thank you very much we 've got some time for questions but but thank you for music within music we find a number of solutions that and nothing to do with learning an instrument and but it 's about it 's about working it as part of a team it 's about developing confidence self confidence and it 's also about being realizing that I miss you 're in tune with everyone else that doesn 't sound quite so ugly thank you have you looked at these Systema Isador model which has been used in south or yes have and in fact actually I went over to the UK as well in a Winston Churchill Memorial Fellowship earlier this year to actually look at what orchestras over there are doing in their communities and they operate a program that takes some of the ideas of Systema but they 've adapted it more for the UK schools this is actually a very interesting program they offer ankled and harmony and I 'm very interested to look at potentially a hybrid model here so the main difference of stemmer works outside of the school environment and harmony works within a school environment so you can utilize the existing like this could be a very very beneficial thing to happen in Christchurch there 's incredible social outcomes that comes from this program and incredible benefits for the wider neighborhoods as well so I spoke I actually was quite I really wanted to delve into this so I did actually do a 360 around this talking to students talking to parents talking to the arts organisations delivering this but also talking to the principals about why they 've gotten on board with us some very Tarrant talented young people and other Nui would be great to connect up with Graham Waldrop Mary Cheney others you know Salvation Army also has used their brass base right chose to bring young kids from not to start anew but a wide range of quite low so low socio-economic area schools and they have flourished and their environment so I 've seen it 15 so I 'm just in terms of those connections I don 't know if you 're aware but there 's a group of music therapists have set up to work particularly were that older people have dementia and I 'm them wonderful backing yeah we 've actually been working with them and in touch with them so yeah I think this is really key as part of the vision what we 've discovered to us over the more than 17 years we 've been doing this work we 've built up a lot of connections partnerships and relationships and the the beauty of what we 're talking about here it gives us certainty to really grow and build on those existing connections that we have so we 're not starting from from 0 here we 're building on 17 years of firm work but actually this gives us the flexibility to look at adapting it further I think thank you very much and you know thanks to the foundation for making that strong commitment for the seed funding for the four years I had a meeting with creative New Zealand just recently and they talked about the the model of the support which has cornerstone oceans that they support and also so that the Torah and in looking for that leadership and then the caja Katya which does which you I 'm just thinking that part of our review of our funding streams ought to be looking at that idea of what is the cornerstone for a city and certainly I view the CSI was very much a part of that so thank you very much for your presentation and thank you for having the vision for taking it out out of the comfort space of the orchestra performance to the wider community thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "good moving so we 'll start the meeting if I call meeting to order please and we will start with item 1 apologies and I have an apology from the mayor I have a college from Jamie golf and an apology from Aaron Cohen I 'm happy to move those apologies Sara Templeton seconds all those in favor against as carried okay declarations of interest and there are a number of applications that various counselors will have relationships with the groups concerned rather than declaring all of those now if we get into any discussion where there 's a need for that interest to be declared then obviously just let this item serve as a reminder to do that it may well be that we won 't get into those particular discussions today and therefore there isn 't a need to do so Glenn okay thank you entered but we could just notify staff just to note any so for instance I got at least one so get them to notify it yeah if there 's a need to do that then you could even if it 's not discussed I mean for example I 'm a trustee of the occasions by Mari and colonial Museum which is a is a lower priority application which is unlikely to be discussed today I haven 't worried about declaring that but if we did get into that discussion obviously I would make it known that I was a trustee for example Mike I should just like to declare my interest now and Ken can 't bring neighborhood support thank you can I just say I think we should be declaring because we will be voting on the funding ok enough we 're not discussing the h or groups themselves now there any interest that council is until I can for me yeah Matt so Walker is in me I even got the number at Ames okay mine 's there okay a maroon-colored noodle Museum which is unlikely to come up for discussion Mike neighborhood support Dave East we already noted that the workshop is the treasure of Canterbury neighborhood supports Sarah do you have anything 09 okay application 209 anything further all right great thank you so those declarations of interest so item three the Metropolitan strengthening communities fund that I 'd like to open by getting staff just to make some commentary on the report and the work that has goss 's to the set of recommendations that are in front of us today thank you chair Thank You councils if I could also just again just very quickly just acknowledge and thank all of the staff involved in this process which has been you know heavy workloads River Island and here we are today to make these decisions so just to go through the available budgets for the Metropolitan strengthening communities fund we have a total available budget of just over 3.3 million dollars and we have it we have total requests and the amount of just over eight million dollars so significantly more than than what 's available that 's come from 238 individual applicants I don 't have the ability that the the amount of applications as comparable with previous years when we look at the Early Learning Center 's major orgs and general implications you know plus or minus a few that they 're very much aligned one three-year commitment that was approved by council in the 1516 financial year that 's to the the Youth Council so that has already been granted we have nine early learning centers which staff are recommending for funding this year while they work to develop policy around community organizations who use community facilities as worked on and developed we have nine major organizations an available funding pool at 1.2 million dollars they are requesting one point see them just over 1.7 million dollars and then we have total of 219 general applications requesting 5.9 million dollars and have an available budget of just over 1.8 million dollars so again some significant work gone and the year now so all of these implications have gone through a process of obviously making an application specialist staff have been assist these applications against councils priorities and outcomes for funding and the relevant criteria and taking into account the the available budget as well there are seven applications that council identified and a workshop last week there are potential fits if you like for the community resilience and partnership fund now that will go future what else have we got here sorry I just lost my place to on my notes that 's really sort of who 'll have probably got to say chair I could probably hand it over to you now to just to to carry on thank you very much and can I also just reinforce the commentary around the huge amount of work that 's gone into the set of recommendations that are in front of us today I 'd certainly also like to acknowledge and thank staff for all of the hard work that 's got us to the point that we 're at assessing the applications in the early part of the process to bring staff recommendations to us and then the huge amount of work on Friday afternoon that went into supporting the workshop that we had as well so thank you to you and to the team of staff that are supported the whole process has certainly made life a lot easier for us that we 've got that level of support so thank you sir I probably should just very quickly also add that the thank you very much thank you so we 've got two documents which additional or change to support the meeting today one of which is the most up to date set of recommendations that came out of the workshop on Friday afternoon and the other River which is a set of resolutions which have been circulated that will in fact that we 've got on the board in front of us on the screen which will be the resolutions that we 're working with today as well so the way that I propose to run this would be to have any discussion and any questions based on the report which is in front of us the spreadsheet that I just referred to and to the resolutions that are in front of us as the the proposal coming into this meeting and then you further changes that were to be made or to be proposed would be changes to those documents rather than the documents that are in the agenda which of course was produced prior to the workshop on Friday so L let 's move to any questions the councillors amount of work gone into this and it is incredibly difficult and it was really disheartening to see I guess state there was a number of the priority two ones that were originally not recommended for funding because he wasn 't budget available and I understand you know there was those five hundred thousand taken out for the partnership fund but compared to other years and I had asked for this last week but don 't have it yet exam how has our community funding they know the last how does it compare to other years so have we got more in a strictly dollar term now than we did in the past or is it the same as it has been so for the last five or six years are we referring to funding going to community boards community funding generally so community at the funding that we give to the community either metropolitan serving communities fund oh nothing because I mean it because it heads be read because so we have a different allocation now that we Tripoli some addresses we can 't just do just metropolitan but so we haven 't made sort of automatic adjustments for either inflation or for the fact that you know post-quake we 've had a huge increase in the number of groups that have popped up that are doing strengthening communities type we it 's kind of just stayed stable Hawaii staple the whole way immediately after the earthquakes two other funders other funds we 're operating which yeah you know covered some of that okay and what I 'd like to maybe foreshadow is adding a sort of an in-principle resolution for the the council to consider that we can ask staff to increase by 10% the available community funding to be divided up between metro and community boards in the LTP process and certain principal decision to raise it by ten percent so it 's probably worth noting that for this year in next year there will be the additional funding because of the extra money that 's coming for the community response funds so it might be in the year four years following that in the LTP that you want to inflation you just the spot yep yep on the agenda for the LTP process that we consider as the LTP as part of the LTP process would be entirely in order so if you 've got some wording that you 'd like to add to our resolutions that we 're crafting today I 'll be happy to to incorporate that in the main resolution yep great thank you all right so if we can work on that and add it to the the resolution that will be good thank you Jonnie I just want to just check on two things one is who set the criteria for the funding applications and when was a council approves to approve the current criteria so the criteria was I guess developed and workshopped with staff and an elected member working party and then approved by council cool and when was that that was two years ago I believe now so this is the second year under the current criteria okay thank you um and the second question was so there 's a number of ones that have been put into mich important but they look like they 're local so wondering if you can just explain to us how you 've done the Hat and whether that 's changed or it 's the same as from two years ago and then just related to that also is there a process by which some of Community Board applications can be put into that new partnership resilience fund because I can think of some in our area for example that would qualify it in line with the ones that we 're recommending today but I don 't know what the process is to do that so sorry is closed so to answer the first part of your question counselor around metropolitan and local organizations and as where the groups tell us that the participants come from so the people that use the services that the organization provides currently if the spread is covering four or more community board areas they are a Metropolitan organization and that was increased this year previously as it was three or more community board areas and the second part of the question was it about the field to the committee he 's from the community board deprecations to council for the first tranche but also the update memo from the ones that there are some councils hadn 't read that previous memo you I think you had it or read it out so we can update you with the process for doing that but email so everyone gets the same information it 's like a process to put in the ones at our community board to that first chance for a consideration but I don 't know what that process is [Music] okay thank you and my understanding is that the paper on that community resilience and partnership fund is only a matter of weeks away from coming to Council it should be with Council before the end of this month is my understanding so we 'll have the opportunity to have those conversations at that time except the boards are throwing their funding now so that 's why it 's quite urgent because they 'll obviously want to know if there 's an opportunist yeah so if we can get some earlier information to the boards that would be helpful thank you any further questions Jimi faint indeed oh now why the my vehicle here is 18,000 so which one 's correct ninety-two the Pacifica 192 a civic new leadership and transformation council the Redis 19,000 Oasis IDO the recommendation coming out of the workshop on Friday afternoon is zero and there may be some background to that recommendation so this one yeah so this one Jimmy if you look at c in the recommendations yes Pacific youth leadership and transformation Council is to be referred to the community resilience and partnership fund okay along with those others on the basis that it might be a better match for that fund yeah and there may in fact be a different or better outcome by putting it through that process so there was some discussion about thattaway workshop and it may well be that this is the right place for it to be rather than considering it today okay and all of those organizations that are noted in fall yes staff will be contacting them to explain yes the rationale for why they 've been put into that category and and and when the outcomes will be resolution four are already under active consideration for the community resilience and partnership fund so they 'll be recommendations coming to Council at some point that we will be the decision-makers on and then those noted in five groups that were identified through our discussions in the workshop has been very likely to meet the criteria for that fund so they 're new ones which have been put into that process but Pacific youth leadership and transformation Council are already under active consideration for a recommendation for funding yes really the community resilience and partnership fund on which we 're the decision-makers and as I noted we 've already got a paper coming to Council later this month okay thank you any further questions all right FL yes Eddington net 1 to 2 and also for Anglican care is 1 to 6 I think Chris might have a record of there ok so adding to net we 've now got a resolution to fund two 13250 that 's good for clarity and Anglican care we 've got a recommendation to fund 15,000 against a recommended amount of 20,000 okay and that came into the workshop were not to be funded at that level so their decisions that were made as a result of the council of workshop it 's like so recommendations that were made as a result of the councillor workshop I 'd also like to make a comment when it 's appropriate in relation to MP and City Mission in India project just and to make sure that different projects that we fund are in fact aligned with other projects was there something you were wanting to move as regards that we you wanted to capture by waiver ideally yes now might be the time to do that yep so it 's basically what I 'm suggesting is that staff have further discussions worth Christchurch 's City mission and other relevant agencies if if it 's applicable relating to sheltered in emergency housing projects being aligned with Christchurch 's housing first program so this is something that you 're requesting staff to do yeah in terms of the way that we work with that particular organisation is obviously not a condition that we 're putting on the funding to get outcomes they 're aligned with and I 'm aware that there 's work that you and Glen Livingstone have been doing around the housing first I 'm happy to explain some of that briefly so and so clearly the the leaders of the different agencies have been discussing ways forward to progress housing first as a as a housing program and in effect they are beginning to work as a collective already and that 's great and it 's it 's so those discussions have already started in DNA I have also had some discussions with with the key people in those agencies I just want to make sure that those conversations continue and that so that in fact particularly the accommodation that housing that air counts to support an effect the different programs are aligned in an effect that they they don 't um conflict contradict each other that 's all so the purpose of any resolution that you 'd be proposing would be just to encourage that joined-up approach in that alignment that 's right so it 's really that staff have further discussions with them want if I head the ball with the wind capture if you press that a staff it 'll be quite well what we 'll do is come up with one resolution that will be everything that 's on the sheet that 's been circulated plus the couple of additional resolutions which have been signaled in the discussion we 've had this morning my intention would be once we 've got the wording captured which obviously we 're just working on now my intention would be to move this to get someone 's second it and fill as chair of the committee would you be happy to second so the relevant committee that deals with community funding you 'd be happy to second level and then at that point we 'll move into debate and then we 'll vote on the resolution once we get to that point okay so how we 're going with wording just to capture those two resolutions sporting principal residence total amount of community funding available for grant applications in each year by 10 percent in the long-term plan and then inflation adjusted each year after and other relevant agencies relating shuttle emergency housing projects been along with Christchurch is housing first programs yep and Sara you 're happy with the wording that we 've got there 13 okay great Pauline during on Friday thought we discussed the clown doctors we do we keep true with fish which application number so it 's number 2 3 9 without a baby foot for the resilience fund and so there was some discussion about this in the workshop the recommendation workshop I 'm not quite mad but I don 't know if we pursued the there was some discussion about it the mayor certainly raised that in the workshop and there was some discussion the result of that discussion was a recommendation not to fund I 'm not sure whether if this area can as well yep and organize our planet askew so with any further colorful staff but yeah there was some reasonably robust discussion about this at the the workshop I don 't think I don 't think we kind of pursued it to the end but um I 'm just wondering and some affirming it be moved to the dr you should be recorders for them because we 're recording the ones that have been included to the resilience fund there are a number of these that may well end up applying for discretionary response funding and my understanding is that staff would be working with um staff obviously will be getting back to all of these groups and where there are appropriate next steps in terms of further applications or other funds that would be appropriate for them to apply to that would be picked up in those conversations is my understanding am i right in saying that or is this since we 're able to it mean asking people by web resolution to go to the DRS raising expectations official or we can be confident the staff would raise any appropriate other funds in the feedback from this nomination that 's right yep so I think we can we can understand that that will happen naturally anyway bearing in mind we 've just stepped into the dr if to to move that there was yes we certainly coming out of his workshop we the discretion release we put additional money in the do if to address those that might have been referred to that 's over and above the balances are already existed indeed mr. the refresh of the year would it be possible for us to receive a memo after this meeting on which ones have been referred back to the DRS please yes yeah thank you okay so we were through questions it 's just a question of clarification question I wasn 't able to be there for the whole of the meeting on Tuesday afternoon I 'm just wondering about the the understanding or the reasoning behind giving the vegetarian society the six thousand and the Royal New Zealand flank at society two thousand seven hundred I 'm just wondering about the reasoning behind it decision sorry it 's on its one nine two is the Royal New Zealand blanket society two thousand seven hundred and 204 the New Zealand vegetarian society 6750 both of those were organizations that people asked questions about and by exception were referred to again during a priority to discussion and in the outcome was were allocated seventy-five percent of the recommended amount so one there are obviously expressions to support round the table to the amount allocated was 75% of that recommended and that reflected the total amount of the fund that was available for allocation and which obviously wasn 't able to be a hundred percent across the board and it was felt that a fair way of dealing with those which were raised by exception was to allocate a proportion of funding rather than a differing amount of funding for each worth noting the trunk it only applied it 's a 4,800 yeah didn 't apply for very much thank you okay so that now brings us to the end of some questions so I 'm now happy to move the set of resolutions which are in front of us Phil you 're happy to second less so that 's now been moved and seconded so I invite some councillors to debate the motion which is now in front of us Pauline we can look at Sierra 's number thirteen is there support and Perez were raising the total amount of community 10% in the LTP and then adjusted each year for Sicari yep and that has the effect of referring vets to the long term plan process and that decision would be made in its final form as part of the long-term plan decision-making Mike if it 's okay with Sara could we have men that to actually put in the financial year that we 're talking about for being the next one 1819 support on principle raising the total amount of community funding available for great allocations for by 10% and the long-term plan for Funimation of 19 it 's a financial year 1819 and then inflation ends in each year after that yeah and then you probably don 't need each year after allocations supporting principle raising the total amount community funding available for grant allocations by 10% in the long-term plan financial year 1819 with an inflation adjusted each year after that and that actually clarifies that I agree with the change of wording I think that just really clarifies it fillers the secondary of emotion you 're comfortable with that change thank you okay so now is since we 're adding like sort of new resolutions um just the whole issue of meeting with health board the DHB over the whole increase in health funding that we 're having to look at as a city I think is something that we 've previously resolved and I think it would be good to actually well I 'm supportive and principle of looking at raising our funding I 'm also very aware of the reliance that we 're picking up because of other other people 's responsibilities in the city mainly central governments funding that 's been cut or not sufficient to deal with the demand so I would like us to meet with the CDHP to discuss the ability to look at the whole grants funding that we 're giving out and the funding that they 're providing through those groups yes and there are a number of groups as part of the review of funding which is coming up there are a number of groups that we 're going to need to be meeting with in terms of working out our strategic response to the way that council 's priorities are at that high level and it would be reasonable to expect that we would be meeting with the health board we will be meeting with groups like creative New Zealand for example with the rather Foundation and other funders so that we can have a more joined-up approach to funding but also so that we can make sure that the funding priorities reflect reflect councils overall priorities and are actually a joined-up approach to what funding might be available or could be available or should be available for organisations working in various different sectors so that we are making sure that the funding that we put in as council reflects our priorities but also at the same time is leveraging those other funds to the best the best they can for other organisations so I would expect that that would be picked up as part of the funding review which will occur before we get your applications next time if you wanted to move something that would see that specifically taken account of as part of that funding review it would be perfectly in order yeah with the elected District Health Board like we haven 't met for ages like with we just have never seen have no relationship with them and it would be really good to achieve meet with them so I just think we should make what they 're just they 're kind of a district health board to discuss matters of mutual interest including the issue of grants funding yeah so let 's sum so just comparing that with what we 've got in paragraph 9 request staff reports Council by the end of September 2017 will terms a reference a comprehensive strategic funding review hold funds and the support the council provides a sustained support organization of the city including the relationship of the council with other funders so that arguably could be picked up in there but I appreciate that you know the current yeah you 're referring to discussion that 's occurred in the past which didn 't land in a result you 're obviously keen to pick that up by way of resolution now to ensure that there is a result more than happy to refer to that to staff just now yeah all right so if you can dictate once again what you want to put up there and we 'll them we 'll do that in 15 that the council seek a meeting with the kinery District Health Board to discuss the issue of grants funding towards health-related organizations towards health related organizations and as I say that 's something that would be very likely to be picked up as part of that review of funding anyway but I think it 's good that it 's specified given that you 're referring to discussion that 's happened in the past where there hasn 't been progress it would be good to see that progress in there in the next short short while that 's all picked up in paragraph 9 really you would expect as part of that comprehensive funding review that we would be meeting with all concerned organizations for the reasons that I just outlined so the wording here 15 was it that council meet with yep so that council meets with the countably District Health Board to discuss the issue of grants funding right so get rid of everything up to meet thank you okay you 're having to include yep no problem at all all right so now let 's move into debate so who is wanting to contribute to debate yawning I 'll be very quick just to say I know the heat and it 's already been said but thank you to the staff for the huge amount of work that you 've done I think one issue that we do need to focus on and hopefully the review can pick us up is the timing normally we 'd have a lot more time between the workshop and the decision-making and also a number of groups are waiting for the funding in September so it would be good to get this this looking at a timetable well I appreciate you 've had a whole bunch of changes with the community board structure and the funding allocation as well so it has been difficult but you know I just think this is one thing that council does that we should be incredibly proud that we support the community infrastructure in our 're investing upfront and communities rather than just the ambulance at the bottom of the cloth so I think we should be incredibly proud as a council that we continue to fund these organizations that have applied I know that not everyone will be happy with the quantum but at the end of the day with meeting a number of balancing demands and I think we 've got to a good outcome so I just wanted to acknowledge that it has been a huge effort from staff and the assessments and to look forward to getting the review done but it 's good that we made our locations today Thank You Pauline I 'd also like to acknowledge that the huge challenge this has been an acknowledge and staff for the myriad of obstacles you 've had to wade through to sort this out but also to acknowledge all the community groups that we have an an hour sitting at grassroots level that are doing their very best to strengthen our communities and it 's the council support of these groups that 's actually got us through the earthquakes the showed us then how important this is to support people in the community who are doing this and have the vision and the energy to go out there and support their local residents strengthening communities is kind of one of those words that 's almost lost that 's meaning because we say it so many times it 's probably better to talk about our social infrastructure when it 's really really vital for every city so I particularly support number 13 increasing the amount somehow we 've got to find that money I was actually considering doing it myself because an actual fact because we haven 't had an increase since I 'd say well before 2010 actually that it 's actually been decreasing so I think that 's a very good move to you to actually start looking at this fund whereas this has been totally over subscribed to it it makes it very very difficult to sort out who gets what and actually every application and here we 've all gone into batch show everything that we we support we said but this is a really good group been really really hard and I think all of us are going to go forward and wit with staff to try and find ways through our networks or through our funding pops here that we can support the ones that haven 't been supported today somehow so yeah thank you stuff and thank you Christ huge thank you very much no I 've got Phil Dion Glenn and Ann and Jimmy so Phil um some of the things I was going to say he had been said you know I won 't be too long but I join other counselors and sincerely thinking staff the huge amount of work goes into this and and I think this is this round has never been harder for me as a counselor especially because of that much increased demand and in fact as has been referred to a decreased availability and supply or the funding and I 'm glad we have are going to look at it in the long term plane I 'm also glad that you know that in fact we 've got we 're going there 's going to be and and and heavenly love you to clarify met that all of us funding is going to be essential there 's a lot of different streams here and we have to make sure in fact that we 're comparing apples with apples and so I look forward to doing that in in working with staff to achieving it so big thing so to staff again thank you for dealing yeah I 'll just echo those words about thank you to the staff but also thank you to all the community groups out there who do provide such a level of service to our city and actually support so many people and try and create the city as a cool place I was actually gonna ask for number 13 to be put separately but um I 've actually just sort of thought about it a little bit deeper and I think it 'll be fun the only thing I was going to think about with putting it separately is supporting and principle or doing an investigation to see if it can be done available because I 'm just worried about precedent budgets are very tight and I just don 't want to be putting more money into budgets without actually putting some real thought into how that money 's coming or where it 's going to come from and those kind of things but I think the staff will be able to do this so I 'm pretty happy with that and that was all I want to say I already have a request to put 13 separately anyway so I will do that Thank You Glen thank you yes also wish to acknowledge our hard-working staff for all their hard work behind the scenes as well as this process which isn 't always easy my concerns particularly remain over the housing and mental health kind of sectors of our community if you like in that regard I support Phil 's move over the housing first model in terms of having that congruence with the other agencies so that we 're all on the same page because it is quite a different model that essentially places people and housing literally first and then provides those services to go with them it such as better women 's trust and Aviva better women 's trust be as the burden of most of the violence cases in our community and seeks to work with the community in trying to make progress there Aviva 's more at the kind of high end of some of those cases obviously with the partnership fund pleased over that with resolution 13 that 's a good move Sara I part of me though I was thinking let 's not stop there so yes totally agree with taking the index you know take it to CPI but next year do we want to explore even taking it further another team yeah okay and and there are some other groups on aware of missed out on funding at this stage but it 's really hope they get some through the DRF process later on thank you and just totally in support of number thirteen and you know what to add sort of the word urgency some urgently somewhere in there because obviously being a new person coming to this process have been totally and struck by the fact that the resources this is about our as people have said our community infrastructure in future proofing our community so very much endorsing number thirteen thank you very much for the for the work that staff have done I mean it 's incredibly challenging process and it 's a very difficult one when you making decisions about who 's in and who 's out so I would really like our legacy as a council to be a group of people who really prioritized people in their needs so hopefully that 's what we will do going forward there thank you Thank You Jimmy because you know for me to actually they are all the way then to kind of apply for funding from the Metro the discretionary fund it 's okay but still kind of the the way we were we you know the israa tricky so the several dimensional items searching I think that 's a very good recommendation Seto but they say I 'm concerned we like to emphasize this kind of active citizenship or partnership how about how do we to make the happen no give a funding not sufficient very difficult in otherwise I 'm but here comes in this year the multi culture strategy has been a top by the council and also that has been the kind of formal lunch by the council where makes you relate to strengthen order engage in engagement with lost multicultural if we recognize 22 percentage of this culture diverse the community now and more maybe we 're more but how the way to make the happen so our engagement with name this might might also my petit vour concept yes so paso de it 's my mind my my view yes thank you thank you so in front of us we 've got a spreadsheet with 258 different organizations and different groups that are doing some great work out there in the community and the thing I think that strikes all of us is the huge amount of work that 's going on out there through these various groups a lot of it voluntary huge amount of voluntary work going on out there the whole variety of work the volume of work and the value of that work I think is we have eight million dollars worth of applications for three million dollars worth of funding in round figures that tells us the the capacity and the opportunity and I think it also shows the limitations of what we 're able to do with the amount of funding which is available and it 's become clear I think as we 've gone through the workshop and this whole process that we need to take a a more joined-up approach to the way that we plan to use and do use this funding strengthening communities Council can only ever be a catalyst in that space is the community groups that do the work to make our community stronger but we along with other funders are a catalyst in their space and we need to make sure that we use that role as well as we possibly can so that from the relatively small amount of funding that we 've got to provide versus the large number of applications we get to the results that we we want as a sitting and as communities so that 's where the the comprehensive funding review the process that we 've gone through really comes into play that 's where we look at where we can make the way that we administer this funding easier and more effective for the organizations maybe easier for ourselves and the amount of work that staff have done has been noted there 's a huge amount of work goes into not only this but a number of other funding processes events and festivals and the funding was administered by the community boards and so on a huge amount of work so if there 's a way that we can look at reviewing some of that that makes it easier for applicants and easier to do the assessments that 's something that we certainly would value and certainly where there are opportunities for it for us to take up a more joined-up approach with other funders that are active in this space so that we can again get some get better value from the money that we as a council we as a city are putting into these organizations and it 's for that reason that we have referred a number and partnership fund we now have this new fund that may turn out to be a better match for those organizations which are already in the process of being considered for that fund and there 'll be decisions that council will make once that paper comes to council those in item 5 which are groups which have been identified through this decision-making process of quite likely to be a good fit for that new fund as well and obviously we 'll be making those considerations on staff recommendation within a very short time as well so item 10 in the resolutions establishes the funding working group the comprehensive funding review that we 've talked about staff have already been doing some work on that item 10 puts some governments support around that process so that that then reports back to council further work obviously required item 11 in the resolutions around the early learning center funding this is something which has been discussed on a number of occasions in the past this is where we 're essentially funding the early learning centers for the rent they pay to counsel for worth looking to see whether there are different ways that we can look at some doing that whether there 's a better process that we can come up with to support those early learning centers and then item 12 in the resolution in order to be able to take the most comprehensive far-reaching approach to the review we need the freedom to do this so whilst we did encourage groups to apply for multi-year funding three-year funding the thinking has been that it would better to allow us the opportunity for the funding review to be as far-reaching as it can be in needs to be without the constraint of having groups that have been funded for three years as we move into that process but of course one of the things that we 're looking at through that funding review is the way that we can provide more certainty and more ease of application and reporting for the groups that are applying so that 's certainly something that we 'll be taking into account as we go through that funding review even though it does mean that we haven this particular time so that we 've got the flexibility so that certainly provides some explanations to the the resolutions and the thinking behind them but once again to conclude thank you once again to and to staff who 've done all of this work thank you to the groups who do all of that work out in our community and whose applications we 've had the privilege and the opportunity to consider so on that note I will put the resolution I 'll put everything apart from paragraph 13 first of all and then we 'll take paragraph 13 separately so I 'll put the main resolution excluding paragraph 13 all those in favor high against that 's carried and I 'll put paragraph 13 all those in favor say aye aye against that 's carried thank you very much thank you and I 'll declare the meeting closed and happy and it 's not hot being City but I 'm working for here mr. cheek could you say one thing look um thank you very much for look for the con you _"

    "text": "domani agenda item three the metropolitan strengthening communities fund and I 'd like to open by getting staff just to make some commentary on the report and the work that has got us to the set of recommendations that are in front of us today thank you chair Thank You counselors if I could also just again just very quickly just acknowledge and thank all of the staff involved in this process which has been you know here we worked with River Island and here we had today to make these decisions so just to go through the available budgets for the metropolitan strengthening communities fund we have a total available budget of just over three point three million dollars and we have we had total requests and the amount of just over eight million dollars so significantly more than than what 's available that 's come from 238 individual applicants I don 't have the ability that the the amount of applications as comparable with previous years when we look at the Early Learning Center 's major orgs and general implications you know plus or minus a few that we do have one pre-existing commitment one three-year commitment that was approved by council and the 1516 financial year that 's to the the Youth Council so that has already been granted we have nine early learning centers which staff are recommending for funding this year while we work to develop policy around community organizations who use community facilities as worked on and developed we have nine major organizations an available funding pool of 1.2 million dollars they are requesting 1.7 just over one point seven million dollars and then we have a total of 219 general applications requesting 5.9 million and have an available budget of just over 1.8 million dollars so again some significant work gone in here now so all of these implications have gone through a process of obviously making an application specialist staff have been assist these applications against councils priorities and outcomes for funding and the relevant criteria and taking into account the the available budget as well there are seven applications that council identified and a workshop last week there are potential fits if you like for the community resilience and partnership fund with counsel and the not-too-distant future what else have we got here sorry I just lost my place to on my notes that 's really sort of who 'll have probably got to say chair I could probably hand it over to you now to just to carry on thank you very much and can I also just reinforce the commentary around the huge amount of work that 's gone into the set of recommendations that are in front of us today I 'd certainly also like to acknowledge and thank staff for all of the hard work that 's got us to the point that we 're at assessing the applications in the early part of the process to bring staff recommendations to us and then the huge amount of work on Friday afternoon that went into supporting the workshop that we had as well so thank you to you and to the team of staff that are supported the whole process is certainly made life a lot easier for us that we 've got that level of support so thank you I probably should just very quickly also questions for runs thank you very much thank you so we 've got two documents which are either additional or change to support the meeting today one of which is the most up-to-date set of recommendations that came out of the workshop on Friday afternoon and the other river which is a set of resolutions which have been circulated that will in fact that we 've got on the board in front of us on the screen which will be the resolutions that we 're working with today as well so the way that I proposed to run this would be to have any discussion and any questions based on the report which is in front of us the spreadsheet that I just referred to and so the resolutions that are in front of us as the the proposal coming into this meeting and then he further changes that were to be made or to be proposed would be changes to those documents rather than the documents that are in the agenda which of course was produced prior to the workshop on Friday so now let 's move to any 's been an enormous amount of work gone into this and it was incredibly difficult and it was really disheartening to see I guess stage there was a number of the priority two ones that were originally not recommended for funding because he wasn 't budget available and I understand you know there was that five hundred thousand taken out for the partnership fund but compared to other years and I had asked for this last week but don 't hear that year exam how has our community funding they know that I said how does it compare to other years so have we got more in a strictly dollar term now than we did in the past or is it the same as it has been so for the last five or six years are we referring to funding going to community boards community funding generally so community at the funding that we give to the community either metropolitan communities fund all ending because I mean it because it has varied because so we have a different allocation now future power some equations we can 't just do just okay so so we haven 't made sort of automatic adjustments for either inflation or for the fact that you know post-quake we 've had a huge increase in the number of groups that have popped up that are doing strengthening communities type we it 's kind of just stayed stable Hawaii staple the whole way immediately after the earthquakes two other funders other funds we 're operating which yeah you know covered some of that and what I 'd like to maybe foreshadow is adding a sort of an in-principle resolution for the the council to consider that we can ask staff to increase by 10 percent the available community funding to be divided up between metro and community boards in the LTP process in certain principal decision to raise it by 10 percent so it 's probably worth noting that for this year in next year there will be the additional funding because of the extra money that 's coming for the community response fund so it might be in the year four years following that and the LTP that you want to inflation you just the spot on the agenda for the LTP process that we consider as the LT as part of the LTP process would be entirely in order so if you 've got some wording that you 'd like to add to our resolutions that we 're crafting today I 'd be happy to to incorporate that in the main resolution yep great thank you all right so if we can work on that and and add it to the the resolution that will be good thank you Jonnie I just want to just check on two things one is who set the criteria for the funding applications and when was a council approves that approved the current criteria so the criteria was I guess developed and workshopped with staff and an elected member working party and then approved by council cool and when was that that was two years ago I believe now so this is the second year under the current criteria okay thank you um and the second question was so there 's a number of ones that have been put into mich important but they look like they 're local just wondering if you can just explain to us how you 've done the Hat and whether that 's changed or it 's the same as from two years ago and then just related to that us also is there a process by which some of Community Board applications can be put to that new partnership resilience fund because I can think of some in our area for example that would qualify it in line with the ones that we 're recommending today but I don 't know what the process is to do that so sorry is closed so to answer the first part of your question counselor around metropolitan local organizations and as where the groups tell us that the participants come from so the people that used the services that the organization provides currently if the spread is covering four or more community board areas they are a Metropolitan organization that was increased this year previous years it was three or more community board areas and the second part of the question we said about the field to the community is from the community board deprecations me for the first tranche but also the update memo from the ones that there are some councils hadn 't read that previous memo you I think you had it or read it out so we can update you with the process for doing that like email so everyone gets the same information it 's like a process to put in the ones at our community board to that first chance for consideration but I don 't know what their process is okay thank you my understanding is that the paper on that community resilience and partnership fund is only a matter of weeks away from coming to council it should be with council before the end of this month is my understanding so we 'll have the opportunity to have those conversations at that time except the boards are doing their funding now so that 's why it 's quite urgent because they 'll obviously want to know if there 's an opportunity so if we can get some earlier information to the boards that would be helpful thank you any further questions Jimi whether my vehicle sniffing from here vehicle here is 18,000 so which one 's correct 92 the Pacifica 192 Pacific use leadership and transformation council the red 19,000 Oasis II know the recommendation coming out of the workshop on Friday afternoon is zero and there may be some background to that recommendation so this one yep so this one Jimmy if you look at c in the recommendations yes Pacific Youth Leadership and transformation Council is to be referred to the community resilience and partnership fund okay along with those others on the basis that it might be a better match for that fund yeah and there may in fact be a different or better outcome on by putting it through that process okay so there was some discussion about that away workshop and it may well be that this is the right place for it to be rather than considering it today okay and all of those organizations that are noted in for yes staff will be contacting them to explain yes the rationale for why they 've been put into that category and when the outcomes will be considered okay so apparently the the consideration for the community resilience and partnership fund so there 'll be recommendations coming to Council at some point that we will be the decision-makers on and then those noted in five groups that were identified through our discussions in the workshop yes as being very likely to meet the criteria for that fund so they 're new ones which have been put into that process but Pacific youth leadership and transformation Council are already under active consideration for a recommendation for funding yes really the community resilience and partnership fund on which we 're the decision-makers and as I noted we 've already got a paper coming to council later this month okay thank you any further questions all right don 't fail yes Edington it one to two and also for England here is one to six no I think Chris might have a record of there okay so adding to net we 've now got a resolution to fund two 13,250 that 's good for clarity and englander KanCare we 've got a recommendation to front 15,000 against a recommended amount of 20,000 okay and they were into the workshop were not to be funded at that level so their decisions that were made as a result of the council of workshop that 's right so recommendations that were made as a result of the councillor workshop I 'd also like to make a comment when it 's appropriate in relation to Incan City mission in in the approaching just and to make sure that different projects that we fund are in fact aligned with other projects was there something you were wanting to move as regards that that you wanted to capture by waiver identity yes now might be the time to do that yep so it 's basically what I 'm suggesting is that staff here further discussions worth Christchurch 's City mission and other relevant agencies if if it 's applicable relating to sheltered in emergency housing projects being aligned with Christ churches housing first program so this is something that you 're requesting staff to do yeah in terms of the way that we work with that particular organization is obviously not a condition that we 're putting on the funding but it outcomes they 're aligned with and I 'm aware that there 's work that you and and Glenlivet stone have been doing around the housing first I 'm happy to explain some of that briefly so and so clearly the the the leaders of the different agencies have been discussing ways forward to progress housing first as a as a housing program and in effect they are beginning to work as a collective already and that 's great and it 's it 's so those discussions have already started in DNA I have also had some discussions with with the king people in those agencies I just want to make sure that in fact those conversations continue and that so that in fact particularly the accommodation that housing that air counts to support that effect the different programs are aligned in an effect that they they don 't um conflict contradict each other that 's all so the purpose of any resolution that you 'd be proposing would be just to encourage that joined-up approach in that alignment that 's right so it 's really that staff have further discussions some wording that you want if I hit the ball with the wind capture if you press that a staff that 'll be great well what we 'll do is come up with one resolution that will be everything that 's on the sheet that 's been circulated plus the couple of additional resolutions which have been signaled in the discussion we 've had this morning my intention would be once we 've got the wording captured which obviously we 're just working on there my intention would be to move that to get some water second it and fill this chair of the committee would you be happy to second so the relevant committee that deals with community funding you 'd be happy to second level and then at that point we 'll move into debate and then we 'll vote on the resolution once we get to that point okay so how are we going with wording just to capture those two resolutions supporting principal residence total amount of community funding available for grant applications in each year by 10 percent in the long-term plan and then inflation with Christchurch City Mission and other relevant agencies relating shelter emergency housing projects been a longer Christchurch 's housing first programs yep and Sara you 're happy with the wording that we 've got there 13 okay great Pauline during on Friday we discussed the clown doctors we do we keep true with fish which application numbers but it 's number 2 3 9 without a baby a foot for the resilience fund and so there was some discussion about this in the workshop the recommendation from the workshop is not too far I 'm not quite mad but I don 't know if we pursued the there was some discussion about it the the mayor certainly raised that in the workshop and there was some discussion the result of that discussion was a recommendation not to fund I 'm not sure whether if this area for as well yep organize if I ask you so with any further concert from staff but yeah there was some reasonably robust discussion about this at the the workshop don 't think I don 't think we kind of pursued it to the it to the DRF was a decision yep so should that they move to the d-r-e issue recorders as recording the ones that have been included to the resilience fund there are a number of these that may well end up applying for discretionary response funding and my understanding is that staff would be working with um staff obviously will be getting back to all of these groups and where there are appropriate next steps in terms of further applications or other funds that would be appropriate for them to apply to him that would be picked up in those conversations is my understanding am i right in saying that or is this is really available and then asking people by wave resolution to go to the area perhaps raising expectations feeling official or we can be confident the staff would raise any appropriate other funds in the feedback from this one that 's right yep so I think we can we can understand that that will happen naturally anyway but bearing in mind we 've just dipped into the DRF to to move but we can 't_''_1236.3 do that coming out of his workshop we were very comfortable with the amount that was left in the discretion releases we put additional money in the DOF to address those that might have been referred to it that 's over and above the balance that are already assisted indeed mr. the refresh of the year would it be possible for us to receive a memo after this meeting on which ones have been with food back to the DRF please yes possible yeah thank you okay so we 're through questions it 's just a question verification question I wasn 't able to be there for the whole of the meeting on Tuesday afternoon I 'm just wondering about the the understanding or the reasoning behind giving the vegetarian associate on plank at society 2700 I 'm just wondering about the reasoning behind that decision sorry it 's on it 's 192 is the Royal New Zealand blanket Society 2700 and 204 the New Zealand vegetarian society 6750 both of those were organisations that people asked questions about and by exception were referred to again during a priority 2 discussion and felt it was support were allocated 75% of the recommended amount so one there are obviously expressions of support around the table to the amount allocated was 75% of that recommended and that reflected the total amount of the fund that was available for allocation and which obviously wasn 't able to be a hundred percent across the board and it was felt that a fair way of dealing with those which were raised by exception was to allocate a proportion of funding rather than a differing amount of funding for each worth noting the bank it only applied it 's a 4,800 yeah they didn 't apply for very much thank you okay so that now brings us to the end of some questions so I 'm now happy to move the set of resolution resolution x '_''_1380.969 which are in front of us fill you 're happy to second less so that 's now been moved and seconded so I invite councillors to debate the motion which is now in front of us Pauline yes we can look at Sierra 's number 13 is there support oppose were year by teen percent so raise it by 10% in the LTP and then adjusted each year is it curry yep and that has the effect of referring vets to the long term plan process and that decision would be made in its final form as part of the long-term plan decision-making Mike if it 's okay with Sarah could we have men that to actually put in the financial year that we 're talking about for being the next one 18 19 support and principle raising the total amount of community funding available for grant allocations for by 10 percent and the long-term plan for formation of 19 for financial year 1819 and then inflation lens in each year after that yeah and then you probably own it each year after allocations supporting principal raising the total amount of community funding available for grant allocations by ten percent of the long-term plan financial year 1819 with an inflation adjusted each year after that and that actually clarifies that I agree would change wording I think that just really clarifies it fillers the secondary of the motion you 're comfortable question or we know moving into the bank since we 're adding like sort of new resolutions um just the whole issue of meeting with the Health Board the DHB over the whole increase in health funding that we 're having to look at as a city I think is something that we 've previously resolved and I think it would be good to actually well I 'm supportive and principle of looking at raising our funding I 'm also very aware of the reliance that we 're picking up because of other other people 's responsibilities in the city mainly central governments funding that 's been cut or not sufficient to deal with the demand so I would like us to meet with the CDHP to discuss the ability to look at the whole grants funding that we 're giving out and the funding that they 're providing to those groups yes and there were a number of groups as part of the review of funding which is coming up there are a number of groups that we 're going to need to be meeting with in terms of fund various organizations in terms of working out what council 's priorities are at that high level and it would be reasonable to expect that we would be meeting with the health board we will be meeting with groups like creative New Zealand for example with the rather Foundation and other funders so that we can have a more joined-up approach to funding but also so that we can make sure that the funding priorities reflect reflect councils overall priorities and are actually a joined-up approach to what funding might be a could be available law should be available for organizations working in various different sectors so that we 're making sure that the funding that we put in as counsel reflects our priorities but also at the same time is leveraging those other funds to the best the best they can for other organizations so I would expect that that would be picked up as part of the funding review which will occur before we get your applications next time if you wanted to move something that would see that specifically taken account of as part of that funding I don 't know when we last met with the elected District Health Board like we haven 't met for ages like with we just have never seen have no relationship with them and it would be really good to actually meet with them so I just think we should make what they 're just the kind of a district health board to discuss matters of mutual interest including the issue of grants funding yep so let 's sum so just comparing that with what we 've got in paragraph 9 request staff reporting council by the end of September 2017 will terms of reference a comprehensive strategic funding review haul of funds and the support the council provides a sustained support organization of the city including the relationship of the council with other funders so that arguably could be picked up in there but I appreciate that you know you 're referring to yeah you 're referring to discussion that 's occurred in the past which didn 't land in a result you 're obviously keen to pick that up by way of resolution now to ensure that there specifically yeah so of you some wording we provided to staff just now yep all right so if you can dictate once again what you want to put up there and we 'll them we 'll do that 15 that the council seek a meeting with the kindred District Health Board to discuss the issue of grants funding towards health-related organizations towards health-related organizations and as I say that 's something that would be very likely to be picked up as part of that review of funding anyway but I think it 's good that it 's specified given that you 're referring to discussion that 's happened in the past where there hasn 't been progress it would be good to see that progress in there in the next short term short while that 's all picked up in paragraph 9 really you would expect as part of that comprehensive funding review that we would be meeting with all concerned organizations for the reasons that I just outlined so the wording here 15 was it that council meet with yep so that council meet with the countably District Health death oh so we we can yeah all right so get rid of everything up to meet thank you okay y 'all_''_1793.37 happy to include yep no problem at all alright so now let 's move into debate so who is wanting to contribute to debate yawning I 'll be very quick just to say I know the heat and it 's already been said but thank you to the staff for the huge amount of work that you 've done I think one issue that we do need to focus on and hopefully the review can pick us up is the timing normally we 'd have a lot more time between the workshop and the decision-making and also a number of groups are waiting for the funding in September so it would be good to get this this looking at the timetable but I appreciate you 've had a whole bunch of changes with the community board structure and the funding allocation as well so it has been difficult but you know I just think this is one thing that council does that we should be incredibly proud of ultimately saves a lot of money because we 're investing upfront in communities rather than just the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff so I think we should be incredibly proud as a council that we continue to fund these organizations that have applied I know that not everyone will be happy with the quantum but at the end of the day we 've meeting a number of balancing demands and I think we 've got to a good outcome so I just wanted to acknowledge that there has been a huge effort from staff and the assessments and to look forward to getting the review done but it 's good that we made our locations today thank you pulling I 'd also like to acknowledge that a huge challenge this has been in acknowledging staff for the myriad of obstacles you 've had to wade through to sort this out but also to acknowledge all the community groups that we have an in our city at grassroots level that are doing their very best to strengthen our communities and it 's the council support of these groups that did and it shows us and it showed us then how important this is to support people in the community who are doing this and have the vision and the energy to go out there and support their local residents strengthening communities is kind of one of those foods that 's almost lost its meaning because we say it so many times it 's probably better to talk about our social infrastructure and it 's really really vital for every city so I particularly support number 13 increasing the amount somehow we 've got to find that money I was actually considering doing it myself because an actual fact because we haven 't had an increase since I 'd say well before 2010 actually it 's actually been decreasing so I think that 's a very good move there to actually start looking at this fund whereas this has been totally over subscribed to it it makes it very very difficult to sort out who gets what and actually every application and here we 've all gone in to bat show everything that we we support we said but this they all are and so it 's been really really hard and I think all of us are going to go forward and work with staff to try and find ways through our networks or through our funding pots here that we can support the ones that haven 't been supported today somehow so yeah thank you stuff and thank you Christ huge thank you very much no I 've got Phil Dion Glen and Ann and Jimmy so Phil um some of the things I was going to say have been said you know it won 't be too long but I join other councillors and sincerely thinking staff huge amount of work goes into this and I think this is this round has never been harder for me as a councillor especially because of that much increased demand and in fact as has been referred to a decreased availability and supply of the funding and I 'm glad we have are going to look at it in the long term plain I 'm also glad that yeah that in fact we 've got we 're going there 's resilience partnership fund and and and heavenly love you to clarify that all of us funding is going to be essential there 's a lot of different streams here and we have to make sure in fact that we 're comparing apples with apples and so I look forward to doing that in in working with staff to achieving it so big things so to staff again thank you deal yeah I 'll just echo those words about thank you to the staff but also thank you to all the community groups out there who do provide such a level of service to our city and actually support so many people and try and create the city as a cool place I was actually going to ask for number 13 to be put separately but um I 've actually just sort of thought about it a little bit deeper and I think it 'll be fun the only thing I was going to think about with putting it separately is supporting and principle or doing an investigation to see if it can be done available because I 'm just worried our budgets budgets are very tight and I just don 't want to be putting more money into budgets without actually putting some real thought into how that money 's coming or where it 's going to come from and those kind of things but I think the staff will be able to do this so I 'm pretty happy with that and that was all I want to say I already have a request to put 13 separately anyway and so I will do that Thank You Glen thank you yes also wish to acknowledge our hard-working staff for all their hard work behind the scenes as well as this process which isn 't always easy my concerns particularly remain over the housing and mental health kind of sectors of our community if you like in that regard our support Phil 's move over the housing first model in terms of having that congruence with the other agencies so that we 're all on the same page because it is quite a different model that essentially places people in the housing literally first and then provides those services to in priorities for agencies such as better women 's trust and Aviva better women 's trust B as the burden of most of the violence cases in our community and seeks to work with community in trying to make progress there Aviva 's more at the kind of high end of some of those cases obviously with the partnership fund pleased over that with resolution 13 that 's a good move Sara I part of me though is thinking let 's not stop there so yes Toby agree with taking the index you know take it to CPI but next year do we want to explore even taking it further another team so yeah okay and and there are some other groups on aware of missed out on funding at this stage but it 's really hope they get some through the DRF process later on thank you and just totally in support of number 13 and you know what to add sort of the word urgency some urgently somewhere in there because obviously being a new person coming to this process have been totally and struck by the fact to be because this is about our as people have said as community infrastructure and future proofing our community so very much endorsing number 13 thank you very much for this for the work that staff have done I mean it 's incredibly challenging process and it 's a very difficult one when you making decisions about who 's in and who 's out so I would really like our legacy as a council to be a group of people who really prioritized people and their needs so hopefully that 's what we will do going forward thank you Thank You Jimmy we should stop across all those not easy and then to kind of apply for funding from the maître de discretionary fund a that 's okay but still kind of the the the way we were be you know that is restrictive so the several dimensional items searching I think that 's a very good recommendation sexual but they say I 'm concerned that we like to emphasize this kind of that active citizenship or partnership how about how do we to make the happen know if a district are key are they difficult in otherwise I 'm Patil concerned this year the multi culture strategy has been adopted by the council and also that has been the kind of formal runs by the council where as you will to strengthen our engage in entitlement with lost multicultural if we recognize 22 percentage of this culture diverse the community now and what maybe were more for how to wait to make the happen so our engagement with name this might might also my cat evil comes said yes so soda this my mind my my view yes thank you thank you so in front of us we 've got a spreadsheet with 258 different organizations and different groups that are doing some great work out there in the community and the thing I think that strikes all of us is the huge amount of work that 's going on out there through these various groups a lot of it voluntary huge amount of voluntary work going on out there the whole variety of work the volume of work and the value of that work I think is something have a trillion dollars worth of applications for three million dollars worth of funding in round figures that tells us the the capacity and the opportunity and I think it also shows the limitations of what we 're able to do with the amount of funding which is available and it 's become clear I think as we 've gone through the workshop and this whole process that we need to take a a more joined-up approach to the way that we plan to use and do use this funding strengthening communities council can only ever be a catalyst in that space is the community groups that do the work to make our community stronger but we along with other funders are a catalyst in that space and we need to make sure that we use that role as well as we possibly can so that from the relatively small amount of funding that we 've got to provide versus the large number of applications we get to the results that we we want as a sitting and as communities so that 's where the the comprehensive funding review which process that we 've gone through really comes into play that 's where we look at where we can make the way that we administer this funding easier and more effective for the organization 's may be easier for ourselves and the amount of work that staff have done has been noted there 's a huge amount of work goes into not only this but a number of other funding processes events and festivals and the funding that 's administered by the community boards and so on a huge amount of work so if there 's a way that we can look at reviewing some of that that makes it easier for applicants and easier to do the assessments that 's something that we certainly would value and certainly where there are opportunities for it is for us to take up a more joined-up approach with other funders that are active in this space so that we can again get some get better value from the money that we as a council we as a city are putting into these organizations and it 's for that reason that we have the community resilience and partnership fund we now have this new fund that may turn out to be a better match for those organizations which are already in the process of being considered for that fund and there 'll be decisions that council will make once that paper comes to council those in item five which are groups which have been identified through this decision-making process of quite likely to be a good fit for that new fund as well and obviously we 'll be making those considerations on staff recommendation within a very short time as well so item 10 in the resolutions establishes the funding working group the comprehensive funding review that we 've talked about staff have already been doing some work on that item 10 puts some government support around that process so that that then reports back to council further work obviously required item 11 in the resolutions around the Early Learning Center funding this is something which has been discussed on a number of occasions in the past this is where we 're essentially funding the early learning centers for the rent that they I think it 's worth looking to see whether there are different ways that we can look at some doing that whether there 's a better process that we can come up with to support those early learning centers and then item 12 in the resolution in order to be able to take the most comprehensive far-reaching approach to the review we need the freedom to do this so whilst we did encourage groups to apply for multi-year funding three-year funding the thinking has been that it would better to allow us the opportunity for the funding review to be as far-reaching as it can be and needs to be without the constraint of having groups that have been funded for three years as we move into that process but of course one of the things that we 're looking at through that funding review is the way that we can provide more certainty and more ease of application and reporting for the groups that are applying so that 's certainly something that we 'll be taking into account as we go through that funding review even though it does three-year funding arrangements at this particular time so that we 've got the flexibility so that certainly provides some explanations to the the resolutions and the thinking behind them but once again to conclude thank you once again to and to staff who 've done all of this work thank you to the groups who do all of that work out in our community and whose applications we 've had the privilege and the opportunity to consider so on that note I will put the resolution or put everything apart from paragraph 13 first of all and then we 'll take paragraph 13 separately so I 'll put the main resolution excluding paragraph 13 all those in favor aye against that 's carried and I 'll put paragraph 13 all those in favor say aye aye against that 's carried thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "a bouncing baby boy so yes I also will accept an apology from councillor Goff as well yep Goff and Jim pre absence from the council oh man G right and would someone like to move that yani seconded by Tim I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried okay so this is going to be a little bit challenging because I wanted all the actual papers on the on one part of the hub but so if we could turn to council 24 August 2017 and it 's one two three four fourth item and supplementary agenda number 42 South Shore floodplain management short term options I should note that the community board wanted to make a deputation in relation to this but on understanding that this was deferral from last week 's meeting the time for deputations was last week so I just wanted to acknowledge the fact that the community board has you know a very very specific and direct interest in that and since we 've had the this paper before us obviously they 've taken recommendations which were actually slightly different from the recommendations that went to the community board for consideration prior to our coming to Council last week but I 've also been advised that unfortunately with a number of things that were happening with the community board only three members of the community board were actually at that meeting at the time they considered this I think councillor Livingston went and well and they said they said you wear white as a sheet actually not green but yeah so but yes so I think that was unfortunate given that both the chair was absent and the in the council was absent so the two counselors so what I 'm what so what they 've done is that they have worked with councilor east in terms of and I 've been involved as well in terms of trying to rework some of the recommendations I haven 't had a chance to circulate those but I 've had a discussion with staff to see whether they are appropriate so if you want to bring those recommendations up because I really liked to put these essentially the first one is the same we 're receiving the report with the attachments we are approving option one which reduce flooding risks and the areas identified and proceeds with the area from Bridge Street BT Street and South Shore SP the report so it 's the it 's it 's what we were considered last week can I just go through this please essentially it 's the Broad Street to be T Street and South Shore so it 's two of their areas the one area is to be to food on a very short-term basis the proposed work and the South New Brighton Park isn 't it south of Beatty Street as a and more south just is it just south of Beatty yeah so so you don 't need the end south of Beatty Street pending further investigation and discussion with staff the community the coastal Burwood community board consultancy can and other relevant entities to seek solutions which ensure that Bund and other measures including soft engineering maximize the opportunities to mitigate against coastal erosion in that area the very specific reason for deferring that there is a concern that with the positioning of the Bund that we were considering that that the community might feel that we weren 't interested and protecting the coastline against erosion which is not the case there are options around that that could provide that protection but when we 're in that coastal environment we 're talking with E can because it is their responsibility in terms of the management of the of the coastal environment so in the coastal policy statement comes into effect as well so we 've really want to do this properly but also indicate the community that we 're not interested and just dealing with the flooding issue to the exclusion of the protection against coastal erosion and it 's it very much fits into our multi hazards approach to natural hazards and then and this came up last week very strongly in terms of the decision to affect the transfer on South Shore South New Brighton and Brooklyns residential red zone land to the council again there was a misunderstanding in the community that that this would mean that there was a difference area when ownership of the land makes no difference so whether it 's owned by Lynn 's or owned by the council the Greater Christchurch regeneration Act 2016 applies and I certainly made that very clear and my statements but what I found out after the meeting was that some of the community wanted to make a deputation last week but they asked for that during the course of the meeting instead of notifying prior to the meeting that they wanted to make a deputation and and so that reinforced for me that the community is under amis henshin as to the function of ownership when we 're dealing with residential red zone land so I want to make it absolutely clear that the agreed transfer to the council effectively training changing ownership makes no difference to the obligations under the Greater Christchurch regeneration act and that the council will continue working collaboratively on a long-term regeneration strategy for South Shore and South New Brighton with regenerate Christchurch which remains responsible for the development of any regeneration plan and the residential red zone if such a plan is required so that we make around ownership I did think that I 'd made that clear last week but it 's you know the fact that I said at a meeting doesn 't actually mean that it gets communicated out from here so we need to sort of ensure that we get that message through and that that 's very clear that and then five and six are essentially what we had in the paper last week now Stephen I think is important and I think it 's important for a number of reasons if you could lift that up but yet thank you the reason why it 's important is that this is an approach that I want to actually recommend to all community boards and if councillors can just make a note of this and as you know Andrew and I have been meeting with individual councillors and what 's come up as a sense of frustration that an issue can be dealt with it the community board level it can be dealt with at the council level but there seems to be a lack of mechanism for actually bringing 's a resolution that staff a reporting back on so I really want us to think about utilizing a monthly standard standing item approach so that individual community boards can actually put on their agendas issues that are relevant to their community board that they want to have regular updates on that doesn 't mean that staff have to produce a monthly report that means that there is a standing aye on the agenda so that there can be a reporting mechanism or there can be a mechanism for the community to engage with the community board on a regular basis on issues that may or may not be concerning them so and this one we request the coastal board community board have a monthly standing item regeneration strategy in South Shore and South New Brighton so there is regular reporting to the board that also provides an opportunity for the community to engage if needed and then finally request that staff create a dedicated channel of communication and that 's leaving some options open because it may well be a page on the on the web page or it board I 'm leaving it open but a dedicated channel of communication that provides advice to the affected communities on roles and responsibilities with appropriate links to other sites because regenerate Christchurch II can the coastal environments you know the coastal policy statement all of these things are relevant to the decision making and waters a complex environment timelines and milestones along with regular updates on progress and I think you know I mean I 've been trying to find a mechanism for ensuring that communities have you know full access to information along the way and I know that people are you know have been frustrated and in areas you know that the flooding damage that 's been caused by the earthquakes has been hugely significant and I know that there 's going to be some conversations and recommendations come around the Heathcott River area and this is a mechanism for ensuring that that will there 's more than one community board that has an interest in that and that river and it may well be that monthly standing item and again a dedicated channel of communication will enable that arise out of there so that that to me as the is the set of recommendations that I would like us to consider and debate the small but obviously there 's probably some questions that people would like to answer ask we had the we had a deputation last week which is in relation to some of the damage that was caused in that environment and the Utah history trust wanting to have some important terms of the future of this area as well there are a combination of interest says that we 're in a very complex environment the option one doesn 't take us into the into the environment where we 're in opposition to two other obligations in that area that number three actually enables us to talk in a much more detailed way with with the various interest and make sure that we look at those solutions that mitigate against coastal erosion as well so so rather than move and second these at the moment I 'll bring staff to the table and and will direct questions to to staff if you 'd like to wanted to say I 'm having difficulty reading it I can just read what 's up there but I can 't see all of it and I just wonder if there 's another way of us because somebody 's sick Oh it 'll be published to the hub any minute oh okay presentation Oh a staff are going to do a presentation first right sorry-sorry the language every program is prioritized by flood was primarily along with other drivers the progresses and saw the program has been significant tonight with him progressing high-priority stormwater drainage projects such as the flippin straighter and the Dudley Creek project in the vales Creek project for example we 've got a number of other projects and development that are going to come on stream and those projects now moving into these floodplain management and topics for our major rivers teams including the Heath get Aven and around the history so I 'm sure this open report provides an opportunity to provide some interim or short-term relief to some of their Fichte Dresden 's before these long-term projects and planes can come to fruition and about the LTP and inside the program following those flood management projects will be medium and low priority projects within stormwater drainage areas now I 'll just touch a waiver on the hits of much importance to the community at the moment we have within soft land recovery program prioritized a number of storage basins and the upstream catchment with the get aim of reducing flood levels and the upper and mid mythical creatures and there are as illustrated by the flooding last month significant issues related with frequent flooding and we recognized those and as part of that work we are continuing to contact affected residents I 'm gonna start another round of communication with them soon and we have an options assessment underway for immediate and looking for options for immediate relief or short-term options for frequent flooding and out of that work we 're planning on a round of engagement with the community in late October as what 's discuss at the recent ITA meeting on the multi-user project so that 's where the Heathkit is it and we are working very hard toward for finding options immediate concerns so to move back to south shore this is some photographs that I took on cetera on the 25th of July when I got out inside and you can see that widespread flooding that was occurring during that event with overtopping of history edge from the would live a mystery and there were two houses flooded and the along working North Road that council is aware of we did originally since the door knocking sighs to try and understand the impacts of that flooding but there 's a as you can see in these photographs significant flooding along roads and streets and access issues for instance on the night we initiated some emergency works and they included deploying pumps engagement of local residents association and building temporary bones and that is what you can see on the left-hand photograph here and thinking around these buns has was already in development prior to that event in response to an earlier resolution from Council to investigate options in this area and to address community concerns now those community concerns extend beyond tidal inundation or tidal flooding the other term coastal photographs on the right show some erosive processes that are underway and certainly Broughton Park in the middle photograph and on the right further down the spirt behind residential red zone land and you can see in the middle photograph that significant amounts of erosion has occurred with time presumably following across due to the earthquake sequence where those reno mattresses that had engineering defenses on that history edge have appeared to have sunk exposing the bank above to wind and wave action further the south along the split there was a series of measures put in by private residents to risk erosion on their own properties and that 's a mix a real mix is a blend of vertical whirls and hard fill concrete blocks depending on the approach taken by the individual resident at the time most of the work has been undertaken and beyond or within paper road within Council entrepreneur 's HT beyond each of the reason to rezone per se and it can 't from even walking around that some of those ad hoc measures are not providing significant amounts of erosion protection there you into this tree but I think there 's opportunity here to separate the concepts of toddler and ocean and coastal erosion they are different processes inaccurate different rates and in different places and for well for example we can mitigate to some degree a title an addition risk through creation of pinkman 's much like that deeply roots that were enacted and there can be away from the top of the bank or the top T Street where that come roshun processors work now we do have to pay particular attention to risk of erosion of any sort of engineered bond that we might put in during a storm event so there are sort of two types of erosion that we are very interested in the the first being at the edge and that regular tidal effect on that edge and how that can be managed moving forward but also that a regular effect that not occur if the Bund itself were exposed to wave action during during an extreme water level and the risks posed to the residential land behind quite different from each of those those types of long term and short term here for for us inside the report that has been presented in an agenda and this work that is proposed and saw this report is really is intended to be temporary and short-term in nature up to 20 years have a longevity of up to 20 years that doesn 't mean it has to be there for 20 years that could be modified enhanced or even removed a long term planning processes identify alternative measures are preferable so the idea is very much akin to what was proposed and adopted for a river whereby there are some immediate works we do in order to create some longevity and those existing Aven River stop banks and allow those long term processors to continue and at the same time providing a level of surety for those who are offered some protection by those or some reduced risk reduction by those measures and you can see in the table above we 're trying to I 'm trying to highlight here that you can separate long term and short term measures both for an addition and erosion and that some space between the history edge the Bund itself there 's not to say that we necessarily want to see that history each move per se it just opens up offer opportunities for softer engineering approaches rather than strictly hard engineering approaches really have much less what they don 't get into that have we bit later and we are more inclined to move towards more hype engineering approaches and it 's fair to say that a long-term outcome for this areas like to include a real mix of all of those things soft engineering and hard engineering and it will be very site-specific so one inside this sort of framework out here inside this table you can see this long-term inundation options permanent works pump stations managing earthquake effects in groundwater and that is really what the ocl report appeared to be driving in and the Oso report was put forward by the local Business Association and we were asked to provide an initial feasibility assessment of it and that initial feasibility assessment has concluded that this type of feature is really a long-term type approach that is typical and establishing its feasibility in terms of earthquake resilience and groundwater management and that 's really a question for the long-term and it 's very useful information for us and can help inform our existing studies that we have underway within that multi hazard analysis that multi hazard project is looking to identify options for long-term flood risk remediation and floodplain management and a hard engineering approach like this what 's profitable and the ocl reporters as an example of that and so it is very useful for us to move using our investigations moving forward but any of these options do sit with inside regulatory framework and I 'm just going to my coid wiII be here to speak briefly around the regulatory framework that exists yeah okay and so in terms of the proposals outlined in the report they are all located in the coastal environment in this environment I think it 's recognized by many it has multiple values particularly related to its cultural and natural aspects and these values are recognised in the regulatory document so in particular the EK and coastal environment environment plan recognizes environment plan will apply to any works below mean high water springs tied at this point in time none of the proposals involving any of those works so it means it may not apply but we all confirm those things once the once we progress towards consent in terms of the Christchurch district and the proposals traverse a number of zones mainly related to open space and of course the specific purpose recovery zone flat land recovery and so also as a result of that design sorry I 'm not going to interrupt you but but I am and the flat land recovery zone the special purpose zone is what went in the district plan and the residential red zone areas only correct yes yes so the remember overlays that also apply to the area recognizing the various values specifically there 's high flood hazard area there 's also flood management area we 've got sites of 9000 cultural significance ecological significance landscape and natural character and so there is a number of overlays and not all of them recognize what 's proposed in terms of flood mitigation there 's and the upshot is is that resource consent will be required as a result for one more of those overlays or zones so as a result of that the New Zealand Coastal policy statement will be relevant for any resource consent so needless to say there are some issues that need to be addressed through a resource consenting process and what interesting process for any option that is proposed here is it just sort of a quick outline of some of those the options that are presented in the report these three options and now there to address these the issues around erosion an addition and a third one at stormwater management when we go and fill gaps in a Bund we also block over in flow paths so we need to address all forms of flood risk or particularly and the effect of those works so the proposed option includes items to address those three issues there are 36 houses in the area which are below or estimated to be if row levels below a level of 10.8 the level of 10.8 is was we tour or the flood between sort of ten point seven and ten point eight during that frequent flood event however it wouldn 't necessarily be sufficient volume of overtopping of the edge to get to ten point eight everywhere so that 36 houses is likely to be an over estimate of the number of houses at risk however we have identified inside the report that we need to do further work around what modelling to understand the exact nature of that flood risk so within the report option one which was often I recognized that what the revised resolutions today vary a little bit from this and maybe I 'll just describe that now option one was including all works between bridge Street and further south but essentially what was discussed earlier by the mirror was removing that green section in the middle and option two and the Porter 's just stabilizing the emergency works to the south an option three is going as far north as BT Street in accordance with the notes motion that was resolved recently so why do we need to go north of it Tod street well there are put at risk some of the low-lying properties a long history Road and through the South so extending the Bund further north offers some risk reduction to those residential properties and there is also other Overland flow paths that exist further north and extending the product of bridge street we offer some Unterman short term protection to those reasons to the north and these proposals consistent with the parks development plan and also the must planning documentation for the parks in the area you can see in this plan here there is a possible stop bank or sheer juice trick identified with a sort of a green space in a red dashed line along it which is away from this tree edge and also you can see in this plan the boat ramp and GT that have been constructed recently or under construction and between the two you can see some history walkway identified which is roughly along the alignment of the existing walkway so the proposed works inside the report to keen to extend abandoned through this Ridge also to stabilize the works further south and this is some completed and you can see from this drone footage the areas for the South this is around penguin Street that the the there is very little room between the history edge and the emergency works and some places particularly the Rodin 's we need we are proposing to undertake more significant or harder talk erosion Misha 's now in the further north as I mentioned we 're not the the soft engineering approach is still an engineered approach and these other areas planting does his great effect in reducing wave energy and offering some offering risk reduction to these inundation measures such that we can have greater security that during an event I don 't they don 't wash away also we have undertaken some elevation modeling of the emergency works have undertaken just to ensure that they meet the target levels that present in the report of living want to so in summary we have for those issues proposed mix of erosion measures from soft engineering monitoring and management of the edge there might be some need to move some parts in some areas and localized planting of course the community board subject the revised resolutions have just been put forward but also some more significant works by at those straight ends for the inundation measures that is proposed within the report to it to extend that unbridle as far as north east as far as bridge street but once again that we subject to the resolution that 's been offered in terms of stormwater management we are proposing to modify this emergency works to essentially cut a hole in them and put in stop logs so that we can manage the risk of Overland flow passing an extreme rainfall events let some water out of the Bund if that were to occur notionally that stop loads will be left in place but if we did find that we needed to get water out of there quickly in the tide was low enough we could release that water along with us we are proposing to improve forecasting of these events and continue to work with land information New Zealand regenerate and Environment Canterbury now the cost of the works have been estimated the stage at around two million dollars we 've brought the support to you with the urgency that was required by the early resolution so the cost estimates at this stage are still will go through through the refinement and development as that design progresses and hence the uncertainty that 's applied on that slide there of the estimate of plus or minus forty percent now in terms of program we have a significant dependency with the resource consenting that is currently being scoped and subject to what DB said earlier around the complexity of that regulatory environment the end the nature of any consensus they might proceed from here and this short two images are going to work in conjunction with the work the long-term work plan work that 's still on which is underway we these short-term images are our time for the long term planning to proceed the short term measures do not address ground water inundation don 't arrest groundwater beneath them and the the short term measures don 't are at risk potentially and in the future earthquake that were to occur there they 're not built with the earthquake resilience and of failure of those measures is considered to be low and that long-term planning however does need to consider those various risks in that 's why and so that multi is a project we are considering not only inundation and erosion but earthquakes and the other tsunamis any other hazards that are present through our low-lying coastal areas so this is easier to get resource consent for the existing temporary works that have been done absolutely is the proposal includes retaining those features and we need to address the environmental effects of those retrospective resource consent is will be required in terms of the land drainage recovery program this this wasn 't the next priority on the list but I 'm assuming that because you 're in the ground on the area and the initial works have been done as temporary works that it 's kind of a you might as well continue with this element of the program while while what 's been done has been done rather than to leave it and complete yes it does present an opportunity for us to address some immediate concerns in the that the history floodplain management project inside the program was prioritized and after that Aven and the hiccup end that the infrastructure investments signal was inside the program for those two rivers as significant you 're talking about many many many millions of dollars and that the timing of that would probably be nearer the end of that 20-year horizon yeah subject of course to LTP processors and funding being approved or otherwise through in just in terms of the funding so if we were to approve this and it came to the the two million panned out as the as the ultimate cost what we would you propose that that funding come from in terms of within the program well the is I mentioned earlier that the history has been identified inside the program is with significant potential investment and order to deliver the floodplain management plans that may arise so it is programming that funding of course that 's all subject to the LTP paralysis that 's going on so cognizant of that we are proposing and if we deliver it further and this financial year would be we had some preliminary design identified for those open river stop banks which we can delay slightly and are still likely to meet her object and that work and coincide that with our with the long-term planning as that 's going on and as the regeneration planning proceeds in the particular River corridor and also if we take we we try and split the impact across a range of projects so that we can still progress general than the program fair significant effect I 'd also note that in terms of two million dollars we have are significantly it 's a relatively small proportion of our budget for this financial year and total it 's still a lot of money yeah don 't get me wrong at all what still allows money but we still we have the ability to manage that within the program to minute no minimize any sort program risks on other projects is I 'm asking all the hard questions first is does this mean that there would be any delay to what is going to be proposed in the hip river as a result the inside for the Heath get inside this financial year we already have a project team that 's working very busily on that and we 'll be reporting to the community and late October our ability to deliver those works including those upstream basins is going to be subject to through the decisions from Council so we do need we still have more processes underway to address the flood risks in those areas and again when we manage at a program level we try and balance all the competing risks and opportunities that are presented in order to best meet the needs of our community right okay so um now Dion did you want to ask a question as because you had your hand up before so I 'll go diancie Arianny clean so one question at the moment is have we thought about the implications on the district sorry the the Wyatt stuff around giving the protection here does that have any implications on the height levels or anything like that for people who want to build we 'll sort some preliminary advice from the with regards to this and advices know the building platform level sit with them the building act as above the heart proposed for the bund so their risk is still at that 50 year level with some climate change allowance within the building act is still greater than what the height of the bunt and therefore it would still apply so what sort of more work do you need to do that well the the the initial advice was no won 't affect it and it 's the bund the the consideration is around the temporary nature with abandon just in actually ensuring that we have infrastructure the nature of the infrastructure is relatively unique and might not have been considered within that framework so in this area before so the the ramifications that are currently identified are thought to be very small and the standard processes will still apply in the floor levels and platform levels will be set as previous I think we just need to confirm that though so that 's the initial advice and will confirm it as part of this process I kind of thank you sir thank you and short term and protect those properties and the the buns and lungs it 's recognizing that the the Syria wasn 't prioritized and I can understand that the youth get an even higher priority but within each of these areas so within the Heathcote in the urban areas and in this one separately would we normally within the land drainage recovery program be spending additional money to protect houses that actually haven 't flooded so currently this this is supposed to there are two properties that flooded to above sea level and my understanding was that worth generally within the plan we prioritize properties where houses have flooded above the floor level these are in an inconvenience with street flooding but I mean sort of extremely expensive way to get rid of all the flapping across the city and all streets so in other areas like the F Qatar we planning on protecting houses that haven 't actually floated within the program where you go we take some considerable effort and hydraulic modeling to understand the flood risk from a range of sources now any storm event is unique and flooding to identify flood risk in areas because the rainfall that might have occurred recently or and and that occurred during the occupation of any given resident won 't be reflective of all the full spectrum of rainfall events that might occur and that flood risk that might be evident to that property so we apply military rigorous computer modeling to establish flood risk at a at a profit level and we seek to corroborate that against recent flooding so yes absolutely we consider areas of high risk in areas that have flooded and we but we use it an addition to computer modeling to identify flood risk to private property and that informs a program in conjunction so we rely on we use both and both are very important but we prioritize those areas with the house that actually have flooded and and then go well there are other have properties that might in a future event but they 're less of a priority because they 're not it seems to be weird the the stuff on Heath get his name I mean and you weren 't here when way that we only considered those that actually flooded is requiring potential protection and you 're talking about the potential and under the flood models which in this case are far greater than the ones that actually flooded on that particular occasion well as I alluded to earlier the opportunity within the timeframe and producing this report to do that detailed hydraulic modeling and in a yield and a flood risk that is lower than thirty six houses I 've got to be open with it that 's that thirty six houses is what we call like a bathtub if you just filled up that water up to that live all that person up rehearses that might be risky and we still need to do floor level survey and detailed modeling to quantify but I think that the the modeling that has been undertaken to date has been coincidental with the observed flooding so we 've got to look many years into the future as well and we 've got to consider that all of the city and we haven 't necessary activated who had swim events in recent history and some areas where our models are predicting it so within the pro within the program we will come up what there will be projects to address flood risk which hasn 't yet eventuated since the earthquake section it 's been a relatively short period of time since the earthquakes and a hydrological since so the types of rainfall that has fallen hasn 't necessarily been representative of all the different types of rainfall so how long would it take to do that sort of modeling and the surveying of those floor levels to see whether we were actually predicting new six houses or actually many fewer and you know should we be doing it before we commit to a large spend of money well odds suggest that we the sort of the dual minimum option presented inside the reporters to stabilize the emergency works and that is there the work that has identified a net option as likely to be required they 're a resource consenting process regardless so freeze seeking retrospective resource consent we want these buns to stay there for twenty years we don 't need to bund for the north as is could be subject to well will be subject to allow to report we 've one of our is the resolutions proposed or the recommendation that start we 've offered is to report back to account sort of later date and the resolution does instruct a specific instruction but there will be an additional reporting between officials arise and we will be doing that hydraulic modeling and floor level assessment within that further work and we will have an opportunity report back to council affair after phase change so one of those issues that might arise might actually be you coming to us in saying hey listen our modeling shows that those properties aren 't as a risk when we thought they might be and this workers actually not a priority but there 's a possibility of that I there flew little surveys will take some time to undertake or they require access to the property and then a little drop and all that and then submit formats of work from the survey team to go there and collect the data and the high drop 'll look to progress our design subject to a decision today from Council in those areas but again if any significant within the infrastructure project within the decide the capital program of the Earth 's ignition significant issues that arise and development development of those projects we come back to Council and report on those and and sometimes that is cost and innocent since it might be the identified risk and part of the report back will also be the marginal difference between doing this now when we have to do the retrospective consenting on the Southshore Burt and potentially stabilizing in their area anyway so there will be a marginal difference in terms of the that 's required to expand given that we 've already made some temporary stop bag decisions up the bridge street eand certainly yeah Jonnie Glen David Phil thank you for the presentation and the work that you 've been doing I know you 've been working really hard on this issue um just at a high level in 2015 in member we had a really good land giant recovery program that showed a really more recently that we have that shows us the status of the program because I 'm sort of struggling to to kind of find all the different things that we we kind of agreed that we were going to do but then kind of what 's happened to each one sure well we do report back through the land range working group on the program progress and projects to report up through ite I understand through monthly reporting so amanda visual project basis we do offer that through the can 't stand council processors I just think they 'll be really useful for the public and for us to get an overview of the program schedule so that like the questions are being asked today we can actually see here 's the other ones that we planned and whatever reason they haven 't happened or their own check and one particular just wanted to ask about because with we 've seen the money we 've done the emergency works here and I appreciate this is to stabilize but there were other areas that have been flooding quite badly where works moved to bring that forward as well so just want to ask you about Bromley and my understanding was that there was a charlesworth drain that was gonna be the staffer here that answer questions about the paper exit no no no no I 'm just gonna say that there is a discussion with the community boards tomorrow I think with the land drainage recovery program working group so I think that that 's probably the best way through a reporting back there wasn 't the group to the to actually get there so I mean I kind of would almost like to ask Pauline if she would take that on board in terms of getting a an updated report to a tee on the actual whole program but I just think it would be useful the reason I asked it though is I 'm reluctant little feast there is no no and and that 's why that the recommendation that I 've kind of worked on us as to is to actually have a public facing reporting framework look time frames may change you know is this paper evidence we 're already in the ground and we 've already applying for resource consents you know it 's kind of you might as well while you 're still there and that that 's that 's moveable feasts but I think Yanni 's pointers is a good one and the sense that the wider public and that 's why I think that a standing item on on more than one community board agenda might be the Heathcott River you know and in Venice families in particular areas well that 's also an Easter II issue as well this isn 't what I 'm really trying to understand as we 've had a whole bunch of adverse flooding events over the last twelve months two years and what I can 't what I don 't get any seat solve is what works being done short term emergency response works being done to address all the areas that are flood we 've got a lot of detail about South Shore and what I 'm concerned about it we 're considering today right I 'll just finish what I 'm concerned about the pointers miss out in terms of the public parties they 've already said that if it 's to be paid for in this financial year it will come from the Avon stop banks area of work that it 's on the program but it 's a long way out so it 's a bring forward as part of the LTP sorry but what I 'm trying to understand are there any other works that we should be doing as a short-term emergency or recovery response to the flooding they 're currently unfunded that could be done if they were funded I need the council our staff to report back on this area if Council if staff have been asked to report back on a number of other areas they would have done so so I think that I 'm happy to do a notice of motion that 's why I the notice of motion is helpful but I 'll talk to you about it on another occasion Glenn I think you I put our two quite different questions just on option number three to fear on a very short-term basis there short to me is thinking weeks or months or there 's a bit like how long 's a piece of string but have you got something closer and I mean we 're thinking just a you know sort of several weeks then have maybe four to six weeks or something just just to get yeah if some some information back to us so that we could actually consider do it well because I think the community and looking for comfort yeah this the history age is not going to be abandoned by the location of the bundle it was that the fear fear assessment of the feedback that we 've had from the community I would just offer a word of caution here of course we have in order to get a report to counsel there are periods of times timeframes deadlines we need to make in it does take some time so I would suggest that certainly Obie 's might be more six to eight weeks rather than four sites okay and probably I was thinking more that 's where the community board comes on so the four to eight weeks to the council I mean I don 't the timeframes I think if they were this has to go through the community board so it does for ownership yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and my other one was just on the regulatory environment its resource consent dependent you 're talking about New Zealand coastal policy statement so we 're waiting for leadership from up high that 's basically what you 're saying no no sorry and Olivia in a booth there so the New Zealand Coastal policy statement as a high-level document that 's already in place so it was introduced sorry that version is 2010 so that 's the one there we have to give a fit to in terms of any resource management documents right so it 's so in terms of national direction around natural hazards this something separate although we 'd be being asked to give effect to something that 's prior to a significant event you know that 's what do you live in quakes which significantly altered the landscape of the area we 're talking about it 's pretty high level so it 's one of those higher order documents that has quite a strong legislative and regulatory basis so I mean that the conceding environment and there there 's obviously a whole lot of things that DB is referred to in her slide and they 're identified with on the report so whatever process you use those will be up for consideration so it 's tricky with all the coastal hazards landscape overlays in there David I 'm thinking just a couple of questions around South Shore in relation to ongoing stormwater management and and stream logs there seems to be a degree of unsuitability and the design of some of the stormwater outlets particularly the ebb tide Street outlet which is an area that does seem to be one of consistent flooding included can you tell me what sort of process you may engage to ensure firstly that we have effective stormwater egress from these drains which then may sort of prove that some of the storm though the stop logs may not be in fact necessary yeah unfortunately you can 't insure anything with with flooding we just run occur during an event that not necessarily on foresee or wall but not might be uncontrollable and one of those things has had the bit of the history might move during an event and that can affect the operation of those outfalls yeah I think that the questioning was more around the duckbill type of outlet there and particularly the ebb tide Street one seems to be silted up more often when it 's clear that quickly sets up again and we 're not getting effective training so would we look to ensuring that those outlets are functioning properly first before we would consider stop lights so those the duct work valves generally are on maintenance cycle so the city could do go out and speak to in the but the right that is a highly mobile bit of the history and we are initiating some design work around that particular outfall to see if we can improve its performance an addition to that we have temporary pumping deployed when the flood levels are observed so that we can over pump that outfit in case of blocks so we have okay well second question is that 's why understanding that the RSL report and one of the reasons why it was so widely accepted by the South Shore residents was the fact that have actually embraced a range of treatments along that section of the coastline from how the engineering safety engineering to natural age can you explain to me why you consider this typical mahad engineering approach the foods that are offered within the report do indicate hard engineering faces Ciroc revetment all so the other mmm features and well my interpretation the report was it was more focused on that harder engineering stall the the history each treatment itself is obviously subject to some concern from the community and and response the resolution or sector and engage Morris community and do more work in that space so you would agree though that the report did offer a range of treatments the OHS self-report well what was presented and diagrammatic form as far more towards the the hard engineering style the exact wording and the ACL report I wouldn 't like to offer an explicit commentary on and I a conscious effort to ensure in that report that a range of environments were considered in developing a solution for sexual thank you thanks Tom in for a huge amount of work in this report and I 've got a number locations work just done the we know the number of houses that were flooded and sale sure sure do you know the number of houses that were flooded on the if cat River in the same during the same event same storm event so following the song event we did do an extensive door-knocking size in both the Heathkit rivers and and south shore and my understanding I 'd have to confirm with my colleagues as the numbers around between thirteen I think it 's 13 properties in the he 's got the original instruments were hired met around 17 I believe so our lightest figures slightly lower than made in a choice term of the seventeen we 're going to continue to speak to those people about that of intan and gain an understanding and then there how the event and occurred on their individual properties thanks Donald to be done around this proposal but and just ask you about the costs low so the costs are two million dollars plus or minus forty percent so in fact if it 's strictures write out the full cost of this plan could be 2.8 million is it creep as I mentioned in any response we will have an opportunity report back to Council on the implementation program and at that point we 'll seek to update the cost estimate as I did mention earlier again that that we are very early in that sort of design life cycle and so there are some uncertainties still in the cost estimates and will seek to reduce their uncertainty in that through the reporting thanks Tom and there 's reference in the report that future decisions could mean that the band would need to be moved or even abandoned so I 'm just clearly in fact the shortlist is it correct in what we take from it that this short-term solution may well not be consistent or it could be inconsistent with the long with future long term plans there is a planning is underway and I wouldn 't want to predetermine the outcome from that it 's going to involve a significant investigative effort is identified that malty hazard paper that recently came to you but also will involve discussions with the community and decisions from yourself so as hard wouldn 't want to pretend I 'm a vet process and decide this decision here and the intent is very much for these works to be temporary or short-term so that we don 't preclude options inside that long-term planning yeah in time I got a question and Dion sort of refer to this before but there 's reference in the report for people perhaps because there 's short term effects if you like that in fact that could impact on people 's sort of view that in fact that will be we stay for a long term that in fact it will give people some comfort were in fact that may not be the case at all but in fact this is just a short term make is a short-term measure so do not shouldn 't have concerned that in expectations on behalf of the compact the part of the community again within the report we identify that community perception as a risk with this decision and however I 'd like to say that the long-term planning won 't as therefore the community as well we 're sitting good outcomes from the community and saw that long term planning and and so it 's my view that will seek to address all all all the issues inside that long-term planning and if we 're successful in doing so then the nature of the short-term works I hope at that point becomes far less important I think so and I 've got one final question if I may just a lot of the regulatory framework which you referred to DV so can we take it there in fact of this short-term option with the band would actually meet the requirements of the coastal policy statement I think we need to do that work so we don 't know that yet okay let 's get a resource consent yes and so I also then wondered it would would it if we as way of a regeneration play in regeneration strategy good we would the the the deep design still need to meet the coastal policy statement I think now none of the issues we 've identified through the planning framework assessment go away just because you use a different piece of legislation so they 're there for a reason because they are they identify issues that need to be considered as part of a new process so if we were to use some other type of process we 'd still need to consider all those issues our initial advice to you would be that a resource consent would be the preferable way forward in terms of you the resolution is to go with option 1 or any of the options they would need to concede and our advice to you as that would be the best way forward to enable it to occur Thanks with you Tim I think you are just first one a knowledge Keith you and your team Tom Peter situated it 's really frustrating to do so much work and it 's like an iceberg you have to that is the finishing that is a waste of time if that 's not done properly so I just want to acknowledge that and my respect for you my question is actually to Carlene because we 've been live streamed and many of the hits could be watching this and I know we 're talking about South Shore and I totally understand the reasoning for this because we 've dear now we 've been done a bit of work it just seems logical the same with flocked in '_''_5067.469 but the people that I 'm dealing with with and Heath young my constituents and others outside that and I know that my colleagues because the Heathcott runs from feet feet right up to areas along high riding areas that you wouldn 't even know are being flooded if you weren 't affected by it so in the end and I know it 's a little long-winded but we 'll just go with it with the annual plane councilors we wanted to keep at five point five fourth rights and we have a finite amount of money so we even flow us as it is extra leadership team in yourself aware that when it comes the long term plan that this will be a priority for many which will then maybe if it cuts too but programs like roadie and others I 'm just putting a hit zone because it 's serious for me we 're very aware at the challenges are in terms of um keeping rates at an affordable level and increasing rates and affordable but with a huge volume of work that we have to do so it 's not only business as usual it 's recovery from continuing recovery from the earthquakes are these new things that community I look for as well as well as the longer-term issues around land drainage ravine flood prevention and actually that will be the decision for Council in terms of how you prioritize those things so we 'll be providing you with scenarios but there will be the real challenge in terms of do you invest upfront and get some of these things done more quickly but that will mean an increase in rates or do you take longer to the thing to my question that may not because if we as a council aside can I talk to myself I am going to be very clear about my priorities and so if there is a Trojan horse like I 'm funding from the in DTI for a new road which 5050 or whatever I will have to look at myself very hard and say can I support that because if I want to keep the rate payers want to keep rates at a certain level and there are many that are not affected by flooding but how do we do that I guess I 'm just cilium signal to you and your ELT a weird that that may be one of the the questions in one of those hard calls that we have to make because when what the fires are very simple in the sense that there was life for us private property and then everything else it seems that will you know we are focused but a deep sand flows are but we 're absolutely aware and these will be really challenging decisions then counsel will need I because I asked that question because those in the hip you know there 's tolling logic why we 'd have flopped and no question about that it seems logic why we 're doing logical why we 're looking at this now but you know dealing with those families and you know it is very very hard and we have to make a move on this it has been least too long okay and one of the just sort of following on from Carlene one of the pieces of work that is being ripped up within the organization and within my office is to you know and I 've been calling it the earthquake ate my homework but it 's a it 's really a statement of where we are you know because I don 't_''_5271.97 I don 't_''_5272.69 I still don 't think the public quite realize how much more horizontal infrastructure needs to be done the recommendation of the under pendant hearings panel that we enter into a cost-sharing agreement with central government on land drainage so you know I mean the fact that the roads and the a gap in terms of that earthquake related damage in terms of the land drainage recovery program so that 's that 's something that 's obviously on hold until after a certain event on the 23rd of September but it is something that we will be talking to the uncommon government regardless of who that is and it is absolutely vital that people understand that there are enormous costs lying ahead of us in terms of the whole program and and some of them are absolutely attributable to the level of the earthquake damage that was that occurred because it may come to a point there we have to look it and split it in half isn 't water quality isn 't because all those literals and split and the the minimizing of possible the elimination of flooding so the two things so let 's get the flooding sorted and in the water quality and maybe that 's a discussion that we have to have in the future yeah and when we we 've set our strategic priorities and you know that the the work that that will entail also and running as best we can yeah Mike Sarah I was sorry Mike Pauline Sarah thank you I 'm just want to get a few things straight so obviously the the flooding on the 21st July was caused by a combination of in secret say the perfect storm I think it saw records the highest and 43 years of some areas in two properties two homes were flooded one temporary one permanent and emergency works done would actually now protect those two properties from its type of flood the word protection is something we try and move away from we 've reduced the risk of flooding of those properties of above full flooding that said the subsequent tide had a very similar water level to that on the 22nd it a little bit on the 21st and it was with a different combination of air pressure wind and wave action so essentially what we what we see is there are there are different vectors that can combine to produce elevated wood levels and that we have identified that there is risk to properties and other places than just the to are different storms that might occur to elevate water levels and the area and so like my response early around computer modeling we need to look at the whole risk profile not just what we 've observed recently and that 's what 's driven the recommendations inside the report is our understanding of the flooding risk of overtopping of the Sturridge along their entire frontage and and the report we were suggesting that the level of the proposed works is similar to that sport so the Mirel flood task force how many properties in South Shore did they identify with vulnerability level one I don 't know the number of stock might hit it was I understand it was two yeah a couple of couple properties and they don 't know if there were this similar the same properties or bit because what I 'm saying is we with obviously their whole task for two were identified and in two have been a flatter than this recent event which we could say is the perfect storm and we 've done emergency works that potentially could protect those we 'll all in so I 'm just we 're playing them potentially to spend up to 2.8 million dollars if it does go out that far to protect an area but tensely we could just do that be a minimum and actually stabilize what we 've already done to protect the houses that actually at most risk so you know there 's been a couple of things I think identified this ace actually we 're not too sure we 're not too sure what they billionaires get impactors and we 're not too sure if the 36 properties is actually correct as we haven 't done modeling from the recent event which appears to be one of the worst have been stuff had in recent times the IRA Goods uncertainty there was uncertainty with every decision we make and in the but the stage with the project for it it 's earlier than would normally seek a decision from Council but we 're under urgency and we we want to get the right decision absolutely that 36 properties is something we 'll continue to work on understanding that flood risk my recollection that there are different to I 'll have to confirm that and we can bring that back to you if you 'd like and as I mentioned before it is we 're trying to address all components of tidal and rainfall flooding and not all those combinations it recruits it 's the earthquake so there may be risks that haven 't_''_5604.32 been made evident since and March 2014 event or and these recent events Pauline a question about having to be tied to the ongoing maintenance of these temporary works if they 're approved do we have any idea of those costs I haven 't tried to establish the exact nature of those costs and the land and which the Bundys place is well through the park is counting managed and maintained by council I couldn 't give you an exact fit on that sorry and just does the option one does it include the stop logs Creek so option one use yes it does okay would be needed to be operated during an event where we come in and remove those in install dumps very much depend on the if we had a very large rainfall event and not a significant history tire tidal have been a mystery then you 'd want to lift the stop logs and release that storm water if that you had an extreme level and the estuary and above the stop log level then you wouldn 't open stop box uses the history and that 's when you pump over the top of it so inside those pumps are they teach me that we thank you Sarah you guys know I 'm cheeky couple of things on the carrot proposed resolutions so number three is yeah number three is one very very long sentence which sometimes leads to lack of clarity and I 'm just looking at its this year which ensure that the band positioning in other measures including soft engineering maximize opportunities to mitigate against coastal erosion in the area it 's a couple of things with it not quite sure whether that means that the the other measures are actually the erosion protection measures themselves like the plantings and those kind of think that we 're looking at trying to see five writer what I meet a bit was that Bund positioning is only one element that if affects the potential for coastal erosion yeah so so it 's it 's it 's both bun positioning and other measures which may be planting which may be but that but it 's making it very specific that we 're talking about soft engineering as well yeah so the other thing that 's not completely clear is that when we say maximize the opportunities to mitigate against coastal erosion and their area what it sounds like we 're doing I 'm mindful at the deputation we head from the S to trust the other day which is is there yeah that is that we are prioritizing erosion mitigation against environmental concerns and we haven 't had a conversation yet about what we 're going to do in the area and whether that is the desired outcome no but given that this is in the coastal environment you know that that requires consideration of II can 't_''_5818.44 so I mean that that that is written to ensure that we are able to talk about occur against coastal erosion what 's it 's trying to do is to say to the community by putting a buns there that 's not the end of this story we actually want to ensure that the coastline is protected and and obviously that in naturalization could go there as well as soft engineering that the reality is is that there are plantings there are mechanism some when we saw that wonderful presentation from Katrina hill from San Francisco this is one who who made it very clear that I 've graduated option actually can provide both protection against coastal erosion actually depleting the strength of a storm as it hurts and it also has the advantage as it comes up providing the flood protection as well but nothing is an absolute no there is no absolute against coastal erosion there 's no absolute no guys danced against flood flood risk as well and just cheating with number six the exit refuses degree and will tell you right now absolutely so that number six refers back to number three so just checking that that means that any mitigate coastal erosion for decision after options have been explored as it right everything 's coming back to cancel even even passing option one does not put us in a position it just it just enables staff to apply for the resource consent well they 're going to that they 'll bring all the work back here won 't_''_5926.179 you is that the idea only these issues we have open side the report I think it 's paragraph four point nine identified some additional work that we 'd envisage being required to confirm the yeah design yep and in doing so if there are significant issues would definitely bring those back to Council and end you have asked us to bring back an implementation program at the same time it 's logical to bring vehicle provides cost estimate if we are able to do so if that has changed significantly from what we see today yeah the the the actual money we have to sign off on on on the next occasion not now watch this configured you please present resolution 3 of option 1 you what do you want to look at is undertake the work identified report to progress this option into construction yeah if you sort an additional decision-making point I 'd suggest you report the progress and to design consenting and consultation and that would trigger another award of course if we trigger another report they could be potential fillets in doing so so that 's the Southshore one though correct it is you the and instruction staff should be a separate sort of a paragraph underneath be if you like yeah hi guys a nd ok so put a do it do a couple of returns and then pull it over and instruct staff to undertake the work I didn 't find the report to progress this option and to design consenting and implement implementation you last night I 'm wearing your amendment probably didn 't drag the okay it 's at the end across strap was not no it 's not emotionally so make an end and struck apply to the whole thing so so so we 're it says end and strapped no no just do a return hit return twice it and oh you 're pull it over yep yep no pepper tuned yep this comes three that 's fine leave it like that could I just get some clarity on what you mean by the word implementation no it 's in construction it should read yeah what what you 've got in construction so just just go delete delete all data yeah pull they 're back I just hit delete after construct oh okay yep oh this one and take out hand implementation no sorry and put back end yep in construction noting the need to report back on implementation timeframes and any issues under resolution 6-0 90 attentiveness to report back prior to getting into or that stage there should approve option one read approve option one and principle yeah yeah yeah three of option one and principle so you are sitting for staff to report back to you prior to building anything on cost and any other issues an implementation program and the other issues that are awesome well given that the resource consent has to be applied for anyway it probably doesn 't affect the timeframe at all because you think conceived what yeah no so so does it affect the timetable because will you be applying for resource consent we will need to apply for resource consent retrospective resource consent for the emergency works you have to anyway yeah that is my understanding but wouldn 't you want to apply for that for the temporary that the strengthening of them anyway it is maybe too busy well essentially that they amount to work needed for the emergency works consent will be the same as what you need further strengthening so essentially it 's probably a good idea to wreck them up together all the month is the intention though that we report back prior to seeking resource consent so the way that the way that I was thinking that was for this for essentially this area that particularly the South Shore area that it was kind of like you you might as well took to the law at once rather than have to resource consent processes you have to by law apply for the for the retrospective consent anyway so the question is can we can we wrap up and been a it 's not an unprincipled decision but it 's a decision to proceed to the resource consent for that as well yeah I mean for me it 's just making sure that we know that they extended work is actually necessary before we commit to it yeah but that 's the approval and pets of all so so I 'm happy with the stabilizing the current staff retrospective conceal that sort of stuff it 's just there knowing that yeah yeah but it 's not a retrospective we 're not asking you to do that across there so yeah so can we split them so that your mana suggests that the death during the emergency works the resolution could read a proven to construction South draw an emergency works yeah that 's essentially option to approving option two and then you 're saying yeah in addition to option two you wish us to consider the works between BT street and Bridge Street however you would like us to report back prior to construction yeah on any of the issues in benefits and cost of those works yeah and to do some more work yeah so is it possible to approve option two and the report yep so rather than just do all that I think that either we take a quick break my head should be a good idea if we just took a 10-minute break and in that time we 'll we 'll just give the final wording right people can go and get themselves a cup of tea or coffee I 'll get myself the kind can get me a cup of coffee and and then we 'll come back and debate the resolution maybe when we come back right prescribed I quite like some clarification around future obligations of Linz especially in relation of the financial part because that 's referred to in paragraphs 4 5 don 't know that that 's the whole point of it there 's no legal obligation for them at this stage which is why I raise the whole question of the cost-sharing discussion that we have to have it but limbs may be prepared but in terms of their ownership because they did do some work prior to the 's do some work order the sierra do some work well then mine sinning is lin 's and operating or doing the redzone clearance and enacted some landscaping nature which is why we know sometimes we don 't eat well basically don 't know whether or not they would come forward with any no and we 've got to assume not but certainly we 're not giving up the ability to talk to central government and whatever shape or form it takes whether it 's runs or someone else that that there 's a contribution in terms of the work that needs to be done so that you 're not going to get an answer today on that it 's crystal clear in the paper and it was last week as well so all right so we 'll just take a quick 10 minute so if the people could be back here at quarter to ready to go enough staff that come up the seams you challenging when we don 't have you know sort of a lot of time to deal with some of these these complexities and it only item on the agenda but I think our time is going to be somewhat challenged for the other items on the agenda so I might at some point have a consideration with the chief executive about what what could actually be deferred until the next meeting so what what consideration has led us to is that as is one to receive the South Shore floodplain and management short term options report with attachments secondly to approve option two to establish emergency works to construction so it it enables us to go ahead with basically the South Shore and that little bit around give tide which have had emergency works done on them and it 's about stabilizing those so it 's the retrospective resource consenting they can get on with it and they can deal with with the the it 's yeah so yeah so they can go ahead with that so that 's agreeing to option to but then referred the remainder of the report to the next coastal Burwood community board meeting which I 'm reliably informed as next Monday for the board 's comment and request 2017 now that 's not a community board meeting so what I 'm going to propose is that we actually invite the chair of the coastal board community board to present the community boards position on the balance of the options at the meeting itself which he would have been able to do had it been a community board meet that they were reporting back to so so would someone like to move that I 'm happy to move that I 'm just wondering about we don 't to make the same mistake twice as the 28th of September date a realistic date for start to come back to us can me but this variable that this is this would enable them to come back with a with a set of resolutions which we can consider on the day but would you like to it could be my interpretation of that resolution that we would not be doing the design work for those other areas would just would be talking with a community board how they thought this to address or what options they might want to consider in that being worded in such a way that would address the concerns will wait have the extra information that people were asking for today about the properties that might or might not be at risk you know the 36 the potential overestimation of those kind of things that 's not cool we make do the entire flood modeling you know so we 're bringing back the extended potential effort community border would like us to do the extension then that would come back to us but we would still wouldn 't hit the information about whether it was necessary or not we would just have the community board saying please do it there would be the extra information we 'd hear we 'd hit the community you know and I think actually that 's a little bit unfair in relation to the situation that we 're confronted with here and I don 't think that it 's I think what what we want in terms of the next set of recommendations in a way I kind of want you to put to one side the recommendations that we 're considering here recommendation that enable staff to progress design works and scope consenting and requirements so we 're not talking about the next step being approving construction so the only one that we 're approving for construction today as the option to and then we are asking staff to work with the community board to come what the what what they want to have considered in the design works and scope and consenting requirements so then it 's not on the screen because that 's what 's going to come back after the community board has had a say about what they want consider because from the previous recommendation that we were looking at the issue around coastal erosion where the Bund is quite a distance from the coastline itself as an issue to the community so I 'd much rather that they drilled into their issue and came back with a set of resolutions that we can we can work through but the advantages is that we 'll have an opportunity in that timeframe to do another workshop so that we 're very clear about what the issues are I mean when we had it an initial workshop on this matter but you know things have changed in a relatively short period of time so that 's why I 'm thinking that this is a good outcome and someone like to second it David so that 's moved by Pauline second by David there 's yep are you still confident around the 1 million dollars for the battle we 're not oh you mean for the option yes I just want to be clear about how much money we 're actually approving 40% on that as with the other options and again others earlier and the design process we still have more work to do absolutely again in here with any project within the construction of the physical works program for council would come back and report you if there 's significant variance from any in any issues that arise so if we found through the resourcing consenting process that there are considerably more onerous requirements for example and we needed to spend considerably more money on landscape treatment for example than would have to and explain that outcome yeah and I 'm Phil I just want to check the staff if what we 're doing with the third recommendation here about reporting what the costa brava community board if in fact that 's going to delay in urgent future meetings with the residents on the hiss code which I know are planned it is that I 'm just going where I 'm coming from I 'm concerned that there 's all this focus on me on these on these whereas the earlier priority is it 's not fear well it 's no I 'm sorry it 's not fear on staff to put that to them we ask them to report by the end of the month that 's what we asked them to do so it 's a bit unrealistic and unfair to ask them what impact that has on a program which we know you 're a member of the land drainage recovery program working group their meeting tomorrow to talk about Heath curse so I 'm coming from a strategic point of view with respect and I think my question is fear well I can assure the two issues in there and both within the program but working independent of each other we 're not duplicating reason well sorry we hear those parallel streams they 're working independently a decision here today should not affect the outcome or progress on the heath King thank you right is there any debate calling yes very quickly because we 've spent a lot of time on this I think this is a really good solution for today it 's an incredibly complex situation and there was some conflicting information and the reports there particularly we 're comparing this this has been a very rushed process and it 's our fault because of what we we called for it in response to an event and this is understandable but I think there 's more work to be done on here and particularly in the light that there is a risk that team pre works could impact on long-term solutions there 's also gaps and the information that may or may not be required so does need a certain level of comfort about these gifts so I think this is a very yeah um I think what 's really important here is that we 've had a number of flooding events and we 've got the land janitor recovery program but we we need to get to a point where we actually change because we 're living in a dynamic environment we 've seen that with the weather and we need to have a much better system of prioritizing post-event from the learnings that we 've understood from that event and so you know I appreciate that these emergency works have been done in this area and absolutely that was the right thing to do at the time but it would be good to get a much more holistic approach to how we 're spending money which effectively is what this is asking us to do and what the benefits are and I understand that we 'll have a chance to do that a little bit tomorrow and in perhaps later on I still think if you go back to the mural Task Force on flooding there were a number of recommendations in there and it would be really good to get what are we agreed to do as a council so that the community can understand where our priorities are and those priorities may change based on the events that we 've had and that would be fair enough but we need to get some transparency over how we 're prioritizing our expenditure so I think it is important to get these emergency works to construction ironically and sadly this should have been done a long time ago with the whole relationship with Sara and Lynn 's obviously we lost that opportunity and I think it 's important that we continue to try and talk to government we 've just done a cost share refresh but you know it 's a real shame that glue and drainage hasn 't been incorporated in that let 's hope that we can get that sooner rather than later the other point I just wanted to make is that you know I think it 's important as a council that we do just actually just take a very quick moment to reflect and extend it afterwards to the people of Houston and takes us for how Houston 's great in terms of planning because it just has no planning controls and people can develop everywhere and one of the really interesting things I think some of those scientists are now looking at is the lack of Pervis surfaces and where does the water go and that 's actually an issue that we still face in christchurch with all the development that were allowing to occur what is that doing to the flooding and I know that the staff are working really hard on those those bigger flood or mob flooding models to understand that but today I think as we look at a response to a flooding of it we 've had we should extend our thoughts and sympathies and and anything else that we can to let the people of Texas and Houston know that we 're thinking of them and that if there 's anything that we can do I 'm sure that we would be asking central government or our chief executive to consider consider that because um some of you may know people in Houston I 've got family over there horrendous what 's going on so thank you to the work staff are doing flooding is not easy it 's a difficult issue I think this is a good interim solution but I think we can 't take foot off the gas for those other solutions and priorities that we 've got post the events that have happened thanks Yanni I think that 's this that 's a really good point thank you Glenn and infill thank you yes I support these recommendations you know obviously receiving the information number 2d is establishing the emergency work send number three but enormous are just like to say I don 't want us to be divided over this I mean lean drainage and flooding issues affect the whole city and of course we 're here as city councillors rather than Ward which is a teach and not easily resolved when it 's your own patch and you you know naturally want to advocate for it but all the wards are important something else I 'd like to say is all 54 members in in my view I think we need to really communities it 's not only Houston it 's Bangladesh Nepal India I attended the screening of An Inconvenient sequel last week the scenes out of Miami to be honest are not too different to New Brighton on a fine clear day that the water coming up through the drains okay so there are some hard realities we need to face and it we actually have a responsibility to step up I 've tried to do this I 've been politically bent over it but I think that the problem is we actually have to face these things and it hard to do but the evidence is overwhelming so we 're a microcosm of what 's happening globally I think there 's no escape from it thank you no thank you and I 'm happy to support these recommendations I 'm relieved that they 've been reduced from the earlier ones I think that it 's important that as a council we continue to be strategic about how we do oliver ln drainage and the language working program has been set up to do precisely there and i just think it listen to those who come to council with with the loudest voice there are as has been indicated huge numbers of people who have been flooded along the Heathkit and in fact we need to make sure that our planning actually improves their situation so we deal with that also as fast as possible and I 'm sure we can and thank you fiercely cannot acknowledge the mayor and her role in progressing this rather difficult subject and the amendment that we have before us today in stark contrast to trust timonium tirade last week I would now like to acknowledge the staff for will work both in the emergency and ongoing with South Shore and South New Brighton and also avoid to ignore as the difficulty that we in dealing with the many land drainage issues around the city and I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to complete the emergency works that we have started in the South Shore area really I had a lot to say if we 'd gone with the other recommendations but I would like to say that the self New Brighton domain suburbs in for the city as a whole and it 's a great asset and we really as a community want to ensure that the best options are considered for South Lawn and ultimately for the city we promote ourselves as a can-do council and I say this is this remit here today is an opportunity for us to showcase a situation really where all the parties can come together and get the best outcome possible what we are talking for this area as I said a moment ago when we look at prioritizing things around the city the investment here is not a huge amount of money but I do appreciate that there are priority concerns and and I 've really acknowledged the the issues in an extremely supportive of measures that we need to take in the in the hrithik attachment as well so I think everyone for their patience today and coming to what we have come to now and I believe that we now do have the opportunity to sit back and reflect in a more measured since and come that we can all agree upon resolution thank you they 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or there 's a place they know that 's carried thank you very much thank you and thank you thank you to the staff that 's um and good luck for the next we well right now I 've talked to the chief executive and actually we can we can move into PX and just do that to particularly urgent matters and it won 't be quick and and these people were relatively comfortable with the heritage incentive grant I heard it wasn 't unanimous at the committee so I 'm and I don 't think it 'll be a quick decision will it sir one the heritage incentive grant it 's been to food twice that 's why yeah Starr for asking but if there 's going to be a significant debate I 'd rather leave it to a next week I don 't think it should be a long debate I think it was discussed pretty filming it at the committee and although we didn 't get agreement there I think that the effects a debate of disparate til next week if you haven 't reached no like this it 's not urgent so I think in that case there would be should be some debate so if you wish to defer its next week that 's fine okay good so I will move that we exclude the public has set out on pages five eight one two five eight four of the agenda on pages 1 to 6 to 137 of the supplementary agenda and that the following people be permitted to remain as they had relative relevant knowledge and experience Rob Hall Steve Clark old ishka and Cecilia dent some tension and four items 34 and 46 yes is that right yeah Oh in Pullman right it 's not he doesn 't he 's not required okay so do I have a seconder for that and drew I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried and you _"

    "text": "so yes it also will accept an apology from councilor Goff as well yep Golf and Tim pre absence from councilor ng right and would someone like to move it Jonnie seconded by tongue I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried _"

  {
    "text": "but so if we could turn to council 24 August 2017 and it 's one two three four fourth item and supplementary agenda number 42 South Shore floodplain management short term options I should note that the community board wanted to make a deputation in relation to this but on understanding that this was deferral from last week 's meeting the time for deputations was last week so I just wanted to acknowledge the fact that the community board has you know a very very specific and direct interest in that and since we 've had the this paper before us obviously they 've taken the opportunity to consider some of the elements of the recommendations which were actually slightly different from the recommendations that went to the community board for consideration prior to it coming to Council last week but I 've also been advised that unfortunately with a number of things that were happening with the community board only three members of the community board were actually at that meeting at the time they considered this I think councillor Livingston went home unwell and they said they said yeah so but yes so I think that was unfortunate given that both the chair was excellent and in the council was absent so the two councillors so well I 'm what so what they 've done is that they 've worked with councilor east in terms of and I 've been involved as well in terms of trying to rework some of the recommendations I haven 't had a chance to circulate those but I 've had a discussion with staff to see whether they are appropriate so if you want to bring those recommendations up because I 'd really like to put these recommendations on table so that okay so so and essentially the first one is the same we 're receiving the report with the attachments we are approving option one which reduce flooding risks and the areas identified and proceeds with the area from registry to BT Street and South Shore as per the report so it 's the it 's it 's what we were conceived considered last week can I just go through this please essentially it 's the registry to be D Street the one area is to be deferred on a very short-term basis the proposed work and the South New Brighton Park isn 't it south of Beatty Street is at end or South just is it just south of Beatty yeah so so you don 't need at the end south of Beatty Street pending further investigation discussion with staff the community the coastal Burwood community board consultants II can and other relevant entities to seek solutions which ensure that Bund positioning and other measures including soft engineering maximize the opportunities to mitigate against coastal erosion in that area the very specific reason for deferring that one from a decision today is to ensure because that there is a concern that with the positioning of the Bund that we were considering that that the community might feel that we were interested and protecting the coastline against erosion which is not the case there are options around that that could provide that protection but when we 're in that coastal environment we 're talking with ek and because it is their responsibility in terms of the management of the of the effect as well so we 've really want to do this properly but also indicate the community that we 're not interested and just dealing with the flooding issue to the exclusion of the protection against coastal erosion and it 's very much fits into our multi hazards approach to natural hazards and then and this came up last week very strongly in terms of the decision to affect the transfer on South Shore South New Brighton and Brooklyn 's residential red zone land to the council again there was a misunderstanding in the community that that this would mean that there was a difference in how we would approach the regeneration planning in the area when ownership of the land makes no difference so whether it 's owned by lungs or owned by the council the Greater Christchurch regeneration Act 2016 applies and I certainly made that very clear and my statements but what I found out after the meeting was that some of the community wanted to make a deputation last week but they asked for that during the course of the meeting instead of notifying prior to and so that reinforced for me that the community is under a misapprehension as to the function of ownership when we 're dealing with residential red zone land so I want to make it absolutely clear that the agreed transfer to the council effectively training changing ownership makes no difference to the obligations under the Greater Christchurch regeneration act and that the council will continue working collaboratively on a long-term regeneration strategy for South Shore and South New Brighton with regenerate Christchurch which remains responsible for the development of any regeneration plan and the residential red zone if such a plan is required so the law hasn 't doesn 't change from any decision that we make around ownership I did think that I 'd made that clear last week but it 's you know the fact that I sat at a meeting doesn 't actually mean that it gets communicated out from here so we need to sort of ensure that we get that message through and that that 's very clear that and then five and six are essentially what we had in the paper last week now important for a number of reasons if you could lift that up about yet thank you the reason why it 's important is that this is an approach that I want to actually recommend to all community boards and if counselors can just make a note of this and as you know Andrew and I have been meeting with individual counselors and what 's come up as a sense of frustration that an issue can be dealt with it the community board level it can be dealt with at the council level but there seems to be a lack of mechanism for actually bringing it to the to the community boards table unless there 's a resolution that staff a reporting back on so I really want us to think about utilizing a monthly standard standing item approach so that individual community boards can actually put on their agendas issues that are relevant to their community board that they want to have regular updates on that doesn 't mean that staff have to produce a monthly report it means that there is a standing item on the agenda so that a mechanism for the community to engage with the community board on a regular basis on issues that may or may not be concerning them so and this one we request the coastal Burwood community board have a monthly standing item regeneration strategy South Shore and South New Brighton so there is regular reporting to the board that also provides an opportunity for the community to engage if needed and then finally request that staff create a dedicated channel of communication and that 's leaving some options open because it may well be a page on the on the web page or it might be a mechanism of a report through the community board I 'm leaving it open but a dedicated channel of communication that provides advice to the two communities on roles and responsibilities with appropriate links to other sites because we generate Christchurch II can the coastal environments you know the coastal policies say all of these things are relevant to the decision-making and waters a complex environment timelines and milestones along with regular updates on progress and I think you know I mean I 've been you know full access to information along the way and I know that people are you know have been frustrated and in areas you know that the flooding damage that 's been caused by the earthquakes has been hugely significant and I know that there 's going to be some conversations and recommendations come round the Heathcott River area and this is a mechanism for ensuring that that will there 's more than one community board that has an interest in that and that River and it may well be that monthly standing item and again a dedicated channel of communication will enable people to feel fully engaged and and the issues that arise out of there so that that to me as the as the set of recommendations that I would like us to consider and debate this morning but obviously there 's probably some questions that people would like to answer as we had the we had a deputation last week which is in relation to some of the damage that was caused in that environment and the Utah history trust wanting to have some important terms of combination of interest says that we 're in a very complex environment the option one doesn 't take us into the into the environment where we 're in opposition to two other obligations in that area that number three actually enables us to talk in a much more detailed way with with the various interest and make sure that we look at those solutions that mitigate against coastal erosion as well so so rather than move and second these at the moment I 'll bring staff to the table and and we 'll direct questions to to staff if you 'd like to come forward Thank You Phil Dion you know I just wanted to say I 'm living differently reading it I can just read what 's up B but I can 't see all of it you know just wonder if there 's another way of us because somebody 's sick Oh it 'll be published to the hub any minute oh okay Oh a staff are going to do a presentation first right sorry sorry villager and recovery program is prioritized by focus primarily along with other tonight with him progressing high-priority stormwater drainage projects such as the flatland straighter area and the Dudley Creek project in the bells Creek project for example we 've got a number of other projects and development that are going to come on stream and those projects now moving into these floodplain management topics for our major rivers teams including the Heath get Ivan and around the histories so ensure this open report provides an opportunity to provide some interim or short-term relief to some of her Fichte Dresden 's before these long-term projects and planes can come to fruition and those long-term projects are part of the discussions about the LTP and inside the program following those flood management projects will be medium and low priority projects within stormwater drainage areas now I 'll just touch a waiver on the hits of much importance to the community at the moment we have within soft land recovery program prioritized a number of storage basins and the upstream catchment with the get aim of reducing flood levels and the upper and mid mythical creatures and there are as illustrated by the flooding recognized those and as part of that work we are continuing to contact affected residents I 'm gonna start another round of communication with them soon and we have an options assessment underway for immediate and looking for options for immediate relief or short-term options for frequent flooding and out of that work we 're planning on a round of engagement with the community in late October as well as to discuss at the recent ITA meeting on the multi-user project so it 's difficut is it and we are working very hard toward for finding options and the hit get to help address some of those immediate concerns so to move back to south shore this is some photographs that I took on cetera on that 25th of July when I got out inside and you can see that widespread flooding that was occurring during that event with overtopping of history edge from the water liver mystery and there were two houses flooded and the long working horse road that council is aware of we did a reasonably extensive door knocking sighs to try and understand the impacts of these photographs significant flooding along roads and streets and access issues for instance on the night we initiated some emergency works and they included deploying pumps engagement of local residents Association and building temporary funds and that is what you can see on the left hand photograph here and thinking around these buttons has was already in development prior to that event in response to an earlier resolution from Council to investigate options in this area and to address community concerns now those community concerns extend beyond tidal inundation or tidal flooding the other term coastal inundation that 's used and include coastal erosion those two photographs on the right show some erosive processes that are underway and south near Broughton Park in the middle photograph and on the right further down the spirt behind residential red zone land and you can see in the middle photograph that significant amount of erosion has occurred with time presumably following the cross due to the earthquake sequence where those reno mattresses that had engineering defenses on that history edge have here to have sunk exposing the bank above to wind and wave a series of measures put in by private residents to risk erosion on their own properties and that 's a real Max is a blend of vertical whirls and hard fill concrete blocks depending on the approach taken by the individual resident at the time most of the work has been undertaken and beyond or within paper Road within Council entrepreneur 's actually beyond each of the residential redzone per se and it can as eminent from even walking around that some of those ad hoc measures are not providing significant amounts of erosion protection there you know they saw behind those and natural grounders moving away into history but I think there 's opportunity here to separate the concepts of tidal and ocean and coastal erosion there are different processes inaccurate different rates and in different places and for well for example we can mitigate to some degree a title an addition risk through creation of pigments much like that simply works that were enacted and that can be away from the top of the bank or the top T Street where that common erosion processes work now we of any sort of engineered bond that we might put in during a storm event so there are sort of two types of erosion that we are very interested in the first being it and the regular title effect on that edge and how that can be managed moving forward but also that a regular effect that might occur if the Bund itself were exposed to wave action during during an extreme water level and the risks posed to the residential land behind quite different from each of those those types of erosion events and there 's sort of the difference between long term and short term here for for us inside the report that has been presented in an agenda and this work that is proposed and saw this report is very is intended to be temporary and short-term in nature up to 20 years have a longevity of up to 20 years that doesn 't mean it has to be there for 20 years that could be modified enhanced or even removed long term planning processes identify alternative measures are preferable so the idea is very much akin there are some immediate works we do in order to create some longevity and those existing Aven River stop banks and allow those long-term processes to continue and at the same time providing a level of surety for those who are offered some protection by those or some reduced risk reduction by those measures and you can see in the table above we 're trying to I 'm trying to highlight here that you can separate long term and short term measures both for an addition and erosion and that 's particularly welcome for us in areas where there 's some space between the eastery edge and the Bund itself there 's not to say that we necessarily want to see the history edge move per se it just opens up offer opportunities for softer engineering approaches rather than strictly hard engineering approaches really have much less work than I 'll get into that a wee bit late we are more inclined to move towards more heart engineering approaches and it 's fair to say that a long-term outcome for this areas like to include a real mix of all will be very site-specific so one inside this sort of framework up here inside this table you can see this long-term inundation options permanent works pump stations managing earthquake effects and groundwater and that is really what the ocl report appeared to be driving in now man the ocl report was put forward by the local residents Association and we were asked to provide an initial feasibility assessment of it and the initial feasibility assessment has concluded that this type of feature is really a long-term type approach that is typical of a hard engineering approach that requires considerable more consideration and establishing its feasibility in terms of earthquake resilience and groundwater management and that 's really a question for the long-term and it 's very useful information for us and can help inform our existing studies that we have underway within that multi hazard analysis that multi hazard project is looking to identify options for long-term flood risk remediation and floodplain management and a hard engineering approach like this what 's profit birth and the O sale reporters as an example of that and so that 's very useful but any of these options do sit with inside regulatory framework and I 'm just going to ask my koi newbie here to speak briefly around the regulatory framework that exists yeah okay and so in terms of and the proposals outlined in the report they are all located in the coastal environment in this environment I think it 's recognized by many has multiple values particularly related to its cultural and natural aspects and these values are recognized in the regulatory documents so in particular the II can coastal environment environment plan recognizes the ester II is a significant Natural Area in that environment plan will apply to any works below mean high water springs tied at this point in time none of the proposals involving any of those works so it means it may not apply but we all confirm those things once the once we progress towards consenting in terms of the christchurch district plan the proposals traverse a number of zones mainly related to open space and of course the specific purpose recovery zone flat land recovery and so also as a result of that design I am and the flat land recovery zone the special purpose zone is what went in the district plan and the residential read zone areas only correct yep yes so the remember overlays that also apply to the area recognizing the various values specifically there 's high flood hazard area there 's also flood management area we 've got sites of ninety who cultural significance ecological significance landscape and natural character and so there is a number of overlays and not all of them recognize what 's proposed in terms of flood mitigation there 's differences and written how it provides for those within each area and the upshot is is that resource consent will be required as a result of one more of those overlays or zones so as a result of that the New Zealand Coastal policy statement will be relevant for any resource consent so needless to say there are some issues that need to be addressed through a resource consenting process and what interesting process for any option that is proposed here is it just sort of a quick outline of some of those the options now there to address these the issues around erosion and and Asian and a third one at stormwater management when we go and fill gaps in a Bund we also block over an flow path so we need to address all forms of flood risk or particularly and the effect of those works so the proposed option includes items to address those three issues there are 36 houses in the area which are below or estimated to be here floor levels below a level of 10.8 the level of 10.8 is was met or or the flood level at to about that level down rocking-horse Road in places between sort of ten point seven and ten point eight during that frequent flood event however it wouldn 't necessarily be sufficient volume of overtopping of the edge to get to ten point eight everywhere so that 36 houses is likely to be an over estimate of the number of houses at risk however we 've identified inside the report that we need to defer to work around hydraulic modeling to understand the exact nature of that flood risk so within the what the revised resolutions today vary a little bit from this and maybe I 'll just describe that now option one was including all works between bridge Street and further south but essentially what was discussed earlier and by the mirror was removing that green section in the middle and option two and the reporters just stabilizing the emergency works to the south in option three is going as far north as BT Street in accordance with the notice of motion that was resolved recently so why do we need to go north of ebb tide streak well there are Overland flow paths that exist behind the campground and could put at risk some of the low-lying properties a long history Road and further south so extending the Bund further north offers some risk reduction to those residential properties and there is also other Overland flow paths that exist further north and extending the product of Broad Street we offer some interim and short-term protection to those reasons to the north and these proposals consistent with the park 's development plan and also the must planning documentation for the parks there is a possible stop bank or share district identified with the sort of green space in a red dashed line along it which is away from this tree edge and also you can see in this plan the the boat ramp and duty that have been constructed recently or under construction and between the two you can see some history walkway identified which is roughly along the alignment of the existing walkway so the proposed works inside the report to can to extend abandoned through this Ridge also to stabilize the works further south and this is some drone footage that was undertaken after the emergency works were completed and you can see from this drone footage the areas for the surfaces around penguin Street that the the there is very little room between the history edge and the emergency works and some places particularly the writings we need we are proposing to undertake more significant or harder type erosion measures now and the further north as I 've mentioned earlier we 're not the the soft engineering approach is still an engineered approach and these other areas planting offering risk reduction to these inundation measures such that we can have greater security that during an event parent they don 't wash away also we have undertaken some elevation modeling of the emergency works is undertaken just to ensure that they meet their target levels that present in the report of ligand point two so in summary we have for those issues proposed mix of erosion measures from soft engineering monitoring and management of the edge there might be some need to move some parts in some areas in localized planting of course this will be subject to further work and further discussions with the community board subject the revised resolutions have just been put forward but also some more significant works but at those straight ends for the inundation measures that is proposed within the report to it to extend that unfried as far as north east as far as bridge street but once again that we 're subject to the resolution that 's been often in terms of stormwater management we are proposing to modify this emergency works to essentially cut a hole in them and put of Overland flow passing an extreme rainfall of insulate some water out of the Bund if that were to occur notionally that stop logs would be left in place but if we did find that we needed to get water out of there quickly in the tide was low enough we could release that water along with us we are proposing to improve forecasting of these events and continue to work with land information New Zealand regenerate and Environment Canterbury now the cost of the works have been estimated the stage at around two million dollars we are still very in the project lifecycle we bought the support to you with the urgency that was required by the early resolution so the cost estimates at this stage are still will will go through fear the refinement and development as that design progresses and hence the uncertainty that 's applied on that slide there of the estimate of plus or minus 40% now in terms of program we have a significant dependency with the resource consenting that is currently being scoped and subject to what DB said earlier around the complexity consensus they might proceed from here and this short two images are going to work in conjunction with the work the long term work plan week that 's still on which is underway we these short term images allow time for the long term planning to proceed the short term measures do not address groundwater inundation don 't arrest groundwater beneath them and the the short term measures don 't are at risk potentially and in a future earthquake if it were to occur they 're not built with the earthquake resilience and mind now given the short term nature that the risk of failure of those measures is considered to be low and if that long-term planning however does need to consider those various risks in that 's why and so that multi-year is a project we are considering not only inundation and erosion but earthquakes and the other so now is any other hazards that are present through our low-lying coastal areas submitters to get resource consent for the existing temporary works that have been done absolutely is the proposal includes retaining those features and we need to consent is will be required in terms of the land drainage recovery program this this wasn 't the next priority on the list but I 'm assuming that because you 're in the ground on the area and the initial works have been done as temporary works that it 's kind of a you might as well continue with this element of the program while while what 's been done has been done rather than to leave it and complete yes it does present an opportunity for us to address some immediate concerns in the community and address some immediate flood risk I would note that the history floodplain management project inside the program was prioritized after that Aven and the hiccup in that the infrastructure investments signaled with inside the program for those two rivers as significant you 're talking about many many many millions of dollars and that the timing of that would probably be a nearer the end of that 20-year horizon yeah subject of course to LTP processors and funding being approved or otherwise tune in just in terms of the funding so if we were million panned out as the as the ultimate cost what we would you propose that that funding come from in terms of within the program well as I mentioned earlier that the history has been identified inside the program is with significant potential investment in order to deliver the floodplain management plans that may arise so it is programming that funding and of course that 's all subject to the LT people is yes it 's going on so cognizant of that we are proposing and if we deliberate further and this financial year would be to manage that two million dollars with inside the program we had some preliminary design identified for those open river stop banks which we can delay slightly and are still likely to meet our objectives and that work and coincide that with our with the long-term planning as that 's going on and as the regeneration planning proceeds in the particular river corridor and also if we take we we try and split the impact across a range of projects so that we can still progress generally from the program fair significant effect I we have a significantly it 's a relatively small proportion of our budget for this financial year and total it 's still a lot of money yeah don 't get me wrong at all it 's still a lot of money but we still we have the ability to manage that within the program two minute minimize any sub program risks on other projects is I 'm asking all the hard questions first is does this mean that there would be any delay to what is going to be proposed in the hiccup River as a result the short answer is no we have identified significant works already inside for the Heath get inside this financial year we already have a project team that 's working very busily on that and we 'll be reporting to the community and late October my ability to deliver those works including those upstream basins is going to be subject to food the decisions from council so we do need we still have more processes underway to address the flood risks in those areas and again when we manage at a program level we are presented in order to best meet the needs of our community right okay so um now deal did you want to ask a question as because you had your hand up before so I 'll go diancie Arianny clean so one question at the moment is have we thought about the implications on the district sorry the elect stuff around giving the protection here does that have any implications on the height levels or anything like that people who build in that area will sort some preliminary advice from the with regards to this and we need to do some more work but the initial advices no the building platform we will sit with them the building act as above the heart proposed for the bund so their risk is still at that 50-year level with some climate change allowance within the building act is still greater than what the height of the Bund therefore it would still apply so what sort of more work do you need to do that well the the the initial advice was no won 't affect it and it 's the Bund the an actually ensuring that we have infrastructure the nature of the infrastructure is relatively unique and might not have been considered within that framework so in this area before so do the ramifications that are currently identified thought to be very small and the standard processes will still apply in the floor levels and platform levels will be set as previous I think we just need to confirm that though okay let 's initial advice and we 'll confirm it as part of this process I kind of thank you sir thank you and um well we need to do this work in the short term and protect those properties and the the buns and things it 's recognizing that the the Syria wasn 't prioritized and I could understand that the you know he 's get an even higher priority but within each of these areas so within the heath get in the Aven areas and in this one separately would we normally within the land drainage recovery program be spending additional money to protect houses that actually haven 't flooded so currently this is supposed to there are was that worth generally within the plan we prioritize properties where houses have flooded above the floor level and these are in an inconvenience with street flooding but I mean episode extremely expensive way to get rid of all the flooding across the city and all streets so in other areas like Heathcott are we planning on protecting houses that haven 't actually floated within the program where you go we take some considerable effort and hydraulic modeling to understand the flood risk from a range of sources now any storm event is unique and we don 't we can 't rely solely on historical flooding to identify flood risk in areas because the rainfall that might have occurred recently or and that occurred during the occupation are being given resident won 't be reflective of all the full spectrum of rainfall events that might occur and that flood risk that might be evident to that property so we apply military rigorous computer modeling to establish flood risk at a at a profit level and we seek to corroborate that against recent flooding so yes absolutely we consider areas of we use it an addition to computer modeling to identify flood risk to private property and that informs a program in conjunction so we rely on we use both and both are very important but we prioritize those areas with the house that actually have flooded and and then go well there are other have properties that might in a future event but they 're less of a priority because they 're not it seems to be weird the the stuff on Heath gets it I mean and you weren 't here when we discussed the dropped an area but there is no way that we only considered those that actually flooded is requiring potential protection and you 're talking about the potential and under the flood models which in this case are far greater than the ones that actually flooded on that particular occasion could well as I alluded to earlier we haven 't hidden the opportunity within the time frame and producing this report to do that detailed hydraulic modeling and a may yield and a flood risk that is lower than thirty six houses I 've got houses is what we call like a bathtub if you just filled up that water up to that level that is the number of houses that might be risky and we still need to do floor level server and detail upon them to quantify but I think that the the modeling that has been undertaken to date has been coincidental with the observed flooding so we 've got to look many years into the future as well and we 've got to consider that all of the city and we haven 't necessary activated who had swimming events in recent history or post earthquake that have created or resulted in flooding and some areas where our models are predicting it so within the pro within the program we will come up what there will be projects to address flood risk which hasn 't yet eventuated since the earthquake section it 's been a relatively short period of time since the earthquake and a hydrological since so the types of rainfall with that has fallen hasn 't necessarily been representative all the different types of rainfall so how long would it of those floor levels to see whether we were actually protecting 86 houses or actually many fewer and you know should we be doing it before we can much to a large spend of money well odds suggest that we the sort of the dual minimum option presented inside the reporters to stabilize the emergency works and that is there the work that has identified a net option as likely to be required they 're a resource consenting process regardless so if we seeking retrospective resource consent we want these buns to stay there for 20 years we don 't need to do some work the additional spending in order to extend the Bund further north is is could be subject to well will be subject to allow to report we 've one of our is the resolutions proposed or the recommendation that staff we 've offered is to report back to account sort of later date the resolution does instruct a special construction but there will be an additional reporting between officials arise and we will be doing that hydraulic modeling and floor level assessment within that fear work affair after fierce challenge so one of those issues that might arise might actually be you coming to us in saying hey listen our modeling shows that those properties aren 't as a risk when we thought they might be and this workers actually not a priority but there is a possibility of that I their flu little surveys will take some time to undertake they require access to the property and a little drop in and all that and significant amounts of work from the survey team to go out there and click the data and the hot drop modeling again will take some time and we 'll we 'll look to progress our design subject to a decision today from Council in those areas but again if any significant within the infrastructure project within the side the capital program of the ignition significant issues that arise and development development of those projects we come back to Council and report on those and and sometimes there is cost and in essence since it might be the identified progress but in part of the report Beck will also be the do the retrospective consenting on the Southshore burt and potentially stabilizing in their area anyway so there 'll be a marginal difference in terms of the that 's required to expand given that we 've already made some temporary stock bag decisions up the bridge street eaned certainly yeah Yani Glenn David Phil thank you for the presentation and the work that you 've been doing and oh you 've been working really hard on this issue um just at a high level in 2015 in November we had a really good land journey to recovery program that showed a really cool schedule of all the different projects is there anything more recently that we have that shows us the status of the program because I 'm sort of struggling to to kind of find all the different things that we we kind of agreed that we were going to do but then kind of what 's happened to each one sure well we do report back through the land range working group on the program progress and projects to report up through ite I understand through monthly reporting so through the Kent 's tender council processes I just think they 'll be really useful for the public and for us to get an overview of the program schedule so that like the questions that are bring us today we can actually see here 's the other ones that were planned and whatever reason they haven 't happened or they 're on track and one particular just wanted to ask about because we 've we 've seen the money we 've done the emergency works here and I appreciate this too stabilized but there were other areas that have been flooding quite badly where works been I guess proposed and with a there 's any moved to bring that forward as well so just want to ask you about Bromley and my understanding was that there was a Charlesworth drain that was going to the staffer here that answer questions about what makes it no no no no no I 'm just gonna say that there is a discussion with the community boards tomorrow I think with the land drainage recovery program working group so I think that that 's 't the group to the to actually get there so I mean I 've kind of would almost like to ask Pauline if she would take that on board in terms of getting a an updated report to a tee on the actual whole program I just think it would be useful the reason I ask it though is I 'm reluctant little feast and and that 's why that the recommendation that I 've kind of worked on us as to is to actually have a public facing reporting framework look time frames may change you know is this paper evidence as if it 's an opportunity to do something because we 're already in the ground and we 've already applying for resource consents you know it 's kind of you might as well while you 're still there and that that 's that 's movable face but I think pointers is a good one and the sense that the wider public and that 's why I think that a standing item on on more than one community board agenda might be the hellcat River you know and an Easter II issue as well this is what I 'm really trying to understand as we 've had a whole bunch of adverse flooding events over the last 12 months two years and what I can 't what I don 't get any seat solve is what works being done short term emergency response works being done to address all the areas that are flooded we 've got a lot of detail about South Shore and what I 'm concerned about it we 're considering today I just finish what I 'm concerned about the Pointer project without knowing what the other projects that are gonna miss out in terms of the fabrics already they 've already said that if it 's to be paid for in this financial year it will come from the Avon stop banks area of work that it 's on the program but it 's a long way out so it 's a bring forward as part of the LTP sorry what I 'm trying to understand are there any other works that we should be doing as a short-term emergency or recovery response done if they were funded I need the council our staff to report back on this area if council if staff have been asked to report back on a number of other areas they would have done so so I think that I 'm happy to do a notice of motion that 's why I don 't think a notice of motion is helpful but I 'll talk to you about it on another occasion Glen thank you I put our two quite different questions just on option number three to fear on a very short-term basis there very area effectively in the middle which we say very short to me is thinking weeks or months or there 's a bit like how long 's a piece of stream but have you got something closer and I mean we 're thinking just a you know sort of several weeks they have maybe four to six weeks or something just just to get yeah it 's some information back to us so that we could actually consider do it well because I think the community and looking for comfort yeah that the location of the Bund it was there a fear fear assessment of the feedback that we 've had from the community okay I would just offer a word of caution here of course we have in order to get a report to Council there are periods of times timeframes deadlines we need to make in it does take some time so I would suggest that certainly will be its monthly more six to eight weeks rather than four sites okay and probably I was thinking more that 's where the community board comes on so the four to six weeks to the community board and then six to eight weeks to the council I mean I either the timeframes I think they were this has to go through the community board so it was these does for ownership yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and my other one was just on the regulatory environment its resource consent dependent you 're talking about New Zealand coastal policy statement so we 're waiting for leadership from up high that 's basically what you 're saying no no sorry and Olivia in a a high-level document that 's already in place so it was introduced sorry that version is 2010 so that 's the one there we have to give effect to in terms of any resource management documents right so it 's so in terms of national direction around natural hazards this something separate although we 'd be being asked to give effect to something that 's prior to a significant event you know that 's what do you live in quakes which significantly altered the landscape of the area we 're talking about it 's pretty hard live also wouldn 't go down to that degree of detail but it 's one of those higher order documents that you know here 's quite a strong legislative and regulatory basis so I mean that the consenting environment and there there 's obviously a whole lot of things that Debbie 's referred to and her slide and they 're identified within the report so whatever process you use those will be up for consideration so it 's tricky with all the coastal hazards landscape overlays in there okay David I 'm thinking just ongoing stormwater management and and stream logs there seems to be a degree of unsuitability and the design of some of the stormwater outlets particularly the employed street outlet which is an area that does seem to be one of of consistent flooding including can you tell me what sort of process you may engage to ensure firstly that we have effective stormwater egress from these drains which then may sort of prove that some of the storm though the stop logs may not be in fact necessary yeah unfortunately you can 't ensure anything with both flooding we just run reduce the risk of flooding and there are things that occur during an event that not necessarily on foresee or wall but not might be uncontrollable and one of those things is had the bit of the history might move during an event and that can affect the operation of those outfalls yeah I think questioning was more around the duckbill type of outlet there and particularly the ebb tide street one sense to be silted up more often when it 's clear that quickly sets up again and to ensuring that those outlets are functioning properly first before we would consider stoplights so those the duckbill valves generally are on maintenance cycles so the city could do go out and inspect in them but the right that is a highly mobile bit of the history and we are initiating some design work around that particular outfall to see if we can improve its performance an addition to that we have temporary pumping deployed when the flood levels are observed so that we can over pump that outlet in case of blocks so we have both an operational response in the design response underway okay my second question is it 's my understanding that the OSL report and one of the reasons why it was so widely accepted by the South Shore residents was the fact that have actually embraced a range of treatments along that section of the coastline from had engineering safety engineering to natural age can you explain to me where you consider this typical that other had engineering approach the fillers that are offered within the report do indicate hard engineering faces so rock revetment report was it was more focused on that harder engineering stall the the history each treatment itself is obviously subject to some concern from the community and in response the resolution or sector engage more or less community and do more work in that space so you would agree that the report did offer a range of treatments the OHS self-report well what was presented in the diagrammatic form is far more towards the the hard engineering style the exact wording and the ACL report I wouldn 't like to offer the explicit commentary on I just make the point that I think that there was a conscious effort to ensure and in that report that a range of environments were considered in developing a solution for social thank you thanks Tom in for a huge amount of work in this report and I 've got a number of questions what just done the we know the number of houses that were flooded and sales sure sure do you know the number of houses that were flooded on the Heathkit River in the same during the same event same storm extensive door-knocking size in both the Heathkit rivers and and south shore and my understanding I 'd have to confirm with my colleagues is that numbers around between 13 I think it 's 13 properties in the Heathkit the original instruments were hired that around 17 I believe so our lightest figures slightly lower than made an oyster mother 17 again we 're going to continue to speak to those people about that of in turn and gain an understanding and then they have the event and occurred on their individual properties thanks Tom and there 's been clear reference for further work needing to be done around this proposal but and just ask you about the costs though so the costs are two million dollars plus or minus forty percent so in fact if it 's strictures write out the full cost of this plan could be 2.8 million is a creep as I mentioned in the early response we will have an opportunity report back to Council on the implementation program and at that point will seek to update the cost estimate as I did mention earlier again design life cycle and so there are some uncertainties still in the cost estimates and will seek to reduce their uncertainty in that through the reporting thanks Tom and there 's reference in the report that future decisions could mean that the band would need to be moved or even abandoned so I 'm just clearly in fact the shortlist is it correct in what we take from it that this short-term solution may well not be consistent or it could be inconsistent with the long with future long term plans there is a risk that is identified in the report and that long-term planning is underway and I wouldn 't want to predetermine the outcome from that it 's going to involve significant investigative effort is identified net multi hazard paper that recently came to you but also will involve discussions with the community and decisions from yourselves so as hard wouldn 't want to prejudice in the outcome of that process and decide this decision here and the intent is very much for these works to be temporary or short-term so that we don 't preclude options inside Indian sort of refer to this before but there 's reference in the report and for people perhaps because there 's short term effects if you like there in fact there impact on people sort of view that in fact that will be stay for a long term that in fact it will give people some comfort were in fact that may not be the case at all but in fact this is just a short-term me is a short-term measure so doing what should we have concerned that in fact the short-term effects it may well lead to some unrealistic expectations on behalf of the compact the part of the community again within the report we identified that community perception as a risk with this decision and however I 'd like to say that the long-term planning won 't as therefore the community as well we 're seeking good outcomes from the community and so that long-term planning and and so it 's my view that will seek to address all all the issues inside that long-term planning and if we 're successful in doing so then the nature far less important I think so and I 've got one final question if I may just about the regulatory framework which you referred to Dewey so can we take it there in fact of this short term option with the band would actually meet the requirements of the coastal but a policy statement I think we need to do that work so we don 't know that yet okay let 's get a resource consent yes and so I also then wondered it would would it if we as referred to any recommendations asked to have this done by way of a regeneration play in regeneration strategy good would we would the the the deep design strongly to meet the coastal policy statement here I think then none of the issues we have identified through the planning framework assessment go away just because you use a different piece of legislation so they 're there for a reason because they are they identify issues that need to be considered as part of in your process so if we were to use some other type of process we 'd still need would be that a resource consent would be the preferable way forward in terms of you the resolution is to go with a terminal or any of the options they would need to concede and advise you as that would be the best way forward to enable it to occur thanks Richard thank you Tim I think you know just first of all a knowledge Keith you and your team Tom Peter its situated it 's really first when you do so much work and it 's like an iceberg you have to do that work underneath because without that the top that is the finishing that is a waste of time if that 's not done properly so I just want to acknowledge that and my respect for you my question is actually to Carlene because we 've been live streamed and many of the hit could be watching this and I know we 're talking about South Shore and I totally understand the reasoning for this because we 've dear now we 've been done a bit of work that just seems logical the same with flocked in _''_3883.55 and Heath get my constituents and others outside that and I know that my colleagues because the Heathcott runs from fear lead right up to areas along her hayride in areas that you wouldn 't even know are being flooded if you were in affected by it so only you and I know it 's a bit long-winded but we 'll just go with it but the annual plain councillors we wanted to keep it 5.5 forthright and we have a finite amount of money so we even flow to try and make that happen so my question I guess us as it is extra bleed ership team in yourself aware that when we come to the long-term plan that this will be a priority for many which will then maybe if it cuts to other programs like roadie and others I 'm just putting his own because it 's serious for me we 're very aware at the challenges are in terms of um keeping rates at an affordable level and increasing rates and affordable but with a huge volume of work that we have to do so it from the earthquakes are these new things that community I look for as well as well as these longer-term issues around land drainage prevent flood prevention and actually that will be the decision for Council in terms on how you prioritize those things so we 'll be providing you with scenarios but there will be the real challenge in terms of do you invest upfront and get some of these things done more quickly but that will mean an increase in rates or do take longer to address some of these issues well and it 's probably the thing to my question that may not because if we as counselors like and I talk to myself I am going to be very clear about my priorities and so if there is a Trojan horse like I 'm funding from the ins ETA for a new road which 5050 or whatever I will have to look at myself very hard and say can I support that because if I want to keep my the rate payers want to keep rates at a certain level and there are many that are not guess I 'm just cilium signal to a you and your ELT aware that that may be one of the the questions in one of those hard calls that we have to make as well what the fires are very simple in the sense that there was life risk private property and then everything else it seems that will you know we are focused but a deep sand flows a but we are absolutely aware and these will be really challenging decisions then counsel will need to make once it 's got a worry information because I feel I ask that question because those in the hip you know there 's Tony logic why we 'd have flopped and no question about that that seems logical I would direct logical why we 're looking at this now but you know dealing with those families and though you know it is very very hard and we have to make a move on this it has been leave too long thank you and one of the and just sort of following on from Colleen one of the pieces of work that is is to you know and I 've been calling it the earthquake ate my homework but it 's a it 's really a statement of where we are you know because I don 't_''_4088.02 I don 't_''_4088.77 I still don 't think the public quite realize how much more horizontal infrastructure needs to be done the recommendation of the under pendant hearings panel that we enter into a cost-sharing agreement with central government on land drainage so you know I mean the fact that the roads and the pipes were covered by the cost-sharing agreement has actually left a gap in terms of that earthquake related damage in terms of the land drainage recovery program so that 's that 's something that 's obviously on hold until after a certain event on the 23rd of September but it is something that we will be talking to the uncommon government regardless of who that is and it is absolutely vital that people understand that there are enormous costs lying ahead of us in terms of the whole program and and some of them are absolutely attributable to the level of the to a point there we have to look it and split it in half isn 't water quality isn 't because all those literals and split and the the minimizing of possible the elimination of of flooding so the two things so let 's get the flooding sorted and in the water quality and maybe that 's a discussion that we have to have in the future yeah and when we 've set our strategic priorities and you know that the work that that will entail also does them to the requirement to get the whole system up and running as best we can yeah Mike Sarah I was sorry Mike Pauline 's Sarah thank you I 'm just want to give a few things straight so obviously the the flooding on the twitters July was caused by a combination of in so you could say that perfect storm I think it saw records the highest in 43 years as some ear in two properties two homes were flooded one temporary one permanent and emergency works done would actually never took those two properties from its type of flood the we 've reduced the risk of flooding of those bodies of above will flooding that said the subsequent tide had a very similar water level to that on the 22nd it very similar to that on the 21st and it was with a different combination of air pressure wind and wave action so essentially what we what we see is there there are different factors that can combine to produce elevator wood levels and that we have identified that there is risk to properties and other places and just the two that that flooded during that first tide cycle and there are different storms that might occur to elevate water levels and the area and so like my response early around computer modeling we need to look at the whole risk profile not just what we 've observed recently and that 's what 's driven the recommendations inside the report is our understanding of the flooding risk of overtopping of Eastridge along their entire frontage and in the report we were suggesting that the level of the proposed works is similar to that sport so the mural flood task force vulnerability level one I don 't know the number of stock might hit it was as I said it was yeah a couple of people profit and they don 't know if there were this similar the same properties or but because what I 'm saying is we with obviously their whole task for were identified and then to have been a flatter than this recent event which we could say is the perfect storm and we 've done emergency where that potentially could protect those will all give them better less risk from us a similar event in so I 'm just we 're playing and potentially to spend up to 2.8 million dollars if it does go out there far to protect an area but tensioner we could just do that be a minimum and actually stabilize what we 've already done to protect the houses that actually at most risk so you know there 's been a couple of things I think identified this ace actually we 're not too sure we 're not too sure what they 've been asking impactors and we 're not too haven 't done modeling from the recent event which appears to be one of the worst have been stuff had in recent times yeah I agree there is uncertainty there is uncertainty with every decision we make and in the but the stage with the project for it it 's earlier than would normally seek a decision from Council but we 're under urgency and we we want to get the right decision absolutely that 36 properties is something we 'll continue to work on understanding that progress my recollection of the two properties and the Merrifield task forces that there are different I 'll have to confirm that and we can bring that back to you if you 'd like and as I mentioned before it is we 're trying to address all components of tidal and rainfall flooding and not all those combinations it recruits its youthquake so there may be risks that haven 't_''_4420.38 been made evident since and March 2014 event or and these recent events Pauline a question about having to be tied to the ongoing maintenance of these temporary works if they were approved 't tried to establish the exact nature of those costs the land and which the funders placed is well through the park is counting managed and maintained by council I couldn 't give you an exact figure on that sorry and just does the option one does it include the stop logs Creek so option one use yes it does no they would be ready to be operated during an event where we come in and remove those in install bumps very much depend on the nature of the storm of you that 's so sure if we had a very large rainfall event and not a significant history tire tidal have been a mystery then you 'd want to lift the stop logs and release that storm water if that you had an extreme level and the estuary and above the stop log level then you would want open stop box uses the history and that 's when you pump over the top of it so instead those pumps they teach me that we thank you mm-hmm Sarah you guys I 'm shaky couple of things on the carrot one very very long sentence which sometimes leads to lack of clarity and I 'm just looking at its this year which ensure that the Bund positioning in other measures including soft engineering maximize opportunities to mitigate against coastal erosion in the area it 's a couple of things of it not quite sure whether that means that the the other measures are actually the erosion protection measures themselves like the plantings and those kind of things that we 're looking at trying to see how they impact on the erosion but unfair to star vibrator what I meet about it was that Bund positioning has only one element that if that they have fixed the potential for coastal erosion yes oh so it 's it 's it 's both bun positioning and other measures which may be planting which may be but that but it 's making it very specific that we 're talking about soft engineering as well yep so the other thing that 's not completely clear is that when we say maximize the opportunities to mitigate against coastal erosion and their area what it sounds like from the east you trust the other day which is there yeah that is that we are prioritizing erosion mitigation against environmental concerns and we haven 't had a conversation yet about what we 're going to do in the area and whether that is the desired outcome no but given that this is in the coastal environment you know that that requires consideration of air can so I mean that that letters written to ensure that we are able to talk about what other opportunities that we can take to mitigate skins occur against coastal erosion what it 's trying to do is to say to the community by putting a buns there that 's not the end of this story we actually want to ensure that the coastline is protected and and obviously that in naturalization could go there as well as soft engineering that the reality is is that there are plantings the arrow mechanism somewhere we saw that wonderful presentation from Katrina Hill from San Francisco there 's a lot of who who made it very clear that I 've graduated option actually can provide both storm as it hurts and it also has the advantage as it comes up providing the flood protection as well but nothing is an absolute no there is no absolute against coastal erosion there 's no absolute no there 's not against flood flood risk as well and just you can with number six that refuses very and will tell you right now absolutely so that number six refers back to number three so just checking that that means that any mitigate coastal erosion mitigation it 's just it 's going to come back to Council for decision after options have been explored as it right everything 's coming back to cancel even even passing option one does not put us in a position it just it just enables staff to apply for the resource consent well they 're going to that they 'll bring all the work back here won 't_''_4742.23 you is that the idea only if these issues we here by Burnside the report I think it 's paragraph four point nine identified some additional work that we 'd envisage being required to confirm the yeah design would definitely bring those back to Council and end you have asked us to bring back an implementation program at the same time it 's logical to bring vehicle provides cost estimate if we are able to do so if it has changed significantly from what we see today yeah the the the the actual money we have to sign off on on the next occasion not now right risking food could you please present resolution 103 of option 1 you what do you want to look at option 1 oh sorry in resolution to be the wording is undertake the work identified to report to progressed this option into construction yeah if you sort an additional decision-making point I 'd suggest you report the progress and to design consenting and consultation and that would trigger another award of course if we trigger another report they could be Prudential fillets in doing so so that 's the South Shore one though correct but as the and and struggling staff should be a separate sort of a paragraph underneath be yeah yeah guys to a nd okay so put a do over and instruct staff to undertake the week I didn 't find the report to progress this option and to design consenting and implement implementation he last night I 'm wearing your amendment probably didn 't drag the okay it 's a plan with lovestruck people is not no it 's not emotionally so make them end and struck apply to the whole thing so so so we 're it says end and strapped no no just do a return hit return twice it end oh yeah no that 's fun no it 's not a see pull it over yep yep yep this country that 's fine leave it like that could I just get some clarity on what do you mean by the word implementation no it 's in construction it should read what what you 've got in construction so just just go delete delete all data yeah hold it up I just hit delete to have to construct oh okay yep no this one and take out hand implementation nope sorry and put back in yep in construction noting the need to report back on implementation in team is to report back prior to getting into or that stage there should approve option one read approve option one and principle yeah yeah yeah three of option one and principle so you are sitting for staff to report back to you prior to building anything on costing any other issues an implementation program any other issues that are awesome well given that the resource consent has to be applied for anyway it probably doesn 't effect the time frame at all because usually you can as soon as you 've got the resource consent what yeah no so so does it affect the timetable because will you be applying for resource consent we will need to apply for resource consent retrospective resource consent for the emergency works you have to anyway yeah there is my understanding but wouldn 't you want to apply for that for the temporary that the strengthening of them anyway it is may be is it yeah well essentially that they amount to work needed for the emergency works consent will be the same as what you need further strengthening so essentially it hold them up it is the intention though that we report back prior to seeking resource consent so I know the way that the way that I was kind of banking that was for this for essentially this area that particularly the South Shore area that it was kind of like you you might as well look to the law at once rather than have to resource consent processes you have to by law apply for the for the retrospective consent anyway so the question is is can we can we wrap up and debt the the decision on South Shore which has not been a that 's not an unprincipled decision but it 's a decision to proceed to the resource consent for that as well yeah I mean for me it 's just making sure that we know that that extended work is actually necessary before we come up to it yeah but that 's the approval and pets of all so so I 'm happy with the stabilizing the current staff Richard speed of conceal that sort of stuff it 's just there knowing that yeah yeah you 're asking it or to do their across the air so yeah so can we split them so this your model suggests that the South during emergency works the resolution could read a proven to construction after an emergency works yeah that 's essentially option to approving option two and then you 're saying yeah in addition to option two you wish us to consider the works between BT street and Bridge Street however you would like us to report back prior to construction yep on any of the issues in benefits and cost of those works yeah and then you 've also instruct us in that middle section to do some more work yeah so is it possible to approve option two and the report yep so rather than just do all that I think that either we take a quick break and my TX should be a good idea if we just took a 10-minute break and in that time we 'll we 'll just give the final wording right people can go and get themselves a cup of tea or coffee I 'll get myself somebody then we 'll come back and debate the reservation maybe when we come better about this place I quite like some clarification around future obligations of Linz especially in relation of the financial part because that 's referred to in paragraph four and five we don 't know that that 's the whole point of it there 's no legal obligation for them at this stage which is why I raised the whole question of the cost-sharing discussion that we have to have it but loons may be prepared but that in terms of their ownership because they did do some work prior to the price of the flooding event is that right let 's do some work order the sierra do some work well then mine sinning is lin 's and operating or doing the red zone clearance and enacted some landscaping nature which is why we know sometimes you don 't get more basin you don 't know whether or not they would come forward with any no and we 've got to assume not but certainly we 're not giving up the ability to talk to central 's runs or someone else that that there 's a contribution in terms of the work that needs to be done so that you 're not going to get an answer today on that it 's crystal clear in the paper and it was last week as well so all right so we 'll just take a quick ten minutes so if people could be back here at quarter to ready to go and if staff have come up the seams you challenging when we don 't have you know sort of a lot of time to deal with some of these these complexities and it 's interesting because I had hope that this was the only item on the agenda yes but I think our time is going to be somewhat challenged for the other items on the agenda so I might at some point have a consideration with the chief executive about what what could actually be deferred until the next meeting so what what consideration has lead us to is that as one to receive the South Shore floodplain and management short term options report with attachments construction so it it enables us to go ahead with basically the South Shore and that little bit around give tide which have had emergency works done on them and it 's about stabilizing those so it 's the retrospective resource consenting they can get on with that and they can deal with with the that it 's yeah so yeah so they can go ahead with that so that 's agreeing to option to but then refer the remainder of the report to the next coastal buried community board meeting which I 'm reliably informed as next Monday for the board 's comment and request staff report back to the council meeting 28th of September 2017 now that 's not a community board meeting so what I 'm going to propose is that we actually invite the chair of the coastal bird community board to present the community boards position on the balance of the options at the meeting itself which he would have been able to do had it been a community board me that they were reporting back to so so would someone like to move that about we don 't make the same mistake twice as the 28th of September date a realistic date for stuff to come back to us to me but this via well that this is this would enable them to come back with a with a set of resolutions which we can consider on the day but would you like to it 'll be my interpretation of that resolution that we would not be doing the design work those other areas would just we 'll be talking with a community board how they thought this to address or what options they might want to consider in their design work and and how they might see the resolutions being worded in such a way that would address the concerns we 'll wait have the extra information that people were asking for today about the properties that might or might not be a risk you know the 36 the potential over estimation of those kind of things that 's not cool we might do the entire flood modeling you know so we 're bringing back the extended potentially thorough community board or would back to us but we would still wouldn 't hit the information about whether it was necessary or not we would just have the community board saying please do it there would be the extra information we 'd hear we 'd hit the community you know and I think actually that 's a little bit unfair in relation to the situation that we 're confronted with here and I don 't think that it 's I think what what we want in terms of the next set of recommendations in a way I kind of want you to put to one side the recommendations that we 're considering here today we because we will be working to there 's a recommendation that enables staff to progress design works and scope consenting and requirements so we 're not talking about the next step being approving construction so the only one that we 're approving for construction today as the option to and then we are asking staff to work with the community board to come what the what what they want to have considered in the design works and scoping consenting that 's what 's going to come back after the community board has had a say about what they want consider because from the previous recommendation that we were looking at that issue around coastal erosion where the Bund is quite a distance from the coastline itself as an issue to the community so I 'd much rather that they drilled into their issue and came back with a set of resolutions that we can we can work through but the advantages is that we 'll have an opportunity in that timeframe to do another workshop so that we 're very clear about what the issues are I mean I thought we were clear on that issues on Tuesday when we had an initial workshop on this matter but you know things have changed in a relatively short period of time so that 's why I 'm thinking that this is a good outcome and someone like to second that David so that 's moved by Pauline second two by David as yep are you still confident around the 1 million dollars for the budget we 're not all you clear about how much money we 're actually approving 40% on that as with the other options and again it was earlier and the design process we still have more work to do absolutely again in here with any project within the construction of the physical works program for council would come back and report you if there 's significant variance from any in any issues that arise so if we found through the resource consenting process that there are considerably more onerous requirements for example and we needed to spend considerably more money on landscape treatment for example than would have to come back and explain that outcome yeah and see through that you know it 's sickly their involvement yeah I 'm Phil I just want to cheat with staff if what we 're doing with the third recommendation here about reporting what the costa brava committee board if in fact that 's going to delay any urgent future meetings with the residents on the heath gap which I know are planned it is it I 'm just where I 'm coming from I 'm concerned that there whereas the earlier priorities it 's not fear well it 's no I 'm sorry it 's not fear on staff to put that to them we ask them to report by the end of the month that 's what we ask them to do so it 's a bit unrealistic and unfair to ask them what impact that has on a program which we know you 're a member of the land drainage recovery program working group they 're meeting tomorrow to talk about Heath cuts so I 'm coming from a strategic point of view with respect and I think my question is fear well I can assure the councillors that we have essentially different teams working on those two issues in there and both within the program but working independent of each other we 're not duplicating where is it well sorry we hear those parallel streams they 're working independently a decision here today should not affect the outcome or progress on the heath Caen thank you right is there any debate calling yes very quickly because we 've spent a lot of time on this it 's an incredibly complex situation and there was some conflicting information and the reports there particularly we 're comparing this this has been a very rushed process and it 's our fault because of what we we called for it in response to an event and this is understandable but I think there 's more work to be done on here and particularly in the light that there is a risk that team pre routes could impact on long-term solutions there 's also a gaps and the information may or may not be required so councilors need a certain level of comfort about these gaps so I think this is a very good solution for today and I will be supporting it yeah um I think what 's really important here is that we 've had a number of flooding events and we 've got to learn Jonah recovery program but we we need to get to a point where we actually change because we 're living in a dynamic environment we 've seen that with the wither and we need to have a much better system of prioritizing event and so you know I appreciate that these emergency works have been done in this area and absolutely that was the right thing to do at the time but it would be good to get a much more holistic approach to how we 're spending money which effectively is what this is asking us to do and what the benefits are and I understand that we 'll have a chance to do that a little bit tomorrow and in perhaps later on I still think if you go back to the mural Task Force on flooding there were a number of recommendations in there and it would be really good to get that updated just so that we 're really clear about what are we agreed to do as a council so that the community can understand where our priorities are and those priorities may change based on the events that we 've had and that would be fair enough but we need to get some transparency over how we 're prioritizing our expenditure so I think it is important to get these emergency works to construction ironically and with the whole relationship with Sarah and lens obviously we lost that opportunity and I think it 's important that we continue to try and talk to government we 've just done a cost share refresh but you know it 's a real shame that delay and drainage hasn 't been incorporated in there let 's hope that we can get that sooner rather than later the other point I just wanted to make is that you know I think it 's important as a council that we do just actually just take a very quick moment to reflect and extend afterwards to the people of Houston and Texas for what they 're going through we often get emails around how Houston 's great in terms of planning because it just has no planning controls and people can develop everywhere and one of the really interesting things I think some of those scientists are now looking at is the lack of Pervis surfaces and where does the water go and that 's actually an issue that we still face in christchurch with all the development that were allowing to occur that the staff are working really hard on those flip those bigger flood or mob flooding models to understand that but today I think as we look at a response to a flooding event we 've had we should extend our thoughts and sympathies and and anything else that we can to let the people of Texas in Houston know that we 're thinking of them and that if there 's anything that we can do I 'm sure that we would be asking central government or our chief executive to consider consider that because um some of you may know people in Houston I 've got family over there I 've received photos and it 's it 's pretty horrendous what 's going on so thank you to the work staff are doing flooding is not easy it 's a difficult issue I think this is a good interim solution but I think we can 't take foot off the gas for those other solutions and priorities that we 've got post the events that have happened thanks Yanni I think that 's this that 's a really good support these recommendations you know obviously receiving the information number two he is establishing the emergency we extend number three but the rule is I 'd just like to say I don 't want us to be divided over this I mean laying drainage and flooding issues affect the whole city and of course we 're here as city councillors rather than wood which is a teach and not easily resolved when it 's your own patch and you you know naturally want to advocate for it but all the wards are important something else I 'd like to say is all 54 members in in my view I think we need to really take seriously that role of interpreting climate change with our communities it 's not only Houston it 's Bangladesh Nepal India I attended the screening of An Inconvenient sequel last week the scenes out of Miami to be honest are not too different to New Brighton on a fine clear day that the water coming up through the drains okay so there are some hard realities we need to face and it we actually have a I 've been politically bent over it but I think that the problem is we actually have to face these things and it 's hard to do but the evidence is overwhelming so we are a microcosm of what 's happening globally I mean there 's no escape from it thank you go thank you I 'm happy to support these recommendations I 'm really glad that they 've been reduced from the earlier ones I think that it 's important that as a council we continue to be strategic about how we do Oliver Lillian drainage and the language working program has been set up to do precisely there and I just think it 's really important that in fact we don 't just listen to those who come to council with with the loudest voice there are as has been indicated huge numbers of people who 've been flooded along the earth ket and in fact we need to make sure that our planning actually improves their situation so we deal with that also as fast as possible and I 'm sure we can and thank you fiercely rather difficult subject and the amendment that we have before us today in stark contrast to trust to my own tirade last week I would now like to acknowledge the staff for their work both in the emergency and ongoing with South Shore and South New Brighton but also a right to ignores the difficulty that we have dealing with the many land drainage issues around the city and I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to complete the emergency works that we have started in the South Shore area really I had a lot to say if we 'd gone with the other recommendations but I would like to say that the self Broughton domain is a unique and special area in Christchurch in the eastern suburbs in for the city as a whole and it 's a great asset and we really as a community want to ensure that the best options are considered for self one and and ultimately for the city we promote ourselves as a can-do council and I say this is this remit here today is an opportunity for us to showcase a get the best outcome possible what we are talking for this area as I said a moment ago when we look at prioritizing things around the city the investment here is not a huge amount of money but I do appreciate that there are priority concerns and and I 've really acknowledged the the issues in an extremely supportive of measures that we need to take in the in the heath catchment as well so I think everyone for their patience today and coming to what we have come to now and I believe that we now do have the opportunity to select and reflect in a more measured since and come that we can all agree upon so I will have pleasure and voting for this resolution thank you they 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye more as opposed they know it 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "thank you so now that Jamie 's back in the room not that we were particularly waiting for him for anything but your timing is perfect we 'll move on to item 20 the Easter Sunday trading hours now my intention is to continue working through the open agenda until approximately 30 and when I propose that we take a 10-minute break and then come back into public excluded because there are a number of items on the open agenda that need to be dealt with today and there are a number of items on the public excluded agenda that need to be dealt with today so I propose that we do those items that we need to do or it 's good for us to do on the open agenda before 30 going to PX at 30 after a short break deal with all of the public excluded agenda and then if we 've got time come back into open to deal with anything that 's left over anything that we haven 't managed to deal with by approximately 5 o 'clock I would propose we adjourn the meeting deal with anything that 's outstanding so that 's kind of the program for the rest of the afternoon we do need to do item 11 yep 11 is one that I 've got on my list and there 's the public excluded part that goes with that as well yep no that 's fine so what I propose to do is 20 and then go back to your et Committee and work through the rest of the open agenda until approximately 30 so item 20 Easter Sunday trading hours David you want to make any comment on this well it was a subject that went through the regulatory performance committee meeting last month the feeling of the meeting at the time was that they wouldn 't pursue the mailer as chairman I didn 't support that particular notion and Jamie was unable to be at the meeting that they had signaled an intention to propose an amendment to the motion that was before us on the day which you now see here today which I am happy to ii okay so that 's a foreshadowed motion so we 've is the first thing that we would consider but in the event that that fails we would then deal with the foreshadowed motion which is moved and seconded so let 's deal with it in that way you know my my own intention was to have us look at option two which is the one that allows us to think of our Corolla has been something quite different than the rest of the city that would allow us to think of a Corral perhaps as more aligned with areas where trading is allowed on an Easter Sunday like for like for example Queenstown and other places around the around the country so right okay Jenny you 're going to raise a procedural matter I 'm guessing it 's procedural so it 's completely up to you since you want to run it but um I don 't disagree with what you 're saying and that would probably be my second you know landing point so my preference and I 'm just saying this to then give you the ability to run it how you like obviously but if my amendment to investigate the possibility that we can trade on Easter Sunday presuming it failed my next best alternative is where you 're at and then third is this the staff recommendation with a committee recommendation to forbid trading on Easter so would is it better than if I put mine I don 't know if I can though with Standing Orders it as an amendment if that failed then it goes to yours and in failing net it goes I 'm just thinking from a cascading sort of way of running it all right so I 've also just had a word in my ear over here which was particularly useful so the for shadow motion is already moved in second yeah so will as ruthless as the motion sure I will then through the comments that I 've just made for shadow that in the event that your motion which is now on the table fails I would move option two and sale event for shadows that she would move the committee recommendation if the first the second both failed so the notion that they all fail I 'll exemption okay let 's let 's deal with it let 's deal with this as we go so because we may not get to we may not even get to two but we may not get to three or four okay so are there any questions on this cuz what I would aim to do I think is just to have one debate and then just put the various motions one after the other as we go through them so questions first of all and the first question is who were asking questions to Brendan are you here for this great and Jamie and Davis is something for you consider whether you 'd be happy to add whether one we could add the words including consideration of exclusive areas so that was reported back to the committee would be either the whole city or exclusive areas mm-hmm so including consideration of exclusive areas just makes it a little bit more specific and all this does is allows the investigation to occur and then be reported back to the committing what recommendation the committee makes on that of course then becomes 've got Yanni and then Vicki and Sarah do we have the legal people okay so areas that have an existing Erie exemption is there a process to put those onto the list and if so what is it described on their national legislation so it would require a bill to go through the parliamentary process of becoming 8 unless it was somehow included in water on the bus changed to the legislation okay so we 've had the answer to the question sounds as though what I doesn 't require my so if we just wanted to make did the discrete geographic area of New Brighton I have opened up able to open on Easter Sunday are we able to do that or do we need to go through a parliamentary process well no you asked a different question you wanted to change the act so if you want to make this a far more cumbersome process then if you wanted to see a poll so you 're layering any specific urea to open so what government have done is that a layered counsel 's to develop a local but you need a policy in order to do that and that aligns with the information that was already provided in a memo which was circulated to councillors on Friday don 't know that I really also kind of want a legal thing on this and I appreciate that it 's not your area Brendan that the council can determine areas that could be open and the council came to and a policy that is somewhere between everything open and everything 's shut that 's my understanding so that 's what the report says as well except that the information that we 're backing up public opinion on is just everything 's open or everything 's shut but I 'm assuming that if we go away and look at possibilities there was a whole range of possibilities in between now the survey information was was reported by Theta aggregate level but also broken down into discreet areas which is where you get quite a variation obviously well it was broken down into banks peninsula and the rest of the city can I can I just the case we can get 'll come back with their information about where that possible or not yeah so that would form part of the discussion that would happen at the committee if this was successful so information on what sort of a policy could be produced would be the first information then committee I 'm sure would have some debate about where that would be applied geographically yani so the information we got seen on Friday on the 18th of August said that we can 't resolve an exemption or exception for allowing shopping trading and defined areas so well I was trying to understand like we can 't_''_603.339 do that but the mechanism for doing that is to establish a policy yeah so it can be done but the mechanism to do it is a policy is required to allow shop trading on Easter Sunday to take place in any part of the city as opposed to in all parts of the city and there 's no parliamentary process to add to the list that others have in terms of the exemptions other than changing the act is that correct well the parliamentary something that is easily done or that I particularly would have thought given that retirements approach was to effectively pass this on to local government to determine on a case-by-case basis that they would entertain although I 'm sure councillors would have be aware that Auckland Council voted on the same issue today and voted 20 votes to one to not have a policy but did pass a resolution effectively asking what being somewhat aggrieved its central government for passing this opportunity or I don 't think that what sword as opportunity onto the so asking central government to relook at the processes here they would prefer a centralized approach which is similar to commentary that we 've made on other similar acts that no past responsibility or liability to territorial authorities yep thank you Seiler thank you and so we have a whole pile of legal requirements about policy work and bylaw work and those kind of things that we have to do and we have the community calling for some things and we have other council priorities is the work on Easter Sunday trading policy if we went priority potentially and policy developed vital development that we have as a council already decided to do I 'll be manageable so it 's important well know something slow down but we don 't think it 's an ugly complex policy but it would obviously be advanced quicker with some clear direction from Council on whether you wanted specific areas or whether you wanted an overall policy in particular if you wanted something in place for Easter next year then we would need to move with the appropriate hice to bring a draft policy bit to the committee so that it could be approved otherwise but effort approved to go through a special consultant procedure in hearings process and to finally agree to policy if it 's there process to be in place for each 2018 if there 's going to be alone extensive period of food the surveying then it 's unlikely we would have anything in place for Easter next year and while we 've had this pain you know we know more was this past giving councils the power to make policies there was some media attention fact that we 're going to have this decision in front of us today a head here 's the council head any eye contact from residents or retail groups and those kind of things wanting to heaven put into decision making or calling for us to make this decision today there 's been no specific contact regarding today we have received I think three letters from people there are members of the public asking the council to not proceed with Sunday trading and we have I think received either a letter or an email from retail New Zealand asking what the council 's approach was I haven 't been able to find that letter or email yet but appears that he has been some contact and do we have an approximate cost of how much it would cost the council and the wave sort of staff time and consultation those kind of things to develop this policy and not off the top of my head but while it 's not a significant and complex piece of work it would take some time to develop in and would take up staff to further consultation and if we for instance had a research company do some more work that might be say another 15,000 Thank You Jimmy one question I 'm not sure even the omission earlier regarding to if staff to establish these Sunday Easter trading policies draft one but I just want to know because you 'll hear including consideration of exclusive area so whether you still will go through a kind of informal consultation with those specific area for instance right CPT maybe in the surrounding the retail shop or souvenir shop era area or some other more tourist area so my question because all the much of this year you have a kinda of step is a 770 the registers you already have a consultation my right so I just don 't know how to establish this one it 's my pleasure yeah the the survey that was done was part of the council 's resident satisfaction survey which takes a statistically appropriate number of people in demographic mix across the whole city there are some areas for instance like Banks Peninsula the number of respondents was very with options around geographic locations it 's likely that we would offer a choice of geographic locations that people could respond by thank you film thank you so the recent satisfaction survey in fact the the way that is conducted professionally and so then fact we can come here ship is a correct that the the conclusions are valid benefit that were and five point eight that something like a higher number of people significantly didn 't want any change with Easter Sunday trading that is correct but there are some caveats have made in terms of the number of people that were surveyed in some parts of the district in that applies particularly to begs financially okay in my other question was was in relation to I guess previously green and it said this the processes would be manageable but potentially the hip the here the hearings panel would need to be called in potentia that could be quite a time-consuming in resource consuming process correct thank you thank you okay so that brings us to the end of questions so is there any debate on this what I then we 've heard the various foreshadowed motions that we 'll just work through one after another as far as we need to go so just knowing what I 'm seeing at the corner of my eye here Jamie your and came to speak to this so the reason why this is the amendment here is for obviously I know it 's not an amendment now sir that 's a motion it 's the substantive the reason why they it 's up there is because I didn 't agree with the staff recommendation fundamentally the question is do you think businesses should be given the option to be open honest to Sunday in my hunt sir is yes and the reason for that is that we 're in a pretty unique situation I don 't need to tell anyone that in Christchurch and we live in the city of Road cones with the perception that we shut and I think if there is any opportunity a hint of an opportunity to send a signal that Christchurch as well and truly open for business I think we should grab it here there nine to five standard jobs with people work all different hours of the day all different days of the week we are very fortunate that we live in a country where anyone that 's lucky enough to have a job usually works in a pretty good environment you 're not forced to work 363 days of the year you can take holidays when you like you arrange it with your own employer and we 're actually reasonably accommodating so I see that given the fact that tourism is is the number one income earner for New Zealand it 's no surprise that seem to such as Queens don 't have a policy which you know allow trading on Easter Sunday so like I said earlier I don 't think it 's in Christchurch as best interests to be reaffirming perceptions that we 're closed for business so if there 's one opportunity that we can grab to say that we 're open I think I I think that we do it this isn 't a complex policy we 've heard staff say that it 's not particularly onerous on because there are plenty about other places that are doing it you know there 's an argument from some quarters saying with us it 's just it 's just it 's one day for goodness sake and I 'd say exactly it 's just one day and I think in this day and age religious holidays aren 't really the be and weand all of life for the 21st century person anymore I think his online shopping I think that people live in a society of convenience and people like to have options so this current situation that we find ourselves in which from my perspective and from my generation I just find Beth Ling and outdated and quite bizarre because it 's actually the time that I 'd like to go out and and do a bit of shopping but the current situation forces closure so developing a policy like I 'm proposing doesn 't foresee thing it just simply provides the option that should a business want to be open should the community have the adequate demand for their business to be able to be open they can to not work that day if they don 't want to for religious reasons they don 't have tone to say they 'll be forced to as a nonsense because unemployment court that employee would go sky-high if they tried to make them so all this is doing is providing an option and I think that we should jump at the chance to say Christchurch is open for business and if we 're a 21st century city where anything is possible III think that we could probably let go of of you know religious holidays that forbid trading if there 's a a reasonable argument for them to be able to trade and if the community want to go shopping on that day so this is a proposal that they 're asking staff to go and develop a policy and I think we should yeah I open open our arms to welcoming and tourists and it doesn 't really matter if it 's if it 's Easter or Sunday or any day come to Christchurch Roden for business thank you so that was Jaime Glen thank you here we are to do with being open on Easter Sunday so open councils just voted three twenty to one that they don 't want to do it they 've picked up on community seen up and on on that and also their economic analysis shows that we 'll have minimal economic impact it 's it 's not how many hours your work I think it 's what you do with your time we need to give our families and kids a break so if you 've got kids in the say teens early 20s you 'll know that they 're tied down all times the day at all times the week it 's it 's it 's forming them mercilessly some of these extended hours there 's only so many hours that people can work and I think a good long weekend is good for families for people to regroup and just have a bit of time to recharge their batteries these are sense in which it 's not just about having business options it is also about money there 's a sense in which the wealthiest one sent want people to days of the year we don 't have to work every last day of the year and if you really want to go along those lines let 's trade i 'll anzac morning then so i don 't actually support this immediate motion i support the original just to give people a bit of time off Sarah thank you and I can say that there there is there is one thing that I agree with with Jamie and that is that we are well past having a religious holiday completely agree but we do need holidays and it is disingenuous to say that I work potentially honor honor the the trial 90 days or anything like that would have any sort of power with a large employer to say I don 't want to work this day if you 've got a more contract you 're going to have to be open they need their workers there there are all sorts of pressures and things that come to play on workers who are often powerless in these situations to be able to say no when they really want to Auckland 're still going to be open for business tourist shops will still be able to open even without the policy because they do anyway and the economic analysis stuffs really important people have a limited amount of money to spend and whether you divide that between three hundred and sixty days or 364 days you 've still got the same amount of money to spend so you 're going to spend it at some point and just because you 've got an extra day doesn 't mean you 're going to have extra money to spend a good spread around the way there it goes which is why only has a minimal impact being open for their extra day there has been no broad call from residents in Christchurch to have this policy and yet there is a lot of other calls on our and our staffs time in much greater areas we 've got coastal hazards we 've got all sorts of bylaws other policies we 've got climate change all sorts of things we do want to develop I don 't want to be putting and that we we 've got so much else to be going on there has been you know plenty of media around the fact that we 're going to be doing this I 've had no emails like I 've had them many of the other issues that we 've had on our plates today and I 'd urge my fellow councillors just to give workers a break for a day I know that previous comments from other councillors not necessarily debate today who talked around the need to consult them quite a public on that we didn 't do that for the living wage we didn 't go to consultation because we decided that for workers it was the right thing to do and so we were happy just to do that right then and there and I do urge people just to do that with us as well thank you Thank You Phil and then I 've got Tim Vicki and Pauline so Phillip I 'm silly what 's one a sport option one I could support option 2 by way of us a difference being made for our Corolla being council have got far more to do than this sort of staff for one day a year but in fact it 's more important than one day because it 's preceded obviously by Good Friday and it 's one of the felt the only weekend apart from Christmas time that that families are able to spend time together I don 't agree with Sarah that and that in fact we 're sort of passed the religious part of Easter Sunday there 's no Christian law that Easter actually is the most important day for Christian people in our city and in fact it 's more important than Christmas so in like if it 's the same in in Europe which is it not I agree as nominally Christian but in the big cities in Europe on public holidays actually their clothes so families give a break and you see people out still out and enjoying a lot of little festivals including in those public holidays so those holidays are for people they 're very special and in fact and for me personally Easter is a sacred time there 's been shops that open open regularly at Easter time in a prepared to to break the current current laws so basically so I think it 's really important that we put this to one side I agree with the either option one or I would partially agree with option two thank you Tim thank you well I 'm going to save my power and I 'm going to support Andrews second motion once this is lost and I 'm going to disagree both with Glen and Jamie clean things about Auckland voting and whatever we have spent firm it much time looking what other people do and it is good use to see what other cities are doing but the most important thing is to look at what they 're doing and then what 's good for us and what we can do and what 's valuable for us and Jamie with regards to one day of training training saying Christchurch is open that 's an absolute waste of time what we we 've got shops open now and there are little islands with nothing in between we keep looking at in our city we could put vibrance in there we have the local talent we can change the whole vibe when you go to those cities that work it as a constant and ongoing vibe not just a big hit every now and then like a Coquette so until we realize these two things everything else is just a waste of time so I will not be supporting this thank you Thank You Vicki I will totally support Jamie 's amendment and I think if you look at like if we look at what we consult on at the moment like last council meeting we decided to consult with the public on with Eva Park on the booms and how you control your stock on the road and yet we now have the capacity to ask people probably how they want to shop or engage on Easter Sunday and we 're choosing not to engage with them I find that absolutely ridiculous at the moment on an Easter Sunday in Christchurch you can buy food you can buy petrol you can go to the movies I think you can go to go to the odorant Scouting 's or garden center so get fined every Easter when they when they open but and everybody goes there we 've noticed in these things from the rigs and consents people people who asked only should all shops be open or should all shops be closed I think there are policies in between that and we could come up with one if people want it I actually don 't have strong views about Easter trading I 've seen for example in Jerusalem that some chunks of city of the city will be closed on Friday somewhere we should closed on Saturday some will be closed on Sunday I don 't mind if people what people want to do is fine but I would really like to hear properly what the people of Christchurch want on a subject that we 've now been delegated and we we didn 't have time to do it last year this year we have got time to do it in time for Easter do they want for example if you look at the data from rigs and consent you hard because there 's too lots of columns but in one of them 47% for example of 18 to 24 year olds wanted all the shops open now are there areas for example that particularly serve young people that they would like open on Easter Sunday if so who are we to say no are there wood for people for example like garden centers given if you ever go to Oh drinks on Easter Sunday how many people are in the garden center because there 's nowhere else that that they can go and and shopping and how many people would like those types of shops open are there areas such as Brighton or such as a Corolla or such as any other part of the city and the central city I mean you can imagine the number of people that go and eat it little high on a Sunday morning and all the surrounding cafes what what potentially the business could be like there on Easter Sunday I just think that we are wrong to have taken data that says everything 's open or everything 's shirt and not possibilities in between so I like the amendment or vote for the amendment because like us to see what actually the people of Christchurch come up with given a an issue that yes we 'll all disagree on but there was a Christchurch solution and I 'd really like to find it and I don 't think ignoring the problem just because Auckland 's voted against it or that 's in fact a very good reason not to not not to vote that way or or you know we 've done the survey that shows that the majority of people don 't want all shops open but we don 't know do you want these shops open or these shots that cater for this particular type of activity open so we 've finally got some responsibility from government on an issue that 's been controversial for at least twenty years thirty years and we 're choosing not to do anything with it so that 's why I 'll be supporting the amendment thank you and pulling look I 'll be really quick most it 's been said but I 'll 's come from the public and my memory to date I support I 'm keeping a watching brief on this and and to me also I 'm considering it as the thin end of the weeds I mean we all love Christmas Day we loved the way that everything 's closed on Christmas Day is a peaceful day without any religious connotations we enjoy it I mean if we open up Easter Sunday we 're looking at two days in the year we live in the age of material madness but we don 't seem to be able to survive one day without shopping and I think that 's actually really good for strengthening speaks me our communities to remind ourselves that we don 't need to be out there engaging in commercial activity every single second of the day and as opposed to people will have a choice whether they work or not know and a people who will be copped by this will be the lowest income people people who are working in the supermarkets you 'll give these Sunday all right don 't worry about that you sorry for those people because the two days a year that they get off love it can 't wait and you know it 's important in our society so I think this is the thin end of the which I would really prefer to wait and see what comes from the people before we make a decision and I think the Auckland decision is relevant to us we need to listen to that we could do all this work around this table you know sixteen to one or something like that in opposing so they 're I agree with Syria we 've got other priorities at the moment so I 'll be supporting the Commission recommendation today yawning I 'll just be very quick I think what 's really interesting is that the 18 to 24 year old age group had a really different view around this than others we 've ever counseled we 've said that we want to be child friendly and youth friendly and we 've actually engaged with the Youth Council um so I think you know that regardless of our personal views whether or not as really the metaphor debate and whether we want a more targeted consideration that includes community engagement which I have to say I would be open for I can 't see why we would rule out the opportunity to engage with our community on what is a really important and interesting issue putting our own personal views to one side the fact that we can do that I can 't see why we wouldn 't and you know people rather comment that things like there 's no shopping on Christmas Day well actually just go online although all the lot big retailers are now open on Christmas Day for your Boxing Day specials online so we are changing as a city we are changing as a country and we are changing as a planet people can shop in a multitude of ways but I just think you know unless we actually spend time looking at this issue and weighing up the community engagement on a more targeted approach rather than just the generic approach that we 've got in front of us then we will just keep going around the with option the amendment that 's been put it 's not to say that personally I agree with Easter Sunday trade trading but I would certainly like to know what different people in our community think and I 'd like to do that a more targeted way than what we 've currently got Mike thank you and unlike councillor Cotterill Henson I will actually be brief I totally agree actually pull in but obviously we 've got a three tential motions up there so I think it 's really important actually say sort of where we are so we don 't cause split votes in them so I will be supporting the Committee 's recommendation it was brief and I think I think that 's quite a timely comment I 'm going to support the the motion that 's in front of us but I 'm gonna do that not because I necessarily believe that every supermarket in every shopping mall should be open on Easter Sunday not necessarily because I believe that everything should be closed on Easter Sunday my own view as it stands at the moment without of town parts of the districts which we should consider been open on Easter Sunday and a karora is the one of those that I believe is one that we should consider on may be the one that we should consider but do I believe in more work being done to arrive at some confidence around that yes I do do I have confidence in staffs ability to bring the relevant information back so the committee can see consider it yes I do do I believe that the committee will do that well and bring sensible recommendation to Council so that we can then at that point continue the debate that we 've started today which is whether we believe that shops should be open on Easter Sunday and if so to what extends yes I do absolutely and give me the the committee of brought as a recommendation not to investigate in Easter Sunday trading hours policy and given if this resolution carries that 's what 's going to be going to the committee as the basis of their consideration I don 't doubt there 'll be some significant draft coming to us for further consideration I also know that we won 't be putting anything out for consultation that we don 't believe in the outcomes of so I 'm gonna vote in favor of the resolution that 's in front of us as I was saying not because I believe that we should have every shopping mall in every supermarket open on a Sunday I think people do from a day off and I think there are some traditions that some that do have value but that 's a debate for another day the debate for today is whether we want to investigate it so that we can have that debate in informed way with a confident recommendation from the committee so and I 'll be I 'll be supporting what 's in front of us although we 've got other motions foreshadowed if this fails so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against so can we have a show of hands for the against one two three four five six seven eight nine so that means that this has failed so we now can have a formal division that 's correct yeah the motion that was on the table was the only motion which so far has been moved in the second day which was moved by Councillor Goff seconded by Councillor easton which were just debated if this fails yeah okay so if we can have a division let 's have a division on this and then let 's move on okay yes yes yes cancel twigs cancel to attend our council imagine yes can 't_''_2395.769 can still get away cancel a chain no cancel the Davidson cancel a quarter No six four eight right thank you so now let 's move on to the first foreshadowed motion which is option two so can we just do this by way of saying that we that we move option two in that are moving option two in the report yep so I 'll move option do I have a seconder for that so option two is in the body of the report which was this is a Corral yeah mrs. banks peninsula in fact so option one was do not investigate option two way of policy we could do that could we not I 'm sure that was the advice that we have yeah by the way of policy we can do so the answer in the memo that was sent out last Friday the staff report with committee recommendation on this includes an option for investigating a policy for Banks Peninsula to respond to the question about whether the council can resolve an exception or exemption allowing shop trading and defined areas this is not possible a policy is required to allow shop trading on Easter Sunday to take place in any part of the city so if it specifically allowed shops in bent on Banks Peninsula to open on Easter Sunday well they can in the council can revisit its policy at any time I guess the rationale for Banks Peninsula was that there was a very slight response and favor of it and the feeling that there 's a a tourism economy that might benefit from it however that tourism economy is mostly able to open anyway so yeah so can we get some clarification on this and if we that it 's required after investigation used to Sunday shop trading policy which allows trading in just the Banks Peninsula area then I 'm happy to amend wording but we can create a policy we can s staff to investigate the creation of a policy that allows for Easter Sunday trading on Banks Peninsula can I become against my bicycle we can do that [Music] so if we had a if we went with a policy proposal for consultation that was allow trading on Banks Peninsula or in a Corral or whatever it might be a valid submission to that proposal could be we want to have some day trading in Pappa Nui or whatever yep okay great could we not just have a cherished bit the original notion it at all so they 're watching brief of public expressions of interest in having a policy particularly targeting those areas could we change that except that that 's not what I mean we could but that 's not what I 'm wanting to move you 're not wanting to move there yeah so you don 't want to get a to trade it is done yeah but I want more than just maintaining a watching brief right well could we could we tighten up Nick wielding a little bit or no I think it 's something different I mean what we could do is just say the council agrees to investigate an Easter Sunday trading hours policy which allows for trading on Banks Peninsula only yeah yet we can do that so we amend [Applause] what which might lead you to another process you might anything all right okay can I just make the point that all you 're doing is asking staff to investigate and policy so all these bits and pieces will come back to you as part of the staff advice yeah I 'm on going on on the mover of this so I 'm gonna move what 's in front of us requests staff to investigate and Easter trading policy whatever it I can 't read it now an Easter Sunday shop trading policy which letter trading up my experiencia error only on Banks Peninsula only we can get rid of or in the bank 's back to the regular performance committee and that 's seconded by Tim Scandrick no little since part of Banks Peninsula but all of this is an investigation which then allows for further consideration about what we go out and consult on and you 're the chair of the committee that will be dealing with that now we would consult with that we would consult with the whole city wouldn 't_:_2823.479 we not only Banks Peninsula yes I would expect you would do that but they 're all that is going to be in the advice coming back to you the way those sort of issues will be answer so if the committee decided they wanted to consult on this with the whole city that 's up to the committee to make that recommendation has the committee got the delegation to do that or is it just a recommendation to council and the council is yeah all right so this has been moved and seconded we did say that we weren 't going to allow a huge amount of debate on each of these we were just going to put them the motion all those in favor say aye hi against can we have a No let 's have another division and here 's me thinking we were going into public excluding the three-person clearly not the case and we do need to go into public excluded as soon as we 've finished this because we 've got people here for the first item we need to consider yes yes so that 's also lost so now we move to the third floor shadowed amendment which was Sarah Templeton moving the committee recommendation seconded by Mike Davidson now bearing in mind that we have one further foreshadowed motion which is essentially you 're happy to wit all that okay all right so I 'm but now I 'm never gonna put this motion all those in favor against no so we 're division on that and it should be you would imagine similar to what we 've already seen together what will if it 's all the division thing can I just have my vote against they recorded if that 's easier now let 's have the division amazed done otherwise separately we put them both together these capsules implemented [Music] yes so that 's carriage okay thank you _"

    "text": "thank you thank you so now I 'd like to move back to the Augustine derived matter that we were dealing with earlier in the day we were waiting for some further information to come back so this is item 10 so we 'll go back and pick that up and if I could invite staff to provide the additional information that was requested when we first looked at this this morning thank you an apology is not having this this morning M so quick point tonight Augustine drivers a local ride that doesn 't isn 't required to psyche wines however it has acknowledged that we it as the accept nutrients for nothing why the idea of the intersection was to was to encourage cyclists to use the Templeton 's road which is a slight deviation off road in the off road see connections today staff have come back and said that we can easily design out the pinch point throw you either shortening or or a multiple of shortening the right to in line or ultimately removing it if we head to that is better to try and 've had in in if we do that we can fit a cycle lane a 3-bit the Western drive section of the end of that intersection so that would be cycle ends on all arms of the intersection we can do that and we could come back at a later date with slightly revised with resolution says that we 're not mindful and it won 't hold up progress on the project so that leaves us in a position where we can approve what 's in front of us today if we wish to is there additional wording that you 'd like to be added to this resolution to reflect what you 've just told us would that be helpful if lemon be helpful it 's fine otherwise I can I can it will it will get back to the 10-minute will be design done yeah also is it daisies notice a question that was asked and it 's a concern of counsel it might be good to Joyce bless that by way of a further resolution hesitation there are some other areas Aleutians that go with it outlining all the so note that that staff will provide for staff through the detailed design process to provide for cyclists on all arms of the intersection note that staff will provide for cycle cyclists will provide for cyclists on all arms of the intersection yes so you good detailed design and will bring back any alterations to the detailed resolutions trick the what are they details a business so that would be back to council that yes okay because it 's about the special vehicle Lane okay so maybe we 'll make no explicit report back to Council any required changes take the detailed traffic resolutions I would call it yet to the detailed traffic resolutions great thank you for providing thank you information okay so we were in questions so we 'll go back to any further questions they may be er me thanks I 'm just looking at the map of the area so we 've got a major cycle way going just one block over basically yep so why would we encourage people to go it isn 't it 's allowing for them and the space for the we are we will through the design of the intersection encourage them to use the Templeton 's ride facility and other facilities that are separated the cyclist is still entitled to use ride in its allowing them space by I guess I just get really concerned when I look around the city and say where we 've tried to put cycle ways and in very narrow spaces and you know if you think of heavy if it 's near Ivy if buses going around that corner yes they may eventually certainly service in Pune WA if that 's the corner you 're talking about has came designed for buses it won 't inhibit that alright that so can we just understand I guess around the safe the width of the proposed soccerway when it comes back just to understand what the dimensions will be they 'll be designed to our standards yes because different standards for Sikowitz light in some areas we 've got I think 1.3 norick we don 't need different standards we have one standard we have hit different standards over the last few years so so one 500 meters so 1.8 major cycle lane three point two meter failing Lane yeah yes they are minimum right that 'll come back in the report anyway so yeah great thank you any further questions film I just want to ask you about the trees that are being removed are they 've been being replaced with other trees so the ones I saw in the picture you know I didn 't_''_374.19 I didn 't see reference from the report why do I could have missed it it 's a big agenda but um do they species to me you seem to be you 've got it okay so I 'm just wondering why we 're not following here biodiversity policy especially because the holes and park you know is a large area of native vegetation a native bush and that pretty wiped out my understanding is we were just replacing light with light but I don 't see any reason that we couldn 't put native so I think in terms of that corridor effect leading into an up you know I pack there would be really good if the ground condition to allow some native trees native species be planted but good to start with the community board on deciding what trees would going because just not as simple and riders be yeah it 's my understanding that staff have been working extensively with the community both the community board in the local community growth out there residents association at least so yep so I think we can expect that that 's exactly what would happen given that we 've just heard that okay so run would somebody like to move this so Pauline will move and will second any debates all those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "on to item 26 but I have to leave you all now so hand over to Andrew okay so item 26 Paul welcome to the table thank you um and what I might get you to do is we 're taking reporters read but if we can get you just to provide some commentary on the report place here we go it 's better if there are tacit approval for taking the porters read or I guess the the main things to flag with you members will record every talk a report to you on the amended by future housing Accord that council adopted one of those key items in the Accord was the setting up of a shared equity home ownership scheme in that report and they men have called clearly flags that this is to be funded jointly between the Klan who have contributed three point zero seven million dollars with the expectation vanta council it does the same so that was another point to you in May so this report comes to with progress dates with MB we 've concluded an agreement for funding with them around households suffice to say it 's pitched out middle and low-income working households so that 's the point a difference with this one perhaps to some other schemes that typically operate at a middle and above median household income so it 's the difference there are ten things trying to draw your attention with we have been able to get stated explicitly in the agreement for funding that councils contribute contribution is indeed subject to next year 's LTP so that 's crystal clear and the agreement here having CDX there are some caveats and conditions in the agreement we are by if council does not match or only partially matches the ground funding then that will be required to repay the crown fire in full regardless of whether some of that fund crowd funding has been spent so for example of a summer that had been spent and there were some existing mortgages through the scheme and council decided not to match the finest thing we would have to pay all it back and manage out the mortgages ourselves so just to be clear with you on that one attention is reflect some options and the report for the operation of the scheme and indeed one of the recommendations in the report is to come back to you with an agreement the third party to administer and operate the scheme so the range of options only trust a CCO a division of Council and those sorts of things so council would still retain the governance monitoring and parameter setting of the scheme because clearly this is a scheme for council to met to govern and manage and that 's why the crowdfunding has come to us and that the auspices of the Christchurch has an accord so that 's my brief introduction mr. to you that 's great thank you very much indeed so we 'll move to any questions that they may be next are there any questions on this so thanks very much Paul my question is really a bit of about service and mortgages and so it just seems that for people who know for a median sales price the minimum which can be the percentage of person 's income I guess does that mean up the servicing line on in 5.9 well coming from it just seems quite expensive what people paid yes the scheme proposals that there 's a maximum shared equity contribution of 40% of the value of the purchase price the caveat that we 'd have in the air for affordability for the households is that they spend no more than 30% of the household income on servicing via mortgage that 's a shady component but say for example of a shared equity was 40% then the remaining 60% so so that 40% is at the peak of the equity is not thing done correctly thesis which makes one before you seen yes thank you so I 'm Vicky y 'all_``_327.819 I 'm wanting to move this I would love to move this and Blaine you 're having a second yep and now we move into debate so Vicky I would love to move this because this has been three and a quarter years in the making and this was part arose from the Christchurch housing Accord that was never part of the original housing Accord it was long coffee with originally three years and three ministers trying to get this across the line so we 've gone through next month and Paula Bennett and Amy Adams has picked this up and actually her staff have run with it incredibly well from the beginning of this year the point of this is that it meets part of the council 's housing policy so we have a housing policy that spans the spectrum from zero homelessness to helping people actually buy their own first house and if we live in a city where anything is possible the fact that you could actually buy your own home in Christchurch with a deposit of 19,000 as per the lower quartile priced house in the table here is absolutely amazing because you can get the home start package which is usually 10,000 if there 's two of you and if you 've got some KiwiSaver savings for a few years you can actually make the deposit on a house and it can be affordable and for any city to have affordable housing that you can buy is so good such a feature that sets us aside I think this actually is a game changer for a lot of families who have missed out on the opportunity to play house and are struggling to actually get the deposit together I love the scheme I think the fact that we can get it and get it operating and Christchurch is fantastic the cost to us is a million dollars a year in capital so the impact on rates is point zero two of one percent per annum for three years to get this up and running and I 'm hoping that it will expand well beyond that once it 's once it 's operated operational I like the fact that we contracted out I think the banks will do most of the work and somebody will administer at on the council 's behalf the money stays the property of the council I think this is actually the best thing to come out of the housing Accord in fact I 'm struggling to think what else came out of the housing court but this is definitely which was never in their housing court as is the best thing that incredibly exciting for a family with say two young kids and her on a relatively low meet low to medium wage to actually think about being able to buy their own house and to treat their house as though it is completely theirs they even get the joy of paying the insurance and the rates on it and I think that 's amazing for families I think it 's an incredible game changer I love the scheme it 's been a long hard struggle to get it here but I think it 's done very well to arrive here I 'd like to thank you for his endless patience with a number of government agencies on it and and I 'd love us to pass it I think it 's excellent I 'd love us to start administering it thank you somebody else too Jonnie I won 't repeat all that 's been said by Vicky but just to say that I 'm very supportive of this initiative it 's also something that I 've been really keen for us to so and I I just sort of share with humanity opening and seeing the impact of of people owning their own home in terms of what that does for their hope and their optimism for being in the community and in the city it 's it 's quite an extraordinary moment and if we can help contribute to that the sense where people can actually own their own home then I think that 's a real positive now you know I think the comment has been made that you know what else did we get out of the housing Accord I 'd like to think that this is also a way in which we can start to improve the health of some of our housing because of people have security of tenure I think there are a lot lot more likely to invest in those properties so you know that was one of the main things that came out post-earthquake was the number of people who get to move repeatedly because of different circumstance and the cost that that has on them their families and just the impact of children for example moving between schools between different geographic areas people can own something rather than fewer people own more than I think that 's a really good thing I think this is a start towards doing it it 's our pilot and you know I think we should also keep pursuing other opportunities through the house and the court in terms of things like inclusionary zoning and warrants or fitness but this is a really good start I think to a positive initiative that will have a very I think important community impact Thank You Clint fifty full credit to Vicki who 's been pursuing furious ministers over this many phone calls over a long period of time so this gives people a real chance that lvr rules at the moment mean there 's less lending available for people with less than a 20% deposit so this is a pretty good deal in terms of christchurch we might be talking about flash stadiums or cetera and then we need to have those conversations but we need to talk about Christchurch being an attractive place to live and if you want to settle down here put your roots down and may pull the house out from you one day then you actually need that security there are two great securities in life this is one homeownership the other being superannuation you don 't want to get to superannuation and be renting because there 's the the chance that you know that could be diminished itself if you if you get into strife so that this is fabulous yes we might have excess housing stock in christchurch at at the moment but their least financial options for people to obtain that so let 's do what we can to get our lower to middle or especially at the lower end who come in as into their own home and try to reclaim this part of the QE dream in little like Christchurch I think that would be a great thing to do and could really be part of the overall attractive package for people to come and stay here homeownership and the affordability of property remains a huge issue and throughout New Zealand and also in Christchurch as well there are a lot of people that would aspire to own home afford to do that and of course home ownership and investments in a home the ability to over the house and they ability to put roots down in a community is another aspect of life that really binds people to their neighborhoods into the city really gives people the opportunity to put roots down and give them the confidence that they 're part of a community that they can continue to be part of for as long as they choose to be rather than been forced out of a house that they 're renting or not been in control of their living a situation in a way that they might like to me so this initiative really does bring those outcomes of the financial security that comes from home ownership and the social security that comes from home home ownership as well so I 'd certainly like to join with Glen in acknowledging the huge amount of work that Vicky has done on this is great to see it result in a paper that we 've got these resolutions in front of us and that we can approve this afternoon put the motion all those in favor against that 's karaoke

    "text": "I should really turn my speaker on we 've been we 've asked after to talk to crown officials over a considerable period of time in relation to the cost sharing refresh and to try and get some clarity around some of the issues that were promised either which way in the cost-sharing agreement itself obviously there are still some some big-picture ones and I know you know council is still asking questions about the arrangements that were entered into at the time and I think the arrangements that were understood by councillors at the time were not quite the arrangements that were entered into in terms of the cost-sharing agreement in terms of some of the components of it the Refresh although I had hoped that we would be able to enter into essentially a renegotiation of the cost-sharing agreement in terms of the time scale in the timeframes that we 've been working to we bumped up against our own re-election period or the election period for for ourselves as councillors and now we 've bumped up against the government 's election period as well so that has stadium now the multi-use arena Canterbury multi-use arena and the and the Convention Center some of the things that we 're dealt with in a way that I think a lot of people today don 't quite understand why the agreements were reached in the way that they were abut but they were so so we focused particularly on delivering on elements that we are required to deliver on under our side of the cost-sharing agreement and to work with central government over the what that might mean in terms of some of transfers of assets which we anticipated probably except for elements of the residential reads own names are both in the port hills end on the and the flatlands but hopefully signaling a promise of things to companies so perhaps if I hand over to you Brendan and if if you just want to give a brief synopsis of where you 've got to as officials and then I 'll open it up for questions I really would like to see the debate concluded by 30 so do do leave leave as much time for the debate as is the miss eyes the material items that have been under consideration and refresh have included the residential residual its own leaned that the crown has purchased and the Port Hills a short component of South New Brighton in Brooklyn 's IND the assets of the past exchange the assets that included in the work on the Avon otaku precinct in the maggrip may he playground combined the crown has spent close to 500 million dollars on those items end and Akashi agreement has their council purchasing or making a financial commitment to those same items of about seventy five million dollars capital what we have arrived at with this proposal as as as they we 've kept the capital contribution exactly the same is what council has budgeted its seventy five million dollars but what we have arrived at as some extinction beyond what was contemplated in the original cost share agreement from 2013 and that the ownership of the bus exchange clearly transfers to council the ownership of the assets associated with overnight in the Margaret may he playground transfer to Council and the ownership of all of in south shore transfers to Council and as has been well traversed before while the payment schedules and the cost-sharing agreement might provide greater clarity then some of the what you 're paying for what this Refresh has done is doing all those together so that we 're very clear that the amount that we have on budget is paying for the full ownership of those assets so let 's taken considerable work between council officials in the crown but we 're now at a stage we are we can present to you the package of proposal as you 'll be aware and the crown is comfortable with this package announced for council volition to approve otherwise the package so I 'm happy to take questions for you Leah thank you sir thank you and I know that an enormous amount of work has gone into this and a lot of work wins into the original posture agreement obviously to lots of negotiations and yet the the Crown 's interpretation of the original cost year was different to the council 's and I 'm wondering what world is some suddenly understanding of what this means over timing and costing still to be done is the same interpretation that the government might currently be making so for example and five point force is the exact financial contribution may vary slightly I mean we might be hoping that I might be slightly lower the government might be expecting it 's exactly the same I mean how confident are you that our interpretations of us are the same I feel very confident so what the paper does say is that the exact amount might vary within the allocated budget so at an al Qaeda budget is 75 million dollars so it 's only going down from that is the interpretation to take with it and that 's because there are some unknowns so that crown for example hasn 't finalized the exact settlement with if you see on the portholes land and so while we 've made an estimate of their six million dollars it might be six point two million dollars or it might be six point five but within the existing budgets that Council have determined through the LTP and various think this has been under a different time pressure than the original 2013 cost share agreement so I think there was some urgency to the cost share agreement it was a requirement of the council then to undertake in a greater cost share agreement is part of having a three-year plane and we 've taken the right amount of time I believe with this refresh it 's been going on for a period of time so I am confident that both the crown in the council have learned from their lack of clarity and both parties all the differences of opinion that both parties may have interpreted from the original cost share agreement so this is far more specific in essence it 's great what about the timing of the taking of the operational expenditure with the the large areas of leaned those kind of things because we would bet that 's current expenditure that we haven 't budgeted for but the crown is currently paying and you 're like that we have the same understanding of how we 're going to work through that process and the timeframe for the land and the residential red zone what the paper size is that we 're going to need to undertake some detail group to understand exactly informal costs of it and we 're going to need to fictel it into the OTP and the paper provides what their crowns costs currently our which includes security related providing security while they 're still doing land clearances so that demolition of the houses and the rates contribution so that 's a proxy for what it may cost the council but we should do that work thoroughly in properly and the dates to be freely transfer what we 're saying in the paper they need to be within what counsel has budgeted both for capital payment and also for any operating that the council has budgeted for so for example on the bus interchange following earlier crown decisions that they wish to continue to operate the bus exchange until cumulative June 2019 and council subsequently moved at its capital payment for the twenty three million dollars until that same period in operating was currently scheduled for first of 2019 and so we are if they make up the operating shortfall and earlier so if they paid us the operating cost that they currently in cure and then we could take it over with the suitable period of ledin so that we could do the necessary work and but if they declined to do that then the transfer would occur at the time that we 've budgeted for oh thank you I just I 've had a couple of phone calls about this bringing one person is quite concerned about in sufficient time to consider it but the questions around you know I guess it 's an it 's about the fine print we 're doing two questions the concern is over fulfilling any rights or privileges rights or privileges this is how they see it under the Act so is there anything there that we need to be did you know what act to you what what 's the minute I 'm talking about I haven 't got the actual this is more general questions so even what Hecht you 're talking about the region it three Ginette this is the question no 't affect the application of the grater crush degeneration X yep so if it 's residential red zone in the only party that can promote a a regeneration plan if one is required yep and I keep emphasizing if one is required doesn 't mean you can 't do anything on the lead you can go you can go through a normal RMA process and that doesn 't and evolve the that doesn 't involve the regenerate Christchurch but its regenerate Christchurch the if favorite generation plan is required then they have to lead the work but if we if we own the property as opposed to learns it does mean that we can move in terms of decisions that we make with a lot more speed then you 're going through a government department it doesn 't actually have money on budget for making the decisions that we make as a council so okay so yeah pips the questions better framed as any losing anything under the ownership you know clean it okay general response to do you lose anything through only property and the council owns a very Church and that allows council greater choice about what to do with the property at manage the property itself erm what gift the property at might establish trust sick and ran it as a urban park as a regional park as a grain resolver candle roads so generally that 's the question is are there any losses associated with ownership or don 't believe so there and providing options but what ownership does come across to owning obviously you need to know the loans and you need to maintain the property and and depending on the state of that property as is worth much of the port hills for example there are natural hazards in the same with coastal areas obvious city but the ownership of the property per se and more of you know either advantage or advantages or disadvantages the council 's obligation irrespective of ownership to mitigate natural hazards where that 's possible and feasible okay so then my question really is around the costs for council which I don 't really see in the report in relation to the site and I think there would be roads and streets and lanes that council owned and we are there 's you know we 're responsible for putting in retaining walls they 're caught in bands that kind of thing like have you got any estimate of those costs per tick future costs for council around those issues no haven 't_''_834.68 done that work so we 're proposing to set up a project team to understand whether any of those costs would have enjoyed end they would be kind of choices that their council would need to make to incur incur debt costs so they would be choices off council what would need to come back to you with any capital cost for example if we wanted to put a road through a residential reads lane that 's currently residential reads owned then it would be a decision of council so that 's an area though where you know as you indicate in the report there 's a level of risk attached to that for Council Robert is a level of risk because I think you 're the decision-maker on those decisions so we haven 't affected earn include that expense once we if we make today make a decision to actually purchase that in effect take pictures though what was it 's been red zone pad of Port Hills in effect responsible for those costs no I don 't believe you 're responsible for costs that you haven 't made a commitment to incur so you 're responsible for the maintenance costs but sorry for that if I 've misunderstood you you 're sad your question was about decisions that the council could make that could require a capital investment so in the absence of counsel making those decisions obviously staff heaven budgeted costs and if counsel was to make those decisions like they wanted to for argument 's sake and build a retaining wall or put a road in or something like that that would incur a capital expense that would need to be a decision of counsel so those properties were the costs are listed we don 't really know though what and though there will be part of income for counsel thus at the cells the profits from sales but we don 't know properties we don 't know the excess costs so what 's listed as the lane devalue of those 70 properties not costs associate with those 70 property so and not the cost for counsel no we haven 't listed the cost for counsel but we 've listed the land value of those 70 properties the exponent D on Sarah yonni my question is almost 70 properties he 'll was how is it determined or he 'll with a deterrent so as the counselor will be a we there is a public excluded that is available that details their information so the crown have undertaken some examination of all of the properties and we 've accepted the Crown 's position and we would want to undertake further understanding of those 70 properties what the staff recommendation is seeking as a council decision to dispose of up to those 70 properties and the rationale for that is to avoid project costs falling on great payers to undertake the the the project related activity which is a one-off cost associated with both the transfer and the conveyancing in the understanding of future options transfer now with this proposal could we scroll up and just show the conditions around the transfer so because that they have been added in here that so requires that the property is referred to an appendix a shall be available as part of the disposal process to the following persons or parties and the following order persons or parties who sold the particular property to the crown as a consequence of the Crown 's Port Hills residential read zoning following the earthquakes and persons or parties generally who sold properties to the crown as a consequence of the Crown 's of Port Hills residential read zoning following the earthquakes current owners of adjoining properties all other parties so in signing the residential redzone offer because it was technically a voluntary offer o there wasn 't any other choice but which was interesting but but the truth is is that it people assign will gave up right if it had been compulsory acquisition people would have had the right of first refusal at market failure to purchase back and there would have been some compensation in terms of efforts purchased been compensation at the outset not to doubts and supersede venerating valuation so you know that that 's the thing so is the proper property owner if we become the property owner that would be the the condition that we would put on the on the on the sale reduction with lungs removing the redesigned case okay so we believe that 's the right thing to do so what that would and then obligate cancel if it was to be the property owner as the follow through the steps in C one two three four through any disposal processes so and that would be a way of discharging what might otherwise perceived is a kind of moral obligation to offer back to the person who sold the property to the crown I 'm acknowledging is the message that while it was a voluntary sale there were viable alternatives for many of those people and I think it 's important to remember that the redzone we talk about the residential red zone or the red zone it 's affection it 's not a designation under the district plan on the flatlands as the specific purpose bracket fletchling 's recovery close bracket zone and that was a zone that was governed by the independent hearings panel as a result of their consideration of the replacement district plan I haven 't got the port hills one in front of me but it 's separate from the flatlands and that 's because it was based on rife risk not like the flatlands which was based on the damage to the land the area wide damage to the land and the proximity to the water table and in these 70 properties represent approximately five percent of the total number of properties that would be transferred over in these represent the properties where their life risk has been mitigated either through removal at source of Rockville role through alternative mitigation measures or we through amendments to property boundaries suitably sized in appropriate building platforms can be built on with some title changes so we think this is the right thing to do for a very small number of properties across the entire portfolio yes Sara Ben Yanni thanks um just like to point numbers of 62 um have been previously identified to lunge into the council is the preferred site by the community for their new village green and they 've been asking the community board for those particular sites and been trying to work with loans on those to get a skatepark or village green or something on those particular sites it 's been in the media on and off for well over a year now maybe 18 months and we 've which on that as a community board they 've got really no listed values here and I 'd really like them to be taken off the sale list I 'd like us to acquire them but actually to look at a community use for those particular properties the statement of fact when we 're not yeah Marley is it possible to make them for any amount of money no no but we 're these a little bit easier and the Leslie we 're proposing to sell I think what cancels asked me is an alternative use rather than the council selling it if it counts who acquires these ones no I can 't two particular properties to be used for a community purpose yeah these are specific properties just these toes they office that the new community facility in some nurse and the the original communities the thoughts community inter-site post-quake was a village green in the community of a desire to have some sort of village green again they maintained and what sort of stuff and then this is opposite yep no opposites if we could just take those bugs a very good lobbying opportunity when I was there for though yep so maybe the easiest way to daughters either we 'd amend Appendix A to remove those two properties or alternatively and eight we simply exempt those two properties mentioned sexy turn security I feel comfortable we can amend I 've been excited to remove those no I 'd actually rather that they were identified as knowledge that the life for us having been mitigated and so I 'd rather that it noted the that they work see you know like a useful they 're really determined to be the life foresters risk has been mitigated yeah Dennis Cooper would still work with Lin 's to remove the red zone classification but happy at them we where a greater work with the local community board and come up with an appropriate community use for those two properties in the resolution that 'll be great you 'd be excluding them from there possibility you can 't have it both ways yeah yeah no you can 't have it both ways but this is a that I mean that this is a separate issue that was already going through a process before that they 'd be women name the lens were working with the council to transfer these two properties anyway yeah so I what I the the reason I didn 't want them withdrawn from Appendix A is that it gives us a clear steer on who on what they are so but it may be it 's just easy enough to easy enough to remove them from Appendix A no I don 't think we would want to work with lens and yeah I think it 's easy enough for us to know not to sell those properties don 't think maybe others the long list of 70 properties that equally might infect have a alternative use what we 've sought as discretion that doesn 't mean that we exercise or that we would look to sell these 70 properties and totality yep okay Yanni I 've got a lot of questions I think the most important one is what 's the Russian doing this today given that we 've had you know basically a day 's notice of us there 's heaps of detail quite complex information particularly on the portals risks and liabilities so what 's the rush that we have to do this today and can 't do it next week so this proposal requires the agreement both of cabinet in Council is there effectively that between the crown and the council was the true signatories the cost-sharing agreement so as it 's an amendment to in a clarification to speaks to the cost-sharing agreement so obviously with the central government election approaching and these period near that rises and in seeking to have this resolved prior to the end of the year we believe that were in this proposal has been endorsed by cabinet in delegated to is we understand to joint ministers to make any technical arrangements to give a fit to the proposal it does require council agreement of the same though before anything particularly takes effect so when 's the last day that those ministers can legally execute this decision my understanding is that the last cabinet meeting was on Monday just past sorry that 's a different answer to the question the questions not about when the cabinet meeting is it 's we 've been told that the ministers have delegated ability to sign it off when is the last day that they can do that I understand that there 's a two-week report back to joint ministers but they were put back on e M takes effect if the council agrees to it there would be no report back if council didn 't agree to this right now I understand that but you 've got an election coming up in a month 's time we 've been given a day 's notice of this well no we hit a discussion a half because actually we 've been discussing this on and off for the last several months in terms of where we have got to with our conversations with the crown we have all we are agreeing here are things that are in the cost-sharing agreement agreed to except for the transfer of more land than we agreed to on the port hills and land that we hadn 't yet agreed to but which indicate a fantastic outcome for the city in terms of the residential redzone for the future I give the merits of this or not I 'm trying to understand the process we had a late supplementary report and a vacuum that sound like the only time that we 've ever looked at some of the issues that we 've been discussing what we had hoped to do was do something much bigger we ran up against an election we can 't this is a part of a process that will continue after the election but if we want to come back and renegotiate every single element of this which is simply what we are required to do I on transferring the money that we have in the cost-sharing agreement that 's already been budgeted for it 's already you know sort of in place what has changed as the residential red zone that the to residential red zone flat lands and all three areas and the sorry the Port Hills red zone being more more land obviously we were on the bus exchange in exchange for our payment inward own Margaret Maggie assets in we rode on their assets that their crown is investing and the Avon River precinct is a mock recei in terms of councils acting under the Local Government Act having a light supplementary report is generally considered only when there 's a special reason to do it and we can 't do it through the normal formal processes that we have and the statuary timeframes that we have and what I can 't tell from this report is what is the urgency in doing this today this is at a at a at a council meeting next week given the magnitude of the decision that were being asked to make given that we 've concerns and maybe some of us may have been contacted by other members if they 'd been more notice of this coming to Council so what I 'm just trying to understand as winners the cutoff for council make a decision that the ministers need to execute that 's a very simple question it 's a two week report back isn 't there and if we don 't make a decision then there is no report back and we have to negotiate around that schedule so this is the proposal that has been endorsed by cabinet and if the council was of the volition to change or not a great service proposal being with back at square one in we would reconvene with the government I 'm saying I 'm just gonna entertain Jonnie because the the reality is is that if this had followed the same model that had been put in place for the negotiation of the original cost-sharing agreement we would be having this debate and public excluded we are having this debate in public because I always said that there was going to be a refresh and it hasn 't been a renegotiation I would have preferred that we could have had a for renegotiation we haven 't had the time in order to do that and so we are publicly discussing some relatively minor but they 're not you know no setlist the other day they 're not I used the phrase rats and mice but this is not Wrexham mice when you look at the numbers but when you look at the overall context of the cost-sharing agreement these are the elements that were that that they 're easy to clear away and that the I mean the risk to the council and not accepting this now is that we go back to we are one in terms of a renegotiation after the general election and if that 's what counselors prefer to do then that 's fine that is what you 're entitled to do and you just vote against the agreement so there 's no point asking questions about us so that 's okay you 're not answering the question we can vote we don 't have one person constantly taking up also we 've been talking about local control and tiling this stuff stuff up for years and we keep getting these opportunities and dragging our feet not just a question we 've got a light supplementary report which informations people to understand and get honey they had your us so so I 'm I 'm gonna move the motion do I hit a seconder for the motion deal say sorry point of order I was told that I 'd get answers to questions I 'd raised I 've got a number of questions that still haven 't been answered and I was told that they would be answered verbally at the meeting the motion the motions been moved I will allow relevant questions so can I just ask around the bus interchange I 've asked for a met and a clear picture of the land that 's been proposed there is actually a designation in the Central City recovery plan and is also a reference and the report that went to Council for the cost year and I can 't tell whether the land that 's been proposed to be was designated emerald water than the original agreement so I explained it to you yesterday with all due respect counselor Hinson so the slained is different to what was in the schematic for the blueprint and so the blueprint which then lead to the designation in the designation into and designated a block of leaned the designation was used to allow the building of the bus exchange for the purposes of a bus exchange in terms of the consenting what 's proposed to transfer to the council as the title in the building that applies to the bus exchange so it excludes what 's commonly known as the balance or precinct leaned and there are two levels of leaned on the south in east side of the bus exchange building that are excluded from what you refer to is the original designation the designation no longer exists because the building is now been constructed so those two and included because they 're not the bus exchange and the question around other discussions around flat residential rigs own land being able to be requested from government for infrastructure was that discussed to Knights drain where we 've just had a report yet notice yon Yvette got asked and answered when we dealt with Knights drain and that is that land east of the east of NZ drive as or Bexley road is not appropriate for the land drainage solution that requires the purchase of land on the other side of the road but the ideal place to the river look at that one but there 's been other infrastructure projects that when we generate Christchurch is required to take into account the horizontal there were the infrastructure needs of the city at the time that it does its regeneration planning you know that because we put that under measure of expectation right and just um finally there was other questions but just in the sake of time just in terms of the market maybe playground what 's the valuation of that how much did it cost to build versus the loan cost and what 's the depreciation that we have to budget for it so I don 't_''_2179.2 a valuation is a somewhat arbitrary figure for a public playground so these be in a four-cylinder 15 million dollars in the cost of the playground as in the facility or 20 million dollars so if it costs 50 million dollars to construct in build on the lane then that 's one figure there the value of the Lane though depends on what your intentions though the value of the lane Denese it depend on what your intentions are so it 's not something that has a market value per se because there 's not too much of a market aside from the akashic City Council of owning a large playground in the central city so the market valuation as as irrelevant and we don 't have a market valuation and what the council would account for is what the fear Book value is of the property and it would be depreciated the same is the accounting treatment of all other playgrounds and lane value okay and just to clarify again we don 't have a map of the property that 's coming to us does it include the car park that 's adjacent to it we will through the course of this that will include the respective maps and the titles and so forth and sorry our understanding of the transfer of the Margaret may he playground as that does include the car park and the area that 's now been established for the barbecue down to the river Reserve the river reserve obviously never transferred to the crayon and as technically still in council ownership what I think it 's probably crown ownership that the council with ministers so it will include it into our area okay right so I 'll open it up to debate I 'll put the resolution Oh eonni well I appreciate that you know it 's good to get this clarification and there 's some positives in this deal I don 't support us rushing into doing this today and my preference would have been to have it followed the normal council decision-making process and that we actually get sufficient time to go through what the liabilities are my main concern is that we could be exposing ourselves to significant financial risk through this refresh and I don 't feel that we 've adequately got enough any degree of certainty so I appreciate a lot of works been done on us there is a lot of sadness I think that things like the portholes redzone wasn 't able to be dealt with quicker and we 've heard from some some councillors today people been asking for two years to try and acquire some lend for Community Benefit and you know ironically we just opened the summer community center last weekend and the whole thing could have been completely different if we 'd been able to have these conversations at a much earlier stage so I think there is some significance and acquiring the land from the port hills for some community benefit but I also think there 's a huge risk and possible financial liability that would go alongside it I 'm not supportive of us making a decision today either to sell sell off that land I think there needs to be a lot more work done around what that process would be because I think how can you do it for some and not others and who 's the right people to consult and whole city is that those communities that were deeply affected or is it those individual landowners so I think there needs to be much more thought given before we make any firm decision about selling off land and then using the proceeds of that land to pay for the maintenance and other costs of things that doing in regards to the bus interchange I do feel that we should actually be getting the balance of precincts so that we can future proof that I think it 's incredible it would be incredibly short-sighted not to have control over what happens adjacent to it and particularly if we just face an uncertain future with public transport we don 't know how things are going to develop but it would be good to have some projection that you know things could be expanded and protected from adverse development in the future so I appreciate the work that 's gone into this Brooklands and south shores and not areas I have a great knowledge of so I guess other local councils will know more about the rust and the liabilities of those areas a very sensitive area for a lot of people and it really if it goes through today this really does need to be done with a great degree of caution but I still maintain that I can see no agency and us needing to make a decision today and that we could be doing this next week and I don 't think that would adversely impact on this discussion David thank you my comments really relate to the South Shore and Brooklyns areas I 've represented the coastal Ward for 14 years and battled for every advancement in the area that coastal areas great potential and yet it 's sort of unrecognized and underappreciated by successive councils the community concerns around being told at the moment is that by handing the land back to the council there will be a continuation of entrenched attitudes and defective thinking towards the coast Awards attitudes that have existed for decades well just quite a local resident especially on Facebook a couple of days across use City Council has been unrelenting and its efforts to block development in coastal areas I think we can council holding the land government has let us down were handing this land over our hope on proved wrong comments such as this related that that of just related are common and there 's a season in my community that this greater opportunity for obtaining a satisfactory result in dealing with the multiple agencies as opposed to the council being in control I could totally support this resolution if there was worrying that in the resolution that indicated a collaborative collective responsibility for the council to work with the local communities to seek and implement restorative and protective processes in South Shore South Brighton and Brooklyn series however our well support the motion with the proviso that more resolution result version opposition to the transfer of the South Shore Brooklyn 's lands been noted okay Phil and then Dion look I 'd like to be able to support all of us you know I think like clearly things like the bus interchange in the Brooklands and South Shore areas the clearly they they can become council assets as well as the Margaret mate playground but I do have more than recovery of the portal that hotels what 's currently reads owned in terms that we 've got we 've heard from staff we 've got no real idea of the future costs around important parts like the retaining walls and balance which are really really expensive so I it 's it 's with some reluctance that I cannot sit cannot support that part of it and if you won 't be able to support or whatever I just think that I I do not want to be pressured by the fact that okay we are on the nova of a general election that i think we that for me personally i need more information before I can agree to that Dion I think one of the reasons that I wanted to second this was ever since the regeneration act came in the conversation around the city has been about local leadership and bringing back that local leadership and trusting the city to get on and do what 's right by the residents and I think there 's some great opportunity Jeepers Creepers I think there 's some really good opportunity 's right I do have something concerns around numbers and bits and pieces like that that have been already shared but I think the overwhelming argument here is actually good I mean to close off the deal for the bus exchange it 's going to mean that we can actually start understanding the transport network in our city and the public transport is a big conversation that 's been missing in the conversation of transport in the Central City for such a long time so I mean it 's a good opportunity to start having that conversation Margaret may he playground probably the most successful anchor project to date I think that 's great that 's going to be a seat a city asset that actually we could be really proud of and there are other opportunities here for for the land that we are going to acquire so I really I really think this is a positive step forward for Christchurch and it 's regeneration story we 've still got the regeneration act that we can sort of work through some of the issues I 'm sure but this can actually achieve positive outcomes for the people of Christchurch so that they can start trusting that local leadership is going to deliver the results that we wanted through the post earthquake era okay Andrew thank you so just to comment on a number of aspects of this proposal that 's in front of us today and the the bus interchange the treatment there is largely consistent with the cost share agreement and is consistent with our understanding of the cost share agreement which is the figure which is consistent with our understanding and the ownership is consistent with our understanding this is the opportunity presented to us today to acquire the bus exchange at the figure that we believe is correct with the ownership model that we believe is correct the Margaret may he playground there are no surprises there this largely is consistent with exactly what we expected we 've got funds on budget for both we anticipated transactions that look exactly like the ones that are in front of us today for both and it 's my belief that we should pursue those exactly as we plan cost share agreement but we have the opportunity to show local leadership to take ownership of land where clearly there 's action required where there are issues that are outstanding that a meses for us as a city to be dealing with accepts where there are overhang from issues like the quake outcasts case which clearly governments still need to deal with the port Hills residential red zone and I live adjacent to red zone land and Port Hills and my own section was very close to being red zone as a part of this process so it 's something that I 've been very close to both as a representative of the community throughout this period and also as a landowner adjacent to property which has been affected in this way and Eiling comparisons between the Port Hills residential red zone and the flat land residential red zone those comparisons need to make clear the difference between the two the life risk elements of the Port Hills residential red zone is what 's relevant to our conversation today and I think it 's important to know how those decisions risk of 1 in 10,000 a 2016 risk values with an understanding that the risk would dissipate over time it 's now after 2016 and it was based on residential use of that property for 16 hours a day now we know that future use of some of the property that we 're talking about today will not be residential is not capable of being residential but is capable of being a use that will add to value for communities for adjacent neighbors there may be opportunities for who knows community planting community ownership in inverted commas of these sites there may be opportunities for extensions to recreational areas all things that I believe would be supported by our communities and yes there will be sites where there 's opportunity to return to residential use some of that because of the there has a dissipating over time some of it because of work that can be done by remediating with rock fall protection structures and those of us that have been on the rock fall protection structures sub committing a fully aware of what can be achieved with what often value of the land given ownership of that land particularly neighboring plots of land the ability to put in place and mitigation that works and that is cost-effective would be enhanced so that 's something that I wants us to to be able to look at and given the disappointment the angst the upset not only of the owners of this land at the times that the time that these decisions were made and people feeling that they were in a situation where there was no way out other than to sell their property to transfer their property at 2007 values I think we 've got a responsibility of responsibility to make sure there are some good outcomes from this the final point that I want to make is that this is a package this isn 't to pick this bit that we like and pick that bit that we like but we don 't like this part and there 's risk involved so we we won 't take it because of you know we won 't take that because of them the part that we don 't like this may playground as expected in the cost chair and on our terms the way we always expected it would be and an opportunity to get good outcomes for Brooklands for South Shore and I believe the Port Hills so people have talked about risks and liabilities I 'd far rather see this whole package in terms of opportunities an opportunity for good outcome for communities an opportunity for us to show that we are up for local leadership we 're not saying we 're going to defer this we can 't make a decision about it we 'd like a B and C but we don 't like x y&z so therefore we 're going to do nothing I believe we should grab this with both hands today while it 's available because there may well they 're totally different environments after the 23rd of September we 've got this opportunity in front of us today this is our opportunity to show a local leadership and I believe that 's absolutely what we should do thank you clean okay thank you my comments relate many to South Shore and Brooklyns of this as well we 've heard how control brings with it many positives but also the reality that there will be costs we know about those in my view it brings greatest simplicity by virtue of the the ownership questions being resolved the timeframe could have been better I think we may have been part of these conversations but it 's the public 's line-of-sight that some will have questions over and in terms of my colleague council east comments before over the council 's treatment or otherwise of South Shore in particular I think if you 've got local ownership it 's a little bit like when you 've got a fleet elected II can you have greater leverage over that group so if the residents do have issues with the council they can come to Council I mean how are they going to have a conversation in that manner with the crown they can 't_''_3162.86 but the council is a locally elected democratic accessible organization you can come along if you want to have a go at your council come and do it I know I probably an issue with their treatment of how they felt the council have treated the area they can do it so would have been good to have more time I think for the community but on balance I do support this today thank you us here thank you um just as we go through this I want to just check that there was some sort of written note somewhere about those two properties on Nayland Street and what will come up staff to work on some wording to to put into the resolution that takes them out of a for disposal yeah and so I just I had some concerns when I read the report initially and they have mostly been addressed and it as a package I had concerns about what hills redzone leaned even if a the designation or classification of read zoning was taken off I still had concerns about that being disposed off by the council without any sort of community consultation I think that going through a process where now we 're saying that we will offer back to the original owners doesn 't mitigate that like to see community groups being included as part of that you know all other parties if portholes previously and wandering these sections and maybe that community groups also might want some of these for various purposes eg to purchase not just council doing things on them the original cost-sharing agreement did hit a lot people dr. Holz this is a much smaller agreement refresh and while I still have issues with yes not having done all of the due diligence work at this point and not understanding the operational expenditure it is a package and there are benefits to having the package as a whole so I will be supporting it thank you I 'll just wrap it up I think that this agreement is good for Christchurch we went right through the process of transition from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act to the Greater Christchurch regeneration Act asking government to step back from the role that it had taken up and the recovery process and asking that we as a city take back local leadership and that 's why we 've framed the whole discussion that we 've like more to be on the table but we haven 't got time to address that I believe we will be in a position to renegotiate the cost-sharing agreement the really deep dive issues around the convention center around the multi-use arena all of those things after the election and actually I think we have now positioned ourselves very well to have that discussion regardless of the outcome of the election so I think we 're really well placed this get some irritants off the agenda and I 've been probably the most irritated of all so I just want to refer to a couple of them the bus interchange getting bet resolved is a very good thing for the city this was the amount that we were committed to contributing under the cost-sharing agreement what wasn 't determined under the cost-sharing agreement was whether it would be in public ownership or whether it would be an our ownership there is an interpretation in a cost-sharing agreement that in this clause you could drive a bus through just like the bus interchange itself and that is because there was no be off the hook for the 23 million dollars towards the cost of the project regardless this is now done and dusted it 's off the agenda it comes to us for the 23 million dollars that 's in the cost-sharing agreement the Margaret may he playground and the otaku Aven River precinct assets that 's already agreed it 's in the agreement were actually not buying them for the amounts because those amounts were determined to be our contribution they were always coming to the city they belong to the city and that 's where the agreement was reached in fact it 's a clear-cut area there is no requirement for the council to pay for the whole of the it was simply to make the contribution as allocated and the dollars and cents some of them add up to what we might have got back in terms of insurance recoveries but with a global settlement it 's almost impossible to identify what those actual recoveries were in that in the long run in the end the residential redzone so that 's where there is a difference between what terms of the cost-sharing agreement but which has changed here Andrews described the difference between the port hills and the flat lands really really well so I won 't read traverse it the the issue around the these the flat lands is that these are the three areas that are not the subject of the present regeneration plan process that 's being undertaken by regenerate christchurch but just to give reassurance just to offer reassurance to those that might have concerns in relation to obligations once ownership transfers that does not change the obligations under the Greater Christchurch regeneration act it 's still regarded as moot zone and the flatlands they 're completely different criteria and it is still if there is to be a regeneration plan it has to go through regenerate Christchurch and it has to engage the community because community engagement is at the heart of the regeneration process it 's not an afterthought it 's not a consultation that 's actually embedded in the whole process so but I know that councillors around the table they 're going to have an opportunity to look at the going to have a good opportunity to have that wider discussion about what the ownership side of things could actually hasten things happening rather than slowing things down because I keep saying this the reasoning that the regeneration and legislation really only clicks in if you require a regeneration plan there 's nothing to stop anyone going through an RMA process on that land the portholes again as as is quite different because it is based on life risk instead of the very confusing provisions of the cost-sharing agreement which says that we get half of the land that 's contiguous to reserve Lea and up to a maximum of they were heart.you half the land contiguous to but although there is an interpretation that says that it 's up to half the gross area but it 's all very confusing this just simply says you get the lot and in its of no it 's no more than what we had on budget it was what we expected if you go back to the original budget the council thought it would be paying another six or would be paying let me make it clear we are not buying the land for thirty-nine million dollars we are we are paying the half share that we 're obligated to pay for the purchase of the properties and in return we are getting the whole of the land that has been zoned green so you know it 's a it 's been a it is a complex area and I 'm glad that the complexity is removed by a very simple statement that we inherit the lot I support Sierra 's plea for the Nayland Street property so I know that that community has work very hard and you so was lobbied very hard on the weekend when we opened the community center so that 's that 's a good outcome all right so on that I will put the motional so all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no so if you could just put your hand up fill clear water Jana Johansson yeah is it okay so so perhaps you can we can we show that yeah will note that thank you alright thank you good work to move _"

    "text": "sorry can we go to the community board funding allocation item 27 thank you so in the film Burke after the paper that was presented to the last council meeting lay on the table so the keyboard shears could no further info discussions about what was proposed and as a consequence of that discussion process which has involved world community boards in all news of community boards and at least one if not more meetings we have a revised recommendation the revised recommendation as included in the supplementary paper apologize for the lateness of that paper the lateness is due to the fact that the last community board meeting discussed at just 36 hours ago because we were using it to come using the opportunity of community board meetings to discuss this rather than called special meetings the the revised recommendation is as a result of those conversations and staff feel that it provides more equitable distribution of funding of community boards than the initial proposal it is an essence saying first of all in this based on support that a mixed model of allocation or a formula based on has unanimous support from community boards that mold takes into account the population of each community board in the end equity the position if you will of citizens in that community board the weighting given to the two elements the first of population of 60% the second of equity is 40% it 's a shift from the previous recommendation of 5050 in order to determine equity it 's in probably more of an art than a science but the recognized method throughout New Zealand at the moment and people do understand its limitations is the social deprivation index and that information is gathered and census along with population data it looks at nine elements and I set up in the previous paper and the background to the social deprivation index is included and the supplementary paper and you can use the index as teen indices we 've recommended that indices six to ten ten being the eeriest with the highest score if you will on the deprivation index and one being the lowest they index the words used captures a niche block areas that are included in that range of applied here is probably better understood now than what it was two weeks ago when we presented the paper the use of it and we feel that does result in a more equitable distribution as I said to community boards the key question obviously is then how do community boards use the money in the criteria for the use of the money has set out on the strengthening communities funding outcomes in our drawing formulas strengthening communities strategy which has being with Council in applied over years for some time so should community boards choose to give emphasis in one area more than another that is via decision and that 's what we 're trying to do is to increase the opportunity for community boards to prioritize and respond to needs so those prioritize proactively and respond to demands that are coming through it is not a deprivation fund I don 't think was ever intended to be but it is about strengthening communities to be in enabling people to be live healthy and and and enjoyable lives and new counties the equity component therefore recognizes that some communities have do their so that 's why we have putting an equity rating or all waiting I should say along with population those the data that we draw on will be updated then the next census and will reflect obviously population shifts and in relative equity so the recommendation is that first of all a model for distributing the money to community boards so that communities can make vehicle and what 's appropriate in their communities is based on a formula that the formula gives us 60% in waiting to a population of 40% waiting to equity the data information is drawn from the census they 're recognizing the position of the Banks Peninsula if you just use the formula they get very little money however we understand that first of all a critical mass of money is required in order to support any community in that area of our city has got some particular challenge in terms of population distribution isolation distance of travel etc so we 're proposing that a subsidy a substitute of 140,000 dollars is allocated to the banks furniture board as well as the formula based really appreciate the conversations that our boards have engaged with in I reiterate that there is a hundred percent support from boards for the the model and the subsidy going to base peninsula there was some variation of views in terms of what the ratio would be what index in terms of 618 in the amount of subsidy for banks peninsula one quick question is when you said that they referred to the net boards having some agreement are you were really meaning that the majority of bullets hit here agreement read the script yes its fees no sorry yep the ratio one hundred percent agreement on the formula was fine word that 's right 5050 6040 then there was a it 's there is support for 20 from one board but that was that was the but not majority support that question was raised at a broad conversation but not majority support so my question is was the majority support for that for the 6040 okay um I have to answer this in two ways if I it depends on where it 's five to ten or sixteen and are pretty evenly split in terms of population and equity so it made little difference to be here how you distribute it other communities have got a different distribution between population and equity so it makes a bigger difference certainly deciding the joyously counselor I would say yes if we were to say take the whole city into account would say no so that I 'm not trying to avoid the question but I think it 's important to point out the differences thank you thank you just a very quick question on the Banks Peninsula subsidy here 's some width 140,000 subsidy proposed in the model that we 've got in front of us is how does that see the banks peninsula funding compared with the 2015 16 year noting that that 's the best comparison because of course testing 17 was a little bit annoyed thank you in 2000 and 2015 16 basement at your what we 've talked about a total counselor hundred ninety three thousand so it 's very very close and in fact they the mono that 's proposed equates very closely for most boards sixteen fourteen fifteen years journey ending Jamie one question your particular mention regarding to the ratio so your original recommendation fifty-fifty yes are you have a mandamus at 60 and the forty years regarding to this change summer come Nepal they are funding happen repeat wat whether this fear of we you mean is yes the other thing I think though thank you I think they 're two issues that community woods got to discuss one is what was a near best interest for the abroad yes in two is what 's in the best interest of the city their marginal changes for five of the boards there were more significant changes for tools the boards and I think the well I know that the process of model has always enabled boards to jointly fund projects and this continues both formally and informally so one board could act as a good neighbor and say look we 'd like to help you all that because we think it 's a good it 's a good thing to do so all words understood and quote a lot of detail which I think otherwise have what the implications of each of the models is and we presented four different scenarios thank you thanks mr. to things I guess one is this essentially a placeholder until we have a wider conversation around us come LTP and two if so is there going to be an opportunity when we have that wider conversation around what those measures are something a little bit more in depth than just what those splits look like yeah it 's a wider conversation with the community about with the deprivation session I know we say equity but it 's I suppose interchangeable with word deprivation but an opportunity to have a wider conversation around if there might be more appropriate measures and we 'll there until then yes so what we 're proposing was thank you is that this formula is used for the current funding year and before the next funding year that 's if the Kasai is reviewed it may well be something the council answers to review the criteria for the for the streets and communities fund and have a look at what it 's explicit position in a review of the strengthening communities strategy which could be a part of the long-term clean air proposals right any other questions right with someone like to move the motion so and Pauline now you want to move an amendment I did want to make an amendment that five is as Joan amended to 55% population than 45% equity which is a compromise position but I think is fair and particularly just noting that I think there are some boards particularly that have incurred a huge increase and some of the KL peas and some of the local needs and I just want to make sure that that can be addressed all right so that 's a an amendment that 's been moved as they were sickened up for the amendment there isn 't a second up for the amendment so thank you all right so I 'll open the measure up to debate Aaron yeah I 'll I 'll vote against this even though in the last 48 hours I will think Lester and the staff for making some compromises based around the concerns from our board because the numbers this is based on deprivation deprivation index which I think 's an incredibly flawed model in fact it 's that one of the main reasons why that CDHP is underfunded is because treasury using this model to apply funding to our city with out of date stats numbers census numbers and and a whole lot of people that moved west and in a course that changed the deprivation rating but also changed their funding but didn 't change the circumstances so it is Ford and the great example of how flawed using that model is is that the least deprived or the least amount of deprivation and the entire country 's banks peninsula who we 're about to give the most money because it comes in at 1% which makes it a better place to live than Zurich or or even Singapore so and I do support I 'm not going to say remotely suggest we cut any funding from banks financial aid because that reason was explained to us but it does show us the force around the deprivation because it doesn 't truly measure and is take us to visit on banks potentially I won 't name them we he can show clear examples of deprivation but it does not come up on the mesh box it doesn 't work like that in it afford model I look forward to the way forward and I 'm just saying because I can 't look my ratepayers in the eye in the world an area that I represent and say this is equally across the city when other people have got twice as much money to build their communities because it 's a strengthening communities fund is what we have though Pauline Dion well I want to support the proposals that are in front of us and as they 're an indicator the staff have done a huge amount of work on this and serve the community boards and the feet they 've arrived at a compromise which actually will work across the city and Jamie Gough indicated before yep as he asked this is an interim decision till we do a lot a long term plan achieving equity is never easy and I think that the the boards be good neighbors with each other that will help iron out some what some of the differences which in fact my own ward I guess a somewhat short James on but this strong agreement from among among the boards about those at the 6040 the 40 split say so I 'm I 'm strongly supporting their recommendations over there and I would expect that they 'll work Pauline yes thank you I agree with Phil the you this has been incredibly challenging out of work I know that it gives me comfort that these figures as least as told us have quite clearly aligned with the 1516 year quite closely aligned so I think that 's a really good start for this now bearing in mind we 'll review it in one year we 'll probably have updated data by then but the other thing that we haven 't actually brought into this mix well I don 't think we have is that the some wards have a higher number of community organizations that are active and performing very well than others and therefore they may have more cool equity either because you can have proactive organizations that do so it 's not always think so it 's another perhaps a lever that we haven 't really I don 't know done a lot of work on so you can see how complex it is but I think this is a very good start and I particularly like the way that the boards are talking about you know cooperating together and jointly funding certain organizations or projects that may actually be cheering population across the borders there so I 'll be supporting us for today and I really do hope that we get this through because we 've got community organizations waiting for an answer for the funding now and you know the amount of work they do they do not need to be stressed wondering and waiting mean enough they 're going to get the funding for this year so thank you thank you I 'm sorry Dion Jamie and then Andrew yep yep cool my button doesn 't work very well I just wanted to voice my support for this as well purely for the opportunity that in our suburbs that have got the deprivation within them and it might the world that I represent the new word central Heathcoat especially in the Lynwood area there isn 't a lot of opportunity for people to get on and try and help themselves and so I think this is a good way for them to try and lost what I was going to say this is a really good look I 'm most fully supportive okay take note everyone that was a very good contribution Jamie thank you you done guys look III empathize particularly with what Aaron see because as you all know we represent the same community board ward area and it 's a look at it really simplistically and quite correctly there 's an argument to be made which is factually correct that we could be perceived as the losers of this given that we receive the lowest amount per person so essentially is this perfect no it 's not it 's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination I 've see this once I 'll say it again I haven 't changed my going to be waiting a bloomin long time because perfect doesn 't exist so you need to try and reach consensus you need to try and reach something good and you need to make it a certain deep probation is that a good measure for doing this look it would be a great measure if this was for the deprivation fund it 's not it 's the strengthening communities fund and I think the issue about deprivation is that you know some of some of its drawbacks oh this is 2013 data so anyone that is remotely familiar with Christchurch will know that a heck of a lot changes in Christchurch and has changed at a rate of not supposed to earthquake it 's changed significantly since 2013 so we 're balancing population data which is here an hour deprivation data from a census three years ago isn 't ideal it 's averages again and we 're all acutely aware that playing the game of trying to solve problems by averages often can result in perverse outcomes particularly when I look at the phenols an area when you look at deprivation scores from that would be high hundred meters down the road they 're probably areas there which I would suggest would have deprivation metrics at the low end and to call that a five probably isn 't a fair reflection of what of what that community actually looks like so I 'm flagging that there are a real drawbacks from trying to make policy or decision-making based on averages because average doesn 't as us just as perfect doesn 't exist deep privation also isn 't a great need for need you know in strengthen communities is often about you know what 's fundamentally needed and tinkering with deprivation or using the deprivation metric doesn 't actually provide any benefit for older people that might be asset rich but a cash poor and incredibly lonely and need a lot of attention there they 're not represented them then so we 've got to a point where we 're talking about a 40 split and and what I love about governance is the fact that we 've got a great diverse group of people that I 've got a mandate get up and go to work because I want to work together with all of you in the best interests of Christchurch to add some value and in making decisions for me part of that and and I 'm comforted by the fact that at the end of the financial year we 're gonna have a wider conversation we 're going to say is deprivation the best indicator to be waiting a significant portion of this fund on and I 'll be arguing no it 's not I think there are other considerations but I was elected by the phenols and Ward and I 'll be going in to bet to give them every cent at community board level but you 've heard me say there 's so many times ad nauseam and I 'm sorry but we 're here as a city councilor and we 've got to look at Christchurch junk what is best for Christchurch and I 'm quite happy for my rates to be a little bit higher to go to someone that needs a little bit more because that 's why we 're a city most fundamentally important aspects about sitting around this table is that I 'd really urge you as a city councilor to ditch the ward just just in this form you can put that hat back on a community board I wouldn 't argue for a hundred percent deprivation I 'd be humanly opposing it because I think that would be completely broken but on the flipside I 'll also be the first person to argue against a fun being apportioned by rate take even though that would favor my ward in Darrin 's ward very well but that 's just not fair and I don 't think a good City Council will do that so this is a compromised position no it 's not perfect but I am comforted in the fact that we 'll have a wider conversation with our community and have an opportunity to create that but I think that we 've got to a point that actually is quite fair and I think it 's going to be best for Christchurch and I think that I can hold my head high that I 've done my leads you to appreciate the bigger picture with it Andrew Mike Jimmy thank you and thanks Peninsula obviously has got particular issues around distance and isolation and this a large Ward made up of a number of discreet and different communities and those isolation and distance issues mean that the strengthening of those communities is particularly important because they can be cut off from weather events or maybe aren 't able to travel from one of those communities to another regularly or readily so I 'm pleased that that 's been taken into account in the recommendation that we 've gone in front of us I 'd certainly like to acknowledge clearly what has been collaborative discussion at the community board level that recognized that in the discussion between the community board chairs and recognizing I guess picking up on the comments that Jamie has just made and picking up on Erin 's comments earlier as well thanks Peninsula would be another example of a community where when you look at it from a deprivation index viewpoint on the face of it it would appear that the peninsula is reasonably of quite deep deprivation on the peninsula as there are in other parts of the city and I think it 's important that that also is is recognized and has been so I certainly appreciate the support for the subsidy for Banks Peninsula that allows for a fair and equitable outcome for the peninsula as well as the rest of the city Mike Jimmy Glynn thank you I 'm gonna be supported in this resolution actually Jamie said a lot of what I was going to say it as a community board member we could have I could have twisted the figures and splits and then got a really good outcome for for the Pannonian it 's community board there was a snare in there I think gave us an extra 17,000 but as a city councilor we need to look across all the wards and all the community boards and actually deliver what 's probably best for for the city as a whole and obviously the wards areas the communal areas had changed I think we need to work together as community boards to deliver some of these outcomes boards so these things we have to do together but one of those things and Pauline touched on others as community groups actually really frustrated with this process that they 're struggling out there they 're stressed because of the time frames and they push that and they just want some certainty of what 's happening and if we 're gonna be looking at this again we need to make sure that we 're doing it early enough to actually sit some proper timeframe so they can make proper decisions actually eating clean I support this one the reasons very simple because the first a start would like to Innotech tell your team champ try to continually cut into a funding allocation of improvement this kind of pika-pika may be very good you know all right just to in the routine cha second is we need to gather the theories but where software fairness some other public considers equity the other maybe the equality but a chronic quality that defender take a difference one is in assam some head the other ones from pattern is equal so public equalities consider is only in population that unique effector by rhinos multi factor noted the privation less that 's pretty cool the more tan multi the factor you know tried to do that achieve lisa paste the fairest read result and also the these amendments fully supported by the Kimiko so I so foolish way thank you clean thank you all I do support Jamie 's approach you know it 's time to think of city councillors rather than would councilors I 've got some sympathy for errands or you your situation as three councillors actually having lived nearby jelly park there are some churches there doing some really good effective community development work and I just wonder whether we could find another funding stream is and where may be needed peps the community partnership fun once it 's up and running because unfortunately their waters distorted within itself by the you know Clyde road as a classic okay I 've done lot down there it 's so different you cross over as Island Road and just changes completely so that 's a bit unusual so I just wonder whether there are ward at some point thank you so it 's been moved and seconded there is annum no there isn 't an amendment so I 'll put I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no yep can you pretend you 're out of the room when I put yeah hasn 't quite rejoined the tables right so the so if you record Aaron 's opposition so that 's Kerry thank you very much now I 'd like to _"

    "text": "and I switched the order and come to the Canterbury arena because there are certain papers that I think is need to get through will do the community 's funding allocation paper immediately following that so so that can Canterbury arenas on the attachment supplementary agenda number two and this is a recommendation to receive the the multi-use arena pre feasibility report prepared by the stadium trust and it notes provision and it requests that officials work with the crown to identify funding options for meeting the potential funding gap so I 'd like to I 'd like to move this and you want to second it yep seconded by David East so is there any discussion no it 's we 're receiving a report we 're requesting that work be done on a London gate so no there 's absolutely no conflict at all Yani just had a number of questions oh no sorry I when do we are supposed to know this is questions around receiving the for and asking yeah so we 're being asked to ask the officials work with the crown on a number of well that 's in the report but we can obviously choose whatever you eyes council what so the question I want at that and I 've put these questions ahead of the meeting so some of the assumptions in here particularly between some of the options are very there 's a huge difference particularly around option two and three in regards to Eve it 's R so if I resume if we 're going to way to work with the crown it 's on the preferred option no no at this stage what we 've noted in this report is that the the previews ability study provides some guideline around the general direction that 's it 's very clear that the facility that spoke needs to be a multi-use arena so that will lead us to a hard floor pass remove all tooth it 's clear that it needs a roof of some sort and and that it 's clear about the approximate seating capacity that the key stakeholders wanted so what are sitting as a direction that we need to hidden the the next stage of the work which tooth and roof options and moving into the business case we actually develop the options more clearly yeah so all we 're asking council to do today is to receive the report not make any decision about which are preferred options or not those will be further expanded and tested out in the next stage okay and I think it 's really important to understand what we 've been asked to do here which is to receive the report and request that officials work with the crown to identify funding options the next step under the cost-sharing agreement is we enter into a business case process the business case process will flesh out a lot of the detail but we are asking staff our staff will not not through here but they are going to do this is to analyze what what these different options mean in terms of whether they are appropriate for our environment you know these are this is the way that like retractable pitchers the as the as the one that obviously needs quite a considerable amount of work it 's the way of the future it 's multi-use that 's that that 's the that 's the key to it so so staff are going to do that work but it says part of preparing for the business case in the business case is something that in the cost-sharing agreement it remains the responsibility of central government so doing a central government will chose the the model whether that 's a private sector model or a public sector model and until that decisions made we don 't know what the funding gave us that 's right so what I 'm all of them that there is so is five going to be looking at all the funding gaps of all the options or is it only looking at the preferred option well it 's obvious from the work that 's been done is that if if it was only the amount that council heads on the LTP we would only get a seventeen and a half thousand a thousand thousand see um authority no roof and the this is not what the key stakeholders have told us they want or we believe the people of some sort to get the facility we need a multi-use service for luminaire workers trying to that 's not saying we have a preferred option and we 're meeting the gap between that and what we have it 's saying let 's start some work to see what the funding options are at the same time as developing through that business case of testing out so if the preferred option is agreed to and it 's a public sector development there is no funding group the crown was very clear in the cost share will cost a great sharing agreement you can join with us in terms of the wording of the cost-sharing agreement it is not crystal clear and in fact you can read it as saying that we 're on our own building a thirty five thousand seat open-air_,_369.5 stadium and a new location and that as according to this report a complete waste of money so you know bit and it 's big look I don 't sign the cost-sharing agreement it 's not language that I find incredibly helpful to try and retrofit the modern environment up every morning and ask for the courage to accept what I cannot change the no sorry the the yeah the strength to accept what I cannot change the courage to change what I can and the wisdom to know the difference and I know that the cost-sharing agreement is not weird and that actually leads to a specific statement that the Crown has contributed half but I am very hopeful there is various political parties using the environment of the Alicia will consider whether they would like to make clear of the air intentions so the two final questions one is that we understand from the media there 's an announcement was today so why are we considering this ahead of that announcement because I 've been officially informed of an announcement I heard that there may be an announcement today we haven 't_''_450.12 I have no idea what they don 't know but those on the agenda learning I think that various various discussions around what political parties are promising during an election campaign is quite different from a government it 's actually committing to a particular element are you know eyes on this issue and I 'm sure that all political parties will be considering it at the moment so I don 't think that anyone in the election period considered this as a government matter we 've got the cost-sharing agreement on the agenda as well and that is is really the end of it as far as it this electoral cycles concerned and the final question was around the additional 60 million so I note that the figures in this report exclude the loan costs but I would have thought we should for transparency with our community have the land costs as part of the project and it was reported I think in the newspaper that the governor 's been 60 million on acquiring the land so given that that 's a significant amount of money as in terms of the business case that where we 're looking at in terms of being developed are we able to include the option of actually just building the preferred option at Lancaster park saving the 60 million is that something that can be considered it 's not resolution that you 've already made and you would need to go through a process to asunder that resolution but at this point this paper is only asking you to receive the pre-feasibility study it 's not traversing what options are to be considered in the business case there would be more discussion about that at a later date at this stage we 're just asking you to receive the report note some of the findings in the report and the quiz that we work with the crowdfunding so we 're not at the point of actually asking you which options we take further to the business case that will be later that work in terms of funding could include the savings by building on publicly I know it can 't_''_591.029 Glenn and will I still able to ask oh yeah you should okay or it 's I know the risk of being a bit cheerless what if we decided not to receive this information so what is the real effect of not receiving I mean the reports being written yeah we we agreed to hear this report on on receiver exactly so I 'm glad that you pre first your remarks by saying that might sound cheerless because it good all right so I will now open it up for debate I 'll put the motion Yani I don 't support receiving yesterday we 've heard I was a late supplementary report and it was in PX and then it was released publicly and between that it was already in the on the press website so you know I think we 've heard that it 's gonna be an announcement today we don 't know what their announcements going to be I can 't see why we shouldn 't wait to receive this next council meeting so once we know what that announcement has been it 's really clear I think from the co-ceo agreement that council signed the report that winter council that if the if the public sector model was chosen by the government that day were responsible for the 253 million or half of the the cost of building the stadium so I 'm not even sure why we 're being told that there 's a on budget and I think you know people do want some certainty but if you go back to the history of the blueprint when the blueprint was announced it was said that the council would have to fund the stadium with the private sector and that the crown wouldn 't be contributing obviously as part of the cost she had that changed there was a huge amount of work go into the cost year but I think what this does is it really highlights the unaffordability of the blueprint because building public facilities on private land has meant that the costs are going through the roof and the tragedy was that there was no agreement to funding before the blueprint was announced and if that those funding decisions had been made before the blueprint was announced and sorted then I think we would have seen a lot more progress in the city so in some ways this is a legacy of not having clarity from the start and all decisions been made that have been being repeatedly changed through a number of different agreements and in some cases no agreement the same is an important issue and I think it is good that work has started but there really does need to be some clarity with central government over what model they 're choosing and what money they have or haven 't got on budget and until we know that I don 't think we can be making decisions and I don 't think we know what the funding gap would be I 'd also say that one of the interesting things in this report is the huge difference between option 2 and option 3 in terms of what 's expected in terms of a bit des and I think we really do need to get some understanding around what the lifecycle costs are all the stadium and particularly around the different options because it does seem quite a massive difference between those two and it is it is hard to understand that but I appreciate as part of the business case that that work will be done and we will have much more information at that stage finally I would say that we should not rule out building at the ratepayers and the taxpayers then why wouldn 't we do that why wouldn 't we do that why would we rule out an option of saving money given we now know that the cost of what 's proposed in the blueprint is unaffordable and that there 's public land that we own that could actually save a significant amount I think as I said 60 million dollars so I won 't receive this today it 's late its supplementary and we 've got an announcement this afternoon that we don 't know anything about by government and until we know what that is and have had more time to consider it I don 't think we should be receiving this report Andrew I think it 's good that this report has gone into the public arena I think it 's great that this report exists certainly in various forums and conversational groups that I 've been part of in the last day or so this has been a hot topic of conversation and it 's right that it should be because this multi-use arena will be a key facility means that we can further this conversation it 's a conversation people have been waiting to have in a sensible way for some time noting that there is now a preferred option we 've now actually got something to pin that conversation to we 've actually got something which has had some work gone into it that tells us what a multi-use arena for Christchurch might look like but also just as importantly what it might cost and it 's interesting that the 253 million that we 've got on budget would deliver and it 's point four in the recommendations a modest provincial vient venue of seventeen and a half thousand seats with 60% roof coverage of seating bowl for a city of the stature of Christchurch for a city of the importance of Christchurch for the main Centre in the South Island which will need to have a regional facility if not a national facility as a stadium or arena that 's not going to do that really doesn 't cut the mustard for Christchurch and we shouldn 't be prepared to accept it there is a funding gap I believe it 's been the expectation of our communities that we would put in 253 million and that government would pay the other half and I think there 's no coincidence the two 53-million is approximately half of what the feasibility study tells us so I say bring the conversation on I 'm fully supportive of our staff having that conversation with governments I think the timings perfect we need this tool and in time to have a sensible conversation about it as part of the development of our long-term plan because if we don 't blend this in the long term plan there will be further delays that 's the reason why we need to receive this report today we need to progress the conversation as quickly as possible and I welcome it thank you no I 'm not going to go too much into it cause I 'm totally supportive what Andrew said that what I will say though is we 're we are looking at putting it it 's about utilizing the central so it 's about maximizing what we have and if you look will be isolated and the cost of traffic management see it 's wasted money we 're investing hugely and we have private sector investment been to the central city this is where it has to be and it has been identified by the pre-feasibility study that all those visions and beliefs way back at the blueprint about private investment into this it 's not a reality and that today what we 've got it does get everything right and whatever that is then we 've got to deal with it and I totally agree with Andrew the expectation was that the government would pick up the other half and I think that our estimate of 253 was absolutely right and it 's showing that with the preferred statement the preferred outcome when you 're looking at options 1 to 4 they are very very different beasts the option to option 3 as chalk and cheese when you are coming down to the ability to use those that the arena versus stadium they are totally different things and that 's the good thing about this and we 've got to get think that the major issue that people have with the stadium is the cost but people definitely want to have that debate and I think the very best time to have that is 30 days out from and so I 'm totally up for those mature discussions and then end the bidding wars that will go on in the next 30 days I think it 's excellent I love the open model of local government funding where everything they do is matched by the government I think that 's an excellent model of local government funding and I don 't know why it can 't extend to the south and so I 'm looking forward to it happening in the next 30 days blend in Sara thank you yes today I think we can actually say as an invitation to the various political parties to show the money one thing I would say though is in our experience of joined-up projects is when we get to the point you know what degree of control will we have over it particularly around procurement and delivery we 've seen delay after delay being a near 50 cost splits but a big question for me at the time will be who will control it I welcome the debate that 's here thank you I 'm just really keen to see the business case and I 'm keen to see a business case which looks not only at the operating performance of each of the different options and whether they stack up year-on-year but a business case that looks at it she 's servicing the debt that the ratepayers are taking on for the 253 million dollars because that 253 million dollars comes with an opportunity cost not just the actual and interest and things that we end up paying on it airs ratepayers and is an enormous opportunity throughout the city for a range of different things that we could spend two hundred and fifty three million dollars or in fact not spend two hundred and fifty three million dollars and not increase rates as much through clear from the report that rates will increase and that 's currently budgeted for but I 'd really like to make sure that the business case the operational performance Mike thank you this is actually a really great step forward and where we need to go it was really important for this city to once again have but stadium or multi-use Rena and it 's a shame that it sort of been left to the end while we see that the library get built the Town Hall get repaired everything else around art and culture has been has been met and been rebuilt yet split there 's actually one of the pillars that hold up this city we are a great sport in city and it 's really important that this moves forward as much as we possibly can and it 's really great to see that we 're going to be keeping it 253 and nothing else and it 's time for the government to step up if all they want to do is contribute to land then when once we 'll go back to Lancaster park and use that area because quite frankly the value of the land is not worth anything compared to what we 're going to be building on there I onto a very very expensive prime real estate where people won 't even be able to walk on it great I 'm going to turn it off so I 'll put the motion Oh what sorry I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no thank you _"

    "text": "they said we moved to item 8 Hornby library customer services and the Southwest leisure center options reports would might Maura like to come forward and present the community board view and could Gary come forward as well thank you well being and counselors now get you from hid the petition and we did have a extremely meeting and set it out of the float and that kind of that meeting is before us today and the community building decided to approve deep impact and option wonderful and that the staff work closely with other sports clubs in the area particularly the one big cricket club in relation to the possibility of relocating from deepen park and that the concerns expressed over community safety and traffic management are noted and staff be asked to work with and to work to address these matters in particular so as you know we certainly do want a a new library service center and and Aquatic Center in the southwest of Christchurch don 't get me wrong we certainly want it we 've been waiting for many many many many years for this but the outcome of their meeting on the 12th is there any questions like that 's pretty straightforward that 's wonderful thank you Jonnie thank you um I just was interested in the public submissions um just from reading it it seems that the majority and we 're in favor of Kyle Park Korean also Sport Canterbury I noted made a submission favor of Kyle Park now obviously we haven 't had the earrings can you just give me any understanding around sports Kent why Sport Canterbury view I don 't know that I don 't think that 's a question for the community board chair to answer he 's here to present the report of the community board it 's not for them into her sister Jo well I just wanted a fed heard from sport Canada but if the board had heard from Sport Canterbury a peri-arrest no hits was that 's I mean actually can see hit some Spokane everywhere in favor of Denton and when we spoke to them they thought from an overall view of sports facilities that were provided that could be provided they initially looking at the costs of remediating the land and looking at everything they came back with a view that Denton must be a perfect option for the sports groups mediary that 's right all right just so I 'm clear so did the the feedback that we 've got where people have been recorded as a submitter and have given their preference you 're saying that that 's not accurate to what their preferences are there was an update which may not have got into their documentaries but I apologize if it isn 't but I 'm even emails from school canterbury and having that after looking everything again Addington answer option okay and I guess following up from there and final question really as how many other people in terms of that submissions in that document that we 've got have got a different view than what 's recorded they really only ones who came back before the movie on the 12th and there 's obviously being a lot of people come back after the meeting of the 12th but for the time island for the submissions spooky and it again weather change yeah David I just want to clarify something that yani asks he mentioned a majority and looking at the document that doesn 't seem like any of the options got a majority like over 50% like there was one one option they 've got more Phoebe than the others but none of them got a majority thank you the petition that was presented earlier referred to the deed of gift from the Denton family a note in the recommendation that we 're talk about the proposed use being inconsistent with the current reserve classification etc etc how far we 've gone into looking into the deed of gift and whether we 're consistent with the intention of losses ours of the engine sorry I think it 's a question to staff not a question here I might slow away and ask or Dijon or some of them up the bed hey guys they 're better late years ago the hot seat and the request basically resulted in the reserve status as we know today all three sites that were shortlisted have the same issues to overcome but their quest resulted in the reserve status that we you know need to look at today if if option want to select it so are you saying that once we incorporate a gifted piece of land a reserve status the reserve status overrides the donors wishes or it is the reserve status that we need to that 's that 's all I can say that we get so yeah I think if the the component of the proposal it 's driving a change to the classification of the reserve is actually the library component so there will need to be a change the world will need to be a public hearing following submissions on all of these sites right I wonder if I could add no I really don 't want to have commentary this is a technical legal question around the status of the user fee but I want to add that no really honestly honestly I don 't want comment from the Purdue seaboard other than to represent the view of the community board so we 're like well I am it because this what I want not worth right to come to the council meeting and and and debate any issues I 'm not as a legal technical question which has been asked and answer okay okay Dianna I 'm like oh cool I just wanted to ask a question was the community board aware of the families from petition that we 've just heard as the community board been aware of when you did your conversation can I look please not a word at the time we met at the time we made the call on the 12th of August we weren 't aware of it but we had asked on the 25th of June could the staff clarify if there was a gifting process and we were told it couldn 't be found and even here 's a fella it 's really unhelpful to provide opinion at the stage because I think that you know that people have worked incredibly hard to get to this point clean pinky minds an entirely different question just over I noticed 4.2.2 page 46 probably to Gary just the Kyle Park option would reduce the deliverable scope by up project what approximately would that look like what are you looking at you know going to Kyle Park what do you stand to lose so if you there 's a dis enjoy engineer with an indicative missing what the building could look like that 's that 's probably the difference it 's to be honestly it 's really hard because we 're in the first stage of this so these are you know a rough idea of what this building could look like I really couldn 't tell you what would come off at other than the nine million dollars approximately to remediate the land would have an effect on what can go on top yes business was dumb about contraception oh excuse me please that kind from it 's not appropriate to yell from the back of the chamber thank you Mike thank you so one of the things I had noticed in the consultation document that obviously if Kyle Park was going to be the third location it would be reduction in the slice to 25% and we do know that in there 22% and we do Kyle Park and again the most support of all the other parks so therefore they 'll actually accept in potentially a reduction in the size of their facility if we put that reduced facility on to Denton Park would we retain the fields yes just noticing thank you just noticing what the submissive the lists for all of the preferred sites we have eighty nine individuals for car park in seventy three individuals for Denton Park and then we have groups that have been represented by a submission have you got any ideas of the numbers that are actually involved here with the groups that have been represented here we have we have from we haven 't had hard copy of those numbers it has been suggested that it could be in quite quite large numbers with the with somebody and the trust workers that are working in the community and if you incorporate the views of whom be high school but the feedback I 'm getting is windy high school students haven 't really been given the opportunity to have an opinion but the Board of Trustees has on numbers would be with respect thank you um Kyle Park a 22% reduction in the size of the facility noting the remediation that would be required to the land I mean obviously we 've talked a little bit about the the cost involved in that would there also be delays to the delivery of the project if it was done at Kyle Park and what would the length of that delay be if there was probably there 's one clear point on I want to make with car lock us options two and three and firstly it doesn 't it doesn 't mitigate the potential issues with car park or or resolve a contamination it basically encapsulates about ten percent at the park through the building and the car parking so encapsulate that the lime felt the old landfill the it just it does offer a high-risk proposition and to be honest and sell written because it 's an old landfill site no matter how much site investigation we completed we 'd never know all the risks that 's the reality and Kyle Park was a was an old quarry to undetermined levels and then basically filled it with waste so it 's its best form in many ways is as a managed park you know it 's we do see paper built in a landfill it 's definitely possible but it definitely offers a high-risk proposition to the council so there is a risk of delay that exists at Kyle Park that doesn 't exist which I can 't quantify at the moment very good oh thank you what would the reduced facility look like on on Kyle Park what would they lose or if they would have just be a smaller size you just repeat the pattern so there was the same question as I page 51 of the report you lose you on your pedaling for are you you were in the swimming pool area Ghibli 's a significant area of from library and you would leave a an area from community board spices well it just brings the whole thing down into the buzz options terracotta advisor God 's own fish graphic with reference they 've got areas for expansion both options even the full the for expansion so if it was to be the reduced one and there 's still the capacity to expand and on the on both of those options it from wins money available to Richmond right well thank you very much right so um well in order to get this debate going I 'll move that the council adopt the staff recommendation seconded by Andrew just is there any discussion and I move it a minute that the size of the facility is to be additional to what 's up there this additional to the motion there the size of the facility is reduced by 22 percent to allow the sports fields existing on Dinda park to remain [Music] do we have a second over there it doesn 't appear to be a seconder failed for want of a sick of it okay debate young group a process question if some of us wanted to support Kyle Park should we foreshadow that as a motion if this is lost and ask that you put oh never chase sighs yeah pop one say what I Peter make an amendment now so no their compact thank you as a foreshadowed motion if that 's lost yeah yeah they 're just for the places I assumed that this whole process will go to a hearing it 's been to the community board the community board have made a recommendation to the council to accept this there 's no hearing following this that that hate fear there will be hearings down to the resilient sorry yeah so there will be hearings under the reserve safety yes but it will only be considering the Dean compact current proposal yes if they deliver it was carried today that is the next step in the process all right okay I 'll open it up for debate I 'll put motion well I 'm have you speak if nobody else 's okay well Yanni I 'll take the face of it the local councilors introduced it but um I just wanted to say that um I really appreciate all the work that 's going on behind this project you know that there there is an irony around the these facilities being quite at the location being quite contentious when perfect location who are still waiting but we 'll adjust that at another time but for me just looking at the submission I think it was quite clear that the majority favored Kyle Park even if it was at a reduced option I am concerned to hear that the family who gave Denton Park to the city have raised the concerns that they have and I take on board those concerns and think looking at the majority of similars being in favor of Carl Park the concerns from the people who gifted Denton Park to the city of the purpose of which it 's used then my preference would be option two and that 's why I 've fought shadow I will foreshadow that I will not be supporting deeds in Park I will be supporting Kyle Park with a reduced build as has been I think presented to us so I want to see this facility go ahead and the Hornby area I just think respecting the democratic process and respecting the intent of why the land was gifted to the city in the first place Denton Parker 's a city that we do have a moral responsibility to clean up Kyle Park at some stage whether we do it now or leave it for future generations I think as a choice that we can make today and my preference would be that we do it today so that current generations can enjoy it you know that is something we should take responsibility for the mist that has been made there we 've done amazing work I think at qe2 for a lot less than the cost that 's been presented in this report so I think there would be creative new ways of dealing with that issue at car park remediated that would be cost-effective that would I think lead to good outcome we clean up a site that 's contaminated we get a facility that the majority of the submitters have asked for in the area that they 've asked for it and we respect the people that gifted us in tintype to start work so that 's I 'll be voting against Denton Park and for Kyle Park option to think you asked that you put little bit of what Jonnie was saying us I won 't be supporting Denton partly because of the information that I 've received recently around the family stuff and the protection of the natural environment beauty of the countryside emphasis on the retention of open space and outdoor recreation activities I just do feel that Denton part with the intensification of development around Lumbee is a great open space for the community that 's gives a public amenity of value to having that open space and the green that you can see along the road corridor there so from their point of view I won 't support Denton part because I don 't think we it 's gone deep enough the investigation has gone deep enough into addressing the issues and I just don 't feel comfortable with the amount of this disharmony I suppose this is created within that community to actually be able to support this decision today okay and for the last four years we have been trying to get the money on to the budget for the sports facilities and the Southwest leisure facility it 's there we have now done the consultation let me just point you to what has actually come through no one Park has a majority support there are issues with every Park and the community board at its meeting five and a half hour meeting on Saturday the 12th August first looked at the option of delaying this and getting more information on Kyle back the difficulty with Kyle Park is a mess of nine to ten million dollars difficulty of putting nine to ten million dollars into the ground and barriers it means that the people of Hong B and Southwest get nine to ten million dollars less of great recreation facilities that will last them for the next 30 to 40 to 50 years and let 's just look at who 's actually submitted Canterbury Track Cycling came along and said they wanted it on Denton Park rugby and cricket didn 't_''_1288.15 we 're very clear on that cricket actually at the meeting on the 12th said that they would be happy to completely move out of Denton Park I don 't know if that 's still there retain notice that there are a number of other organizations her in favor of jintan Park won 't be high school board of trustees for example the the Community Care Trust and a range of a quite a large number the kimchi development network trust that deals with young people in the area a Fenton Park in terms of the family we 've heard from the brand net view the land was gifted for recreation facilities a swimming pool and indoor recreation facilities our recreation facilities recreation facilities extend beyond could excuse me I 'm not going to have counselors who are perfectly entitled to speak in this environment without interruption from people who are not entitled to speak during the debate thank you the the facilities that we 're looking at our recreation facilities it is really important in Hornby that we have a facility that people can swim in that kids can learn to swim in that disappears at Kyle Park we have we want the same sort of community facilities that we see for example at Tarawa in halls ball and every time you go in there there other class of things that I 've never heard of or participated in but they look like great fun and they 're definitely recreational there are there are many many sorts of recreation options available to the community and I appreciate that some clubs are impacted I appreciate that the Rugby Club loses a field and would have to be and the end the budget has been provided such that that can be provided elsewhere and to upgrade the field at at Denton I also appreciate that Crickett who had who said on Saturday that they wouldn 't mind shifting completely may not want to do that and they may want to stay there they can do that and their facilities can stay there they would need to move one field and there is as I understand it for cricket teams part of the Hornby Cricket Club I may be wrong on that but that was my latest information that there were four cricket teams and I think that what we need to think about is what we 're doing that will last 30 to 40 years for Hornby and like you let your kids walk to it will it work such that you could go and have a swim you could do your 3d printing at the library you could have a computer game at the library you could maybe even get a book and then you could go and have meet your family for lunch at the mall is it good safe walking distance what was the city what was the crime prevention through Environmental Design report that recommended Denton Park now I know that this is not what people in the room here want but there are a lot of other people in the southwest of Christchurch who are desperate to get a facility that allows their kids to have a swim that allows their kids to enjoy the facilities of a library that allows the community to meet and to have a great time and that there is more recreation options than the ones that were opposed to this to Denton path the really big difficulty I have as both a rate payer and a counselor is taking ten million dollars or nine point five million the ground so that I can put foundations down for our sports for a portal library facility their difficulty with Kyle park is that if there 's an old landfill site the the estimate of a quarter of the cost going into the ground so that we can build the facility there only remediates the ground on that site it doesn 't deal with the rest of Kyle Park at all if you disturb a speciose and all sorts of things then the cost of that is very very high qe2 is a completely different example it is not an old pert and I think we need to realize that there are a whole lot of things that we need to make the hard calls on now I would love to go with all the people in the room and say I 'm totally in favor of taking ten million dollars from all the ratepayers of Christchurch and just burying it but I am not in favor of us making a decision that takes away from the people of Hornby and the Southwest who for so many years have not all or a community center or a great place where you can have that amazing community feel that Humvee needs and I 'm just not willing to say ten million dollars less of facility is okay for an area that desperately needs a brilliant facility which can be provided at Denton Park the issue of the well intriguingly Warren Park only received I think 14 percent of the public vote Ron Park is a great deal closer to a great Barone Park received as I understand it 14% of 14 or 16 percent everybody largely wanted co-located facilities we know that that 's great one heart was the least preferred to say that the majority of people are opposed to Tintin Park the the interesting thing about any of these parks is that the majority of people are opposed to them actually if you look at the numbers so it is a hard call and I know that the Community Board struggled they went through the option of pale they went through the option of Warren and then they arrived at the option of Denton Park for a variety of I know it 's well loved and I know that green space means a great deal but it is a very good safe location to build an awesome facility in the southwest of Christchurch and the other option of Warren Park was not supported by the community the facility at Kyle Park literally you bury 10 million dollars now I 'm not willing to ask anybody to bury ten million dollars of their facilities and of their money and are not willing to ask an eight-year-old and or six-year-old and Hornby to do with that what we think would be and what everybody else seems to think is the necessary standard of great community facilities for the next 40 to 50 years because we couldn 't agree on a location we 've fought so hard to get this money for the southwest we so need to make a decision there is still a opportunity for people to actually say talk about the reserve status each of these parks is affected by the reserves act each of them is affected in the same way each of them will have to go of the debate on Saturday and much more on Facebook and everywhere else would have originally supported it on their own be high school site but of these three options we tried that we couldn 't get the Ministry of Education or NZTA across the line but of these three options set up a force today and which have been consulted on and I think the only tenable option is Denton pact Thank You Sara just quickly because of Aki 's coverage most of most of everything and my my what an initiative is gonna be to clarify that majority and they you know the majority we 're against every site and majority is fifty percent there is no consensus from the community on this one and a consultation is one factor that council has taken to account it as it is an important one and it is one that informs our decision-making but not by sheer weight of numbers every time it 's through the quality of the submissions the points that they make and it may not always be the most popular that is the correct decision and elect us to represent the wider interests of the city not just those for a small specific area and if we made all of our decisions based on a popular vote in a survey on online then actually that wouldn 't you know that the most the most organized the most well resourced group in the community would win every time and that 's not how a democratic decision process works we 're addicted to make the decisions in the best interests of the city and I agree with Vicki that then burying nine or ten million dollars when it 's not necessary when it could be spent on an amazing community facility is definitely the way to go thank you thank you David a long time and trying to get facilities in the eastern suburbs a I do appreciate the support that was given to getting that up and running in this case it 's quite unusual that you know you 've got three sites to consider and and and all of them have some some issues but I think the overriding factor that I think needs to be following the earthquakes has experienced a huge amount of growth and and are still doing so putting a facility on coal park coming to the stage you are looking at a reduction on the size of the facility of 22 percent right from the word go I 'm probably looking from and from the angle of how can we best provide the maximum facilities for the area for the size of the population for our city and so I think Sara pointed out a few moments ago some decisions at times can 't_''_1962.54 be the most palatable one that I think in the end we need to be looking at the best bang for our backs to a degree in how can we provide the most sizeable facility for the budget that we 've got and serve the community in the best possible way in terms of the size of the facility that we 're providing so with a degree of reluctance I am going to support this motion not not a degree of reluctance and that timber a degree of reluctance from some of the people that are LBC wider and look at the size of facility that we 're able to provide and how we can best serve their community I 'm sure some of the other sporting codes that may be effective can be accommodated in other ways so I will support the motion that was before us today Andrew thank you I 'm a big believer in grassroots democracy I 'm a big believer in decision making at the local level as my colleagues around the table now I 'm a stickler for process and I 'm also a big believer in meeting community expectations and their some of the issues that we 're actually considering here today the community board have done a huge amount of work staff have done a huge amount of work the community board and the community have been hugely engaged in this issue and I acknowledge all of that I think it 's important to know that considering a community board recommendation my default on that because of those beliefs I talked about when I opened what I 'm saying is that I 'd I take the community boards recommendation that on its its merits and that 's exactly what I 've done here this has been through a robust process there 's been an engagement process the community board would have heard from submitters the community board of sat for what I understand was a protracted amount of time to arrive at their recommendation and they reached a majority recommendation which is what we 're considering today I think it 's important to note that submissions process is not a referendum it 's not an election the number of submitters that submits in favor of or against a particular option yes that 's one of the things that we take into account but that 's not everything we take into account as a council we 've got a responsibility to consider costs we 've got a responsibility to consider outcomes we 've got to consider the expectation of the community which has been raised through various long-term plan and annual plan processes in this case over a long period of time and in this case in a community which needs a good quality facility in an area of high going to be fit for today and which is going to be fit for the future and it 's for those reasons that I find it impossible to consider a facility which has got a reduced scope by 22% which doesn 't meet the expectations that have been raised for this community and I find it impossible to consider an option which is going to consider which is going to cost a significant amount more to actually deliver less and where there 's a risk of delay which doesn 't exist at Denton Park and that 's the reason that I 'm happy to be seconding the motion that we 've got in front of us today okay I 'm Jimmy I remember you 're in the communal extraordinary meeting on 12 August I particular emphasized no mater Hawk handle option we make decision some of the residence a good happy summer may be disappointed a hippie however as a elected member of the council come here for we had to review all those possible the options and listen to all those summation then we make the decision this decision the southwest area so in that committee I make decision is the popular option one Tenten Park however I would like to remind our mayor in my fellow councillors the community board recommendation slightly different from the original verse staff recommendation because we move the paragraph for in the paper five and these to the paragraph was you animals by all the community or men but not any committee against the paragraph four is regarding to the staff working closely with us postcard in the area particular in the day we listen to the home be legardie the football card as well as holding weekly at the twenty curricular carbon regarding to the possibilities relocating from the tent Empire there 's a couple new enemy support the other one will listen to the summation particular concerned a community facility and the traffic management issue we also the first the Starmie took particular to emphasize so this the this area this solar book after the committee meeting I got quite a few email from the only area heard of you but I would like to three filigree out to the the just want to be out quickly I 'm not your waiter chair maybe I did not take instruction from the back of the room you 're perfectly welcome to refuse an email you know okay simcha the one is the purple that determinant means the chain released to show our support for the development empire in Holmby incorporating a new library spinning poor as a resistance way they 've been hungry for 44 years we firmly believe this project is a benefit to the whole community and not a select a domain for to suppose the parties this individual I also got a quite a few from the community I would like to be out just one the group from the home P community care center he particular a little painful the other to paragraph as for the new facility we know they are mainly in a community looking forward to having four council services available packed in a home be there has not enforced service since 1989 when Papa rotisserie council was disbanded in the move from the Clocktower beauty in the new swimming pool which was promised when price series and also recently I read that the last time the counselor a community housing economic development in the master schedule the new home builder the neighbor service center will be open in that July 2017 it means mastermind city open part 1 we have the today because the killing the soul Vince leader the consultation he says so this might will be ready you know the way week so we about later I 'm the local councillor you know it 's very hard for me for me but we need to pull them and consider all those of either the home be in the southwestern area I just want to we can working together to go home benefit for the people for a wider home be area this my my view Phil thank you look I 'll try and be brief but I I think this is an extremely important issue there 's no question at all that Hornby deserves a decent Civic Center not a reduced one and and in the it 's a growing area population wise probably the fastest growing area in the city it have advised us around Carl Park that in fact there 's a higher risk of the contamination or the extent of it via and as the staff actually wisely seed the risks are unknown and so while a figure of nine or ten million may be what 's required in fact there may well be a lot more than that if F for me is to have the the multi-use Center that it deserves so the this one with some loss of sporting area from Denton Park there are clear alternatives any report at why Cola Park and clearly council will be supporting those I want to commend the community board in terms of standing strong will vote I understand was six to three I hope them think the community board and can does have some strong leadership so infect the recommendations that you need chain referred to can in fact be supported across the wider community thank you so I will put the motion all those in favor say aye yeah well yeah but okay it 's just one so I will put one first on its own so aye those opposed say no can you record unit your hence and oppose and now I 'll put the balance of the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "in the next one is public participation public forum and we 've got Cameron Bessette from West Mountain School who will present to the council on the creation of a biodegradable pot plant what plant pot as part of the young enterprise scheme so what Cameron like to come forward Cameron and Fergus Vegas will come first time front of Council let 's do it well welcome specially your five minutes starts now you know everybody thank for this opportunity to speak with a special thanks to mrs. P Tim would have no ego vests this connection but but now breathless notes gone he 'll sit on Cameron and mrs. Vegas and five students from our school are privileged to be included in the young enterprise scheme which is a nationally run program which it encourages us to start anew Enterprise during our last year of school and take it to market I 'm at the beginning of our journey we 've started a company called earth to earth then we begin to work with issues around their area to try and address see a problem of plastic pots when ran into other problems when using these such as such as the time it takes to pull each plant out of the plastic pot and also that the problem was trying to reuse and will dispose them or sterilize them or whatever they the assistant as I 'm sure this resolved enough stand to work with the with a local car would supply producer and we 've come up with the biodegradable plant and we 've found we 've proven it that says many hours in the production not as I see not having to pull the plant out and it all solves the addresses a big problem with with plastic consumption I wound up them to the market and biodegradable pots and we found the real ones out there but I 'm the nurseries weren 't using them so we we see that to find out why our main reason water they weren 't using the paid pots and what was out there really is that some times so lasts too long and sometimes they don 't last long enough so he came out with the design of a up to six months in the nursery so that allows most varieties of plants to grow in mature what bring in the nursery we 've come up with the design off so you can see that 's a deer we 've got I was on the sort that allows the ropes to come out and spread out once planted on the ground and wind the tray close together we tried to make it so none of the house on it so water and the trailer weights don 't try to either and then we 've got that you probably can 't see it but the dark out lawn or into one when planted you just rip it off which allows it to access them to fray up they 'll also flip it so they come for breakfast which is good storage space and we 're working on toe sorting in the moment that 's their biggest size were also working on a four centimeter trophy for dum la de production nurseries that grow heaps of seedlings and stuff yes so this is out this is a six centimeter square but contract pops so a nursery that is planting out on a motorway or ravit joy whatever Coast side or something they can grow these in the nursery as an upon just the normal pops because the sizes are designed to fit into their common nursery pot then they can take this to the site and plant them straight in and save so much time but there 's more the sauce which foodists was talking about is slightly smaller and a lot less shallow and these are for large nursery set of producing millions of plants in crow them on to the next size up to bigger trees but as a result of us being here what would what would love to see is as these sort of biodegradable pots being specified specified for for use from nurseries because a lot of the issues we we talked where they say well what we use works so why would we use these would use these when people request them surf projects requests them and such as a council in the city care and they request them and then that 's a lot up for us someone what I have some questions or oh yeah well we 've got 29 seconds to go I 'm I 'm just going to use that time to say congratulations it 's one of the best elevator pictures I 've seen it 's one of the council beaches and thank you Sarah Templeton for allowing them to this opportunity to raise not just awareness around the council table but I think you know because it 's live streamed I hope you everyone links to it on on social media but I 'm just wondering whether we could get them to go to the innovation and Social Development Committee worth in order to pursue pursue this issue is it as if here yeah yeah because I 'm just I 'm just thinking that you know if we want to if we want to turn this into a reality then we need to have a champion and I think the committee that buggy back tears which they 're at in fitness as on you know as as as a really good place to to be in that regard thank one other thing have you got investors outside investors and we always five of us in the group um coincidental Eve all of our parents are business owners they are don 't need to steal myself yeah I 'm just thinking that but we haven 't got any external it yeah I 'm a big supporter of the youth enterprise game and if we can find a way of helping to connect you also with potential partners you know obviously you know I 'm just looking up the potaro altered which the number of us you know who 've been involved in they had a planting day so you just think of all of those areas where there be potential for requiring that to be to be used but not thank you very much Yeah right thank you very much and then what this legging with your secretary and she said she 's going to help me a distribution area thank you thank you right and the next one is Joe Cocker from the Avon helpers history in Qatar trust who 's presenting a dictation of counsel on item 42 going to defer the consideration of the paper until 9 o 'clock next week because there 's obviously that 's quite a significant set of recommendations and we want to we want to analyze them and I 'm we bit more depth but we 'll still hear your deputation today thank you very much good morning everybody this is the deputation on damage to the South new boat and national with natural restoration sites following the emergency works in response to the flooding and the storm on the 21st and 23rd of July 2017 the Aven Heathkit eastery i which i trust as a charitable society registered in 2003 to advocate the avon Heathkit history our huto the vision of the trust as communities working together for clean water open space safe recreation and healthy ecosystems that we can all enjoy and respect one of the Trust 's restoration projects around the eastery and partly funded by council is led by scott butcher and is focused on native restoration and regeneration within the South New Brighton Park this is a project with the endorsement in support of the council and the council 's South New Brighton reserves development plan the ecology of the site includes important salt marsh graduating into coastal bioship habitats that are unique and sensitive to climate change and that demand adequate space to retain resilience to sea level rise during the recent storm 23 July combined effects of significant rainfall in the catchment chem tides in storm surge inundation from history was experienced in South Bryson in South Shore emergency response measured response measures were triggered to reinforce flood protections in the area including the construction of new stock a new stock Bank in South Brighton Park between the northern end of eptas Street and South New Brighton mosha came alongside an existing track this works resulted in damage to many restoration plantings into salt marsh into other habitats in this area the construction of the emergency stock Bank through the middle of the habitat gradient now presents a physical barrier to the natural progression along the gradient habitats that experience inundation from the history that would would allow us not much to retreat to higher inland with sea level rise and now cut off from clear that we support the need for the emergency works and acknowledge the very real threat of inundation to the local communities if these emergency works had not been undertaken at the time we also acknowledge that the contractors working in very very trying conditions however we would like you to acknowledge the following issues with regard to these words we raised these in the hopes that our concerns can be addressed and lessons can be learned for any future events through residential properties might be exposed to risk of inundation as a result of adverse weather events and climate change particularly with their environments of high ecological value we 're concerned that warnings by local communities of vulnerabilities and the existing flood protection measures were not adequately adequately heeded and addressed prior to the event if these had been heeded in a more planned approach to flood protection enhancements would have been undertaken with greater consideration of the ecological values of the environment where possible flood protection measures should be designed to include natural ecological systems in many cases these ecological systems can be a buffer against wave or of intrinsic value in their own right this would mean as in the South Brighton situation placing engineered flood protection measures or embankments as far back from the eastery edge is physically possible while still affording adequate protection to residential communities in this instance that would have been possible to construct the stock Bank on the boundary with or within the adjacent red zone and retain the full breadth of regeneration habitat gradient from the estuary edge this principle should apply with the planning long term protection measures or short term emergency transitional measures and this is the lesson to be learned for the future long term there is still potential to attain the habitats gradient and consequent resilience of further stop Bank is constructed on the boundary or within the adjacent red zone and the emergency stop Bank removed or breached to allow passage of tidal water from the history into this area it is the emergency stop link should be considered as a transitional protection and not necessarily a permanent solution over 150 native plants were lost as a result of the emergency works a situation that 's the restoration work support from the council with a supply and replanting of placement plants as the metro agency is important to ensure the group can continue to retain and recruit volunteers and demonstrate councils commitment to the value of native restoration and regeneration in the area we ask that the AVA nestra issue they even hit that eastery how you take trust be recognized as an important partner in any future planning and discussions for South Shore and South New Brighton particularly on the eastern edge we have many years Abed with focus a frantic integrated management and conservation of the values of the history the views of local residents are important but so are the views of the whole city as the history is an ST issue of local regional national and international importance thank you thank you very much you know it 's it 's a really you know powerful point that you make in terms of you know the extent of what that history means to the whole of the city and all so bringing to the fore the international significance I know that none of they had to operate in that environment and you know I know that that you know if you acknowledge right at the very start that the emergency created the need for being to work in a way that then had this unfortunate impact the significant impact on the contribution of volunteers and I kind of want to acknowledge them as well because quite frankly we don 't we don 't make a difference in these environments at the same with restoring the Port Hills after the fire we don 't we simply can 't_''_895.32 do that without the voluntary effort so I think all of the points that you 've made will be taken on board not just for the consideration of this paper but actually for wider consideration of how we you know restore what has been lost in the storm till Joe thank you for your deputation today the report which I don 't think we 're going to deal with today but as a mere alluded to but it refers to longer-term use in future adaptation and future land-use change basically so in this going I think report going to arrive would your group be involved you think in having those conversations about future use of all of this area with with the I guess with the other community groups yeah I think you know the whole the whole coastal environment and that 's one of the reasons for deferring the paper to next week because that we really didn 't give staff sufficient time to even look at the you know the interrelationships between the role of regenerate Christchurch as an owner but with another paper on the on the on the agenda will not regenerate crash which is an owner but lenses and owner regenerate Christchurch as is the overarching planner and the residential red zone as far as regeneration heading where that 's required and and also the end it can in terms of its responsibilities and the coastal environment and I think people forget that because they have transferred to the council the planning obligations but actually the wider obligations still such where they can so it 's it 's a complex environment and I think your submission has really focused our and just about flood defense this is about how can you create flood defense that actually then enhances the environment thank you very much thank you yeah sorry okay thank you thank you Joe so what I 'm hearing and I think that means just said this anyway we 're not hearing an either raw I mean we 're hearing from the letter obviously the need for protection for residents but also rity chin bhava fundamental ecological values is that exactly you know okay thank you a lot thank you very much appreciate your time to write so um on that note I will simply well note that the South Shore flood meant a third plane management talk to talk short to options as they literally lie on the table to it just won 't be considered until today until win with you yeah yeah so be considered at nine o 'clock next Thursday with the meeting adjourned till then at that point please die next week oh sorry did i sorry okay so _"

    "text": "your item 22 the Christchurch Civic awards process review now Jonnie you chair the committee that 's done some work on this so if you 'd like to introduce this item that will be great yeah sure I mean effectively I think the reports pretty self-explanatory I don 't think it needs a long introduction just to say that what we 've done is basically formalized some of their criteria and their procedures and we 've extended it into some new categories so that we can recognize people in a slightly different way than just the Civic award so I think this really records captures the process it 's a way of recognizing people that have a special relationship in connection to the city in one form or another where it 's appropriate but still that committee will retain you know quite a large degree of discretion as well the council when it chooses to approve any of the things that have been suggested so I think the final product is that if you look around staff did a really good job looking at around the awards around New Zealand a huge number of schemes to recognize and make awards to people for a whole variety of different things so I think you know the the interesting thing about this is really it 's refining what we 're already doing and adding a few a little bit to it but it 's not trying to duplicate other other events and the final final point was just the emerging Civic award that we talked about the emerging leaders so what we recognize is that there 'll be people that are doing new interesting things in the city that have a positive benefit and we thought it was important to have a category that enabled us to have an emerging leaders Civic award so it 's not just for young people but it 's for those emerging things that are happening in the city that we have a way to recognize which i think is actually quite quite cool so really happy to move this forward thank you to staff for the work that they 've done on it yeah great thanks thank you for the introduction and thanks also to you to to get us to this point now Duncan welcome to the table was there anything that you wanted to add to the comments that Yanni 's made no-face mr. Chairman I think Cassie Hansen 's covered it nicely Thank You Jana you 're happy to move this yep so moved by Yanni seconded by Sarah are there any questions on this any debate erin question just on and I should probably know this given my position but the for-hire on us beyond the Civic rewards can that committee or at Kenna council nominate for things like knighthoods and stuff like at least someone in our community that there 's a council we go not me Duncan is that a question that you 're able to answer so if the councillors take a view that they wanted to nominate an eminent citizen for a royal honor then I guess it would be the case where the mayor would would nominate that person up through the process of the royal honors process but that would be my understanding of it I might have to go back and do a bit more Kim but that would be my understanding of it at the moment thank you any further questions any debate I 'll put the motion all those in favor aye against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "so then moving to item 22 so this is in the first supplementary agenda the draft council submissions of the inquiries of the 2016 local authority elections Joe welcome to the table thank you for joining us were there any preliminary comments that you wanted to make on this matter just a couple of quick comments his councillors all recall I had a briefing with you and being to July and then circulated some information at the briefing we talked about a number of different points and there was some mixed views so those point aren 't included in the submission so it 's happy to answer any questions thank you so are there any questions Aaron and then Yanni yeah just no surprises here Joe so on number 11 and District Health Board elections the council supports investigation the benefits although there 's a missing word there yeah the benefits are into the benefits so it 's ease of being held together they were already held together yes are there benefits in them being held together right I 'm happy to change their joint flipped held separately yeah oh but the my question around that was I thought there was an agreement that working party that the difference in the two systems at the moment the STV first-past-the-post is causing a lot of confusion in trouble providers and we 've made that we 've made that sentence within the paragraph further acknowledges the possibility for confusion at the district health boards or the ministry of health I beliefs decision floor is TV voting the council 's make their own decisions so I haven 't_''_111.869 included that in there because that 's a decision of the Ministry of Health not something to do with the regulations so at the Ministry aren 't going to change their minds and I would not comment and leading into an election whether we have an open-minded minister or not but if they 're not likely to change their minds would we look at changing us potentially okay okay so we can look at that beyond now leading up to the election mm-hmm yes there was that one what if someone else might being off because I didn 't touch my shall we come back Yannick Sarah Vicki and then we 'll come back to you Erin just two things that I think we discussed that we didn 't have agreement on were the online voting which I see in here that we 're recommending there be used but when the report came to council last term the council voted against s-- against that and the second one was around the reef not refunding the candidate deposits so vestal and yeah and I was just gonna race with it yeah I meant person I feel uncomfortable not refunding campaign deposits and also just thought if the online voting is continuous then we should probably remove that as well and the recommendation here is that me the legislation be amended to allow for online voting so it was more about having that ability then the council will use it and with regard to not refunding the deposits that 's fine if there 's coming that that point can be taken out all right so we 'll have some discussion on that once we 've come to the end of questions I 'll just note that for great Sarah yes sorry I was away while they win the food stuff Pippen with counselors and it wasn 't clear from the emails sort of where it was all heating like to agree with both Aaron and Yanni and about the both the deposit the refund should be given especially if we 're looking each and people who may not be able to afford initiator to jump up to start with and also think that actually people do need to pay a deposit and I think that someone who 's serious about standing should be able to get enough support to get two hundred dollars together and I don 't think it 's very much another thing that would be actually get in the way of people standing and I do think that people should get back at the end so if we could I don 't know yeah I guess it 's gonna take a bit more discussion and them to vote on that in a minute yeah was on east TV so both Wellington and Dunedin news is it 'll be really good to know if they consistent with the mystery of health and I 'm really sorry I didn 't seen it beforehand I 'm really really sorry that I didn 't see my question through quite a little bit last night um but I think it 'll be really good for us to look at changing our system to keep it consistent with the Ministry of Health and that CDHP elections no we don 't have any say on the other one but I think keeping it consistent is really important and I think that um it 's more democratic as well to get to change DSTV I can 't comment about with your not other councils had less confusion or not and like I mean this is a submission with the points if there are points in there that the council isn 't an agreement on they can just come out there 's no requirements on us to submit to the committee however obviously I 'm recommending that we do so if that 's a point I mean we can make those changes to or if the entire section with regard to the deposit its staying as it is and with regard to the STV the council will have the opportunity to consider that itself so I think acknowledging the point that this confusion is probably well all there has been confusion is probably relevant but it doesn 't tie the council into anything or any decision with regard to that alright so I 've noted three things already the things that we need to give some direction on the online voting refund of the deposit and confusion over STV will finish questions and then I 'll just get a steer as to where people are at on that maybe to avoid needing to have a full debate about those things but some less let 's just see where we go so Sarah that was your questions yep great okay so still in questions Vicki and Aaron so we didn 't include anything Joe on the fact that people can still at the moment vote in more than one part of the city and the ratepayer enrollment entitlement least there seem to be rough agreement around the table when we had that briefing so like us to debate putting that back in okay so Vicki Aaron and then Glenn well funnily enough point got asked and see my answer but quite early in Sierra so it seems we 're all on that on the same thing I thought just on the onus one no on the electronic voting I thought we were at that meeting were very clear that we were keen ears on bringing in the electronic but just the way you only see that sounded not but you 've clarified that we are keen okay on the legislation allowing use really and finally Glenn thank you thank you Joe just wishing to clarify under seven over online voting where it says should be offered on a trial basis it 's actually the real thing as we know so rather than a trial which is something we discussed last time if we did we come to a consensus on their like I think one of the reasons that the trial basis was whether or not it 's made that made that online voting is must be used in 2019 that 's a short perhaps I kept showing that point stays and perhaps clarify rather than say trial basis try on at least a trial basis or something their wording to that effect to indicate that the council would be supportive of it being available full stop there 's been quite a lot of discussion around sorghum and algae as heed about perhaps online voting being available to subsets like particular demographic areas or perhaps in a by-election type environment just to I guess fine-tune the system I 'm open to the idea of it but just since it could be problematic given what is the definition of the trial because at an election is an election actually you know how do you actually have a trial so I think I mean that 's covered really by the addition of the words at least and obviously if we were going to adopt online voting for any election that would be and you 'll probably write geophone wrong that would be an explicit decision of council to do this all we 're doing here is saying the opportunity should be available we 're just submitting do that and what the details of that would be obviously something that we 'd consider separately than this this is just about advocating the opportunity be available to those councils that subsequently choose to film in drew I 'm just wondering if I could ask Joe but if to work it around the like this reference to postal voting and I think that makes sense given the circumstances of delivery times at the moment but I 'm just wondering did the working group consider you know adding to the opportunity for people to vote by a way of having some polling booths not as such no we didn 't there is the ability for if people haven 't received the voting papers in the mail to cast a special vote at which case and we had five sites for site sorry around the city where people could do that so no we haven 't suggested polling as such but its facilities we can make available and some in some way because even if people perhaps receive your voting documents but for whatever reason haven 't got them particularly as they can come in two locations and like I said they were for in 2016 I think we can look at increasing that in 2019 so we could do that as a council Joe we could increase the number of sites so that if people did need to cast a special vote or wanted to bring their papers in because they didn 't understand it then they could do that okay thank you all right so that brings us to the end of questions on the online voting issue given the comments that have been made around our submission essentially advocating the opportunity to be available are people generally comfortable leaving that in in the in the way that it is at the moment attempt thank you just to remind those that were here last time when we discussed it one of the things about the online voting winner was brought to us was technically if Christchurch didn 't pick it up it would not be used in New Zealand because they needed that nice to make it work and at the time many of us felt that we didn something that was new because our people have been through enough so they needed something solid do remember no I 'm pretty sure that the system did get hit in Australia so I wanted to see it used somewhere else let them be the guinea pig so when it came back to Christchurch it was a lot more robust and almost guaranteed although you can never have a true guarantee of it for the pip of Christchurch because as Glen said it as an election it is really important to get it right and accurate and we 're very likely people like Joe and others that really work hard on this so when it does come and when it does as an opportunity and it will cut hip and sooner or later my key concern is that it is robust and accurate for the people of Christchurch so that 's just a bit of a reminder at the time and I think some of us have forgotten why we voted as we did last one yeah and that is a good reminder I 'm keen not to get into the 're talking about is what goes into a submission but on getting a sense that there isn 't pushback against leaving this in the submission in the way that it is so on that basis will and might suggest we leave that in the refund of the deposit now there have been different views have been expressed through questions so far I mean we can either do this by somebody moving an amendment that we take out the matter relating to the refund of the deposit but is there a general sense that we 're comfortable to take that out or other people that believe I mean be good if we could just come to an agreement so that Joe can take some direction rather than having to have a full debate about this if we can you 're not running because you think that this should be no peace and painting their pile whatever doing it as a joke with your flatmates you 're taking it seriously and then if you get over 25% of the winning vote you get your money back and if you don 't get you don 't see your money again and hopefully take it more serious next time and just just get slightly stronger policies than peas and pies as was the case with the mayoral candidate once just okay so yours so are you our and supporting then that we just take that paragraph out what 's a sponsor essentially there will be the way to go is there anybody who would I mean I 'm just trying to get a sense because we do need to debate this we will is and would argue yeah all right well let 's let 's deal with this more formally in that case then so Yanni 's signalling amendments that the paragraph on nomination deposit be removed yep all right so Jana your amendment then is yep yeah so if we captured that so to a mental determinant yeah yeah to remove the sentence regarding not providing a refund and to maintain the status quo or to support the status quo okay that 's fine so is there a second dirt throat Yanni 's amendment Dave okay we should have got a mover and suspect we may be going to the realm of making something reasonably straight for more competent I 'm concerned about that but just so just for some clarity around this and where I met with it what I see this at the workshop so I 'm just saying affirming what part of this is in line with the submission or not is I 'd be happy for the for a deposit still would be paid because I think you need to have their line in the sand to say that you 're serious but I 'll probably I think the and I think the gist of what Joe has been saying is that you know there is a cost to administering this so I sort of sit at the at the point where reduce the amount say 50 or 100 and nobody gets it there so and it 's sort of like a middle ground of all right so that 's debate on the unnies amendments essentially but is there general agreement that a deposit should be paid yes so can we change the submission to reflect that we believe form a view on whether it should be refunded or not okay so that means we don 't need to worry about the whether the deposit should be paid or not so if we can change the submission to reflect that it should be paid and then let 's debate Yanni 's amendments in the context of the submissions gonna say that the deposit should be paid okay great now a piece in there that acknowledges that the different voting systems and having STV for the DHB election causes confusion everybody 's in agreement that go in there they just rhythm that that confusion is acknowledged yep so we can set that one aside and then there 's the issue that Vicky 's raised around the the right payroll and the ability for people owning multiple properties to vote for the Community Board in a different Ward where they own a property in that different Ward and your proposal Viki would be that we just think that we should have one person one vote just seems the fundamental aspect of democracy so we add to the submission that there be their general agreement that that go into the submission yes would anybody argue against Vicky 's position all right so let 's add that and we won 't debate that we 'll just take it there 's agreement that that goes in so the only issue then now is to let 's get a mover and a seconder for the the whole thing and it probably should be somebody who 's intending voting against Yanni 's amendment so so if everybody 's in agreement that we put the 200 in and we get a refund then there 's nothing to debate isn 't that generally the view Jamie you 'd indicated that you felt that mustard so my view is that by I think the 200 I think that that actually could be a barrier for some people I think you need something but I think 200 is probably the high side so I well I guess what I 'm proposing is that it comes out in the wash sort of thing is no one gets a refund because I butt in but you make it a smaller fee so then no one gets a refund and I think you know that 's okay so that 's going back to the issue that I thought we 'd already dealt with was that people were comfortable with maintaining status quo on the payment the only matter at issue was the refund but I 'm now hearing that there is some issue around payments itself the amount okay there 's reference it to a reduction in the amount but but but your concern at the rate when you mentioned it was about there was an administration cost exactly but no no no right but after you drop it the administration costs are still the same it 's just a lesser amount of money you 've got to try and compensate there 's no administrator there 's no administration cost of his no refund yep well why not keep it 200 because I believe his administration cost to refund there okay so why was that easy well as some free-flowing discussion on this but it 's probably got a little bit more free-flowing than I 'd perhaps thought it would and I mean a point where we could agree that we would generally agreed on things bearing in mind that all we 're doing is putting things into a submission yeah you know I hoped we could get to a point of general agreement without needing to have a big debate on this so on the issue of whether there should be a fee payable and the amount if we were to reflect in our submission that there were to be a fee payable but there could be consideration of reducing the amount would that capture a common view around the table no mr. chair I think the problem is where I am with it is that I kind of connected because I wouldn 't support reducing the feeding if it 's if you 're still refunding it so a 200 dollar fee I would then if you charge them 200 or fee you know I think that it makes sense to refund their because it 's a sizable amount of money but on the flips but on the flip side though yeah but but I think there 's a bit a solution so if you then charge 50 to stand then I would support their not refund anything to anyone all right let 's deal with Yanni 's amendment first and then we 'll come to Jamie Sara if there 's any issue remaining after that so Jamie I 'll come to you so we 're kind of treat this as a full shadowed amendment that will work up if we need to so we need a mover and seconder for the substantive motion so Erin you 're happy to move the substantive motion Tim 's happy to second so moved by Erin seconded by Tim and then we 've got Yanni 's amendment which will deal with first so Yanni did you want to say something about this um like I actually think that you know one of the comments that 's being made is that if people were serious about standing for public offers then 200 isn 't actually a huge amount of money to find but to me it should be refunded and you know I I we already have an issue with I think a number of people so you know I I personally don 't see it that it 's been a barrier to people participating and you know I think the risk is if we reduce it to say 20 then you get a whole people more people standing not taking it seriously so I personally think it 's better to have it at a higher level and offer the refund and that 's why I offer mr. okay does anybody want to speak against Yanni 's amendment just quickly soso why well I take account of you to Yanni with that in the sense that we don 't know what we don 't know so it 's well and good to say that you know that 200 on a barrier but you know I there were four counts of Simmons total that were elected unopposed so maybe if it was a bit cheaper it might have been more people so I think it 's very hard to say that it 's not a barrier but we just don 't know and I think more people running is actually just good for democracy so if we wouldn 't we so I 'm not saying that you have nothing there because you do want serious candidates but I do think that 200 is prohibitive to probably a number of people okay um Sarah just briefly I just had to point out that issue for those of us who are elected and and move into these you know especially it counsel to be well well-paid jobs the refund of a deposit doesn 't matter for those who don 't get elected actually the refund measures many of them won 't have a employment and in the no matter what the size of the refund is it will make a difference to their pockets and I think that they should get a refund yeah any further debate on refunds versus no refund Tim I just got a comment about the four elected members that got an unopposed on you know hopefully it is of some kind of part there that the the communities that you thought we 'd done something for three years but the other part of that is there 's what 's changed what the feedback was not so it 's not the amount paid that the feedback I got it was actually that the the gamble was it was one position rather than two and that was the hurdle so I think that the amount is reasonable it 's more than fair and you do have to have a true commitment as Erin said you know like teasing a pie it 's just um fixations it 's just not with the serious we represent our community so I 've support the tournedos and I support the refund so ok pulling a 100 which i think is probably more easily accrual by most people in no refund because refunding in itself costs a lot of administration and I think it 's a level of hundred dollars means you 're serious but also that you 're prepared to take that risk with your money and you 'll have a really good goda so I think just to reduce that administration cost of a refund as worth considering all right so we 're now in a position where we can take a vote on amendment 1 a remove the removed from legislation so if you in favor of a refund you would vote in favor of this and if you 're against a refund you would vote against I just clarify the requirement for candidate nomination deposit to be refunded be removed from legislation be refunded be refunded as missing from their otherwise it 's pretty good I don 't wanna be voting on something that you know yep no that 's go ahead that took like a deposit all right so this is just one a for the moment so I 'll put this all those in favor aye against so that 's carried so that then just becomes something that we 're going to do so we 're going to remove that okay that 's great so that 's now part of the resolution and then the one-person one-vote my understanding is that where we will vote on this and to add it in as well so I 'll put one be all those in favor against so that 's included as well so now we 've got a substantive resolution that involves both includes both of about the amount it 's only if yeah I think we 're taking of enough time with it but it 's only if this support around the table it 's just you know in my perfect world view but I I don 't know if anyone else thinks of these mirrors on that they know I will but Paul is the only other person that 's indicated there might be support for that it would there be other support for a reduction Sid eration of a reduction in the amount is there so from what I understand the submission where he says that indicates for reducing the amount yeah that 's it we 've already previously voted on Yanni 's amendment which was that the refund stands so correct it 's kind of a nebulous argument from me now because are people comfortable with that so we take out they 're all removed I think that reflects the discussion that we 've had so all right so strikeouts all removed and I think that reflects the discussion that we 've had yep I 'm just thinking that so now we deposit it would cost us technically so know whether the big discussion started over the amount in the refund the refund is going to we support and I personally support the ton of dollars but all we 're saying is we 're events is the wording in the submission on this number twelve the nomination deposit be reduced or removed so it 's only yeah I mean I 'd be comfortable with removing the words all removed and we 're saying consideration be given to reduction that doesn 't mean that we necessarily or I certain your um so let 's formalize it then so Tim you 're moving that we remove the wording that whole paragraph okay so the whole paragraph about the 200 nomination being a barrier and possibly reducing or removing it okay okay so Tim 's moved Sarah a second so let 's we can just take a vote on this country so who would vote in favor of removing that paragraph those in favor aye against no no can we just get a show for hands so those who ever knows show their hands so so that 's the lost alright so we keep that paragraph in so on the basis of all of that discussion and the decisions that we 've made there now let 's come to the substantive motion which has been moved and seconded and I 'll put that motion that Sarah yes you 're and one of the things that we discussed earlier on I know that 's not something that we 're going to be taking in an or out of changing and this as the the STB method of voting it 's it 's really clear on the electro Commission 's website and in other places that it 's actually a fear a more democratic system for voting the fact that we currently have two different systems is confusing for a lot of people and I think that while we don 't have any way of changing what the Ministry of Health wants I think that is a so we should be considering at the appropriate date which I think is I don 't know sometime in the next year whether we change our voting system and I move to try and do that for that for our next election Thanks Thank You Glenn thank you yes it as I alluded to before I 'm open to the concept of online voting my personal view on this as to we we take it carefully and quietly one of the notes that came through last time when we discuss this that the government wasn 't happy for the Auckland Council to proceed with it so I think that 's something we need to have our radar tuned into online voting in my view is not a trial that is the real thing and that goes for by-elections as well so I 'm not sure how you trial online voting I think that would in itself as is his issue so but as I said if it could serve to stimulate greater voter position participation that 's great I haven 't seen any data that would support that at this point but if one of some of you have got that that 's good anyway I 'll think it on balance it 's a good submission thank you Dave yeah all made a decision last time around then at that stage it was primarily based around a fear or perception that online voting may be open to being hacked and I certainly would support my online voting but only on the premise that some fairly robust IT had been devised that we had absolute security or confidence in the system that it wasn 't going to be hacked and manipulated so what was like what was I believe was the the main reason why we weren 't that confident and going fooled with the last time so I certainly would like to see some assurance around the system that it is robust and and and not reliable to be tampered with and secondly I 'm just on from a personal point of view I 'm happy with the voting system we have at the moment I think these TV systems have big of a an idea well that 's clearly a discussion for another day but yeah thank you view comments and Tim thank you I 'm totally supportive online fighting and I was last on but the two things last time was the company or any company needs a critical mess and Christchurch was that critical mr. Wellington and Auckland so the reason why they didn 't go ahead and New Zealand was because we turned it down because we were the turning point if you like all the the weight point if you like or whatever you want to put up so that that 's one reason why I didn 't support it because we they needed the numbers which is totally understandable and no question there but the other reason is that I just felt that personally their robustness for me Percy wasn 't there and as Vicky 's super forth you can 't guarantee that something will not be hit because you are some very very clever people they 're always nibbling nibbling nibbling and it 's just a progression but I think we have to be if we 're going to look at in the future at all online and voting we must ensure that we get the beast in micro most robust system available and we owe it to the people because of biting 've to say thanks Erin yeah whichever system we moved to absolutely support Sierra 's point then it needs to be the same just for consistency and easier on on people that are making the decisions and online voting is just the way of to kind of even suggest that it 's it 's a way way off would be would be crazy in fact if you go to I did a Google search you look at election buddy who do elections all over the world four hundred four point three six million votes cast and twenty two thousand nine hundred ninety seven elections and it 's the same system it 's the same 256 but encryption used is may just Bank security so I don 't know if anyone here has online banking or has the money in a bank and you don 't trust online voting you should go put all your money under your pillow mattress yeah Joe just checking in with you you 're comfortable with the discussion that we 've had and what we 've got in these resolutions that gives you the guidance that happy with me making these amendments and getting the submission a spin I will see me do so yet great so you 've got the clarity that you need with this that 's great thank you so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that carried okay thank you very much so let 's now move _"

    "text": "we move into the supplementary number to agenda item 27 which is the mayor 's monthly report and are there any questions on this report so um fell into it 's in it 's in relation to carlene 's report but it 's just um letting the rights okay cuz it 's just a comment really and and rather than a question if there 's a clear reference there to the work of their emergency services dead with the recent flooding and that the staff really it worked in a very highly commendable way and this isn 't written here but I know the many of them were working 20-year days so it 's easy to come along and say you know we want this done we want that done but in fact I think full credit to a staff who work very very hard and I actually think being in the land drainage working group we 're incredibly lucky to the caliber of staff that we have and I just want that noted and on please that is referred to in the chief executives report yeah and thanks very speak for all of us when I say that our gratitude goes out to staff that worked long hours in very difficult situations away from their families particularly on that Friday and Saturday and over that weekend in a way that you know people wouldn 't naturally choose to but the work needed to be done and our staff are out there and they did that work in in very difficult and trying situations and we certainly appreciate that and we appreciate the sacrifices that they made to do so and I 'm very aware of some very positive commentary that 's come in from affected residents who had interaction with staff over those over those days as well so thanks very much indeed for making those comments thank you so now turning to the mayor 's report are there any questions on the mayor 's monthly report Jonnie just I mean as in the mayor 's report as well but I do think it would be good we 're told there 's a review of the flooding response it would be good to have an ability for the community which that can be done I mean the longer we get from the event the harder or we yeah so I think I refer you to the comments that I made earlier in response to the community board comments which is that you know we 've been in obviously the emergency situation we 're now in recovery clearly there will be a review of what was done and any learnings from that and I think it 's reasonable to expect that any review would cast the net wide in terms of getting opinion including comment back from the affected communities in live and then community boards and I 'm assuming that 's the itty committee or the land drainage recovery working party would have some governance input into that anyway so they have had and previously residents have been advised that the meeting next meeting for information was as Yaya is a will have being a number of meetings with residence groups next one was to be October and I understand what the work staff are doing there in fact the date most likely is to be October 4th at talking about two different things I 'm talking about a review of the event not the whole flooding mitigation work which is important and needs to happen but I like we did with the tsunami response I thought it was really good we had a dedicated staff member that came and talked to the the community boards and that people couldn 't import feedback to so I just wanted to get understanding of a time frame around that review that 's mentioned in this report that will happen and I guess just raise concern that the longer we 'd lever the less information we may get back that 's relevant yeah so whilst I 'm hearing concerns I don 't have an answer to the question is something that we can certainly find out some feedback I mean really it 's you know what what is the process for gaining local input community input into that piece of work that we 're referring to to make sure that we doing that in as timely a fashion as possible so that we don 't have a big gap that then means any meaningful way yeah I just need to be clear that what 's taught Bellamy is report here is a review of the response which is what we would do after Nutan see you 're actually asking for a review of things before bed and so that 's a discussion we 'll need to have with the she commercially in the land drainage and board that 's a different issue that so the the review of the response is something that we would do normally equates to approximately the via deemed yes sorry is that the misery asked for an update on the mayoral task force and a sort of report that 's a separate piece of work around what recommendations were what 's the review of the event and the response as what I was raising so that is underway or no is that just ways we 've worked through the recovery phase first and then we 'll do the review of that once we know we likely to get some information around latitude that 'll be at least October before engagement of the rest of the community is about the flooding I believe that maybe we need to be talking about the same saying I think we talked about various work strings here to be clear about that so yeah you all you 're talking about the I understand I think you 're talking about what the community board raised and their impact of their on the event which is slightly different it 's a bit more like the tsunami our warning system so it 's not just about the response so the responses are fairly standard debrief after in a being my age the mural task force update is about as I recall from our last meeting was about what was proposed to be done in what was done so it 's a sort of stopped a to close things now they made all come together but they 're actually different pieces they 're quite separate but there were two points that the community board raised one was around on the Thursday knowing you know that the significance of the event and not reading that properly but you you recall being briefed assuming you would be that all that I 'm just saying you know that what we 've just heard from the community borders what they were saying with with local knowledge they saw a bigger event and I 'm not saying that they 're right we 're rival who 's right or wrong I 'm just saying they did raise the kind of preparation for the event and the adequacy of it so you know I understand the moral stuff will happen I 'm just talking about the review at the moment around the process by which people can feed into their review to the response of the event how can I present some preliminary response will be their preparedness for the event as well yep all right so obviously something that there 's there 's some thinking on the way we 'll obviously make sure that 's communicated back in due course all right thank you are there any further questions on the net report so I 'm happy to move that we received the information in the report and then there 's the second resolution as well resolve that councillor Davidson replaced the Regional Transport Committee so we 've got those two parts of the resolution thereon happy to move that David East is happy to second all those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "thank you thank you thank you so now moving to the coastal Burwood community board item 15 and Kim money chair of the board welcome to the table to present the highlights from your report now I know you 've always led the way with visual presentations this is clearly moving into a far more competitive environment and it was really we 've had some videos this morning so we 're waiting to see whether you 're keeping up oh my goodness well barely answer David he did a fantastic job and humor and everybody else that 's just amazing good morning Andrew and good morning counselors and staff and community it 's great to be here and of course I 've got Deputy Chair term census enable governments manager Joe Wells we have no part 8 days to report today very get my goggles on first we have just wanting to move them the CUNY Board decisions and the delegation amazing to see our young woopsie come later I want to give them too much of a show sorry yep but the young ones there that was able to endeavors so really encouraged to see some young ones now to help them financially they 're hidden strategist significant projects and initiatives with the boardwalk at South New Brighton which we were able to repair as now if you look at that that 's a little bit dated now because they 've actually finished and completed a third of it so once we 've got to the end of it and the GT is completed we 're really wanting to have a wee celebration and once it 's both of them are completed so there would be really great so what 's your inbox there and the inviting war memorial area you 're probably quite aware through the media that the community through the protection panels that means you weren 't in favor of us they didn 't like the look of it neither did the community board actually so we 're working now with the New Brighton return services associated coat resolution we would like as a board to explore some landscaping options for that area around the area just to make it more inviting liven it up so that these panels will actually be more temporary than they are going to be permanent so that 's what we 're working towards and also just to highlight the qe2 part transport with the two schools going on the site and the new recreational facility going in there we 're very aware about the parking issue so as a board we 're just wanting to be involved in that process right from the very beginning because the volumes are obviously going to be increasing and there 's going to be a wide range of users usually with we here is quite a few students that drive cars these days so moving on to the significant community issues the one that we have to highlight today it 's been a horrific month for the South Brighton and South Shore community through the floodings that we had and that July weekend I 'd just like to take this opportunity on behalf of the board just to say thank you very much to the staff and to the contractors that were there that weekend we Joe myself David East and Tim were in just really fantastic to see the contractors and the staffs empathy towards the community they were very concerned and whenever they approached any of the staff and contractors they had as much time as they needed to assure them and to hear that what they were wanting to say so and I just want to especially meet um at the stage because if we hadn 't have had him on the spot that would have been a bigger disaster than it was in another life Tim 's background as a commercial fisherman so he as his life and job totally depended on knowing tides and the currents and weather and his local knowledge was just amazing for that weekend so he was able to show the contractors and staff where the weak points we 're through that so thank you Tim for that actually I must just say at this point as Tim 's birthday today today but I came in species for this yeah that 's great so um so great for that clarification we would like to on the part of the community would just like to clarify that weekend is earthquake related flooding and just to sort of recap on a few things the land had dropped in certain areas the land was mechanically lowered when removing the houses from the redzone the retaining walls were damaged and removed and consequently that caused the erosion from behind and so we you had for example the Remo mattress which is stones and wire mesh the securing the higher land and the earthquake that dropped so therefore the water was and some areas that dropped in Sicilia for the water was able to get through in a road behind it and consequently we have what we have and also time I talk later on on the banding there but just that in itself was one issue but then also the drainage is the other so if you can imagine I was actually going to bring a prop this morning Andrew so I 'm reading aside down a little but I was trying to find one of those little birthday was whistles and that roll up and I was wanting to display this sort of drainage that we have so blowing until it works really well and everything 's going fine but if you pinched it end and held it the only blue it just wouldn 't work it wouldn 't do its job and that 's when our drainage is like down at South and Brighton we have the system in there whereas if the the flex of this drainage system not operating as they should have so therefore the street water and the rainwater just can 't get out so add that to the earthquake damage for coming in from the history plus the rainwater not being able to get out of the drainage things we have what we have that weekend so really are also wanting to just put on a thank you at this point to for all of you backing David a notice of motion on the 3rd of August which at this point would like to read for the benefit of the community that haven 't heard it and that motors notice of motion was seek urgent approval for resource consent to continue incomplete to a robust standard the bund work created on Friday and to extend this work as necessary to prevent sea water inundation along the eastern side of South Shore and South New Brighton domain to the GC so we really do appreciate your getting on behind that one thank you I 'm just going to hand over to terminate at this point thank you Thank You Victor wishes to buy presents exhibited later and there 's more expressive than with it but look I 'm even in the paper during the week and if it was a before on the 20th on the Thursday the headlines were warring of two months reign one day storm approaches set on the believes to compare to the story with two months rain high tides etc so I was feeling well forecasted and you know I was worried on the Monday and Friday knowing I looked at the item and it was a load tide it was half-full so you 're gonna be a baby I requested sandbags would they be for for some areas and didn 't have any luck the same thing about this whole thing is it could be it didn many times I 've bring to the council over the last four or five years saying you 've got some big gaps in your step banks and once not baked you probably don 't stop make you don 't know about is the one in South Brighton from casseroles stripes it 's too hot there 's a get 200 metres alone our only stop bank stops there 's a big decorative moves right through the red zone onto East rewrite and this happened three or four weeks ago to on big tide and I took council staff down and showed them in contractors in Regina right and it 's so disappointing when you see the gaps you know it 's going to happen and nothing gets done and I looked at all those workers on the field on the Friday night and instead it I working all through the night they didn 't have to be there they worked the most atrocious conditions to fiction bun that we 've been asking for for so long to be fixed the old wise guys could have been in the hit cut looking skinny we 're going to be proactive not reactive it didn 't have to happen and they said the mornings been there we 've gotta go away scot free with it there is it you know it was so obvious it was going to happen and I 'm it was a big event and you know I 'm gonna have to look at what happens when the whole east coast of the South Island and island already enough and it 's it 's quite sad that we have to we hate takes to get to the stage to get six years of fighting to get a work done overnight to get fixed and you know and but Kim is there Dave is there one less harvest things to see people on the street saying water coming into their houses I don 't mean into three houses by the way but people said this shouldn 't have happened this shouldn 't be happening you know it 's it 's we the fixes were so easy for Salesforce out Brighton unless the state thing about it on the other hand do the get we are so simple we 're fits their own right so it 's good team player must earn it but we have to learn from this and we can 't keep on just fixing it before we die questions over a couple days over a month before he makes the you know I said you know it needs doing and there was no money on the budget and I did quote you 'll find many where that happens and that 's exactly what happened and it happens in so many cases around the city so that 's my also a camping ground tour must admit they came aground had water can always come into it luckily the contractors were there and managed to put a little buns in front where we 've just signed a 21 year lease for the camping red for new owners and here they 've got water coming right over the door stick so you didn 't have to happen thank you thank you so if Thomas eat these things that we can learn from this also we feel that going forward from here the a positive step forward and what it 's notice of motion as well so this these actions that have been since actioned do give our community some assurance so we do think of it just highlighting a few other things here we 've got under the significant methods of interest there was we 're very grateful to the staff for investigating the one to two pages road it was to be demolished and however we 've asked if this is possibly able to be retained so we 're very grateful for them looking into that and seeing if there 's some other options there that we can preserve this house so here we go we had an awesome week this week it 's nice to have some ups because we 've had a few downs we 've had the two Saab tunings this week the Shirley boys name inside Gil 's high school which was really exciting on the Qt site very sorry haven 't_''_699.38 got to pitch on my photography work is not quite up to some of the ones round table like deals but anyway we 've got from DC oh oh absolutely I can 't take any credit theorists these young ones that were showing us that weren 't they David but I 'm what is it probably me saying move over David let me in here but anyway it was them we the other two occasions are very exciting and when it came to the playground I thought what a special way to start the regeneration of New Brighton with a child 's children 's playground I mean that that 's pretty special so and these young ones here this is a historical day for them you know they 'll be able to tell their grandkids about it and that 's them etcetera etcetera so they 're children they 're from you Brighton Catholic school and South you Brighton promise store so it was a wonderful day that DCI had put on and it was there was a real poignant moment where the big Duggar truck turned up so there actually happened to be in the background and a lot of people were very excited that she 's seated on-site so it was a wonderful day because you were all part of that so thank you okay so this time for a probably just a couple of questions Yanni I think you um have you had any response from staff around reporting back on the Merrill task force or are you aware that that 's something that we 've asked for in terms of the flooding because I do think we owe you some answers around what hasn 't happened and why it didn 't happen no I 've made contact with an impervious events but going back a few years I didn 't even know that it still existed actually there is clearly work going on which you 've already referred to in your presentation and obviously there 'll be some local issues that will be picked up within that work I mean thanks very much indeed for raising the the local view of those issues and I mean all of us were very concerned around what was going on in all of those areas where the water rose and homes were flooded and so on but yeah you certainly refer to the notice of chamber in the past couple of meetings there 's more reporting which will land and obviously there 's work been done in that space and it was pleasing to hear some positive comments along with hearing about obviously some of the the challenges that we 're all facing as well as we move through those issues but there is work underway and it may well be yani that you know I mean some of these things are definitely relative to South Shore relative to the Heathcote relative to other areas as well and and there is work going on it may be that those questions are better put to the areas where those work streams have been considered rather than to the community board although your level of awareness of what works going on between something that 's important to it so I was just trying I mean I thought that we 'd asked for I think the mayor and asked for add also raised it in the debate that we get a report on the actions and the mural task force and what hasn 't happened what has happened service that we were noted for failing which I raced in the performance reports that we were getting so I think it is important that we do involve the community board in that given they 've got some feedback that they met well yeah so my understanding is that that reporting will come to the et committee we 've got a bear in mind I think that we 've gone from emergency to recovery and obviously any any learnings and findings and further work will flow on from that but yeah my understanding is that that will come to the 80 committee for further consideration and just the second question was just stated it is a work in progress so that 's happening is there a process by which the committee will can fit into a debrief on the flooding events again when we get to the point of having that debrief when we look at learnings that 's obviously something will be considered at that time I think it would be very sensible to hear from people within local communities and from the local community boards to feed into recovery work the lend that Lane drainage working group work that 's done there is regularly reported in the three waters report is part of the Educare Mattia gender and that 's there 's a recordable at the 14 for you Yanni and other councillors in community board members yep great okay great so I mean obviously some things have been raised by the community board which serious concerns at the local level I think the message loud and clear is that there are work streams going on where those things are going to be picked up we certainly heard the message that you 've brought to us this morning very clearly yeah and staff have been great any time we 've wanted to access them or have meetings or anything they 've always been available so appreciated that so we understand there 's going to be a report come to the table next week so decisions are going to be made so I want to just see another personal invitation to all of you some would be more than happy to walk you down the ester edge so they make sure she does have a caravan at his place that looks out over the sea so it 's well worth it a truck copy Boris thank you very much indeed for that that that brings us to the end of the time that we 've got for questions but thanks very much indeed for the station of the report and the issues from from your area so we have a recommendation in front of us to receive the community board reports moved by David East seconded by Glen Livingstone all of those in favor against that 's carried _"

    "text": "so now we need to item 12v banks peninsula Community Board Christine Wilson chair of the board is here Christine if you 'd like to come to the table and I noticed some Pam Richardson here as well Pam did you want to come forward as the Deputy Chair all right all right so Christine and her ma 'am thank you for joining us this morning and if you 'd like to present any key points from your report to us okay good morning everyone think you enjoy and we have a bit of a public participation thing running through our report today so ad versus thing is the liberation air quality report so basically in August 2014 the Dean Littleton community living tournament heber Community Board noted that there was concerns in the community about the air quality particularly in Norwich case I in 2015 there was conversation with a varmint cage break and the Buddhist priest and you know the concerns that ass would it be possible to have that Myrna Shh so as a result of the H 2016 the monitoring the game and it was concluded and it was really good because the report that came back was actually a chat lis so that gives you an idea basically of the main train that was going on so you basically escorting and each report that we 've got copies of but the results that come back with it excuse me the time of day the time of use the Jesus attracts or submissions and not the main source of dangerous particles so from the community perspective that 's really good because of the increase of tracks that are moving along Norwich cave aim that suggests oh that 's my thought from a penis okay so in some way the mushrooms from the truckasaurus did not appear to be a big air quality issue a large K so we 're really thrilled about that result the high ones walleston Boston it all burns up here and this chart just to clarify Kristine this particular chart PM 2.5 that 's likely to come from would be no righties oppose each other and track admissions interesting yes secret for with that yeah maybe journey if you 're able to graphs relevant term and then obviously you can pick that up well it may be so if you can forward it but um and maybe to the which committee would it 'll be the itty committee so maybe to Paul Lena 's chair of the et committee as well and that will allow us to pick that up because clearly there are some concerns been expressed there Lisa it 's also been raised in the Newark report we used to get and it was placed on the agenda for the middle of the commissioners that councilors have sorry alright so Pauline if that comes to you do you want to pick that up as well there any synergy with the reports on the natural environment recovery program that we used to get the Knope and also the ability to discuss this because obviously air qualities II can issue the ability to discuss this with econ commissioners at a governor start counselors at the governance level as well we normally have an update from Lincoln to issue but we haven 't recently because Davis been done well when we as councils put it on the agenda previously run Woolston on heavy particles which is different to the graph that we 've got so there 's an even worse issue for Wolfson I think it 's good I don 't we 'll be good to just get it on the agenda get in meeting with those commissioners and yes right we 've got a meeting with um II can 't counselors coming up so I 'm not sure what the process for getting items on that agenda would be but it 's certainly something we can look at and if we yep so Joan if you 're able to forward the report through as relevant that would be great and clearly there are some further actions either through community boards or Council or through econ that might result from that say well certainly further discussions so thank you Christine apologies for interruptions good to get that sausage and of well with that the next item is just really women to follow it for those who have not aware that the bank 's financial community board travels so we alternated in meetings monthly I think really the good thing to highlight here of waiting were different communities we have a lot of deputations so any are maintained and Joan we had 15 deputies that came along so it 's really good to see that the communities come out and really want to speak to us win with ear as opposed to the payment of travel which a little turn so I was amazement leads that that makes me so pay to cheetah my he that it 'll be very efficiently so that was really good 15 deputations is a lot the photo he just shows the environment scribe that came along and requested Alicia 's of support for the entrance into an international environment competition and the board was happy to provide it for them so just really wanted to highlight date now the next one as an NGO initial and akaroa about the textual pavers so we he 'd signal deeper ties that they 've maintained who are very concerned about the color of the tectile pavers and well support under stained and you know the color and the reasons behind it go into the next thinks join if you have a look at this photo here in the China major and yellow the I would really change a streetscape so there was a bit of concern around each have a spirit in quality of the area so these lots of conversations going on about those pavers at the moment trying to get it right in this next picture is just this an occasional strike so you know it 's been brought to my attention that there are other colors that can be used so we 're just breaking basically for some more information so we can try and get beats each hold it 's just really highlighting that yellow it 's not the only option tick tock papers but obviously a community a very pushy much obh their community in the colors that go into it so they didn 't want them at all they don 't want though no so the discussion of the border was very much around whether color other than yellow could deliver the same safety benefits that yellow would be able to deliver and there 's if it 's ongoing stole so what 's a space endorse Lee I know that we 're gonna be presenting their board planes next month but this is just a way and snippet of

    "text": "okay so that now brings us to the report of the papper nui Ennis community board and we have Deputy Chair and menorah SH here with us this morning so Emma welcome to the table thanks very much indeed for joining us and yeah we look forward to hearing the presentation of your report thank you and we take for the public to come up we 've had a couple of world events in our area so I just want to highlight those we had our community service awards for 2017 during July and we had 16 individuals one couple in two groups who received awards and so it was a fantastic evening here the Northcutt school kapa haka group there 's a couple of the recipients so that was and we gave them fruit trees as well as the frame certificate so they were all really appreciative of that are we also held june july and dusk-to-dawn which is a in an event for youth and done through our board in their fingers when why Mary Huard and it 's an overnight event from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. idea of what the kids got up to [Music] I 'm so it was 150 youth as well as 40 youth leaders and council staff who were there for all night and need to thank Aaron Campbell from the Pendleton one Mary he would Community Board for all that video footage and photos he was there all night and did a great job with that I just highlight a couple of things from the report you see we 're a working party has been initiated by the Pocono youth development to support the installation of an all X 's playground in our local area and so the community board has Dobrin and Mike Davidson representing us on it really working party they 'll be exciting to see what they come up with we had last week their first of the stucks river catchment working party meetings which was initiative from the community board working with seven community representatives along with elected members and staff they went through a number of issues where the focus being on action points including weed removal tree assessment options for cedar sediment removal in general real involving a local community and local decision making process and we 're working alongside coastal board and that process and we also have the son Albans Park Pavilion rebuild we hold a meeting last week with council staff and sports groups or users of that Park to find out exactly what their needs are so we 're waiting for staff to come up with the design before that goes out to the community so it 's exciting to finally see something happening on their part I want to get it usable again next next year and a major issue for us in our board area at the moment is your basic money and small bones around some urban school down Cranford Street we 're having issues with our traffic cars speeding and running red lights we 've got the police out there a few weeks ago 2-door blitz on one intersection they can give up Quincy tickets in the space of an hour 17 of which will work for orange and red light running and so it 's really real issue because it 's a busy busy road with a meeting with police school community board representatives and so we can work on what can be done around that area as well as looking at getting hopefully some barrier arms installed on the Cranford Berwick and two sectional just to protect the pedestrians who are standing very close to the the roadway that 's basically it from us questions great thank you very much we don 't we 've got time for a couple of questions Glen thank you thank you Emmet the red light running brings to mind something that which I speak a lot of us have seen is that your understanding that is true red light running or do you think the traffic signals need to be phased longer Islander but the morning at the police whether they obviously gave out those 17 tickets for data fit so there is an issue here okay and Wheatley and we are working with our traffic engineer to see what can be done possibly with the signals you know I think this came up a while back to look at they 're phasing but time a it 's man got the green light when it goes red there 's the considerable time before the other light goes green to give the pedestrians therefore amici that 's just more the design of the intersection there 's a slight Bend on the roads here and I don 't know why people just think they can keep going but what surprises me is that the police that never came back they did wonder you so we were lonely out with the police yeah to get the making but dangerous the red seems to pick on the new orange people precious so it sounds as though the community board has got some good interaction with local police it with him we 're working with them to hopefully get the meds it wind the relationship with our local police but unfortunately it 's the traffic people who have to go and do a lot of that stuff they seem to work a bit separately okay yeah okay thank you all right well it was just a follow on from Glen 's point I think you 'll find oranges in the new read its readers Pulsar joke the that phrasing that Glen spoke about I think is a problem at that morning time and afternoon when the traffic flow is the medians about 30k now and I think that 's what Glenn 's referring to so be good if we maybe even saw sake back at the Infrastructure Committee to whether the orange phasing needed to be longer not that there 's anything right about running a read but there might be something in that yeah I know what we have done it surely primary school is with the pedestrian crossing you that 's got lights they 've just left it 's a longer gap between when the red light for the cars goes and when the green light for the perience goes so this should be a time we know nobody 's going it may be an option as well in the communities standing down there of signs and stuff I think that 's really had an impact on the repeat drivers so I 've seen their action of the parents and the school committee which is certainly to be commended yeah we 've getting something done some good suggestions there as well yep great all right so we 've got a recommendation here to receive the community board report I have a mover for that or Lane seconded Mike all those in favor against that 's Carrick thanks for _"

    "text": "thank you very much okay so now let 's come back to item 11 Lynette you 're here for this one the orbiter public transport route yeah so we were going to consider this before and then there were questions and we didn 't have a staff member to answer questions so if we can bring staff to the table that would be great and item 11 Yanni you had a question oh thank you um just in regards to the board 's report I know that we had quite a lot of discussion about the possibility of extending the scope to include a little bit further up the pedestrian safety crossing so I just wanted I didn 't see anything in the report that addressed that and I just wondered whether we 've had any any further information back on that thank you sorry oh this is Kirsty managers project manager for this project so let your answer and so I 've spoken with the area engineer traffic engineer and he 'd been on site and discussed this previously there is the potential to do something but unfortunately we down there because there 's driveways either side for about 60 metres through to the bus stops so you could do something but then it his other impacts so we 've I 've drafted up a memo to come back to the board on that particular point what justice go through prices moment so we have looked at it there 's not an easy solution unfortunately so look at there and we have also editon as per the scheme design met they painted shoulder so the approach is people come around the corner it actually appears narrower so people slow down and take the time to look as they should be for the good way anyway thanks just a little explanation to councillors it 's just on the right sorry on the lift in turnout of a power road in to insource Road the submissions that came to the community board were concerned at the speed with which people were around the corner and the ability to cross safely with her existing crossing was so so effectively if we wait for the memo and then the board could come back that 's okay definitely yeah it 's been drafted such an over our way so there 's a process underway to allow that to happen at the board and obviously the board can deal with that and make their recommendation to to Council once they 've got that absolutely yes yeah great okay so that 's in hand don 't thank you what my concern really I suppose is it 's probably one of the busiest intersections and in the city and caters for a huge number of heavy traffic vehicles and by putting these cycle pathways and there are we actually confining the carriageway at all or are we expanding the footpath abut or minimizing the footpath because I just get concerned that we sometimes squash the traffic up and we 're making things to live but more dangerous for cyclists rather than improving at times and we have certainly looked at there and we 've also looked at the trekking paths for their heavy vehicles and showing the ones going into the 14 Hogan yard and that section of insource road there 's not huge huge numbers of gets more Brown Street their heavy vehicles so putting the toilet putting the sidelines on provides definition more white people I was probably more concerned with the the off ramp from Brougham Street on to insource Road itself by the railway line where you 've got a merging of cyclists heavy traffic and vehicles and there 's certainly no encouragement of cyclists along ran straight given their it was very very busy but we have looked at there and done vehicle trekking past to make sure there is the room for vehicles to go around there safely but hopefully my talk offline yeah absolutely okay Sarah did you have a young question all right great okay that 's fine now my only question relates to the way that the resolutions are set out in front of us the staff recommendations of the board looks quite different on paper to the party that the board are bringing to us their recommendation just in the way that it 's formatted but the effect of both the the staff recommendation is picked up in the the board 's recommendation isn 't it the as the the staff recommendation that 's correct and it 's been noted as something to improve for all future reports yeah no that 's fine I mean as long as the substance is the same then I mean great yeah no that 's fine all right so Sarah we 'll move this item is there a seconder Michael second any debate all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much _"

wait till we got the staff in the room and come back to this so that would then see us move on to UM spray tan Kashmir so item 14 we 'll come back to item 11 item 14 Sprague and Kashmir community board report to Council so Carolyn good morning welcome to the table thank what 's been happening in Sprague and Kashmir and thank you for putting me up the list as well because I 've got an engagement this afternoon and I 'm grateful for staffs flexibility and you [Music] well the first item up is worries loose rope which you 've heard quite a lot about it trucks are coming through we will be really interested in the local response we don 't think that 'll be without controversy and the intersection is going to cost two million dollars so it is a big effort and we and the consultation with that is on the 14th at the same time as a consultation is being held about our Albuquerque track which is much used and beloved track you can crash into the obliques on a Sunday morning if you 're off of mind that 's used in the lab attract to the port hills and up to the top to the Summit Road and it 's increasingly difficult to get a exists especially for local residents in terms of other people wanting to park there so those two days we 've got those two consultations we 've also got another consultation out before we move on to Vista on Vista place where it 's proposed that we stop external traffic from between 00 p.m. and 00 a.m. because of the disruption to the peace and calm of the residents of Vista place at the top of Hannspree 's contrary to the principles of human rights in terms of the right to travel and the right to movement and and it 's always got a high threshold so we 'll be interesting to see what comes out of it one as well who in a community seem to know I passed around a short and accountabilities statement from the people at who in a community center we 're prepared we 're almost at the stage we are the center will be allocated to an area of council and will be leased by a committee that 's now established and that is in charge of the community center you 'll remember this was the children 's libeled that was proposed for disposal and has been rescued and is now fulfilling a function there 's a small Center in the middle of we requested some money to provide plumbing out of--out of the annual plan in order to be able to be provide hospitality facilities at the center we don 't think we were successful though it 's difficult to identify but we still hope to be able to proceed I am moving on with Tillerson Street the residents have called for safe crossings these four traffic islands on Tennyson Street which seems a bit over the top but what the local residents are saying that each traffic island is too small to take a person with a couple of kids especially if they 're on cycles and boards this is an issue that has been raised frequently and you 'll see some this is from children from Beckenham school in some of the things that we 've received in terms of the local neighborhood take action on this issue and we 've also been a proposal before us from the Baha 'i from the Baha 'i community wanting to plant some trees and have a carved pole in the early Clarke reserve where they have had many volunteers over the last year doing weeding and planting and that 's what council now and we look forward to receiving a response from Council and the board we hopes that it is and we hope that the council will consider it favorably we heard our concern community service awards there 's with them that they were to the detriment of the people who got there so I asked that they be excluded and this is Benedum Louise for a long standing volunteers in our community at rally they know that 's fine and if we go on that the next one is Michael Paul Palais who was who won the youth community award who was a giant of a man figuratively and literally and and who has been a volunteer since he was in I think prior to being a teenager and he 's been the volunteer in the in our community consistently over all these years and his latest project along with a lot of other young people from the rally rally is lights at the basketball courts on moon Hopak and finally we I 'd like to attempt but the board has asked me to write to Chris Gregory hit of traffic engineering and local staff thanking them both for the restoration of the traffic engineering support in our Ward we 've got a terrific traffic engineer we 've had him now for about six months he has caught active traffic engineer we are grateful to the City Council we 're grateful to Chris Gregory and his staff and we 're grateful to our local staff in the restoration of those facilities Thank You Roy thank you very much thank you sir are there any questions on the report Tim yeah just just with the woolsley on hoon hi the development and the wall sleep elegans a new certain 30 km so the pressure on it that intersection is only gaining so it 's just as the heads of it yeah it 's not just tight coping with the current that 's the future oh it 's going to be extraordinary yeah sorry no just one other comment that like the first Thursday 's project and some of them which we 've written about and my understanding is besides that this the special board contributing to that because was said them was previously in the board area that in fact that the Lynwood Central has got board has also contributed so it 's a good example of with a sort of a near boundary board to working together you smoke oh yes you know the first

    "text": "a deputation by appointments and I would call Michael Bell director of orange Studios to the table who 's going to addresses regarding public excluded item 20 the Performing Arts precinct Michael thanks very much indeed for joining us you have ten minutes to make your deputation to Council this morning thank you thank you very much deputy mayor councillors thank you for seeing me today and thank you for people that have come in and support I 'm here in capacity as leader of Andromeda the proposed alternatives business case for the multi-purpose theater which the council has drafted to put into the performing arts precinct I agree that this is an excellent thing to put them to the precinct and it 's got a lot of use it 's got a lot of reasons to be in there and in recent times it 's become clear that the court theatres are proposing that this multi-purpose theater gets deleted from the precinct and with the funding with all of the available funding going to them to me I don 't think this is a good idea I think this company has in Christchurch I don 't think that 's good for Christchurch 's arts seeing I don 't think it 's good for Christchurch as a whole and I 've got a it 's up to you to judge but here are 20 reasons why they are so beyond the screen door and so some of the questions that I 'd like to address today is Andromeda the multi-purpose theatre just a cheaper option without any economic or artistic benefits and is the multi-purpose theater worth removing from the Performing Arts precinct in favor of all the available funding going to just one entity so I guess one of the easiest things we can talk about first is how much it 's going to cost the court will cost 40 something million dollars to to get up off the ground Andromeda is going to cost a half of that the special multi-purpose theater and one important thing of this is one important thing about this is that it means you can actually afford to do it now so so give it the green light will be up off the precinct creating a really great corridor from the from Cathedral Square through to the migrant may he playground but the fact that you can actually afford it doesn 't have to be the only reason that you should do it the court theatres asking if 1 million dollars a year after they 're built of rate payer money to help uncover to help subsidize their increased costs of being in Lea Andromeda has a more sustainable plan which does not ask the council for that if you would like to give us the income from the car back then we would gratefully accept it and we can do some great things for Christchurch with that money but we 're not but we 're not asking for that annual public money skipping to that bottom a purple box sphere if you want to create a new economy for Christchurch Andromeda is your only option here it 's going to put 20 million dollars of new economy into Christchurch half of it 's going to be coming from out of town your money injected into Christchurch it 's new activity happening in some activity from one place to another if you move the court theatre from Eddington into the CBD those jobs will go with it and I 'm sure there will be probably a few new jobs created but if you build Andromeda first you 'll create 70 jobs straight off the bet and it 's direct employment within the theatre not even including the new theatre companies that will be moving into it employment there and the the new employment it will create in the tourism industry and the surrounding and the surrounding area one really important thing that you 're going to want to consider is as how it activates the CBD and the Performing Arts precinct so put the court theatre in there and you are guaranteed to get an influx of people at 7 p.m. when they arrive to go to the theatre you 'll also get a few people turning up early at 6 o 'clock for dinner and at ten o 'clock you 'll get another outflux of people as as the courts predominant demographic hourly for theater and go home to bid if you to 18 hours a day activation is part of the core of its business plan it 's built entirely around this both inside the facility and surrounding the facility so from six o 'clock until midnight we 're going to be activating the precinct with with locals with with conference delegates with with with businesses meetings with business meetings with theatre goers in the evenings and in the evening and later in the evenings even weekday evenings tourists who aren 't ready to go home yet so this really is a true option for activation of the precinct I 've noticed in recent times the court have started using buzzwords like all day activation and benefits to the dance and community theater and music communities and tourism benefits but it would appear on the surface that they 're copying the text from Andromeda 's website and I would definitely encourage critical thinking of how they would achieve the same thing in terms of benefits to the arts community and 45 million dollars will buy you to performance stages at the Court Theatre for exclusive use by one one theater company and a co-working space in a tenancy space for twelve of Christchurch 's other professional theatre companies who have got a lot of diverse voices and a lot of world-class [Applause] theater to give you and and we really do have good track records in Christchurch around New Zealand and around the world furthermore you 'll be clear influence base lots of community theater companies that are in desperate need of it lots of dance companies that are in desperate need of it the court there have been calling this a theater for hire that 's not the case at all it 's a joint venture model it 's a it 's a it 's a newer model that 's getting really popular around the world it works a lot better in Auckland and Wellington that I 've got that and I 've got really great diverse forming out scenes that that a world-class and we can 't_''_414.82 say the same at the moment about Christchurch that build was theater and we will be able to say the same thing about Christchurch in terms of benefits to the public build music performances every year so this is both on the big main stage and also and it 's and it 's jazz comedy bar which opens out onto the courtyards so the vast majority of these will be visible from the square so locals and visitors walking through will will really get the benefit of this of this activation but it 's not just music that 's theatre Court Theatre you 'll put the court theatre in there first you 'll get yourself five hundred and fifty shows moved from one place to another build Andromeda in here and you 're gonna get yourself 1,000 performances a very conservative estimate feel free to ask me why later if you 're wondering how that 's possible also Andromeda is your only option to create a really good meaningful hub for Christchurch 's existing and future festivals so we 're talking world buskers festival and I crashed which arts festival Jazz and Blues Festival big band festival and other festivals as well it 'll create a excellent excellent much-needed hub to help these festivals to do really really well and in close the groundwork for new festivals to happen and I 'd love to talk about the abilities and new festivals and why they 'll be great for Christchurch but if you if you 'd like to ask questions about that later feel free and Java is your only option for adding new activity and meaningful new activities or Christchurch 's arts scene it 's your option for helping Christchurch 's art scene to become more diverse more active and more respected by other cities and I 'd like to add more equitable so so you look at other cities even in New Zealand Wellington Auckland there 's a diverse range of theatre companies doing a really big big range of theater you know you can go to lots of different places there 'll be theatres all the time we can have there in Christchurch as well but we need an equitable art scene where the funding is split bitter between between our awesome arts groups and the core theater certainly does have a good track record they do excellent shows and I have a lot of respect for the court I I really look forward to being neighbors with them in the performing arts precinct Andromeda also has a lot of reasons that this is not not a big risk for the council so the people behind it and in it have a really good track record of business and theater in Christchurch and New Zealand and overseas and dromeda also has a very viable business plan so it 's years in the making it 's thoroughly researched it has has professional market research it 's it 's costed up professionally it 's well consulted on it 's it 's very viable and it works and you 're welcome to ask any questions about it but not only does and not only does it work for Christchurch and as itself but it has so far 31 letters of support and Counting they 're coming in all the time so there 's a real need and want from the Christchurch trans community to get this to get this up and running and I think it is definitely worth your consideration to look properly into this so what I ask of you is engage formally with Andromeda negotiating and evaluating a deal that can be brought back forward to you as a tangible option for getting the falling earth precinct up and running sooner rather than later thank you great thank you very much and that brings us almost exactly to the end of the ten minutes allotted for the deputation but thanks very much for a very interesting presentation this morning thank you very much indeed all right thank you _"

    "text": "now moving to item 3 public participation we have a number of public forum participations and one deputation as well so I would first of all call Joe McCoy of the cycling Action Network who is going to speak to us regarding the New Zealand Bike Expo so Joe good morning welcome to the table thank you very much indeed for joining us and you have five minutes for this public participation thank you okay thank you Amy tuna and councillors thanks for allowing me to have five minutes today I 'm a volunteer cycling net Action Network can which is a national advocacy organization and with me today I 've got David Hawke and Robert Fleming from spokes Canterbury who I 'm sure you 're all very familiar with spokes Canterbury is hands long people here in Christchurch and I think you 've been working with with these guys and with Dawn babe and with clean curry and Claire Simpson over the years as well so I 'm involved in organizing the first New Zealand Bike Expo in Christchurch which we 're really excited about being here I live 't think I 'm mentioned before so I had a town but I 'm coming to Christchurch there are two benefits for Christchurch and hosting their New Zealand Bike Expo first can and spokes Canterbury want to support the council and your significant infrastructure investment and cycleways we love it it 's just fantastic so thank you so much for doing it I went out with Robert yesterday on the pepper newly parallel and it was just so exciting I know I 'm so jealous coming from Wellington I know that Christchurch is leading the way in putting in cycling infrastructure to the country and so basically the best way that we can support as community cyclists support the council is to a bike toba so spokes Canterbury 's organizing by kotoba which is a series of fun public events throughout the springtime which is a great time to sort of get people ought to get on their bicycle and Ken 's doing and the bike Expo which is a consumer show bringing in the whole retail community and bringing in lots of visitors into Christchurch and giving people in on a bike and just having fun so we that 's the best way we think tuning the culture around getting people involved is the best thing that we can do to help support your significant investment and council staff are supporting our behind us as well supporting it with their their marketing if it 's around the major cycle routes and Clarry will be having a stand to talk about the major cycle routes at the expo which is great and the second benefit for the council is and for the region as the economic benefit the expo we 're talking to supplies all over country and a lot of them will come through the local retailers to get to the event local retailers and the businesses are in a great position to leverage of this we want to build it up to be a major thing year after year in Christchurch hosting and experts Annette natural consequence of broadening the appeal to bicycles but in this is where the economic benefit can come in so why am I here talking to you today creating something new is about town my event manager and I are from out of town so forgive us for coming here the reason why we 've decided to choose Christchurch besides being the favorite New Zealand 's favorite place to ride is because dawn babe from spokes Canterbury said Joan you should do that Expo idea that you 've been you know throwing around you should do it down here in Christ 's shoes because we 're doing bike toga and it should be part of bike Toba and that 's why we went okay let 's go to Christchurch and the reason why spokes is creating biked over is due to and I must acknowledge councillor Clearwater here is due to the council bringing the asia-pacific cycle Congress to Christchurch so the a PCC is coming and spokes said okay we 'll do bike Tober and then they 've brought cannon to say okay we 're going to do the expo here and it turns out Springs a fantastic time to do this kind of thing gets people on their bike start of the daylight savings talking about and I think it 's promotions for bicycles so the reason why I 'm talking to you is building something up from scratch we don 't have the stats from last year you know retailers are coming and behind us they 're taking a risk too because they can 't we can 't point to the stats from last year and say we got so many visitors they 're putting their thing behind success breeds success the way to build it up is for people and you 're all community leaders and you have got huge community networks and every day whether you 're a cyclist or not yourself you 're talking to people who do cycle so please get the word out there please talk to people please excite them about this event it it 's it helps protect your investment and it helps to grow that bicycle economy you can like us and share our facebook page is dub-dub-dub dot NZ Bike Expo doctor in Zed nice and easy and we 're on Facebook so please share that like that and just get the she the love and get it out there thank morning October certainly is gonna be a good time to be here and it 's great to to have heard about the work that you 're doing and the collaboration with others as well exciting stuff thank you very much indeed for taking the time to come along this morning thank you thank you and just just a follow a question from that just to you mr. chair that as a council we should consider referring to all our documents in wording is piped over this year rather than off moment just we officially named everything just because we are the biking capital of New Zealand great thank you okay and our second participant in the public participation this morning is David Lynch David if you 'd like to come to the table please and David is going to speak to the council regarding Cathedral Square and surroundings and as with the previous participation you have five minutes to make your presentation to us thank you very much indeed for joining us Thank You mr. Tiffany there for this opportunity I must confess that the Reg we had before you sure until about 00 a.m. this morning to the plantation that I would be here I am here very mind capacity as a public relations consultant and in my professional opinion as someone that 's head reasonable significant experience in fact a number of consultation engagement matters as I 've set out and as I mentioned that someone that was pleased to be involved with a group of a successful overturning the government 's decision on Victoria Square there I believe I come with some experience and knowledge to provide someone I hope is constructive observations with respect to what I consider is a an important way forward for Cathedral Square that right now they rushed so as I have set out I consider that the three weeks set aside for the public engagement three we generate for the planed real developments of Cathedral Square is totally totally inadequate now as a company open engage and expert for example over traffic engineering metals with a meaningful submission and you give them just three weeks how does a voluntary organization meet with its members on this important matter and submit and a meaningful and fully informed submission in the consultation document is woefully inadequate than providing essential background information that I 'll refer to a little bit later on we generate christchurch interesting lead claim and their engagement principle was to be respectful and what people and communities at the centre of what they are about I respectfully submit that we generate cry Church on this occasion is being disrespectful when you consider the efforts required to make a submission within the time frame they had set and with the significant limitations of the information that your basic meaningful submission on the generate Christchurch is running late as we know with their June consultation and we now have obviously a shortened opportunity to be engaged but I would argue that this does not say the very important community that has a huge investment in Cathedral Square and we need to stop and pause so what am I tried to do in the last few weeks my head engage with regenerate and I asked for the following a couple of the traffic management analysis supporting that those changes to Cathedral Square and and future visitors in the area an indication of the type of new businesses that regenerate Christchurch and this council expect will establish as a consequence of the proposal as put forward preceding a copy of a business case and budget supporting the proposed changes a list of the property owners and businesses consulted in the preparation of the proposal and a team table for the final consultation on the finished plans and its costings on Tuesday August 1 I received an acknowledgement of my communication to regenerate Christchurch and was advised that my enquiry was being forwarded through to the strategy and regeneration planning team and they would be in contact with me soon after I have received no answer from the generator of the questions writes it out which I 'm sure you 'll appreciate isn 't helpful for someone that is representing clients that may wish to make submissions and in my own case will also as a resident do though do so so I make the filling filling a Chris that I hope you will consider seriously today and that is that I believe this council regenerate to extend the time frame of the engagement by six weeks at the minimum and nine weeks preferable I would also suggest that they need to respond the Chris for information made by people an eternity manner and I suggest they also need to address the inadequacies in the information that isn 't a consultation documentation the improvement issues to us counsel as I see it you a point as I understand half the board of regenerate so when we look at the costs as it reasonable to have an open-ended wishlist without indicating the costs when you 're engaging people the moderate may he playground blew up to forty point nine million and reliable voting construction industry sources have told me an estimated that the redevelopment of Cathedral Square could cost sixteen million dollars or more who do we know will bear that cost the ratepayers and matter of heritage that the Christchurch Square and at subjects vanilla Square Cathedral Square have heritage protection under the district plan the Christchurch City Council being should be ensuring that Cathedral Square which is part of a heritage of our heritage no reference whatsoever and the documentation from regenerate that makes reference to this very important underlying vector the Cathedral Square is someone pointed out to me appears to be healing the direction of a fair ground attraction a business owner observed that regenerates plans appear to be turning cathedral square into a three space circus does only to run as an ongoing carnival to attract for example by people by placing aired hot buildings to hide the Convention Center as I understand this is seriously a legitimate approach to looking at our serious heritage in the city the square and I would argue not so today I would respectfully request that this council regenerate Christchurch and let 's not forget the crown should get together and consider whether in fact that matters I have raised I know other people are worthy of serious consideration under some urgency thank you and thank you very much for that is faking now meeting this morning thanks very much indeed thank you so that brings us to the next item and I would ask James Lundy and general manager of regeneration planning for regenerate going to give us a short presentation on the Cathedral Square and surrounds piece of work so welcome to the table thank you very much indeed for joining us I 've just an I mean you do introduce you you know Carolyn this is a joint this is a joint project between regenerate and the the council and we 've been working collectively with the council 's planning department and other other organizations within the council traffic planning people in the engineering aspects to investigate the square yep thank you thank you I 'll try and keep this short and tight because I know that you 've probably very familiar with thumb that the fine keynotes the title is bringing life to the corner of Christ job City what we 're charge to do is to faint to find a method of delivering the recovery strategy that has been carried out by zero in the square so what we 're trying to do is to find the triggers that will advance the the investment because if you walk around the square you will see that investment has liked and not that were asked to provide a clear well supported vision for the area that builds on the vision that was in the recovery plan identify any planning changes in our statutory policy tools to enable the vision to be implemented recommend immediate initiatives to bring more people into the city reinforce the positive international image of the future city so they 're all based on the recovery plan and we 're here to our organization as there to deliver outcomes from the recovery plan the area that we 're talking about isn 't just Cathedral Square we have gone out with one key issue at the moment which is recognizing that Cathedral Square has always been very important in the city it 's it is iconic for the city and a much overused what but not in this case as an icon of the city and it 's something that 's memorable and internationally it 's a large public space but the area that we can see on dawn is the area and you see the red dot eat the red dotted line and the smaller red red dashed lines that aren 't developed yet or have derelict buildings in them is the area of the city that has responded least since the earthquake that 's the rationale for choosing this area as one of our focused project was given to us and as part of our mandate by government that this is a project we have to focus on along with the red zone so what we built on because we didn 't start from scratch we 've started from a position that 's that 's building on all the work that the council had done before in the square and all the what that seed has done before and since so it 's been that this plan in some ways has been six years in the making at least but probably another ten years before that so share an idea we had a we had a consultant may not information that 's a huge amount of information we pulled out concepts from share an idea and we group them into various categories we did some market research to check a public opinion has changed since year an idea sell project reference group which has a broad representation of the community and also includes councils and we engage directly with property and business owners now have personally spoken to 60 property and business owners with the nuts base over the past two months so we 've had quite a broad spectrum we 've also had seventy thousand viewers of the crash tops dilemmas program we 've had about six hundred responses so far a question in the project reference group I 'm not gonna dwell on them because they 've all devoted a large amount of time to helping to be a litmus test and a touchstone they 're not a decision making group but the group that we bounced ideas and concepts off of and includes of diverse groups such as social and your students and heritage organisations and just people who are really active in the city but also other organizations at the casino in the airport that are really key to the growth of the city the objectives and we 're adding to these as we go through the the consultation breathing life back into Cathedral residential there is a long-standing Mundi that to achieve at least 20,000 residents with the new revenues which would mean trying to achieve about two and a half to five thousand residents within this area and so we are investigating how do we get that to happen with the private sector improving access experience on perceptions strengthening ecological integrity showcasing by cultural stories capturing the spirit in the response to the earthquakes because the city has changed and people have changed how do we respond to that change some of it is positive and it 's no how were defined we want a major award as a city for a street art so how do we keep that going and then there 's another one being added recently by exposure to community groups as that to create an open neighborhood because people that live in a place take ownership over so bringing community back into that area physically that 's it here as you will see the square is only a small part of it but this part of our consultation is focusing on the square not the rest so the way the area the Foskey move is reshaping the square to create a more lively and variety of public spaces reshaping doesn 't mean building out that means dropping objects and if they will enliven it I 'm changing the nature of the species that were around that which is more difficult because most of the spaces around at the moment are in private ownership but we don 't want to go back to the lack of I to abuse on the ground floor that we hide before the earthquake we have to find a way of engaging good example of that as negotiations for the slum the owners of the what will be the new spark building and and it wasn 't hard negotiations they 've volunteered they 've got an arcade on the ground floor of their new office building which will have 500 staff in it they 'll also have a research and development you know and the putting hospitality in retail on the hall ground-floor fronting Harold on the square so that 's the kind of trench warfare that were engaged in you know it owner so this is one touchstone that we 're doing of gauging people 's opinion and appetite for change key move number two is forming the square with structures and buildings to stimulate arts creative enterprises knowledge in education this is purely a concept if the community reacts the extremely negative Church then is a concept that will be revisited and redeveloped but like many species there are always objects that appear these objects wouldn 't be ordinary buildings as no point we have lots of vacant land in the city this would only be if an emerging us came that was going to add to the international profile of the city think of it as your Pompidou Center if that occurred where would it be located what we 're actually talking about things that may only be where we put temporary structures if you want events you don 't want temporary structures in the center of a space you want them on the edge so one of the things that key things that came out from the people who organize events was having an event ready space that when move onto and be used the square has to be used by all sorts of people it 's everybody 's place it 's one partner city where it should be totally inclusive rich who are young old s ethnic diversity there are very few other places and cities other than the center where everybody needs to be felt welcomed the the next key move because I 'm gonna go through the photos quite quickly so concentrating the key moves so improving connectivity to through in around the area the area started out life as a park Wrigley square then the cathedral developed then Colombo Street was put through has gone through a number of changes through times but for most of its life it was a transit hump it was the trums Cayman is where the bosses kimmm and along with them came active uses like cinemas restaurants cafes bars and then eventually hotels and various other things so that was the pot Basava changing nature of traffic and transport and the changing nature of development left us in the year 2000 with a problem in the square that wasn there was an attempt to create a new purpose in the new use in 2004 the square will be visiting not given everything that 's happened and seeing where do we take it now what 's its purpose I think its main purpose and the research we 've done as it is still a hub it has to be a hope it 's the center of town it 's where everything and connects and distributes so the green lines show network of lanes that largely exist or are being built at the moment and we 're proposing new lanes so that basically you can walk seamlessly through from all the shops in casual through a networker lens and they 're not on the even River corridor and continue on so we 're trying to stretch the whole place together even River corridor Eastern Park a network of of lanes and then the the purple or pink our lanes sure the connections to the wider area that we have to work on that maybe cycling walking or it could be public transport so we 're investigating all these things we 're for people for us including the council 's appetite for this kind of approach so the key move 5 is the reintroduction of water we haven 't had water in that area well actually since the earthquake but we haven 't had water in that area since it was developed so now what we 're looking at is water but we 're talking about water as a story in a metaphor water that deals ecologically was thought it 's systems that deal ecologically the stormwater reintroducing of natural vegetation the reintroduction of natural WOD life through that because we 've got the even River corridor which we 're going into the red zone and large areas of of wetland and bush so extending our idea of wetland and a natural vegetation to complement the the next vegetation along the even River corridor and also the next vegetation exists already in the square weather initiatives that were looking at as the kind of businesses that would locate here how do we get residential to what we have no lot success with hotels the hoteliers are waiting for a key number of are telling us there is they 're waiting to the convention center contracts and knows which is very soon they would like to see some movement on the cathedral they 're all things that we all know and they would like to see the public realm improved because most people would think it 's okay haven 't_''_1607.8 been there I walk through it every day I 've got a team on there at the moment looking at it as a design team is quite broken the public realm regardless of what happens that needs to be lifted and replaced it 's just one of these things that you have in cities it 's ongoing maintenance of public areas we 're also looking at existing committed existing and committed off streetcar parking and the potential for more off streetcar parking so we 're investigating that how do how do you deliver it who delivers it where where should it be and how do we future-proof the buildings for the time when maybe we don 't need so many car parts pieces when we 've got a more compact more density with where people do use cars so there no other things that are happening the library 's open in about a year 's time Town Hall 's opening a year 's time Convention Center opening three years time those hotels already open in their spark building opening of a year 's time we will see a very much transformed place in three years time this will be a transformed city centre and and and the Joomla chrome from my point view the Performing Arts Center this will have more theaters within one strip than anywhere outside major European cities or American cities nowhere else in Australia will have seven of formal spaces within one urban block and that is a unique selling point us yes Utley you 'll get in London 's West and dropped into the center of Christchurch so reshaping the square gaping different purposes these are just ideas Norbit in the right mind with design places that work pink green and yellow and purple they are actually to illustrate uses and areas obviously all these areas have to integrate you don 't you know we used to put up in houses where every room of a different every part on carpet we rip them all out and we put a plain carpet and to unify and then we dress and decorate it with objects and artwork and possessions and open spaces are no different this is what we 're looking at no to bring us back to a sense of reality so we 're looking here at the mode this is how it looks there 's the reward that goes round to say there 's the convent violence of the land for the Convention Center site and we can see the Millennium Hotel which is going to open in about a year 's time as a distinction Hotel look at the rendezvous hotel and we 've got the Nortel there we 've got the the spark building we built in our area and the Town Hall will be restored so it could look something more like that but it may look very different but we have to reach that level of standard to be an international player or even a national player again again we 've missed out that again but more than that we need to welcome our own citizens bike into the centre and it 's happening spend assault city centre is outperforming the other key activity centres no and that 's a good point and of course we need an eight-team environment one of the things that is quite distinct between a neighbourhood area like reggaeton creativity center and the city centre is a nighttime economy and we need an eight-time economy in any city if you want to keep your young and you want to keep your old they have to have an 8 economy and if you want to keep the best and the brightest you have to create a vibrant city for them because there 's a lot competition out there my name Aldous daughters gone to Sydney I 'd like to see a comeback here so how how the inner core it looks the library with so and this shorts really Odette notes coming on phenomenally the library no and how the library will look and a particular dedicated space we 've alerted here because we haven 't actually come up is done under the excessive accessible cities program we 're still falling that program but still in place but that anticipated an extended rapid transit and public transport system so we 're looking at how would that look where would you put it then we look at how the current area looks at the moment this is the area remember it said smart building built in a year 's time potentially a year year and a half we 've got the distinction hotel opening in a year 's time this is their their view at the moment this could be their view because the not other research people said they wanted a green space they wanted more vegetation they were water so this is me this these are merely illustrations that are showing what some people have asked for we will then distill through this engagement a design that actually ties it all together so framing up would repeat buildings in that space they 're not to hide the Convention Center the Convention Center is part of the square it hasn 't got an act of age to the square a hotel and that 's illustrated there so what we 're seeing is there could be temporary there could be transitional architecture there could be anything there but if the circus came to town again which it used to look here in the square there are lots of photos of when misako 's went into the square if the suckers came to town again we may not put them in you 'd put them on the edge we have the best species in the world have active edges people cling to the edges they don 't walk through the middle the middle is where you have performances and activities parking I 'm not going to go through that you 're well aware you 're probably more aware of parking than I am but the the the deeper part poll shows two minute walk from a car park so coverage in that area that the the blue circles are a maximum four minute walk from car park buildings you will notice that we 've put in the the Performing Arts Center car park because it 's not built yet we haven you put on top of blue young we haven 't put a deep blue circle around it and then there 's the other one which is in the old ridges hotel and they 're going to rebuild their car park building that will cover that area so the area will be covered with off street car parking and quite generous amount of off street car parking there is another issue that onmyoji so may as well see it because it 's quite it 's coming out of all the discussions I talked to CBB ear last night went to their meeting top the issue really is free car parking for a length of time it 's not the number of car parks it 's it 's a perception of paying for car parks and that 's a different debate to have that 's a debate for them to have with council and private car park corners and retailers so the old one is upgrading the streets and lanes between the activity Hobbs one of the things that we 've indicated does that the new Regent Street I struggled on an lane that stretches right down from the retail district right across the river as the opportunity of being really well connected to a network Elaine 's that Tom 's our entire Main Street for a residential population so we secure the future of these lanes by the activities are random integrating water and indigenous ecosystems and the streets and public spaces not had much kick back about that idea most people like it most people like green most people one species to relax weather initiatives we 're going to look at get to understand the land use requirements and regulator in policy changes that might be needed what investment and incentives may be required how species can be activated in the short and the medium term because we may not see full Bongo for one thought for some length of time but we can 't live with it in the conditions that then at the moment so we 're looking at activation strategies and how the strategy could be implemented with actions timeframes priorities and the sort of level of financing and investment needed and what sort of return the i rapidly went through it as quickly as I could happy to take questions yeah we actually don 't have time for any questions unfortunately but thank you very much indeed for you know what 's been a very visual presentation certainly been good I know a number of us have seen a similar presentation or maybe the same presentation that at other events but certainly it 's being good for that to be presented in a very public environment today and in front of us that are here thank you very much indeed for taking the time to do so now thank you now on aware that there are people here this morning who are on time constraints we do have a deputation by appointment from Michael Bailey 's is Michael here what I propose to do if we can Michael is to take item ten which is the Linwood central Heath Community Board report to Council first which should be a relatively short item and then move to your deputation if that 's all right the the chair of that board has got an appointment that she needs to get to so on _"

    "text": "visually outcomes and strategic priorities that I 'd like to move this and second of as Andrew and I mean do people have any questions because I know that M once to raise an issue which I think we can deal with by way of amendment but are there any other there any questions that people want to ask right and would you like to move your Amendment thank you just there it would be great to see children 's as well as youths well-being and voice being prioritized and so this citywide strategic plan for children young people as part of this so we wondered about putting an under strong communities strong sense of community valuing the voice of children and young people is a as an addition for a separate line so if we could do that well what I think that does is I mean that the intention that set behind the the council 's vision was to add the words for all Christchurch as a city of opportunity for all and that means that it 's for children it 's for older people it 's for for people of different abilities you know so it 's for all and the expression for all really it was intended to capture there but if we are going to consult on the community outcomes as part of the the whole engagement process around a prelim to the LTP and the LTP itself but by adding in a specific line about about actively hearing the voice they are children and young people then it does create that sense of you know the intention it 's the value that comes from doing there there is a community outcome yeah if the community is a whole values the voice of children and young people in terms of any decision-making that affects the city then it 's go to outcome yeah yep we had admitted me even we can add it into the community outcomes right happy to see can I happy to agree with it and Sikandar what if they forgot okay right but I mean I 'm I 'm happy to include it and I just including the make sure you know it 's the resolution yep did you have a of of units within the council and the function of that group is to give effect to the priority our strategic priorities in to find ways to better align our overall strategic direction and work programs so over time I think you 'll find that things start to align much more than they do now and you 'll see linkages across the organization that perhaps aren 't there at the moment do something we have to drop something but we have today many choruses any like it actually work out yeah and counselors amita increase priority when they suddenly knew reduce the products yeah I don 't know that this paper is designed to answer that question in which will be presented to Council so read the whole sentence it will be presented to Council so it 's coming back to us and that 's the appropriate time the strategy we program is one part of a bigger work program so what I heard get in say is that we 're aligning our current work to see how that fits in with these various areas and then as new work know that we 're getting in the same direction so the inferences that as you make resolutions about new things that you want done they 'll be under these different directions and priorities it 'd be unlikely that you 'd be wanting things and that are outside of this but we do have a current route program in the works happening across the organization and see we 're at that center here to support that direction sorry represent win so that alignment of the work program which is ongoing counselor your Hanson 's asking when will that come to council well an initial work program will come to you is then later on this year and that will be presented as as part of the LTP process if you like but that will include some things that are already planned and budgeted and some things that are already planned and budgeted but we may be able to tweak if you like to read it more towards the strategic priorities and they will inevitably be some proposed new work that the council can then approve or not at that point and spoke to you in this work program and that 's fine we can just work with that later on all right well I 'll speak to this because I did ask for the still on the table since I wasn 't here last week and that was simply so that I could articulate why I think this is very important and why I want this to be in place for us to develop the long term plan obviously the number of community outcomes has shrunk considerably it has been a good process that has enabled us to capture the elements of I think there were over 60 of them before and we 've managed to narrow them down into these into these areas but the strategic priorities enable us to set a direction over the next three years which is the active period of the long term plan enabling active citizenship and connected communities is actually about ensuring that people are engaging and not only with each other but with us as decision-makers in a way that actually creates a sense of well that citizens are not you know they not requiring a citizenship certificate but I 'm talking about people who live here work here who want to have it 's about enabling a relationship that doesn 't see them as as ratepayers or consumers of services that we provide but really partners and we become enablers and facilitators and supporters of initiatives that come from our communities that 's what enabling active citizenship and connected communities is all about maximizing opportunities develop a vibrant prosperous and sustainable 21st century City we 've we 've been gifted this opportunity that has come with the disaster that we have experienced and you know I thought I 've truly believed that we don 't honor the lives that were lost unless we take advantage of the opportunity that has has come with that and I really want us to maximize the opportunities to develop this as a city not only for the people who live here but people who will live here in the future as the expression that no tahu always use it 's for our children and our children 's our children after them so in their children after about this that isn 't enough that we just want to provide for the for the elements of carbon reduction we want to lead the way we want to take a leadership position and you know if and I keep repeating the fact that my favorite book has Benjamin Barba 's you know if me is ruled the world and the only reason that it 's such an excellent book is it 's not about me ruling the world it 's about recognizing the fact that nation states or the borders that exists between nations cannot stop things like pen demyx and global terrorism and even the global financial crisis that they cross country 's borders freely and the only protection that really can exist in terms of building resilience to such events comes at the city level with a community level so that 's why it 's so vital that we take a leadership role informed and proactive approaches to national natural hazards risks you know we have we are in a vulnerable environment we have endorsed today in a particular approach around an all-hazards environment that is absolutely 've set you know I 've said on many occasions that I 'm disappointed at the lack of guidance that is coming from central government in terms of the in terms of some of the natural hazard approaches and some of the scientific data that supports a particular viewer and in terms of climate change but they have but but we must continue because we are in a vulnerable environment and we need to take informed and proactive approaches to respond to that increasing active public and shared transport opportunities and use you know I went on to the Joint Committee for a reason I want us to be leading the way it 's very hard to do that when you don 't own the routes or the responsibility for actually consulting with the community about where the buses go and for me that 's a that 's a real detriment we don 't have a joined-up approach where both the routes that the contracts the that the type of you know bustles that we might use them and we obviously have an ambition to get to electric so that and so but it 's really hard to do that when we 're only responsible for the for the road corridors and and the in the bus shelters and not for the actual public transport system and then safe and sustainable water supply and improve waterways this is not last by any means and it 's certainly not least it is absolutely vital to who we are as a city that we have a safe and sustainable water supply and that their ambition that we have is to have our waterways and pristine condition and I mean even some of the discussions that we had today with the zone committees indicate a real desire around this table to see change happen the last thing I just want to say is that we 've got an overarching principle of partnership I had preferred citizenship but it 's the same thing it 's about how we engage with each other and the supporting principles not only apply to how we as a council operate but also how the organization operates and responded to the citizens of Christchurch accountability affordability agility equity innovation and Trust and I end on that word trust because it is absolutely vital that we we not only I made this comment to the community boards last night that there is a lack of trust and governments be they central government or local government but actually when you analyze what 's really going on that governments have lost the ability to trust the people and that is what we need to reclaim as a city so I 'll hand over to whoever else would like to speak on this bill it 's really um it 's probably a Christian life there 's just so much good stuff endless there 's no doubt in my mind I just want to clarify around that when the draft long-term plan goes out to consultation and this is like the framework will we also be asking citizens and residents to comment on a framework the overall view we we 're going to include that in the consultation yeah yep thanks Mike thank you um this add up to thank Emir actually for leadership as we 've developed this this framework it 's actually to actually leave this city moved forward to really actually become like this of a true prosperous and livable and strong strong city I just wanted to uh and obviously at the same time this is not going to take away from the the core services that we actually provide which really is our bread and butter but I just want to touch on the strategic priorities for a second and it 's when you look at them there 's actually a strong lean towards the the environment on on for for the six and so I want to look at climate change because obviously we do need to be strong and be true leaders with climate change and we 're seeing globally cities that are taken the challenge to respond to climate change it actually it helps the local economy so I 'm hoping as we move forward and we use this framework as a benchmark that we do set some strong targets I want the city to be carbon neutral I want the council to become carbon neutral before the city does we 've just had a debate we obviously don 't need to have public consultation on so I hope moving forward that we as a council set a target for this organization and in the city to be carbon neutral and I hope that happens soon right um there was no one else was here all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's Kerry _"

development indicators the quarterly monitoring report just a question of searches so living wage that 's fine at 30 and it is lunch at 45 so this 15 minutes okay yes the commitment that was made by the mayor was that we would start living wage at 30 just so people in public gallery of got some expectation as to when we 'll do that okay oh yeah thank you okay so I 'm fighting 12 urban development indicators so this is a quarterly monitoring report is there any staff comment on this as we move into this item is shall we in an national policy statement came into it on that urban development capacity came into effect on December last year and it imposes a several requirements on councils including the requirements to prepare to monitor and urban development indicators so the Greater Christchurch partnership has started doing that monitoring monitoring report attached to this report that has been considered by the partnership committee upon which the mayor and councillors Clearwater and Templeton set and they resolved to endorse that monitoring report and to refer to all the partner councils for their endorsement and publication so we 're looking for that today and also we 're essentially seeking our delegation to staff to continue to monitor in that general way in that general framework on a quarterly basis in accordance with the national policy statement whilst making improvements to it over time we emphasize that this is a first attempt at monitoring and preparing the monitoring report and that is being informed by various sources and some of the data is very limited or hasn 't been tested for its robustness so there 's some caution around the DA that 's India but despite those limitations and elope and the reliability potential reliability issues we 're recommending that it 's a good starting point and it should fit should be endorsed indeed so thank you for that I just had a question and maybe it just relates to my own I didn 't really understand what that meant does that mean that this quarterly report won 't be reported back to Council in future or does it mean that there 's work will be done by the Greater Christchurch partnership committee that hasn 't been done in this case in fact I didn 't really understand what the close story was meaning we 're trying to get consistency with the resolutions between all the partnering agents say so that 's where they come from but essentially what it 's suggesting is that the monitoring report as it as it will go it 'll be published it is already on the Greater Christchurch partnership website but it just enables staff to continue to update that on the portal basis and not have to come back every every quarter to Council okay know that your that makes them say yeah so will we so will will this be reported to Council on a quarterly basis not withstanding like we 'll continue to see this report we just put up on the website and it 's up to us to go and look it would just be on the website but we do report on land supply issues I think on an annual basis generally so this work will feed into that reporting all rights are sensing that there may be some around the table have got a particular view on that and I 'm glad that you 've explained it clearly so that people are able to take a view so we 'll now move to questions so Glen and then yani Glen thank thank you for this information a lot of it I think is very good and we 're looking to set up a housing subcommittee so it could be that could be a place for it to land as well given a lot of it is over housing I just have a couple of questions over one is on page 309 under notes and it says about the ham housing affordability measure it calculates what the residual income would be after housing costs if they would apply odds so what is that residual income as at City Percy given that affordability is based on 50% of your I may that but my understanding is that there was there is a magic number this is a an MB indicator and the magic number I understand is to have something like six hundred and sixty two dollars left over after housing costs are taken out so that 's that 's the magic number if you didn 't have 662 dollars after those housing costs you would be how do you you 'd be in that it 's unaffordable probably the percentage because they 're a good to match this up with their own housing policy which the council adopted so what you know percentage that six hundred actually represents won 't be good to know yeah it 's about trying to match it with other council selling my neck as well so we need to that 's why we using their MV one cuz that Doug provided data across councils in a consistent manner so if I may follow up do you can you give me a percentage on what that residual figure is is it seventy percent well we can looked at okay yeah if I can ask just another point near death Ward 's the bottom says other factors that may have an impact on will reliability of this measure such as only using the lower quartiles dwelling price detecting what we have in our policy and you know or lower quartile affordability yet it 's being seen as having an impact on the reliability I just wonder why that 's the mean yesterday is only indicated the rationale behind it is not clearly understood by us at this point and we have got questions that have gone back to in between being about how it 's arrived in time what actually means that 's why we 've cautioned use of it in be have asked us to or prepared a number of indicators to put in this report which is what the partnership have done so just understanding that a bit more is on our as on their agenda so could be very understanding and outs of affordability will differ so yeah yeah okay thank you all right thank you no I 'm not sure Yanni oh thanks um but I see on page 15 314 that you there you 've got indicators to help improve understanding regarding housing affordability and homeownership levels I 've been really came to see some indicators around home ownership and also who owns how much it 's one thing that we don 't have any information on so you know in terms of I don 't know if we can get information around for example how many how many houses and homes are being owned by investors versus versus not for how many properties per person and what the bands are and also whether we can monitor the density of social housing that 's existing and what the trends are so I just wanted to ask if we can get some indicators around that yeah it is really difficult to get reliable information on a lot of these things so it will be you know ongoing dialogue with the central government in particular to to try and pull together good sources of information for those sort of things to get a good picture so we 'll certainly look at what we can do it is quite difficult to get information on home are you know it 's really quite difficult to get some soup doing around through the chair I thought the government had bought into the new rig banking regulations around investors for housing so that they should the banks should have some quite good data now that we didn 't have previously but that okay the social housing I mean the the size of social housing that 's been fill and location and the density is that is especially free yes so part of the housing assessment there 's part of the MPs that these monitoring indicators will inform more look at social housing and what 's being provided and what is what has been demanded so will pick up that kind of information and that can include geographic yeah in special making yeah this monitoring of indicators is one of the requirements of the national policy statement another requirement is to prepare a housing and business land capacity assessment and that can involve looking at you know the distribution and type of housing and location and where the demanders and that sort of thing right and sorry just both that we have a huge oversupply of industrial and commercial and possibly residential land so is there any sort of outcome of now we know that this is the case there 's any sort of outcome in terms of what we should be doing either through land zoning district planning policies in terms of provision of infrastructure or or other sort of interventions to deal with this issue so in terms of this report and the data that 's on that I guess another caution about it is that in Jason perhaps can explain more about the vacant land register but it doesn 't look about it looks at total and total housing but it hasn 't gone as far as working out whether or not that capacity is feasible as required under the national policy statement so that piece of work will be undertake as part of the housing and business link capacity assessment so I don 't look at total supply of business and housing land and then test whether it 's feasible so these numbers could come down quite a bit and it 's only once we convince that I 'm asking the questions in terms of what does it mean and what should we do should we respond time just a clarification on national haven 't haven 't we done that through the district plan review we 've we 've spent a huge amount of money analysis expertise and understanding where loan can be zoned and I would have thought that those decisions would have been based on the feasibility of it so how is this different to what we 've just done the requirements under the national policy statement are much more onerous and some feasibility work was undertaken as part of a district plan review but not in terms of industrial and commercial a little bit in terms of residential so it 's more onerous requirements under the policy statement and we 're looking at a different time frame as well because the national policy statement asks us to look out 30 years whereas the district plan land supplies or 10 years effectively so if we may add as well that the feasibility that the NPS directs us to assess is actually developer feasibility or infrastructure any other council related type work it 's actually about whether accountant a developer will make their 20 or 30 percent margins over the top when developing that land so that 's a piece of work that I think there was some work done at that level and district plan review but this is quite specifically directed at developer feasibility from the NPS point of view so there 'll be looked at and reported back to Council as part of the housing them and business land capacity assessment at the end of the year and there 's no sorry just um there 's no environmental analysis as part of the environmental feasibility or um there is a and the phase of it aspect or inter feasibility for a start in terms of you know G ot that sort of thing it 's quite comprehensive and also Elaine has to be serviced so infrastructure capacity and all of those sort of things that come into it as well thank you be just the stuff on page 309 310 310 particularly available on there a chain by index forehand by and just the water tracks and how it tracks it and then your paragraph it says that the start of page 310 while the improvement in housing affordability is positive the level of improvement could have been considered small against the significant increase in land supply which is the most being another just sort of credo of the government in terms of landscape course affordability and then you go on to indicate a couple of other major problems with the indicator that 's based on 100% mortgage whereas you can 't buy a house with a hundred percent mortgage for even if you 're living in it and the fact that they had the interest rate wrong and a range of other things and so I 'm wondering actually how helpful it is because it seemed to me when I read it that it was based on an interesting envy theoretical formula which was probably derived in Auckland and then when you applied it here the theory didn 't work and the actual numbers didn 't actually they hadn 't given you the right numbers either so I was actually you on there in terms of the caution that should be applied to it but it is what MB have developed for this particular purpose for monitoring this measure but my understanding is that the partnership monitoring team who are people working to appear the next monitoring report and will continue to have dialogue within be around the appropriateness of their indicator and what it means so all of our affordability measures measured on incorrect percentages incorrect interest rates and a land supply theory which may or may not be true outside of Auckland it 's a wee bit worrying well the land supply information that we 've got as I know as us quite real but what what what you indicate on page three one sorry three 100 at the top is that actually given a huge amount of green fields and brown fields extra zoning the affordability should have come down according to the theory of land supply equals affordability of housing it certainly does raise questions in terms of a relationship but it 's a lot of these indicators do they raise more questions than anything and them I mean there 's a lot of in dependencies between them and you can 't look at one in isolation necessarily for another and with them there 's a lot more analysis that will need to go into it I mean it is a first start and it really is pulling together a whole lot of disparate information to comply with the in piece requirement and and the viewers and the expectation of central government is that ilysm as it is a first step and to build on that and get better in it and understand it and get better information over time so it is a product of its time and I can 't really say any more than that so given this clearly this is reported to council as of the first quarterly monitoring report the intention clearly from what we just heard about and paragraph three is that future reports wouldn 't be reported to council although given the comments that you 've just made around there 's been a work in progress and a report that 's very much still in in development and you the thinking around reporting this one to council and not reporting future reports I 'm assuming to this council or other councils we certainly could do this I guess the view is not much more have change for when we do the partnerships clarify this is a partnership undertaking is the next report up not much will have changed so coming back in a few months to say exactly the same thing I mean it may well be that a longer reporting the time frame might be maybe on a six monthly basis six monthly or annual basis yep for monthly three tons of you and I mean a little bit like the the zone committees who we heard from earlier we did have them coming to talk to us every two months and now the thinking is that quarterly might be good if we went every four months and then we found that that was too much we could always drop back to six monthly as there was a level of confidence that there weren 't gonna be made to changes and as there was a level of confidence this is a quarterly report so oh yeah of course yeah so really three months or six months would be the the choice yeah yep okay Sarah so a suggestion that we we do continue to receive so that the quarterly report continued to be reported to Council and if at some point we realized that there 's minimal change or we 're so comfortable with what 's in there that we no longer require that obviously that 's a change that could be made at that time but initially to bring that report to council quarterly by way of information you know I don 't think we 're looking for are we looking for the ability to endorse that no but I think if we 're like water is one of our key you can do things your housing is one of our key things so I think getting this information I mean there 's really interesting information in here for example the fact that actually the land costs and so on and Waimea cannot radically lower than in crash suit city which is really interesting and probably goes mess of information I enjoyed reading it I thought it was a really interesting report even if I didn 't believe most of what in beast and exists and we 're based on and I think getting it every three months would be really helpful so maybe if we had a paragraph for here that says that the the future quarterly monitoring reports yeah the council requests that future mr. chair just the quarterly reports will be reported back to the partnership on a quarterly basis and we should be reporting what happens at the partnership or the minutes of the partnership back to Council so peps the the need for an additional resolution might be some perf loss if that is already in place so you would bring this report to us as part of that reporting which is already occurring well I think the idea and we discussed this last week at the ite committee there 's a few regional and sub-regional committees which we 've got a number of counselors that sit on and the need to make sure that whatever happens at those committees has formerly and that the great positive partnership is one of those and we would be looking to report the minutes back from that back to Council war or pips the strategy and what 's in that they adopted the report yes yes though well that 's not helpful I think oh you 'd look are you talking about wanting to endorse it or what we would certainly look to attach that as well so I wouldn 't just be the minutes itself so yeah yeah so maybe if we had here request that future monitoring reports be reported to Council on quarterly basis and if the method of doing that was by way of the existing reporting which you 're already doing or there 's already happening from that from the Greater Christchurch partnership then that would fulfill the resolution in any case would nice yes so if we just keep it broad request that the quarterly monitoring report be reported to Council on a quarterly basis and if that 's by way of reporting that comes out of the great Christchurch partnership well so be it therefore there is no expressed by Vickie and by Sara his picks up so that we actually actively have this put in front of us rather than needing for example to go to the website and look at it I think that 's that sort of picks up the the thinking yeah yeah take your Andrew I 'm just thinking like there 's a lot of feeling over this could it go through say the proposed housing subcommittee for good going over because we have our own measures of affordability which don 't match that for instance this or not at this stage and we might want to find a way to have us kind of like a conversation over there and then we yeah so I mean housing is only a part of this oh yeah and of course the housing subcommittee is perfectly entitled to put on its agenda whatever it wants to put on its agenda so you know if you wanted to have a discussion about this or any other report as long as it sits within you terms of reference there 's no reason why you couldn 't put Oh across all three districts has actually decreased over the last ten years which is almost counterintuitive to what you would have expected it 's actually interesting yeah all right well thank you very much indeed for the answers to the questions certainly there 's been some some useful discussion there and so we 've got a resolution in front of us do we have a move up Glen will move Aaron will second all those is there any debate all those in favor against that 's carried _"

    "text": "it was sorry I 'm just a teen okay so there so just just by way of introduction and it 's difficult to introduce the paper as the chair of a committee as I will because there wasn 't a recommendation from the strategic capability committee but I just I just wanted to give an overview which was while it 's very keen to be here when this was debated the living wage as you know as as stated to feed the hourly wage a worker needs to pay for the necessities of life and participate as an active citizen and the community that reflects the basic expenses of workers and their families such as food transportation housing and childcare and as calculated under pendant Li each year by the New Zealand family seemed to her social policy unit Ellen Freeman who implemented the living wage for the Greater London Council spoke to the spoke of the letter to dignity that a living wage provides for working people and their families and it was really interesting to talk to Ellen when he was here the movement began from faith communities that 's why in some jurisdictions that 's called the family supporting wage New Zealand has got undergone a radical change since the 1980s the loss of a statutorily protected wage fixing system and nearly a decade of no increase in the minimum wage in the 1990s has had a major impact on New Zealand I 'm not surprised that the living wage movement has found a welcome here in the UK it was not the council 's that were asked to adopt the living wage first targeted industries were security hospitality retail higher education clean and thin local government they went to the stock exchange first and then to the ethical banks it was all very well to want to present a compelling story internationally about if the core investments and have no commitment to ethical wages that allow a family to live in dignity the impact was immediate but in considering that and the context of who would benefit from the past this resolution today indicates that here does not focus solely on a family supporting wage which is why I 've come to think of it as that within our budget if we adopt a policy that requires the gap to be minimized toward three different rates of increase applied over different salary bans can bring the bottom rates up while reducing the rate of increase at the top but without bringing salary levels down as some have suggested would be appropriate I don 't accept that I don 't think that you can ask people to take a pay cut in order to increase other 's pay and I think that the adjustment process that I 'm proposing would be something that would be generally supported and would not see an increase in our rates impact but it seems to me that what 's missing here is the procurement story and that 's why I 'm going to move an amendment myself we need a procurement policy that supports a living wage Ellen reminded me how important research was to support this the efficiency gains that they had measured in the UK our higher productivity and lower turnover and staff which meant a 25% reduction and staff management costs through lower recruitment costs and reduced absenteeism should have an additional report to support a consideration of how the living wage would apply to when we procure contractors to do work for us and and that 's why we need to have a five-year horizon and I think that was his suggestion in terms of measuring the impact and seeing the difference that it makes because ultimately a 25% reduction in staff management costs applying through lower recruitment costs and reduced absenteeism actually is something that we can claim as an investment not a cost so I 'm very supportive of this paper coming to Council I 'm very keen for us to and a 1 today I do want us to look at our procurement policies and I 'd like to now as the chair of the committee open it up to questions of staff and I want to ask their questions to staff be focused on the technical aspects not the policy issue that I have spoken to so technical questions to staff did you do you have that Aaron okay we 'll come back to that in a minute I 'm Flynn and then begins one of the major considerations of adopting the living wage is the ongoing future costs would it be fair to say that that 's a consideration of whatever tier of pay within the organization yes what we 've done is provided the costs our estimated costs for on an annual basis but that doesn 't take into consideration other as some of the facilities as we bring facilities on and what costs will be borne from there so it 's just that you know recognizing that it 's not a one-off cost it as a continuous cost for me so then we have on that basis is a continuous cost we have that kind of provision built in for those above what we 're proposing here yes so we as part of the LTP have a budgets or forecasts of budget for all personnel costs the salary and wages for the whole organization Phil thank you for the report Emmitt and the work that all the work that 's been done up I just want to ask you about the issue of sustainability in terms of particularly in the may not be sustainable in its full form and and there 's no reference so in the report to the sustainability of high salaries just wondering if you might explain so when we look at salary wages we sort of look at what the market rates are so our current remuneration approaches to look at market rates and also looking at performance so it 's just about if we are operating within the existing budgets the impact on being able to pay people you know maintain market rates as opposed to requiring ongoing funding to ensure that those market rates are maintained just a follow-up question does that normal so they 'll apply then toe to the higher salaries and salaries overall yeah we 're looking absolutely I mean we 're always having to look at how we fund the whole selling wages not judge use Andrew thank you option one in the paper we 're told that that would include that would create an increase of seven hundred seventy five thousand annually with an additional 400 to 500 thousand of additional op x so that and i just wanted four hundred five hundred thousand per annum yes that 's right okay and my understanding also and again I 'm just seeking clarification to make sure I 've got this correct obviously there would be a time taken to fully implement living wage if option one were supported today my understanding is that any effect of that in this financial year could be absorbed within existing operational budgets but the effect of that net increase of four hundred to five hundred thousand would first take effect in the first year of the long term plan yep that 's correct so because this year it would not be for the full year it would be sort of a partial implementation we believe that on balance we could have saw that in this financial year within for the first unit EPB they were full amount thank you I guess my question arising from my statement for is that if there were kept in terms of how this has been applied because it 's absorbed in the first year so we don 't have to worry about this financial year the first year address it presumably you would be able to start looking at how you negotiate because I mean I keep saying that 10% of a mouse versus 10% of an elephant if you give a flat wage increase then obviously people at the bottom can come up and people at the top do not go up as much as they 're able to be absorbed in that way I haven 't proposed that arrangement so staff are on a range between collective agreements which we have with a range of unions including ESA in each other and here today supporting the living wage concept in individual employment agreements so contractually to change those agreements to what which would be a fundamental move to mobile way from a percentage based increase to a fixed increase would be a measure of negotiation with individuals for oh I sinned with representatives for collective agreements yeah but we could ask you to do that you can ask us to do it we want to give you some advice on the pros and cons on the merits or otherwise of that approach though I know that cup of years as we 've been looking at this as having two rates of percentage increase a higher rate of percentage increase at the lower end in a in a higher rate lower rate of percentage increase at the top end yeah absolutely and that 's been their counsels approach for a long time and in addition to that we have a position and range so people they will tend to start in a lower position in range work your way up and we give greater increase images as people working their way up to provide greater incentive for people to reach the desired position and range which is typically around ninety five to a hundred percent I know that with some of the CCO will see CTO they do start people on a lower rate if they haven 't had any training and then use that as a training rate to lift them up to a trained level but I don 't think anyone 's under the living wage when you look at it at the trained level is that for within the CCO for within one so in a training role and who are earning less than the living wage at Council currently there 's a degree of envy the sort of the profile that we 've described in the paper and they sort of a quite I mean I guess it 's not so much that their training they 're really sort of developing their competencies and so we expect that people in the first sort of one to two years of their work here will then sort of reach a level of what we would deem fully competent how much public consultation is the council done on the living wage we have no need public institutions thank you Aaron miniature I 'd like to move an option I 'd like to move up from one place it I would see condemned [Music] inhibitive you you 're immune Ventus here the order addition the amendment that I 've got is that the council report to the sorry just lost it the strategic capability Committee on the procurement policy amendments that would be required to ensure that contractors are paid at the living wage and or canceled would be I guess on council to what the impact would be on current council finances would it be council finances yeah no no dogs and your council your hints and here 's another amendment saying that the council request a report within three months on how the living wage could be extended to council vcos in CCT oh that doesn 't talk up people who for example are our own cleaners than the buildings that we operate so but but they 're two separate amendments you 're happy to see second up okay keep him here and we already have a mover and seconder for the other one I just like the signal in a moment Thanks yep there the council grazing principle to adopt a living wage over a period so adopt the living wage subject to public consultation through the long term plan process okay so so that 's fully adopt the current living that the council of gray and principle to fully adopt the current living wage yep subject along to 73 consultation through the long through the long term planning process into scan drug-seeking space stop there in a novice living wage through the long term billion process right good could I ask you a question and a turf of clarification and relations amendments so that your first amendment that you moved is that is that like an amendment to option one in addition in addition in addition Thurston you too and I think well Yanni 's the new tip knew you too and I 'm a new three councillor Davidson 's amendment is well no it 's not a foreshadow motion because it really should be voted on first because it is an amendment of fully adopting the current living wage now that says we 've we 've fully adopted a you know subject to public consultation through the long term plan process but it 's yeah so rather than I mean the trouble was the the work that at the moment fully adopt the current living wage doesn 't say immediately and it would be replace the word immediately worth subject to public consultations through the long term plan process that 's how it would in fact let 's just change the wording current living wage you know it 's all immediately immediately if you can put it immediately just let I 'm sure just pulled out in the sectional report on the complementation of this additionally a matter of negotiating their collectives we 're not I wouldn 't expect challenges and implementing this that we wouldn 't be immediate is and staff wouldn 't get paid twenty dollars twenty in the next pay run it would be or the further collectives or if we can otherwise I mean the collectives as soon as we could so we 've explained in the implementation section that the collectives expire in September so we 're committing that process they are so just crucial that I wouldn 't want staff be confused when they read that so fully adopt the current living wage in accordance with the in accordance with the what tell me the paragraph of the 9.6 9.6 and accordance what paragraph yes yeah yeah and a coordinates work a nine point ninety point six to nine point yeah nine point this is me on forensics yeah nine point six to nine point eight the paper it sounds good okay in accordance with the implementation section of the staff report and make the that word implementation start with a capital I yep cool thank you right and so the amendment is that the words that to replace in accordance with the implementation section of the staff report worth subject to public consultation through the long term plan process yep that 's the amendment [Music] yeah but it will be subject to public consultation that 's the difference it can essentially only be an an unprincipled decision under those circumstances no I mean no it technically is because is it right from you guys all right with it yep in would be jumping up and down I 'm sure but he 's not here via direct for the adopted principle yeah wasn 't he wasn 't recommending that we put up one of the other options you know it wasn 't a recommendation that we do nothing it wasn 't a recommendation to do the partial it 's a recommendation to fully adopt but subject to public consultation and in fact you don 't you out yep no guys alright so I think that probably the easiest way if there 's no more questions I 'll just yeah process Christian viewers of obviously there 's three amendments up there and a substantive how do you want to deal with this are we gonna speak to a stance on it once or I was gonna say that it would make sense to have an overarching debate and deal with Davidson amendment first okay and then we will deal with councilor Johansson 's amendment and my amendment and then we 'll deal with the substantive motion but we 'll have one overarching debate rather than several different debates but one of those options passes there was other amendments go there they know the Army 's that and my one makes note as my my one 's not impacted by the passing of the First Amendment it 's go ahead yep not the American Constitution all right so so are we clear that the the overarching motion is adopting the current living wage in accordance with the implementation section of the staff report there is an amendment that through the long term plan process and there is a request for a report and a request again for a report all right now I 'm not going to support councilor Yang Hansen 's amendment yes I know but I don 't agree with us for something that is not something that it could produce very unintended consequences in my view so there 's no point me supporting it so is the movie you can start the debate Thank You Erin yes love to start this debate and where to start when I think I 'd like to start by stating when I grew up I grew up and and Woolston and went to Romney primary school and so I grew up in a neighborhood where kids didn 't go to university most kids in our neighborhood aspired to a minimum wage job and most and half of our schools still there and half of moved on to other neighborhoods the ones that normally moved on to other neighborhoods got traits v a small number went to university and some are quite entrepreneurial where you got yourself five jobs and it really hard having grown up in those neighborhoods to be able to look someone in the eye who and grow that up with our mother or father who have children at home they 're going to bring their children up when they kind of feel essentially getting handouts from the government when we live in a society that can absolutely afford to pay a living wage in fact society would end up better off with that living wage because as the mayor pointed out what they found in the UK was you had the job stability and productivity went up because people feel more appreciated and of course we re hiring new people and retraining them in building that trust relationship that you do with employees is is quite hard work and destabilizing for many organizations and businesses and small businesses so I think it 's cost saving majority of people in our society especially those and the bottom half that in probably anything from under 40 50,000 down-spin definitely so by paying people more the economy just speeds up people have got more money to buy coffee to around society so we will see our city boom if the entire city is bold enough to take on this and we have to lead the way and to get us there with the contractors I think would be quite surprised how many of our contractors actually already paid them and pay the living wage or above we don 't currently ask for that to be shown in the contract because it tracks no points but there are no long with environmental issues I think should be part of our procurement going forward and finally the last point I 'd like to make is we know that little kid going to Bromley primary had Bible and schools and I got kind of grew up in a non-religious household and I became a Christian myself out of my own choice but the Bible of schools lady taught us one valuable lesson and it was a saying that 's always stuck with me it 's do unto others as you 'd have do unto you and for me I put that in all aspects of my life and for me that comes to be paid 1575 an hour 20 dollars an hour what 's the difference and if I was going to bring up my own children crikey 20 now would be a struggle so this is for me as just to treat another human being who might be a parent with pure dignity or they could be supporting someone else the investors that 'd be a minimum of what we can do Andrew thank you so to summarize wire summarized where I 'm at on this I 'm certainly supportive of option 1 I support the two amendments that are requesting the reports I think that allows us to have a sensible and informed discussion on those other issues that clearly are and things that follow on from any decision that we might make today I 'm not supportive of the amendment that essentially defers decision on decision making on this to the long term plan this issue was discussed at the relevant committee throughout the last term of council a lot of work has gone into it I think we owe the community and we are our staff an answer into it I 'm certainly not happy to effectively defer that until the long term plan next year so today we 're presented with an opportunity to make sure all of our directly employed counsel staff where the part-time casual full-time or seasonal are paid a living wage a wage that allows them to live with respect and dignity that allows them the opportunity for decent housing the opportunity not to measure success by whether they 've got food in their cupboards but whether they 're actually able to take part in the whole of society and be active members in every aspects of their community a living wage provides social benefits to individuals it provides social benefits to families and it actually provides social benefits to whole communities provides economic benefits as already has been mentioned to individuals and families but also puts more dollars into our whole local economy it speaks to the value of work he speaks to the value of people it provides benefit in fact to Council as an employer through commitments to work and the value of work within this organization Wellington set a wage from the 1st of July this year Auckland Council has agreed to implement a living wage by 2019 Christchurch today has the opportunity to lead by example by adopting a living wage for all directly employed council employees I support that this is an investment an ongoing investment in fact in our people and ongoing investments in social and economic outcomes for our city so I 'll be strongly supporting option 1 I 'll be supporting getting the two reports and I strongly encourage others to do the same thinking in why don 't you like to start by thanking the living wage supporters for being patient today and it 's a bit like those who are waiting in the living wage they 've had to have a favorite of patients but look I strongly support option 1 up there to adopt the living wage and fall it 's because it 's fairer all council staff and it 's likely to be more effective in a real benefit to the whole city as Andrew was indicated where I grew up as a young person we didn 't have a poverty as we now have in Christchurch and New Zealand in Christchurch many are doing extremely well financially and others are relatively well-off but many are struggling on low incomes and some are living in poverty I never believed I would ever see so many homeless people on the streets of Christchurch as there is today option 2 refers to council adopting a stepped approach and I have to say that I believe it as a council unfortunately that approach to date has been painfully slow in terms of achieving a living wage for all air staff the initial report goes back to February 2014 when the committee asked for a feasibility study ten months later we had two further reports and then we made decision actually to work towards a living wage a year ago the numbers of staff were reduced but with are still 428 staff men who are below a living wage and the report today shows that there 's 470 staff below that level so we 've now actually got more staff who are paid less than the living wage than when you started so clearly is that a large proportion like over 72 percent of them are women I asked councillors is that discriminatory and I 'll leave that for you to decide the living wage is affordable for us as a council for all air staff because we have a really budget of three hundred and seventy five thousand for thus we need between four hundred and five thousand staff to achieve a living wage for all so overall I believe it 's a small amount for council defined and comparison for the spend on high salaries we need that a fairer distribution of the other council salary budget and this can be done and obey the way the me as indicated that the be a fixed increment as a way of in new negotiations is a way that will free up a considerable amount of funding which can be used to make up the living wage and there is a real need to redistribute council salary budget the challenge for air council is to be a leader and not just follow opened and Wellington or drag the chain by doing consultation in my down clearly that clearly a slow approach has not worked in Christchurch for the past two or three and a half years and so my question is how we 're going to adopt the living wage for some and leave others mainly women behind or are we going to adopt the living wage all thank you thank you clean thank you as you will see in the urban development indicator report before you today rents in Christchurch City have increased a 42 percent over the last ten years so the priests indicated the other week that they have come down lower to 360 the question I put to you how much of wages gone up over their time if you look at rental affordability being 30% of gross income 30% of 808 which is 20 dollars 20 an hour by 40 takes you to 240 this is a shortfall of a hundred 18 on current rental levels in the city we build increases into the LTP as we 've just heard before for the top tier we have to provide for all the question I have to you today is this or do you want to wait today some of you may remember that television series of a long time ago at the Paper Chase remember what the the prof used to say carpe diem seize the day don 't wait another year don 't wait for rates to go up again do it now this is not a new idea it 's been consulted on in a broader sense let 's do it actually used to say you come in here with a mind full of mush and leave thinking like a lawyer but you I thank you and you know for all the reasons that have been stood out by various councils already I am in favor of a living wage I 'd like to just a couple of points though the fact that Oakland and Wellington have both recently adopted a living wage has been applauded by the living wage community applauded by the unions and neither of them have done it immediately both of those councils have consulted on it during the annual plan process and we 're asked to by the living wage movement end as only starting at 18 an hour from the September moving to the living wage and 2019 and Wellington are also taking a staged approach this is being applauded in the media by the various movements who are in phase of the living wage we haven 't consulted on this as part of an annual plan process and I really wish we had I wish that the report had come earlier and then we were able to include an NRI annual plan it 's good to notice that in the in the annual planning process the heir to Union did actually submit and what they submitted on page 87 of volume one of about multiple books there was actually that they asked for the report on the living wage implementation to come to Council by December this year and that to enable the information to lead the discussion in how the inclusion into the 2018 28 long term plan of the commitment to work towards the critter accreditation in accordance of their own living wage movement so in fact that you to Union asked for this document by the end in the long-term plan that 's very clear in their submission to our in your plan and that is what I think we should do we owe it to the ratepayers of the city to make sure that everyone was behind this if we do this now we will suffer the backlash of a lack of consultation on this we haven 't budgeted for it and we need to do that thank you Jimmy he will review the egg of living wage men and is reduced inequality and poverty and we reveal the definition of this living wage particular emphasize the income necessary to provide the workers and their family with the basic necessity so after the earthquake especially the February of 2011 actually quite church lots of people community is kind of the anxiety and also more or less people suffering in the hacia but these the earthquake the Kuwait even rhinos they are not yet completely because why we are enter into the final stage of the earthquake recovery is a regeneration recovery however you will review maybe a moment I didn 't have the teacher figure but percentage income in the lace the 20 percent income the tape gradually enlarge these are phenomena my view you know this rare Magna least a community this society more or less unstable and stable because the our city still in the recovery the candor of the process this might be a concern but this age is not today we just talk about this issue because back to the four years ago we already know to initiate this issue already so far how to mitigate this in court quality how to mitigate this poverty with only to take this issue more seriously another one regarding the definition particular emphasize the basic necessity Baha is the basic necessity it 's all food is how close it is all may be popular transport as well as the when he mentioned earlier this important is accommodation but we meet up with the kind of you the issue in the quite a few times of steerable people know they have no known no no housing to live they 'll be in the net they are currently in the shelter etc there 's a real situation give us the the the kind of the the issue may be some consummation of yes Wennington they kind of stability analyses enough a policy but they 're the kind of the that living weights the figure is only 18 point oh six or 18 point or three etc but we need consider as a council we need to tap into the most seriously especially in hi Chester such a she 's a different from the situation in a council there 's this wider you know so I fully supported the option while the the living living age we need to adopt from today and rather than with post-punk to the future thank you I don 't disagree what has been said I actually do support having a living wage I don 't you know the term living wages I guess questionable because a lot of these people that I 'm obviously will potentially give this wage actually probably don 't require it to Luth but obviously we can 't just select a few people that do it so I understand that the need obviously to put them across everyone hear across the room from a lot of counselors have I 've been trying to get this done for like four years so it really does surprise me that it 's actually never gone out for public consultation one of the things are here for one of my fellow councillors who often are does vote against things because things need to go out for public consultation this has not gone out for public consultation I 'd like to hear from the people in Christchurch today get minimum wage that are not employees of the council what they think about us doing this this the people I want to hear from I don 't know what the people of Christchurch think about how we 're going to spend the public purse because it is their money we 're spending I do support your saying to say I do support a living wage that is what my amendment says but I think it was extremely important that we actually talk to the people consult with the people and then once we 're here from the make the decision okay I think there us as counselors one of them is our concern about inequality and equality and the price that you pay for that and I can see the price that they 're paying for it in America at the moment and it seems the price way way too high and the price they 're paying for it in Australia and and with the bricks that vote and all sorts of things the other one is climate change and the other one is housing and I would have thought on some of those things that we actually take a leadership role we are debating later this month I hope a shared equity scheme for housing it hasn 't gone out for public consultation because what we know is that people want to be able to afford to buy their own house and I actually think this has been a long time in coming one of the things that surprised me in the data about it was how what percentage of the people in this role were woman 72% I thought was extraordinarily high the other thing that made me reflect was that we yet we expect them to say to save our kids if they can 't if they get into trouble or even us so those those sort of things drive me to supporting this and to supporting it and doing it now and taking some leadership role on it I think it 's quite simple yes it 's expensive but we either do this or we don 't the public consultation could come back half half anyway I don 't know what you do at that stage but it seems to me that the report makes it clear the impact I actually applaud the work that the living wage people have done up and down the country I think it 's been a lovely sort of movement that has expressed concern and care for other people in in the workforce and the thing I find heard is people struggling we heard yesterday at a meeting ization Rickett on about some of the issues than Rick Otton and actually what the people were stealing was food which was interesting is not what 's normally told in the media so I like the all over our people a living wage and that 's why I 'll support option 1n public consultation on this issue will mean that you need to be able to have a computer access to a computer you need to be able to have a litter box you need to be able to read and many of the people who the community that we are thinking of at the moment him none of those because they live in deprivation this is an opportunity for us as a group to provide moral compassionate leadership and we 're just going to say to our community we are not happy with the inequality that is happening in our community and we want to address it with we 're tired of it we want to fix it or start to fix it there are over 300,000 children who live and low-income families in New Zealand what that means is that they probably will be living in a cold damp overcrowded house they may not have warm or rain proof clothing their shoes may be worn in on many days then they go hungry or to go to the doctor and when they are sick because they can 't afford the costs of the appointment they get sicker others stay home from school because they don 't have all the uniform or lunch to take living and hardship can also cause lasting damage it can mean doing barely at school not getting a good job and having poor health we often don 't bother to listen to what children say and the Children 's Commissioner has made the statement that he doesn 't understand young people are not given a chance to speak their mind about issues in legislation that would lead to richly he has already criticized the government for not consulting with children about the education Amendment X that it 's making its way through Parliament if those is an ingrained notion their children have nothing useful to say that adults know better this is genuinely consulting with children and hearing their voices and variably producers not only better quality but also quite surprising responses under 18 to have a lot to offer so if we were to ask children what they think three jobs and they don 't see who have to get out in feed their siblings and get them ready for school because mum or Deb is no parent in the house because they 're having to do shift work to make ends meet I think I know what they would say to this decision thank you David um thank you I 'm glad to support the Davidson resolution because I think it is important for the reasons that Sora put forward a short while ago and I also have a concern really that we had supposedly 470 in English in the living wage excuse me and that the whole focus of the living wage seems to be around a an income for the family and the family standards but yet that 470 there 's a huge number of those seasonal workers often lifeguard school-aged kids and we 're putting that into a our prices so I 'm very supportive of going out to this having a public viewpoint on this and not making a decision that we 're the criticize for later and so yes I 'll go support the principle emotion of a living wage and that our full-time employees and regular employees should be paid that living wage but I do have some reservations about some of the categories that we 're lumping in here of their employees thank you Jamie and Tim look the only thing I can support out of these implements here today is is asking the question of of our community I do have some reservations around I respect the people that have come along here and that are passionate about this and everyone that 's spoken I respect your view on this I 'm sorry that I in this instance I disagree and I 'll reserve my right to to change my mind depending on what the public say after consultation but I think it is important to have that that discussion we employ one person and that 's that 's the chief executive and we set the high level direction the the strategy the KPIs and we monitor it I can 't help but feel that perhaps what we pay and blanket minimum wages is a how not a watt and I feel that we 're clouding governance risk management which is never a good way to go that being said we 've got a report that says that it will cost seven hundred and seventy five thousand dollars to implement at step one now this research an opinion that says that it increases productivity and you 'll see that there 's opinion that says that it doesn 't now for the sake of good decision-making it 's just let 's assume even if you don 't believe it presume that the letter was right that it didn 't increase productivity I don 't think I could look the community in the eye and say I have increased expenses for zero increase in productivity it would be like going down and buying a ten thousand dollar car down Moorehouse F and them saying there 's a ten thousand dollars sticker on the window and they say what make an offer and I say seven hundred and eighty five thousand dollars and I say well it 's it 's seven hundred and seventy five thousand dollars more than you need to pay 's an argument to say that we 're doing that with rate payer money now if you want to do that with your own money that 's your call but I think that we 've got Ben than ever in squeakier clean with ratepayer money do we want to be a leader or a follower I tell you what with ratepayer money I want to be a follower if it doesn 't work then I 'd rather someone else make the mistake and not us the the other issue that I 've got with it too and it 's a very real one and the report doesn 't can 't quantify which is actually the most worrying thing is the bow wave of relativity that could follow that all of a sudden you 've got someone that came in yesterday a teenager that was paid 17 an hour and there 's a team leader or something and the same in the same sector that 's paid 21 now all of a sudden if that teenager that came in was employed yesterday as in paid 20 20 I can tell you that 's paid 21 that 's their team leader and that person then goes up to 24 25 and the person that 's on 25 that 's been there for four years is going to go up and thus it continues on and it 's a heck of a lot more than seven hundred and seventy five thousand dollars so for me there are way too many questions and way too many landmines in this yes I think that it 's a muddling of governance versus management yes I think that it 's potentially being careless with rate payer money and yes I would rather let someone else go ahead first with us but the final thing that I 'll say is that I am supporting Mike 's amendment with it because there is in my view no possible way that we can make such a radical change without without having that conversation with the community and if you 're going to be spending seven hundred and seventy thousand dollars plus per year when you didn 't need to there is nothing more than gross financial mismanagement in my opinion I would support asking the question of the community thank you and you won 't need to work you 're right that 's me I want to endorse both what Aaron and serifs it I know it 's cool Woolston as well I went to Timothy ki scope I was brought up in a single-parent family so what every other person 's some appearance with hunkering down for the night with the appearance our mother went out to work what would really like to see as public consultation for the simple reason and a number there 's really we 've had comment about Auckland adopting the Auckland Council adopting Wellington Council adopting what I would really like to see is Christchurch adopting a living wage we have a responsibility to the ratepayers in the people of Christchurch I think it would add strength to it I totally support the living wage I know things have got harder for people but I do know how to turn my own life idle fantastic childhood but I 've probably missed a few things that others got that 's just life but I would like to see it adopted by the city of Christchurch rather than the council and I think that there is the real strength because I don 't be 2 or 3 years down the track and things change I want to see the living wage it skipped in step with inflation and kept real and I think of a city adopts us rather than a council that that is exactly where it should be so I 'm going to support our my colleague Towson 's comments Thank You Ernie important I think it 's important that this debate focuses on all three of the proposed amendments and we 've heard a lot about some of them um some we haven 't heard too much at all so I just want to start off by saying I welcome the counselors that say we should have put this into the annual plan you had that opportunity last year I repeatedly raised her and had no support to do that so we had the chance to do it and for whatever reason and I suspect it was because there 's some very complicated management that it 's not tenable to do it through that process that the best process to do it through is the way in which it 's proceeded that was my understanding of the advice that we had last year so I would have liked to have put it on the consultation document for the annual plan last year which you were all involved with there wasn 't support to do that and that 's why we 've ended up in the situation today having said that there 's been a lot of talk about the importance of the living wage and I don 't want to go back and and and repeat all the arguments that have been made or or heaven I will just make the point we heard the same thing that one of the counselors who said that they 're concerned about it around development contribution rebate to some of the wealthiest people in the city 20 million dollars to developers to build residential and commercial in the central city and that advice from staff was that we could not tell what impact that rebate scheme talking about a fraction of that going to the people who I believe will benefit the most not the wealthiest in our society but some who are on the last in comes to me that is an absolutely the right thing to do and I think there has been overwhelming evidence that we 've heard around the importance of paying people a fear pay for the work that they 're doing so that they can support their families and that they can survive I just reflect on the issue that we 're being told in terms of the maintenance contracts we got information in the report around some of the CCC OHS and the concern around the maintenance we 've heard from our own staff the trouble of attracting people into the core bread and butter functions of this council around maintenance because of the ability and ability I think to pay them compared to what they 're getting in other sectors of the rebuild so paying people a living wage will actually help us as a city do the basics the bread and butter of the things that we CC O 's in the CC TOS why I think it 's important we have sinned it I 'm sick of hearing the argument that this will somehow reduce competitiveness I don 't want any bar and supporting the idea that we simply can paint to erase to pay people as little as possible and the people that have come in and made deputations and the people that have come from the airport the cleaner who came from the airport and talk to us deserve to be paid fairly and to say that there 's no money for those people when we 've had senior executives on 1.2 million journey per year getting played so there 's money for people at the top there doesn 't seem to be money at the bottom it 's time that we reduced that through our counsel companies where we do have a number of people that should be on a living wage who are getting paid listen Thank You Pauline okay look gotta know how does it go a few days work for few days okay or is it a few days pay if someone 's out there working really hard 40-hour week and they bring enough money home that they can 't make ends meet you can 't live on it that is not fair somehow something 's happened in New Zealand we need to move towards a more equitable society where people have dignity if you 're really hard and still can 't make him to meet where 's the dignity in that people are saying the costs are questionable but they may be offset or even neutralized by the gains and productivity and there 's evidence to show that it does so the whole wage structure here is just got out of kilter there 's a big gap between the rich and the poor now and actually not that 's not a gift that 's a gaping chasm with the government making up the shortfalls so now we want to move towards a real economy that 's not subsidized so whether we paying a living wage in a decent wage in a livable wage or we pay it through our Texas via the government comes to the same thing let this this takes a step towards that reseat let 's knock this whole solution because 20 20 an hour is not a fortune believe me and young people we talk about lifeguards young people without kids should they get it of course they should they 're doing the work they should have the decent money and that then gives them the chance to try and save a deposit for the home then as Vicki said we know people want to be able to afford to buy their own home in New Zealand so let 's lead the way after Auckland and after Wellington and give people the chance to climb met leader to dignity it meets three the living wage does increase productivity I couldn 't look my community in the eye and say I voted against it so I support option 1 thank you alright I 'm before I go back to Erin for thrush reply I 'm really pleased that we 're having this debate but I want to reiterate what I said before and that is that the living wage movement is a direct result of a had in this country we were world leaders you know you go back to the eighteen eighteen hundreds of the 1890s and you will see that we were regarded as an experiment and a new way of delivering for for workers in this country so that there was a fair day 's pay for a fair day 's work and there was a commitment to an eight-hour working day that 's all gone that 's that 's disappeared and if people don 't understand that impact of the employment contracts out on this country then we will never ever get to the root cause of the problem so we 're being asked to solve a problem that was created out of a deliberate attempt to destroy collective bargaining at the same time as reducing benefits that meant that the there was a bottom line where the minimum wage couldn 't fall it got dropped and the minimum wage was not increased for nine years for nine years at set where it said oh and that is an artificial environment designed to lower wages in this country we 're a low got to do something about there but until people face up to why we 're in the position we 're in we will continue to ask the wrong people to pay the price for a deliberate attack on wages the rate payers of Christchurch can 't_''_3732.82 be asked to fund the living wage and this they themselves are paid a living wage and I totally agree with terminus has got to be about Christchurch as a whole unit turned my numbers on I am monitor myself we can 't have a movement that lobbies councils and walks away my challenge to the union 's is to ensure that the costs are not unfairly borne by those who do not work for the council in my view that means it is necessary to have differential rates of pay depending on the salary band that people are owned and I 'm really looking to the trade union movement to help the council fund this in a way that provides equity not just for the workforce but for the people of Christchurch I 'm satisfied that over a period of time we will the meantime don 't make the most vulnerable rate payers pay the price I want the public consultation because there will be there 's no cost in this year 's annual plan so I want the public consultation not to focus on the issue of the rights and wrongs of a living wage or even to say that the council can 't_''_3807.67 be a leader in this area I don 't want the debate to be about that I want the debate to be on the impact on the budget and I 'm giving notice that I don 't to propose an increase in the LTP for this purpose I want us to direct that that this is absorbed within the budget as it is for the remainder of this year that 's what I want us to debate as part of the LTP now that 's going to require a collective effort and again I 'm looking to the union movement to those who represent the collective effort to develop a true partnership with those who bargain on our side of the table on our behalf if we put provide equity for all we have waited to implement this decision and the hope that it would be that it would occur by osmosis but that hasn 't achieved the result sufficiently in our view and we are now making this our firm commitment so can I hand it back to Aaron for a final yeah thank you all for your debate and for your open thoughts on this I 'll just finish by saying one of the groups I missed out before and I 'm a little embarrassed that I did was the disability sector they are paid 3 less than everyone else and by adjusting to all of Christchurch and I graphed in there that should have the living wage I mean that would drag them up as well so I certainly flag that as part of this which leads me on to all of Christchurch adopting it we should lead and then and others there plenty of companies like I own a business myself the wages we pay it all above the the living wage so it 's not hard to do and all companies should do in society more people can afford to go to the murder mystery dinner theater on a Saturday night if they had the living wage at which pays artists that come along and workers actors and zombies and then finally I want literally a zombies and finally I want to say to my fellow councillors I hope you have listened to the debate lay your cards on the table here because this is your chance to look working-class people in the eye and say we value you you are parents you are children your brothers and sisters we value you we value the toilets you clean the trenches you dig and the walls you paint your important part of our society oh and the lifes you save at the pool in the ocean let 's not leave that one out and so please do rate and support of this and send a strong message to the rest of our society to do the same thank you very much the system is it it 's not ok so bright ok so we 'll put the first amendment which is the one on and wrote so we 'll have a roll call of councillors yeah [Music] cancel machine no caps new Davidson cancel a quarter no come here aren 't no latina no counselor Scanjet yes against thank you that 's lost the next amendment is the one on the name of counselor Johansson counselor swags again do you want to just the counselor johansson swags that 's the real quick report within three hours of how the living wage could be extended to council ccos and see some Tio 's yeah no I may be the only one voting against it of course yes no yes no but Kari and the next amendment is in my name both councillor Turner more deputy me as counter a second egg so I 'll again is there any objection to this one because yeah there is yeah my poster well we put up your hands if you 're a poster and it might recover East and Gulf thank you so that 's carried so I 'll now put the right oh yeah okay through the process of evolution there was look at them it was than giving them to do a roll call so anyway hey did someone want to abstain no right okay so so I 'm going to put the whole motion now which is as amended I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no no recorded East End Gulf thank you carried _"

    "text": "down by Porter smut cheer for Banks Peninsula Water Management Committee to come forward this should be quite a few staff and I know Pam was quite keen to come but I can do Greeks much luck so you will see on page 293 of the agenda that in the last two months we have done those things I can 't remember whether I reported last time on the report that 's being put together of all the immediate steps funding projects on banks peninsula did I did I talked to that last time you might not remember no but happily remind us yes I have a copy fear I 'll show you but anyway it 's it 's about all the immediate steps money that has been spent and it it 's from the landowners own voices and when you read it all together you start to build up a big picture about some progress being made on ripe Lorien planting that we assume is going to improve water quality on thanks much now and the other three four things I 'll just I might just take questions on we 've had we 've got a new facilitator for Banks Peninsula some of our energy has been channeled and to resolving some process and relationship measures that arose and the focus going forward is going to be on the review of our zone implementation plan which you will all know is called the zip and to make it a bit more useful to agencies like you in to channel funding so that more gets achieved from it so that 's going to be the focus going forward we 've we had a discussion or I have had a discussion with staff around that the timing of these presentations and we 're going to try and link them and with the community week so when the community come and present then we 'll get you guys to come and present on that week because again it will it will just take you take us back into the and to the community focus which is very much what the design design committees are doing that seems sensible to me but I will go back to the committee and talk to them that 's the second week of the month as opposed to the first so questions for Paula Gianni thank you um oh sorry I 'm probably on the crush at risk Melton one so that 's not it often happens I mean it 's a similar question to to both which is just around the impact of the Port Hills fires and the sediment runoff and probably affects both sides of okay they 're two Zoners yes so on the that you will realize that that of course that the zone boundary is at the top of the port hills so in the Banks Peninsula zone we the fire major effects were in the Ohana tarhe reserve in some neighboring farms and we 've not had any updates about impact on water quality on those downstream areas but I mean what what we can see is that there 's already quite quite good plant cover re-establishing just coming away and there 's been a massive planting effort and and and we 'll be going forward and Ohana tahi but it 's a good Christian and I will try and get effects on water quality on our side very good any other questions okay thank you thank you very much is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or either do you want to look represent inside it 's not being spokes right with this big screen shot so thank you once again for providing this opportunity to speak to you I 'm pleased Leawood booth facilitative Christchurch miss Melton I 'd like to first of all apologize for the Selwyn wide horror zone team in your agenda you 'll note that they are currently doing a series of seminars on the issues that have been facing the cell and district inside that is what they 're currently doing today so there 's seven seminars one in a at lunchtime which is now and one in the evening so today 's the one on the lake and the next one will be on the central plains water so I do have a some little booklets that go on within seminar series that counselors more than welcome to have I 'm happy to field any questions but I 'm probably suggest that would probably be more productive to move straight on to prostitute release melton of the ellipse questions throw but if there isn 't a show you then don 't worry about it we can get the answers yeah that 's awesome I think Vicki just in relation to the Selwyn one and it may not be appropriate to ask you some of the drinking water and the quality of that is that being dealt with further by the salinity or is it just again soon drinking water is an issue it 's plant the targets and the Canterbury water management strategy but in terms of drinking water as you you 're probably aware that employment Canberra is responsible for the groundwater aquifers where most of the drinking water comes from and the TAS are responsible for the reticulation and their own boards so if you have a individual war and you 're taking up for your household supplies that is your responsibility so so it 's it 's a combination of Regional Council TAS and in individuals my concern is with non-compliance of some of the drinking water just what 's happening about those and is it something I mean it 's very difficult for us to question or sell one District Council and it so the other the other main organization involved is the Canterbury District Health Boards so so they will be monitoring their compliance of all those walls that they are keen to be advocating to to ensure that the drinking water is at a potable level for everyone but they have no legislative responsibility for all right so absolutely we can move on to so Christchurch Rhys Melton 's own committee I have on my right Suzanne Kirk who is the vice chair of the Christchurch we smelt and so in committee so she 'll provide the report okay one of the things that under last month was a technical workshop on copper and zinc contamination and urban streams of the four main pollutant urban streams you 've got eco low heavy metals sediment and nitrates and so we were focusing this month and looking at the heavy metals which predominantly your zinc and copper contaminants and they 're highly eco toxic which so and sex and fishers and the rivers because the concentration levels are just simply too high for them to even little reproduce so we were looking past research has indicated that these are addressable problems and there are solutions out there so this was a workshop looking at what the status collars and how can we get that to where it needs to be it was well attended by members from the zone committee Christchurch City Council can as well as MFE mbae and University of Canterbury experts in the fields with a really good range of participants the main findings we 've had a there 's been a very good study done from the juices study by Canterbury University and the main findings that your hot spots for the zinc as you go when eyes droop so zinc is predominantly from roofing materials it comes from a galvanized steel and other materials as well but your hot spots by an extremely long way you 've got unpainted galvanized roofs painted galvanized roofs are better but by no means as good as many other alternatives and copper hotspots copper basically as well but the vast majority of a copper and our waterways is coming from brake pads and so you 're hotspots of pollution that highly trafficked roads and large car parks with heavy vehicle maneuvering Medusa sir model is quite but it basically it shows where all your different sources of pollution are come from and it also enables us to look at scenarios as if we change one of those factors how that affects end result and various scenarios for copper are relatively simple the only thing which will get the streams and rivers down to acceptable level is to replace copper brake pads with copper free brake pads and the story for zinc isn 't as simple think it comes from car tires as well as through fur materials and there are many things we can do to reduce the amount of zinc but there is no one straight answer so it 's going to be a combination effect the other thing to note is that removing these heavy metals once they 're in the system is very difficult so if you treat your water you might 's not easy it 's much better to get rid of them if possible at source so the rest of the workshop was discussing methods that we could implement these changes so I 'll just run through a couple of the high highlights of those we 've got a pretty comprehensive list which I 'm sure you can get from Leslie but basically one of the main themes which were lacking is education this isn 't a well known problem to the public and a lot of people don 't realize that they 've got copper brake pads on their cars let alone that coppers killing the life and our streams so education at all levels from schools right up to national government as a really important factor and if we 're going to get change there needs to be the education to allow for that legislation is also an important tool we believe by laws dictating discharges from sites including concentration limits would be a very useful tool rather than saying don 't use copper roofing for example you could have a bylaw which stated the total amount of and if people want to have copper for example they could coat it or they could treat the water themselves so having maximum levels dischargeable to storm water systems for emitters was one of the tools we were considering considering putting stormwater to search for particularly high catchment areas such as car parks or main arterial routes possibly just for first flush again that would be you have to look at the limitations of your stormwater system but the first flush which is your initial ten minutes half hour after rainfall is where your majority of pollutants come off the roads so it 's quite a short period to catch a majority but basically encouraging different uses of roofing materials there 's a big one for zinc pollution is pretty much it basically how it 's got got to go there 's no other solution which will achieve the necessary results various other regional things could be encouraging misuse of cars by new bullets haven 't had bike parks instead of car parks was you know one of the myriad of small suggestions which basically it needs to be a of the main things was phasing out cop of materials and brake pads there are other brake pads out there a major problem to using those ones as there 's no labeling you cannot go and look at a brake pad and instantly know if it 's good and the same thing with the roofing materials so one of the main suggestions was having something along the lines of a five star group five green stars for materials for roofing and for brake pads to enable people to see what they 're putting on a lot of people have got an idea of they 're polluting or not and a lot of Architects don 't realize what the products do if you 've got a five star rating people understand what that means and they 'll instantly realize whether they 're pollution or not there 's lots more points we have which I could go into but I think I 'd like to allow time for questions so your questions Dion Aaron just on the brake paint thing oh it 's it 's something that 's interested me on car state in the United States have bent copper cups or straight heads do you think it 's a possibility not just for Christchurch but for the whole of New Zealand to actually adopt something along those lines definitely there are multiple benefit the manufacturers are very well aware of this problem and the end users aren 't end-users being the mechanics of putting them on and the suppliers to rip coal in your and work problem but your manufacturers are very aware of the problem and there are currently brake pads available for pretty much every make and model of car you know there are differences which are available and the price difference is not significant you 're talking about 10 to 20 dollars for a set of brake pads and the quality and longevity is just as good I mean this there 's an idea I have here through madam chair is maybe that 's something LG Inns in Kakaako do know but we could get it next year for the LG insid brake brake pad copper brake pad free New Zealand or something I 've discovered that actually would be quite good much quicker much faster than waiting for an annual conference well I don 't know I mean that 's just a process to go through but then I 'm really happy for that to happen you know I 'd like to do something like that yeah was it Yanni no okay I know it was Erin sorry it was Erin and then Pauline and then Vicki I know we did so just a couple of quick questions on I totally agree on this point that just if once you know something 's really bad for your environment then you should just move forward and eliminate it and move on to whatever 's next their next problem but the trying to mitigate via swales and things are there any plants that will clean the zinc or the copper sure answer I don 't know that it 's not easy to pull out general plantings don 't do it to a significant level what there may be specific plants I know that some are CSIRO 's have done research on specific plants to do that but your general they do pull out some yeah yeah because I 'd hope someone is doing some work around that and what what cleans that cuz I have another issue not so much it 's not real but in the city is the cigarette butts and waterways because just purely the amount that go into gutters city intersections is single done in week around me again I don 't know cigarettes are a problem but it 's mainly a Central City problem and their difference between cigarette butt pollution and cough or pollution is copper and zinc once is soluble it 's very hard to get them to particulate out where I think a lot of your cigarettes but pollutions out will sit all out no I love smoke first bit and finally do bicycle brakes of copper a lot of them do yes but you 're talking about volumes the volume that will come off a bicycle brake is insignificant you know you have a bus break once and that 's probably all you brakes bicycle braking in Christchurch you know it 's tackling your big problems first I think you you know the kilograms of copper their contribution to our streams is insignificant comes a load of questions I thought they didn 't shot myself in the theta in the bike seat every range let 's make sure that yours don 't don 't break off the primers just a follow-up because I think obviously it was a gap was it over a year ago the sewing committee requested counsel to write to the government department requesting that they look at banning the use of them with the sales of copper brake pads and I 'm wondering if we 've reactions yet and if we could look into their because we did agree to do it around the table sorry we 've already Requested councilors own committee as requested counsel to write to the appropriate government department and request that they investigate barring the import of copper brake pads so that may have been I 'm just wondering where their theaters have been actioned what was that a resolution of council it was a wee while ago do you want to cut somebody found there it came through the UT up it would be quite good well I can 't put hand on heart and say that I 've done that because I simply don 't recall signing outside I know but if we just look in Turks it was already resolved but it 's already resolved in then I 'll certainly undertake to do that but I might take a resolution on on the gaining support of the other councils and the country to really sort of it was part of it as well come to think of it well we did broaden it out there to gaining support for the other territorial thora teas yeah yeah okay macro bo-boogie if you don 't want to be killing wildlife that you actually don 't know when you 're buying brake pads what you 're doing that seems does it seem odd to yours that just moving weird I agree I think something like having the five star you know eat environment health is the copper free there are plenty of symbols were really out there we 're thinking of a five star one is probably more applicable for your where obviously concrete 's perfect solar panels are perfect color Steel 's okay galvanized terrible copper break free brake pads yes it should be simple but in order to have copper free meaning much to the average public you also need to combine us in education because I think a lot of the public doesn 't know copper kills fish or aquatic life Jonnie yeah I was just interested to clear since it 's one on the thinking one on the question before um have we done an order has anyone done any work around public facilities in terms of roofing materials and looked at whether we could need to change and look at doing that and there 's been localized studies done is the very intensive study dominating Tobruk that there isn 't been one specifically looking only at council buildings but there are a lot of council buildings that have highly polluting Rufus 's so would that be something useful that we could pass a resolution to get staff to do some work on I think that would be excellent getting the council to sort out their own fleet of vehicles would be an excellent start and it 'd be a great way to show that you 're leading the community and doing the right thing move an amendment and then the second one was just to follow up on that question before I run the Port Hills fires I mean visibly that Heath get looks really really full of all sorts of staff have are you doing any monitoring of that have you got any programs underway to try and minimize that or address them I 'm actually going to pass that one on to Leslie okay thanks um you said there is monitoring and some of you will be aware that Kashmir stream care group has done a number of years of clarity monitoring that 's also monitoring but in coordinated with Environment Canterbury and the water waves Center Jenny Webster Brown at Canterbury University but yes you know the hiss code it has been looking in a very sorry state and no doubt as I understand it the fires will have contributed to that I think some of the major solutions is actually coming from there 's also the stone committee has prioritized the ear is affected by the fire in terms of the immediate steps funding so that 's a hundred thousand of trying to plant out right period areas and year is that a prime to slips I understand also some funding near that the City Council put in the annual plan for summer activities I just like to add to that as well as the sediment the the existing settlement is also a problem for the heavy metal pollutants because of the existing sediment is polluted so that does need to be addressed as well for the heavy metal side of it but until we stop coming in that sort of secondary and our focus look ask for a change to there but it 's request the the committee to investigate and the status of copper usage and our facilities and fleet and report back to the council the reason I 'm doing that is that I know for example that our heritage building the crash ditch Town Hall has a copper roof it is being protected so that it does not ensuring that that doesn 't happen and what I don 't want is to have a resolution on the books that says that we 're going to reduce and remove copper for copper when there are mechanisms that anyone can take to ensure that the storm water is protected from the leaching from copper roofs down I mean just on that I mean I personally would like to see us actually because I mean the the brake pads have been identified as a problem and there are suitable solutions out there which I 've just sort of looked at and I 'd actually like us to take a bit more of a stronger stand specifically on our fleet of cars in the resolution there are some changes occurring with our fleet of cars which are ones that we own we could we say no but we we 're changing our fleet of cars I 'd like to leave it is asking the committee to investigate the status of copper you that usage and our facilities in fleet if changes that we 're promoting and the fleet area actually result in us to waste time getting rid of something that 's getting rid of so let the committee do the investigation and come back to Council with recommendations is there any other questions yep I mean to actually adjust the council actually runs at least to education programs with children on fresh water and you know understanding their biodiversity so hopefully they will be you know teaching about these issues at their level so it would be probably quite good to just follow up on there and see if they 'd think you can take this okay that would be worth following up on yes and just a comic true as well with your looking at the status of copper roofs I think it 's important to point out you want to remove copper pollution gravure than removing copper if I you know great your community council on having pollution there copper roofs coated and removing the pollutants before they get them to stormwater that 's it an excellent example and the more that that could be advertised that that is a viable option that would that would be great you on the removal before it goes into the stormwater isn 't it Dave Dave do you want to just quickly comment on the Town Hall they 're putting in a um a trap system here we do have to replace the the material in it as it does as we monitor and do it but my understanding is that I 've got a roundabout of 10-year life and then they can be just renewed in my place and that kept us all the copper that runs off those systems now there 's a retrofit because it wasn 't in there previously and we have to obviously do all the stormwater drains that come off the roof so yeah thank you and for investigate the status of copper pollution from usage might be better because we 're essentially it 's not the copper it 's the pollution ventilation air from usage well I want them to do it I want them to investigate the status and report back to Council with recommendations if required to reduce if required to reduce the impact of pollution yep all right so do I have 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "item five flood management multifaceted assessment progress presumably team coming to the table and every could I invite speech here at the committee to receive the report thank you this came to the instructor transport and environment committee and we had an in-depth some conversation about this and the thing is that we have been assured that there 's no planned works will be delayed as a result of going down this path and we know the importance of actually having to do this investigative work that a really detailed level to get the best result the floc dhin remedial routes have actually proved there I think they were really many months and preparation people were getting frustrated that nothing was happening but the end result is proved successful forty eight million dollars project delivered on time and on budget so there will be no other routes that are already planned will be delayed by this but this is going to ensure that in the light of the many hazards that we have now exacerbated by the drop and lend by the earthquakes that 's also having a negative impact and it is proven by you know last week 's event increased storm surges intensity and duration of storm events we don 't know how bad these are going to get and how frequent they 're going to become so we 've got to make sure that staff gave us the right advice on we to spend the money and what to do and so the issue committee has formed our recommendation here to actually support this I 'm just collecting my Sabrina cooking because it went to sleep and with a couple of extra recommendations and there that 's the that we proceed with option one that we know the Landrum 's recovery program will be returning to the heath community with an update in October that the land rains recovery program will be reporting to Council and the options for short-term measures for the South Shore eastery edge so there 's always been in the mix and that the recovery plan will be prepared following the recent events we 've had and will include community engagement and numbered point to it as it 's still in there will weekend so basically that 's we had a long discussion about this at the committee and this is what we have recommended for council so I think it might be good idea for staff to give us another update as well anything to read about these death no pulling it was a wonderful stops us Thank You councillor got on um I think I just like to iterate that the work that this is leading towards is establishing adaptation pathways we have an uncertain future here in Christchurch and international best practice leads us to attempting to identify adaptation pathways what that really means is making decisions in a short term in making that don 't preclude or inhibit long term options that 's very much what we 're seeing and see as well for example in other works that 's gone on within the land around recovery program and it 's very important for good outcomes for our community in the whole community that we understand those adaptation pathways and a complete and robust way and that this work will provide technical information to support them and floodplain management the risk is of course that if we launch often to single hazard approaches that we may later regret some of those decisions in a significant infrastructure investment and it will require significant emphases addressing some hesitant if acun infrastructure investment and we want to make sure those decisions that are best and sound I 'd also just like to iterate again counselor Coty 's words around the work that 's already been acted mentoring recovery program has progressed a significant amount of work the last financial year and we 'll be continuing to do so this financial year it 's a real big year for us we 've got a lot going on a lot of fiscal works going on across the city and our these were example helped by this investigative process on thank you okay questions first David East thank you I 'm supportive of this approach I do have some reservations area mainly around some of the disadvantages that were noted in the paper and also the fact that we are proposing to do seven additional technical reports potentially the cost of 1.6 million dollars on that 's required to finish this project off and equally on quite concerned when we when I read the paper and look at the options and the advantages and disadvantages to progressing with this and the disadvantages that I noted that there are a greater cost and extended time frame for implementing hazard mitigation options and secondly that there will probably be additional community apprehension resulting from uncertainty associated with the potential findings of the multi hazard analysis the time the quest and the time to complete this work we are dealing with some communities that have a heightened distrust of council at the start oh they use that word to a goodly but those those are level in the in our community that in some areas we have been going for some years now evaluating options and on consuming this piece of work is going to delay because if counselors are going to call across the council-chamber it 's it 's not appropriate if you take a point of order and draw my attention to what your consumers and I will direct councilor easy to ask a question but of you know understanding around the table there are people that have been really badly affected by the floods we 've got a group of staff who extremely hard over a long period of time and we will focus on one of the resolutions around in terms of how much has actually been done it is a very long process but I would like everyone around this table to be treated with respect thank you so my questions really a two-fold one really see some evaluation or some report on on the costings of these reports or reports I find that expenditure quite significant and secondly Tom Parsons has referred in his early address there on a number of occasions to an adaptive pathway pathway I don 't see anything and I 'd like the resolution to acknowledge the fact that we need to adopt an adaptive management process to to our approach to multicultural multi Hazard Mitigation rather than sort of adopting strategies that go straight to the extreme position of climate change so I would signal my intention to a desire to see an amendment that resolution to the process of dealing with multi Ezard mitigation processes so that would set the precedes with the preferred option which is to regress the multi hazard analysis by completing further technical studies and developing floodplain management plans with a particular focus on adaptive management strategies yes it would be there are we 've been very happy to support the resolution with the inclusion of that wording and and some advice from staff we 're going to do with these seven reports under coastal would you like to respond on the costings of the report because I mean it is an issue that I also hear a concern about in terms of I think y 'all just probably put that in the context of the land round recovery program we brought a report up last year on options for their history tidal barrier you may remember in the cost estimates at that stage for hundreds of millions of dollars and I believe that investment and investigation to identify depth at pathways could lead to significant cost reductions overall within our current financial framework and that that is a very wise investment to lead to a solution which included significant improvement and say sure we caught there that that type of infrastructure investment is going to be very very expensive and an adaptation pathway would lead us to potentially smaller investments in the short term and subsequent investments later once or more information is available and in order to have those adaptation pathways presented we need to do some we need to do some investigative effort we do have rigorous project management controls with inside the program with inside counsel and these projects will be awarded and appointed within standard policies and frameworks for procurement so we have the frameworks in place for delivering value female value for meaningful counsel what was the what was the cost of the title barrier again I wouldn 't like to leave it off my head sorry it was it was Williams you know in the total context of providing flood protection on the upstream of the streams as well as Jonnie and then glean I think you um I heard several questions one is is it any relationship to the mural Task Force on flooding actually said we 're doing that report I 've already asked the the land drainage recovery program to do precisely that they 've moved on so the last councilman this was raised as well with the social establishment here at least I 've asked the land drainage recovery program etre to do an analysis of group what the mural task force did proposed what was done since and what is still to be done what 's the time frame for that would it be useful to put a time frame in place for that I don 't know that that 's necessary right now but it is going to be done so when I read this my understanding is the reports won 't be done until December 2018 if everything goes to plan and what I can 't reconcile is the work that 's happening around the heath Girt that 's coming back and I think it 's October 2017 or the model will be done after that but there were some usable results so I can 't reconcile why this won 't slow down what we do and the the timeframe for actually doing something to address the immediate flooding risk in the history peps you could talk about the for storm water basins one of which is already completed and the other three that are already on budget and commencing this summer and the multi-million dollars that has already been spent and doing there so so the people that are getting flooded in the history area and the Heathcott River area and through Wilson in okar I like we can talk all we want about the storage basins but actually when it rains it 's incredibly stressful and as we 've seen there is a very high risk of flooding in that area so the the work being done on the citywide model has been delayed and has been pushed out we you know I think it was March 2016 we 're supposed to get that report it 's now still when worked on so we what is the time frame for some solutions for that Heathcott River model that we 've been working on for so long good stuff please answer the question about the storm water do they have mitigated the flooding and Heathkit I 'll see you again i 'm so Johansson here 's asked a question about the timeline on the heat cut and I 'll hand it over to star yeah so I can answer those questions and so you 're right that our focus has been on the basins because that 's the space that we 've been able to work in storage such as those very adaptive means because we they feed they 're kind of like the foundation they use for the works that we 're doing so we need to get that foundation there and underway and so it really focused on their what does the total storage capacity looks from the eight hundred thousand cubic meters we 're still working on matters possibly likely to be slightly more than that so those weeks are underway and I understand the need to look at those areas which I 'm sort of looking from downstream and Kalambo straight through to Radley Street that 's our focus now and we 're going to the land range working group tomorrow with the 've got this time frame that we 've committed to of going back to the communities in those areas in October of this year so it would be OK for accounts of a for any counselor that was interested to attend the land drainage recovery program meeting tomorrow to get an update on on things to settle right Pauline you 're the chair of that if counselors want to attend they can have team I don 't know I mean it changes the whole nature of it can we get an indication of how many it would be it 's just a small nimble group here Sierra Leone II did right just solves a problem if they 're coming up with solutions tomorrow which is great for the FCAT River then what does this process that we 're being asked to consider do to those solutions in terms of jump so I just caution away the way from solutions because it gives the impression that we 're going to fix it you can you know completely fix learning larger ravine and it make them along so the options that we space so the people who are working on those options are actually same people who both mock hazard both Tom and I are across those projects so we 're feeding in the learnings from the multi hazard back into the thicket floodplain management options it 's also partially a question of timing you know those residents looking for options which deal with problems that they 're experiencing now we know that in some areas and the particular in the lower reaches those problems flooding problems that are going to get worse with the time and to me that 's where the multi has it comes on looking at what are the longer-term issues in this area in the longer term options we 're looking to work in the space of what can we do there are there is still no regrets we 're not going to do something that paints us into a corner that we can 't get out of that still addresses the issues that are faced by residents now in through the next sort of medium term so that 's the space we 're working in the work is being undertaken so simple answer is no it 's not going to delay us going back to the community in October and know the options that we come up with will not be ones that are incompatible with what the study is looking at clean thank you thank you for all your work on this and I 've set the realities of the conditions we face in the big picture of climate change my question is how might this work I change information already on land information memoranda so would it be bound up in some kind of comprehensive statement for instance have you got some thinking on that so that 's and the civil pieces of information are already on the land information memoranda and many people are familiar with with their own limb and limbs across the city so we do have general flooding information on the limb at the moment the improvement and the modeling and the improvement in understanding the coincidence of storms particularly on the coast will improve that information so there will be more precision more accuracy in that information on the lot of work on vulnerability to liquefaction across the city and at the moment there 's just a blanket statement on limbs and also for some people some information about the old technical categories the TC 1 TC 2 TC 3 so the information will also be considerably improved and can improve the information available to to people who are interested in property across the city so yes it will improve the information on the land of informational memoranda and of course it will also improve the information available to anybody doing any works in these areas in for council works and infrastructure as well okay um just what I 'm getting it is think of one you know resident southern place there they they see you know when the council who does this to I so what they were saying was another layer of information so what but I think what I 'm hearing was saying I just like to clear it those that this isn 't necessarily new information it 's more greater precision around whatever it is yes it 's great so everybody on the flatland for that will improve that information and for some areas that the information may come off completely because we we have a better understanding of where LipPerfection is likely to occur and where it 's not so it will be better information rather than new information Haley thank you just with reference to one C of the recovery plan kvass windless would be likely to be prepared however any expected actions out of it and how will that community and what form of the community engagement [Music] response in Britain won 't be overlapping the week that 's been done by the name drainage so we 'll tell into the week without doing so we expect it to be in about a month in it will fall it will have targeted actions but there 's ongoing work during the phase of recovery too so it 's not we 're not just sitting around writing a plan we actually implementing things is is heavens all right yeah I just wanted to ask what 's happened with the temporary flooding defenses budget that we 've approved and is that budget being considered for the short term know that this is the place to direct the question it was money that we put on budget back after the 2014 it was more recent that no it was put on budget after the 2014 floods as part of the long-term plan yes so and I think that it 's going to be looking at what that could be useless that the recovery plan so the civil defense are working with named drainage to right now Pauline would fetch a minimum to you happy to move the motion yep let 's do I have a second up Mike Davidson is there any discussion Danny um you know I think you know obviously this is an important important work to be done what what concerns me is the risks that have been identified and I 'm not convinced that we 've got enough mitigation against further delays of coming up with options to mitigate the the current situation and it sort of reminds me a little bit of post-earthquake when you know the government comes out announces zoning you know technical categories then it comes out with whole nother category of things and every time there 's just another study another report that net is needed before decisions are made so that people can move on so I appreciate that this is important work I will reluctantly support it but I what 's really important is that this clear simple communication back to the communities that are really badly impacted on what 's happening particularly with flooding at the moment you know some of these communities were identified in the mural task force has been really badly impacted on and yet you know since 2014 it 's hard for them to understand the complexity of the work that 's been done and why solutions or mitigations haven 't_''_1398.299 been put in place or aren 't in progress to the extent that alleviates some of that risk so you know this is important work it is hard to understand why we haven 't done this as part of those flooding model plans and maybe there 's a learning there we are spending a huge amount of money on infrastructure and a lot of money has actually already been the scope program so it 's a real shame I think that we didn 't do this sooner but you know it is what it is I think what 's really important is that we do get that report back on the mural Task Force on flooding we do get that recovery plan in place and we actually do look at what we 've heard is that short-term interventions to alleviate some of the concerns and stresses that people first being flooded repeatedly since 2014 can can look at some sort of relief so you know as a complicated issue and again I 'll come back to some simple communication around the complexity of it to the communities that are feel like they 're just waiting and waiting and waiting would be really useful so that they can understand what we 're doing because I know that we have been working hard trying to address these issues but it is concerning obviously that this could further delay getting those mitigations in place I think you look with some trepidation I also support the resolution I did note in some of existing works and and proposed projects but I do have two reservations are supposed one as the cost which we discussed earlier and secondly the disadvantages that were listed as against option 1 and already McGann that they greater cost an extended timeframe for implementing heads of mitigation options a great concern and he of more concern to me is the possibility of probable additional community apprehension resulting from uncertainty and associated with potential findings of the multi has its analysis the cost and the time of the completion of the work so as I said with some trepidation I will support it but I don 't particularly want to see this piece of work being used as a as methodology to potentially date delay of the work so that 's what 's my major concern clean thank you as I said before we need to face the effects of climate change in what is happening to our city as it continues to respond and as we continue to respond to successive events I know this is you 've been mayor running on average calling a local event one a a changing kind of environment what I would say here and give particular stress to is items see and will include community engagement so I think it 's how we go about that how we promulgate information how we take people with us that will be crucial I 've seen an example of where it went well and where it has done badly so I think for me going forward that 's the crucial thing that we take people with us and that we not unduly agitate and disenfranchise our communities to the comic by that men and Sutton place stays with me is another thing the council does to us so I think that 's really important that we ensure we take yeah and Pauline or just in closing I think it 's looking like this is going to get support and I 'm pleased about that but the other thing to remember is that the council you know has a legal requirement to be fiscally responsible so when we 're talking about potential mess of engineering works we have to make sure that we give our staff the 'll be supporting going down this track and bearing in mind that none of the planned works will be delayed I think we 've been told it several times so that gives me comfort so I will be supporting this thinking okay all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "session and I 'd like to invite Tony rush and Russell seems to speak to the council on behalf of the Christchurch hearing support and hearing New Zealand regarding the silent leadership challenge and I think counselors have been asked to adopt a particular approach Tony would you like us to put these on now just a moment okay we press the button sorry not a good sign here but soil to the roses are met in real councils thank you for inviting us here today to make this presentation at the RTA risk to us it 's a very important topic and to see ourselves Russell Psalms the president of Christchurch air and support and tightening on my right here does only abode but more importantly is also the president of the here in New Zealand which is all the polarization some elevated together why can 't talk for long unfortunately probably just as well so our posture of the tiny to make the presentation and thank you very much thank you worship councillors ladies and gentlemen I 'm Tony wish and I have a hearing problem that sounds to put your hearing aids on now please hearing a hearing sorry mouth yeah I 'm sorry what was it now don 't worry about that 's not important five most difficult words for people who have a loss of hearing if it 's important enough for you to tell me in the first place it 's important enough for you to say at a second time so I can actually understand it is that important in a greater scheme of things 63,000 of your ratepayers and citizens in Christchurch suffer from some degree of hearing loss and me half of that was preventable half of that is treatable with hearing aids some of it is not but one thing is sure the moment you lose some of your hearing you never get it back people with hearing loss suffer from social isolation they suffer from an elective the ability to participate fully and what 's going on around them yet it 's hard not to lift it up so you can hear it and the lack of understanding is probably the biggest barrier a family don 't understand it 't looking at me as I was as you were talking the general public don 't understand it you go into a shop and people look at you as if you 're done because I don 't understand hearing loss so that 's the aim of the silent leadership challenge to try and get across to the wider public something of the scale of the problem and something of the attitudinal changes that just they were made would be hugely beneficial to us with hearing loss 63,000 of your fellow citizens suffer from hearing loss and the percentage is going up used to be the worst cause for the noise induced hearing loss was industrial at work today it 's probably because of the music and the earphones go directly into the ears and doing enormous damage that you don 't notice at the time so actually already taking part in the silent leadership challenge basically what we do is ask business leaders community leaders to take part in this by undertaking 10 minutes wearing enough in a meeting ten minutes of wearing earmuffs in a social situation like a aids ten minutes watching television ten minutes one on one so you already went up well I hope you 'll do ladies and gentlemen councils is when you go home tonight get out from your cubbyholes or wherever you keep them the ear protectors you should have at home and even for ten minutes while you 're watching TV or ten minutes around the dinner table so you can give feel for one 's light to have substantial hearing loss thank you for taking part thank you for sitting there looking rather than baffled with your hearing muffs on it 's quite fun thank you all so I understand that there 's been a raffle going around the 6th floor to raised funds for the Christchurch hearing support and that 's raised around 20 I really thank you for that so that 's it from me I hope I 've given you a taste you can take them off now and I 'm happy to answer any questions I 'm actually really glad that you ended by a statement after we 've taken this off because I mean all of and in actually I found it quite compelling to really focus on on you in what you were saying and that 's an incredible reminder because we do say things without looking at people we do say things without engaging people and and as you say the worst thing to do would be to say I live in mind and not repeat what you 've said that must be terribly debilitating it is really yes thank you I just like to thank you for your presentation and as one who suffered some industrial hearing loss and currently was hearing aids our cultural presentation was excellent and does amplify some of the issues that those of us who have suffered some hearing damage here even in this council chamber supposedly there was a hearing Lowe but only working there will some of you around the table speak quite quietly I think as a consequence of my hearing damage I speak only softly at times you know and don 't really appreciate it so there are a lot of side effects and and and conditions that go on with hearing loss and air today and wish you and your organization all the best and promoting and health awareness hearing awareness thank you I just finished more years as a councillor a District Council in the North Island I 'm a new South Islander and that 's how I became involved for the Hearing Association because my mere and my first year said are there an association they 've got no GM can you represent me you 're the only deaf and I think you 've got done counselor thank you sympathize the father so just a quick word you say your lip system doesn 't work very well I find this excellent because I got to yours well I can 't hear any of you speaking because I 'm severely deaf now over I was 20 years but the lips are still way up that I 'd be totally in the dad and I still here but not terrific the world but clearly and believe me that sort of thing is essential and all public buildings if we are going to upgrade the loop system as well it 's really important that so I just want to ask a question around a subject of mine I like to bring up as many times as possible and the disability sector there 's an issue with people with disabilities are paid a third less than the rest of society on average is that the same with the deaf community probably fear has gaining considerable research on the economic cost of loss of hearing and if you want to read that it 's a document called you 'll find it on the National Foundation for the Deaf website and that 's a very good measure of the the very real cost and loss financially economically of loss of hearing we 'll get the link and circulate there to councillors Yanni oh thank you thank you for coming in today and I just was had a question you 've talked a lot about individuals and the silent leadership challenge and businesses but in terms of council we 've got a huge housing social housing portfolio is there anything that you think we should be looking at in terms of domestic housing that could improve the issues answer can I get back to you on that because it 's probably difficult to imagine the situation of putting them here and weapon in a rental house certainly there are assistive devices that people can use but normally the thought of is belonging to the individual rather than the house I don 't really have a quick answer for you maybe if there 's something new comes up just come back to us like I just I right on that the only way that council could really help people with a hearing loss in your housing is to ensure that they have soft floor correct soft tripes and not hard reflective surfaces because those soft sound soft materials absorb sound whereas once right in here okay absorbing tiles on the roof which is great with the hard floor the hard walls all make it Hickory and very hard to hear thank you thank you thank you lord thank you very much for coming out and and thank you for presenting us with a challenge and good luck with the rest of the campaign I think it 's extremely worthwhile to play a role and kick-starting the attention that I hope that your campaign brings to the rest of the country thank you unfortunately we can 't let you keep the hearing aids but the rhythm is hearing much but there was a hand out for you thank you thank you very much right the mixed public participation as Chris Thompson from Ashe be presenting on recyclable coffee cups so you can just cook a chance or just do a winter yeah no sorry I just drink it at a time please please my way okay thank you very much there 's a podiatrist Chantal isn 't it so thank you for the opportunity to speak my name is Chris Thompson I 'm the managing director of Ashe big trading Navarro Kia which is a trade name we own we are located at 12 Phillip Street thoughts down here in Christchurch we have a total staff of 10 and distribute to all of New Zealand next January s big trading we 'll be celebrating 18 years in business Deshmukh was the first company to bring bio packaging into the South you know as it was then the vast majority of oil packaging in Christchurch ends up in the landfill I want this to change at the moment there 's a lot of noise concerning single-use plastic bags and disposable coffee cups we have an amazing opportunity to make a difference in environment but without the help of councils such as yourselves this is very hard to do so I 'm here today to introduce to you crushin City Council the future of packaging I 'm also asking you for help to Ben polystyrene a growing number of cities and countries around the world are banning foam even Asia where foam containers are manufactured they are bent yet we 're permitted here we have an extensive range that has been made and designed to be composted which we which would be well suited for all applications such as cafes supermarkets restaurants and council run events yet the public constantly asks us where can this product go to be composted and we have to tell them do it yourself or put it in the red burn a full arrange is better and by a short quality there 's a suitable for organic composting feedstock this range would also eliminate the need for sorting a very time-consuming process we fully understand that to make this happen there has to be some strict rules in place otherwise this would contaminate composting down the line but in a closed closed-loop environment as what the court such as council events that this would be the way to go you can 't you see on your desk in front of you you 'll see a coffee cup and lit that lid there is the world 's first domestically compostable but we 've actually taken a long time to develop it that there will compost in a domestic compost in three weeks and disappear I noticed that a lot of the councillors here to Dayton people are drinking out of coffee cups with plastic lids by simply asking your cafe to remove that plastic lid and use that live there you will remove 15 times the amount of plastic that is actually in a cup just by removing that lid I was hoping today here to have for again I 've only got a couple here but this is something that we 're developing this as potentially another world first it is a coffee cup made out of entirely the same material as the lid that has no plastic or PLA lining inside of it and again that will compost in three weeks and a domestic compost then i 've got examples here of palestine fill containers that is currently getting used that goes to the dump I 've also got some examples of what we would actually have as a replacement fully compostable packaging that has been approved by shore quality even the lunch that you 're about to eat here today we supply that to fully lunchbox these guys doing an amazing job and even for those guys it 's like interviews where does they end up I 've got a brief presentation here the Ruffman salat but it 's just this is the first time for me just skipping through here so people can see so again a very here is a brand that we 've created it 's gonna single isn 't that cool did basically as does the mugshot of me but what was that past that that one okay sorry this mean all right okay so this is an example of compostable food packing image packaging and actually more products of it this is our range the lids that you see on there now we have a PE t plastic which is highly recyclable there is a problem with packaging out there at the moment and it looks like that there and it 's made of a product called PLA it is an incredibly unstable product and there 's nowhere in New Zealand they can actually compost it so it goes to landfill so this is the change there 's no reason why that people and events can 't use this here and there is last but not least a coffee cup so there 's my presentation we 're looking for change we 're looking for help from the council to actually stop the stuff here we 've reached that five minutes but I guess that part of the reason for having you come and this morning as to ask council staff I mean obviously you know how many picked it up you know been down stairs getting a cup of coffee so and how many how many how much at least placed it did you say 15 15 times being tired what is in a cab right it surrenders alright so so I think that we should ask it sort of formalize a equipped reservation okay that 's right would you would you not get your committee sorry yeah speaker on to arrogance people to see if this would be okay remember the presentation available yeah I 'll move that we refer this matter to the sustainability no innovation and sustainability committee and and to ask them to report back with a consideration of the other Venus as well as yet they asked the events of people for a report on whether this could be yeah but it 's also committee also in house use yet within the council 's yeah you know yes so I 'm amazing runway and you would you like to see conduct with my right um yeah hang on sorry I wasn 't expecting a debater possible funding Avenue but I 'm just trying to find out there yeah okay so there 's no need for questions or comments on on there we were fearing each other committees but you may comment about what it would include and I just want to make sure that it all include our procurement policy as well what 's a report on what options they might including procurement it 's just referring it to the Committee on to the standard so we 're just referring it to the committee we 've got a very good presentation from our beans Timur doing a great job so I think it 's right for this to come to the committee before we start putting a rule and other things if you don 't understand it yeah yep good so so it 's been moved that it be referred to the innovation sustainability committee for consideration and we 'll just leave it at that leave out the the risk because that I mean it 's actually not standing orders yep full stops all right that 's been moved by me seconded by Bucky back aye those are I know that 's scary right thank you very much very much ok deputations by appointment there are none _"

    "text": "so now we move to the final open agenda item which is item 23 decision-making for resource consents thank you welcome to the table is there any initial comment on this report by way of introduction actually what has happened since our last meeting was some amendments to the recommendation staff recommendations and that is around recommendation a is the key one which has changed to refer applications with a high degree of complexity to a hearings panel thank you are there any questions on this for staff I wonder if the high degree of complexity is the tomb that we actually want I understand I understand where you come up with it but I just wonder if it 's more a high degree of public interest to you and all completes the deal with something um maybe my legal advisors that would create significant risks for the counsel process wise because public controversy is not a relevant consideration under is this the tomb that 's required under the age okay thank you thank you any further questions young just we we got a memo around the whole idea of wondered whether that 's something that we could adopt a position on we 'll get a report back on and we can cover that at a later date is this that 's around Appeals or judicial reviews to the court yeah it 's a slightly different matter than what we 're considering but we can have a separate discussion about that is it possible to put a note on that because it seems to me if people aren 't notified and they challenge then they have to go through a judicial process which can be very expensive and costly and we should be considering I think our policy aroma I mean I 'm happy to have that discussion a separate meeting but I think there 's a different discussion you know establishing a process for that to come back to us or for us to have that discussion yeah okay so is there a process that 's already underway or is there something no there isn 't say it 's obviously an issue that 's just cropped up on a recent judicial review application and I think it would be as a matter that presumably the council tenders mind and approving the delegations register which establishes delegations or second costs and judicial review proceedings and on appeals okay thank you and then just the other question was is there any auditing of the commissioners who we appoint and there 's a lot of focus on elected members and it 's kind of interesting that some of those commissioners are people that have written opinions about elected members but what 's the process for us monitoring their performance the recommended process and recommendation see is that an audit be carried out and their audit will cover that decision-making of a by a commissioner or another decision-maker but an answer to your question there is no specific auditing of commissioners and those commissioners except through the procurement process so commissioners to get on the panel go through a procurement process where they 're thoroughly evaluated and that happens in really three years I think is it possible to be more explicit under say that we 're not engaging someone that the week getting someone who is actually independent from having received previous company communicative accomplice is actually independent not someone who 's worked for us oh no not a previous someone who 's commissioner will make decisions yes we can 't_''_265.12 do that that 's that can be done although these twinky decisions might not be commissioner only it might be hearings panels it might be staff and it could be commissioners as well so it could be either of those decision makers that are being reviewed as part of those 20 but we can include some of those in the 20 thank you and just a final question was around their judicial process I think is really good we in that we ordered independent decisions but are we also looking at getting a report back on High Court decisions or Environment Court decisions and what the learnings are I 'm staff staff do review there 's there 's lots so staff gets seen a case law summary every every week a case look summary reviewing all the recent cases that have come through the courts secondly we run case law training seminars as well we get that from our own legal provide that through I was many more the ones we like we 've been we 've been taken to court and the decisions been issued and then how do we learn from that how do we improve from that if we found to be wanting so we haven 't had a successful we haven 't_''_338.68 been in a judicial review situation for many many years we do take the learnings back to what we call our unit meeting after every Environment Court appeal decision this is not a whole lot of them there 's maybe one two or three a year so it 's not it 's not a lot of them Thanks thank you any further questions all right so update Oh Hollis is gonna make one suggestion sorry yeah that 's right it 's D is repetition of C so in the last bit of C is just essentially being repeated in D so I don 't think DS necessary so we can remove paragraph D yes okay so let 's do this and then Dave you 're happy to move this do we have a seconder all come to your questions link Jamie will second okay and then Glenn will come to your question sorry it 's just what we 're elected members part of hearings panels do they receive for remuneration ah yes they do they do on top of their existing is one of the few panels that to our immunity remunerated okay okay so this has been moving second is there any debate is there any debate on this yawning I think you I mean I think it 's really good practice to look at what 's working well and what 's not working well and look to how we can improve and I think that the whole issue of notification is as much as central government policy and in particular in Christchurch I think it 's important to note that the government through the statement of expectation and the order and council run a district plan review made that a key legal strategic direction for the city not through the choice of counsel but through the choice of government that to reduce notification requirements and I just don 't think the community understand the government has done to our district plan has meant that they get often not notified of things that they might feel I was important to them so I think it 's good that we can do this work here to look at how these decisions are being made so within what little ability we have we can take the opportunity to look at how we can improve I do think there 's real concern around the community expectation of being involved in decisions local planning decisions and the ways and we those planning decisions are being made and it would be good to start to look at how we can improve that so I would welcome this and I look forward to getting the audit I think we 've also been told that 30 of June 2020 is like sort of the last day but that that they my understanding is there 's an indication that stuff will work sooner rather than later on getting that first order to us and I think that would be really useful thank you Dave and I think you look I 'd just for the report this has actually been ongoing since about October November 1915 and it 's sorry 2015 some of these regulatory things do take a while that you said look it 's been on our books now for almost two years I think and it 's gone backwards and forwards I 'm very comfortable with what 's what 's before us today and I 'm happy to recommend that it be approved thank you very much I know council processes can sometimes take a long time but 1915 well longer ago was and I 'm able to remember let alone care to remember okay so I will put the motion all those in favor or against that 's carried thank you and thanks it out for the work this _"

    "text": "thank you okay now we move to item would move back to the Cranford matter which is item 21 so back to item 21 and we adjourned for lunch midway through this and counselors were in the process of working up an amendments to the recommendation where did we get to with wording on that amendment we didn 't we didn 't get is that did you want to speak to that bridge all right so maybe we can hear from staff first of all in so Brendan you want to just take us through any further developments since we broke for lunch yeah sure so Richard know what we 've shown that most of the kind of technical questions and watch they had Bimini particularly about the hydrology ships rationale of Cranford and the consequences implications of what this decision that is near front of Council has mostly been addressed but so I brought lunch canceller you 're Hinton and introduced proposed draft amendment which was needing some work on and in the question a particularly of bruges they joined us just to reassure act or summarize what we I think it 's important that councillors are aware and of the requirement in the eighth and the great across which regeneration act and that the regeneration plane must remain consistent and with the outline plane and this is an a showstopper by any stretch in the nation ocean and in print advice to you was really clear or it 's simply pointed out and it 's part of your consideration showing that the formal plane remains consistent with the draft we didn 't include specific such is a probability in the draft that print advice to you that you can make such changes still stains and then once we kind of just over that procedural issue the other advice that you received was kind of materiality the materiality in terms of what 's being proposed to or trying to be achieved through the proposed amendment was to introduce at least a proportion of the homes which if broke if the plane is approved in Cranford would be affordable of some description and the advice from staff was very clear on it and with being very clear that Cranford and means that the development costs are already going to be relatively high for such land equally the plane has always been consistent and that we 're seeking and high environmental outcomes in terms of the sustainability of the development so just to put that all together and we 've got constraint Lane that his quite high development costs and we 're after high-quality environmentally sustainable housing and also aid and now at the 11th they are condition of affordability and the opinion of staff will make it virtually impossible to get off the ground and the basis for that is and the exemplar projects that we have sought to deliver over the last couple of years under the lameness recovery program in others that have sought both sake very strong environmental outcomes in affordability and haven 't been problems edge right until mr. not successful and but haven 't delivered on the outcomes that we 've been seeking so and balance those two I mean also try and do that on lien that his significant development requirement to go into it on staff a voice is that that won 't step further the consequence of that may well be an intentioned but it might mean that the developments then don 't go ahead which means that what we were seeking to achieve in the very first instance of intensification in an area and within a couple of hundred meters of Northlands and service Boyd strong transport languages on the soccer wise hasn 't achieved which then and the claret the the consequence of there is that you start looking at going forwards opportunities and you get to the situation that Richard was describing that rather than intensification and you end up with their sprawling city and so we simply think it 's important to step through those and implications for counselors so that you aware because we hadn 't been able to hear in the consideration would fight about what the implication of including affordability and this conditioners but and and the time available we have wanted to bring to your attention that there are some significant consequences that you 'll want to be remind in your consideration notwithstanding that we do have staff suggestion if you were seeking to we have to put it up the sectional turn pro two of the draft waiver of regeneration plane so that 's the section that refers to the instrument that we would seek to execute with the developers they amended to include to make reference to affordable housing okay so we 've got two different potential amendments or two suggestions for amendments in front of us here one of which is shown here has been moved by Yanni the staff seek through a memorandum of understanding to achieve a percentage of the uplift to be used by the Council for social or affordable housing so presumably they 're what we mean is a percentage of any uplift in land value i struggle and to interpret exactly what the resolution was 7-8 that counselor your hints and what want to the modernist yeah absolutely we just sorry we just heard that sections are sewing for huge huge amounts of money in the center so to me it seems perfectly reasonable I think um councillor Easton had a suggestion that we should define affordable housing by the council 's description of affordable housing debate but that 's not the only issue what I 'm keen to do though if we 're gonna have a resident which is going to be capable of in Milton 's second it we need to know what the wording of that is gonna be so yummy the wording the all wanting to put forward is the wording we 've got here my suggestion was that we just specify a little bit more clearly a percentage of any uplift in land value just so that it 's clear what we when we say uplift what we 're actually referring to yeah no yep so they 're not associated or any offer Finland value yeah and just remember words sake and remove the words sake okay and we would also then remove the word to I would imagine as well blow me Miranda understand okay what with what you were saying in prison that it 's not doable that 's not a staff suggestion that when I read that so for a member in his understanding we seek to achieve a percentage of any uplift in lane value so I used by the Council for social affordable housing who are they that verbatim via that sounds as though that we would effectively text and profit on a land and we would use that anywhere for social or affordable housing five times increase in land value as a result of rezoning the council would take a small percentage of it and use that anywhere for social or affordable housing I think we 're going asking the same question but yeah that question was what you were saying cool is that that 's not doable I won 't bleep it 'll be doing the third moon of understanding because a member of a memorandum our understanding would require to be signed by both parties it and the expectation I assume would be the developer wouldn 't voluntarily signed a memorandum a Memorandum of Understanding to be effectively taxed by Council when that wasn 't a requirement if they didn 't they would be a fear assumption or thought yeah okay so yani this is what you 're wanting to move yeah yep okay is there a second or for this way okay that now leaves us with there 's a staff suggestion that section eight point two point two if the draft Cranford regeneration plan is amended to make reference to affordable housing now in as much as staff are putting this forward I 'm assuming that this is doable and it is a way that you can see that we might be able to weave the context of affordable housing into this document I don 't think it 's staff writer suggests an agreement the the staff recommendations already there so if a counselor wanted to make it okay yeah poster we were simply trying to make durable the proposed amendment slightly higher yeah okay when you say durable we can put it with the developers agreement into a memorandum of understanding does it lead to affordable housing for the reasons that I 've outlined really oh I don 't think this is you 'll be speak for affordable housing so when you say make reference to affordable housing what does that actually mean we 're trying to make sure that we don 't sink the entire arrangement by those type this is a good location for affordable housing well okay and that comes back to almost the proposed agreement about that 's a tax on someone making profit deliver somewhere else across the city okay so as a matter of process then what we 've got in front of us now is the original recommendation paragraphs one and two we 've had a proposed amendment which failed for want of a seconder do I have a mover for the recommendation oh they 're already moved there so that 's already moved and seconded that 's a long time now okay can I just check then so the staff response to the submissions that asked for affordable housing and housing choices what exactly so as as Brendon alluded to we we think that there 's real issues with getting affordable housing and this location and addition when you take the development constraints and addition to the sustainability criteria we 've introduced into the outline development plan two and two together it 's very difficult for you to get affordable housing when you do that do we see that there 's anything of idea the regeneration should include regeneration or also types of housing options and choices for people unaware of anything but but I guess what this would go back to is when we did do the draft our line if we wanted affordable housing as part of the criteria that was going to stem from this regeneration plan we should have sorted thin so the difficulty is introducing something at a late stage which is not in the outline but I don 't think there 's anything in the act which refers said it does refer to it does referred broadly to social and economic another type factors but I don 't think it gives specific in terms of portability that the Act doesn 't require that every regeneration plan includes affordable housing that 's not a requirement of the Act okay Glen thank you there 's an issue I can 't get past and it 's this one on page 211 and seven point four which is actually under alternative option one not submit the draft play infer of you in it it reads this option would be consistent oppose the dark plan until an alternative choice you like the discharge stormwater has made a baby so my question is why would we proceed with an option that actually opposes the position of Tahu yeah sure and if someone to that question that you had asked earlier on that and the Act doesn 't require all section 29 partners including my Tahu to in agreement with the proposal of early proponent in in fact what the requirement on regenerate crushed Church is is to consider the views of a proponent so what the council does and is the proponent of this plane in addition to submitting the plane we also provide a summary to regenerate crushed Church of the views of the the situation partners under their grade across future generation eight in in this case we 've we simply say to paraphrase that night our who doesn 't support the plane for the reason that they can 't support their boss trusses they can support discharges endorse you like and that that 's not a decision that the council is being asked to make that 's a decision equally and wrecking immediate to the Minister for approval that the minister will take into consideration thank you that actually tells me a lot about the act and its view on our relationship is a partner okay given that we already had gone through questions and answers before we got to moving and second thing and coming into debate and having an amendment and that process I 'm assuming that there aren 't going to be more questions at this stage so the original recommendation as in the agenda that we have brought to the meeting has been moved and seconded is there any debate on that okay so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against okay that 's carried did those who voted no want their votes recorded against okay so that 's Glen fell Pauline and Dion and Yanni voted against and that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "right so we 'll reconvene the meeting so I 'll call the meeting back to order and just a reminder of where or where we 're at what we will do next as we 'd always committed is that will do the yelled Hurst village subdivision item 26 next and then we 'll come back to Cranford and then we 've got item 23 still to do to complete the open agenda and then we 'll move into public excluded at that point so that brings us neatly to an item 26 the altos village subdivision just a reminder of where we were at with this last week we are two weeks three weeks ago might even be three weeks ago we had an open session and the public excluded session we then had questions and answers in both of those sessions we heard from a number of submitters we heard from the community board we went through question answers we went into debate and then obviously at that time it was moved and carried that we would leave this matter lying on the table pending any outcome from arbitration that we remain in debate what I 'm proposing is that we get an update from Rob on the arbitration question I 'll then be happy to take any questions on the arbitration matter bearing in mind that we 've already had questions and answers on the substantive issue and then we 'll continue with the debate well we need to get a mover and seconder for something and then we 'll continue with the debate and make a decision so on that basis Rob good afternoon welcome to the table thank you very much and if we can start by you giving us an update on the arbitration matter which was the reason why we deferred this to this meeting thank you mr. chair and councillors I I communicated with both infinity and and the opposing group to clarify the details so they there was a hearing took that tour was to take place the day after the count the last council meeting and that was as council Turner has indicated the reason for the deferral that that occurred what it was was a telephone conference with the arbitrator understand it it has set a number of steps and a timetable there is to be a further timetabling telephone conference in certain le September and it 's anticipated that a full hearing if necessary will take place in the first quarter of 2018 so it didn 't resolve itself on the 7th of July and it 's heading towards a hearing in early 2018 thank you so given that we 've already had questions and answers on the substantive issue are there any questions on the advice that we 've just received the update that we 've just received okay Jimmy one question just want to know if we go to the staff accommodation today whether you know the council we 're overriding the resource concern Act and also to our right in the subdivision the resource concern the session and there is now they the the the officer report that you have in front of you this is sense to you you have a have a question to answer under the 1974 Local Government Act it sets out what what boxes need to be ticked before that that compliance with the resource consent and the advice that the report contains says that yes all those boxes are ticked so they can can make the resolution and the 1974 act thank you okay so in order to proceed from here I need somebody to move something question Erin yep yes so just my question is and it refers a little to this evening for actors around that this is a dedication versus feasting which normally happens I 've seen a few of those who come through someone develops that link then comes into position of a council so on and so forth this process seems very unusual and so when something unusual crops up I get concerned why are we going down that road and the the dedication process under 1974 Act and the other type of process which might be more common under the Resource Management Act is are two parallel processes they were in the end result erode is the same they are both equally legitimate processes for for an implicant development to follow so then why not just use the regular visiting process that we usually down this road well that 's not a question I am able to answer but I suppose the only thing I can say in regard to that as as you know I 've given legal advice to you about about those matters in in px but all I can say is that it is it is an application that they are entitled to make to you it is perfectly normal and perfectly normal legal application that they 're entitled to make in that you are required to make a decision about so and that may be that may be the case because it does exist that just seems odd that it 's the first time for this council that it 's that it 's come through this way versus the other way of not saying this never a time for first but you normally do something in particular way for a reason then you change for another reason I just not not seeing that reason but the other thing is I 've been made aware that there 's a court case currently happening where the property owners are taking the come back on the council or can we be implicated in that viable decision today but what I can 't answer that question because I know nothing about the case but perhaps I can answer it this way if there is a case between people who are in a contractual relationship and they are suing each other for breaches of that contractual relationship that would have nothing to do with the council yes but we do become involved in this by the dedication of this rhodol we become part of it eventually as is the way that a development happens so there 's no way that we will get and caught out anyway here you the council cannot prevent people suing it people are entitled to sue and the council if they wish I would obviously can 't give advice to you without a lot more detail about whether that would be successful if somebody did decide to sue you what I am saying is that in a general sense a contractual argument between two parties who are not the council is unlikely to involve the council in any legal covered this earlier on just two questions one is who 's the suitable guarantor and the second one is what 's the relationship between the storm water access Arrangements and the dedication of the road [Music] well the the the suitable guarantor is somebody that we decide when the guarantee is presented is as an acceptable party so I don 't have a name or a list I can put in front of you but that 's a that that 's just a matter of making sure that the guarantor is somebody who 's Gimli is solvent and available to pay so the second question we 'll just in regard to the city will go can can you just given the history of this case that seems like an incredible risky thing to do I can 't like all I can all I can say in that regard is as a sail giving you legal advice about we about what things you need to consider and respect of this application and what things you can 't consider I can 't really take that if so the consideration of a suitable not something that I can dentists your isn 't something that I can give you advice episode and the signature stone I 've already given advice about the second question was um I was what surprised to be asked us honest some sort of stormwater agreement so can you just help me understand what the stormwater relationship is we heard deputations previously in that regard so what 's the relationship between the stormwater design and the writing and what would being asked to do today so I think the the answer the answer to that question is is is this as the report says officers have checked this subdivision against all the relevant requirements of the subdivision consent in the Resource Management Act and it complies as the report says that 's that 's what you need to look at and consider and end and what that says is that the stormwater what that what that what the situation is is that the stormwater requirements as set out in the consent that 's relevant to this question are complied with cirrhosis I guess I mean it may just be concept be asked to enter into a stormwater agreement a day or two days before we 've got the city coming back to us the this the storm the storm water agreement is is not part of this particular application there 's not there 's not related it 's not directly related this particular application this is consonance in the sense of the question that you 're being asked to decide today years thank you Dave I 'm not thinking of hearing that then affect we being asked to make a decision on this matter will we we 're being given advice that the course of action that 's been taken is legal and we have we they have little options on what I am still unclear on although you told me that the dedication of this road is a lawful process till now I 've still not and this is the first time that this has been used by the cross tree of City Council I still do not have any idea of the implications that arise from dedication versus visiting and whether there is a distinct advantage to one it says councilor Qian see this is the first time and when something unusually different to what we have done the arises I would really like to hear the way this option is preferable to having it visited as you just seen mr. O 'Connor has just gotten got into my ear I 'm sorry I may have been too cautious and what I told what I 've what what I 've said Mr O 'Connor tells me that this council has done this process at least two or three times in the time that he has been here the latest being something to do with some writing at the airport still doesn 't answer the question what is the difference between dedicating a road and vesting the road for your purposes in making this question there 's no asking this question answering this making this decision there 's no difference there are just two possible there were two parallel there there are two possible paths to get to the same result ie Road and the developer is entitled at law to come to you and ask you to use this has happened before well I 'll ask the question rather is there an advantage to the developer and having it dedicated rather than Vista my answer to that is that 's not a relevant question for you okay so the question has been asked and answered are there any further questions okay Vicki yes developers lawyer explained to us at the last meeting and I just want to check whether this is your understanding as well in terms of the parties to this fit I think you see going from memory so I may have it wrong I think he said seven in favor of heads signed something in favor would perhaps I can clarify therapy later because there has been some further communications about that question and then I have undertaken across Jack so of there are 13 titles land titles which hold the covenants which with which owned if you like the covenants that are registered on this piece of piece of road this piece of land to become right of those 13 Infiniti hold I 'll use the red discharge it 's not actually there 's seven of the title owners have agreed to withdraw the covenants there are two who have infinity and I 've seen the document have non opposition of agreement so while they haven 't seen we will here 's our discharge they won 't oppose to this judge and there are four opposed thank you thank you deal I just wanted to ask question whether the mortgagees of the particular landowners have been notified I do not know the answers that question because in order for us to make a decision as far as I know just lead agreed and some of the legal understanding of this they need to be notified as well that that again is not of is not a question for you it 's a question we can 't make a decision under the Public Works Act 1981 and 1618 yeah you know the mortgages have been important right you 're not making your the council 's decision is under Section C is under a section of the Local Government Act 1974 not you 're not making a decision under the Public Works Act so if you we make the decision we 've been asked today in the absence of that information yes the answer is yes thank you okay so we 've exhausted all questions great so yarny would like to move well there are two there 's a staff recommendation and there 's a community board recommendation Jonnie isn 't moving the community board recommendation and Jimmy is seconding that itself foreshadow their staff recommendations or however you want to serve Vicky you 're foreshadowing does in the event that what has been moved by Yanni and seconded by Jimmy fails you will then move the staff recommendation and would there be a seconder for that at that point yes they would okay great so that 's the context in which we 're working in now we have therefore got the community board recommendation moved and seconded is there any debate on that Yanni this has been a long-standing issue in this local community it 's been in front of council and the board a number of times a number of those counselors have said that we support the community boards being you know like complexity of this case and the work that the community wood has done on it that we should respect the resolutions that have come from the local community board it 's not an easy issue to deal with I understand that it is very complicated but actually I think for me the issue should be resolved through the private parties not not through council making the dedication as we 've been asked to do and I am particularly concerned around the issue of a suitable guarantor and given the history of this development I would find that an incredibly risky proposition for us to to make so I won 't be supporting the staff recommendation of support the local community people and that 's why I 've moved the the broad recommendation I would say that I do also struggle to understand why the stormwater is not related to the writing it seems to me very hard to design a stormwater system without knowing what your rating system is and surely they should be done at the same time so I personally can 't see how this can be resolved don 't believe we should be making one decision today that could prejudice the outcome of other things outstanding Jimmy Jimmy in catch air yeah you 're in a communal meeting I supported the majority controller members decision go to the option to but today in comes people in my view decision not any change because as a councillor for more than six and a half years I never seen a you know issue like this one who is so complicated and regarding to the resource concern Act and also the contentious for extension for more than six years other ones may gather the lots of information from the staff information from the legal advice and also from the developers the reputation as well as name owners reputation all those the information give to me love info Council we go to the option one to theta K the row rather than the option the two to kind of offer you know the this solar the whole case the situation properly more or less is a risk of all council all right in this the resource concern detector and also this particular no open to us we compare two options it looks like a steer the option to much debated or than the option one because why we will review here particular studies show us the first the perception by the lane owners who have interesting in the land then a council is using an unusual state to dedicate the road in favor of the developer only ignore the other name honest like an interest unless the stop the information and also that in here particular greeted the council not being involved in removing the carbon under the property law Hector therefore there are no other disadvantage in option two so still step the developer still proceeds with the variation and relating the safety the improvement if let you you know why that we are not going to the option to rather than the option one and also the reason we as a council with receiver information summary information even right now I still know any dirt confirmation that answer while so founded the daily Parker one you know the particular keep the the the remind us the authority under the out of context and should not be used the subject subdivision head but regarding a stop in Surrey no student the difference so pup for us in the shortened period how to way to identify know which one is correct and also we receive the information from the lawyer the cover leach lawyer the Tula avail or region D River noble in the mostess and other learning illness the particular emphasis in here you know your will be aware the excess salt is a temporary the measure only because once the new intersection opens louder 22 master waste as a legal role as per the Covenant recording on your class the title and resource concerns fear of obtained by the developer so this quite clearly you know gave us a signal the stupid code to the quarter you know sooner to a developer know to remove loss equivalent role in a console you know to kind of the you know to to to kind of to to the reduce the the way so based on this the informational this why I still prefer the option to rather than option what risk or counsel over right in his research comes a subdivision of the issue thank you Dave type and thank you for myself in a rather invidious position here where legally we are told that we have little option but to go with this resolution but my reasoning and logic and me raises alarm bells that something 's not quite right in this whole process that 's been going on for a long time I wasn 't at all happy with the explanation between dedication and vesting there have been a number of questionable processes in this whole ordering I really feel it should not be this council that is making a decision like this at this time there are so many things that are unresolved between property owners in the developer here and with some regret on not going to support the staff resolution I am going to go with the the community board resolution for a number of reasons which have been adequately explained by councilor tuna and others thank you picking our you 'll be surprised to know that an Community Board resolution which wasn 't unanimous to meet with the adjoining property owners to discuss options on a way forward so you 're actually suggesting that accounts will become the mediator in this dispute and I am not at all in favor of it this has been going on for a very very long period of time and it is a dispute between private property owners I am NOT keen that the council puts itself middle and center of that dispute and takes a huge amount of well I don 't know who 's meeting with them whether it 's counselors or staff or who thinks that they 're going to resolve this issue which is currently at arbitration I think that 's a very dangerous precedent for the council to see it when we were at the community board the legal advice could not have been clearer it 's seldom you get such clear legal advice on the implications of the resolution that was incredibly clear at the community board it was incredibly clear to us last time the issue for the for the council is a range of issues as we heard just before 7 have agreed to the conditions if I can ask people in the public gallery please to remain quiet thank you and to have signed an on opposition that leaves for an opposition out of three as I understand it and and that 's the information that I 've been given I just think that in the in this issue there were other issues raised at the last council meeting where one of the speakers talked about the safety of your toast road and that strikes me as really really important in this issue we have traffic lights that have been unusable for a very long period of time and consequently risks to users of your test Road whatever happens in this case it will end up no doubt as a dispute between private property owners that 's fine I am NOT keen that the council becomes center of that dispute and I am NOT keen that we put ourselves at risk from from what we do so because we 've had that very clear advice I want to go with the staff recommendation as supported at the community board do share some of councillor bucks concerns and because of that and to maybe help get the result that some of us want to see here at us that you 've put one and two separately I 'm happy to do it because I would agree with Vickie on the second one that I don 't really want the council involved in that but the first one I have reasons for voting the way I will and I 'll vote in favor of supporting the community board it wasn 't unanimous but that 's democracy but democracy is that community board Jimmy 's also the Council for their area and and where the traffic lights are I 'm on the other side of the road so we 're neighbors there we see we share the concerns I just want to touch on a couple of things as everything else has been covered with the feeling titles seven withdrew their opposition they didn 't support I think that that 's a considerable difference and in the wedding they withdrew the opposition they didn 't say yeah hey we 're really keen look would I think some of them have given up till you went for an on a post and four will be probably died in the ditch over this one they will fight this to the end of the world and and they have a right to do so because they stand to lose a lot they stand to lose a lot because there 's been some dubious practices involved in the subdivision we are not voting on that today or have anything to know that today and that does not even play into our decision-making but the thing I will highlight is that there is a court case where the developers are being taken to court for constructive fraud and that does consume me because we will be dedicating or potentially dedicating a road which is part of that case into our name and for me these alarm bells there and I just think if you 're that cautious sort of counselor then you would go for the community board option which is to just steer clear this and it 's already says it 's going to go through we play lawyer judge and jury and come up with a decision and dedicate this road I don 't think we should and so I 'll support the local council and the community board and what seems to be the bitter of a bad situation so as a cautious councillor I 'm actually going to be following the legal advice really clear I 'm really uncomfortable with the history of this but the history of it has become a civil measure in not one that we should be stepping into and so I completely agree with councilor back there and if I ask people in the public gallery please remain quiet thank you we 've been presented with a report which details you know something that we have the the applicant is legally able to ask us to do and and I 'll be following the advice their end going with the foreshadowed promotion and end against this one here right Jimmy I 've never seen an issue like this and I hope I never see an issue like this again as I 'm sure other people in the room there are a number of aspects of this that are really an ongoing and protracted private property dispute and as I said at the last meeting you know there 's little that we 've seen that suggests that that protected private property dispute is likely to be resolved anytime soon separating out what 's relevant to the question that we 've been asked today and what 's not not relevant to the question that 's been asked today has also been quite complicated and there was a lot of time spent on that at the last meeting as well my natural instinct would be to go with the local view to go with the community board to go with the local councillor and again we 've taken advice around the two options that are in front of us today the two approaches that are in front of us today and what we 've heard is that this quite rightfully is being put to us as a valid process by the developer we maybe haven 't seen this happen too many times in the past but it is a valid process areas and that we 've heard this afternoon has happened in our area in the past as well albeit maybe on a small number of occasions but more than anything I 've heard the legal advice some of which has been provided to us in public excluded and I 've heard that loud and clear and in terms of balancing the various aspects of the decision that we 've been asked to make there are a number of things that we 've had to take into account and that balancing act is one that we 're all very very used to but the balance for me is one where I 'm going to totally rely on that legal advice and therefore will be voting against the motion that 's in front of us at the moment and supporting the foreshadowed motion that 's on the table so I Dion you hadn 't indicated you wanted to but yes you can right now I just wanted to quickly say that I 'm actually going to support the community and the people in this who have come to us as well and an email I got a few weeks ago and saying leadership is about doing what you feel is right and sometimes laws aren 't right and sometimes doing legal process isn 't the right thing to do and indicated by what is on the board up there that they 're going to go through a legal process yet the legal process work out what 's right for these people so I 'm gonna do what I feel is right and I 'm going to show some leadership to that to our citizens of Christchurch and vote for them to take this private matter and work it out that way thank you okay so I will so the motion in front of us is the community board recommendation so if you 're in favor of the community board recommendation you will vote yes and if you 're not in favor of the community board recommendation which is the text in blue in front of us you will vote no so all of those in favor oh and I 'm going to put it in two parts yes I am a thank paragraph one first so all those in favor against no can we have a division on that please use counselor Templeton counselor manji counselor Puran yes counselor gathering counselor Chen yes counselor Davidson counselor Kotter no no counselor back counselor Livingston no counselor east yes okay so then we will put paragraph two all those in favor in relation to the resolution I 'll take the further advice and if I could once again caution those into public gallery remain quiet thank you at the last meeting we asked the councillors to add in lot 600 into into the resolution and I 've been advised that the council does not need to make a resolution and respect of lot 600 so I 'm not sure whether the resolution and comes here and whether the proposed resolution includes lot 600 so this is so this is advice on the staff recommendation yes advice on the staff okay so when we get to considering the staff recommendation yeah so when we come to the staff recommendation what we 're hearing is that that does not need to include any specific reference to finish to unring there 's a question really as to whether to stands on its own anyway but we 'll put it in as much as it 's been moved and seconded so part a option all those in favor against no so that 's lost okay so now we come to Vicki your foreshadowed motion which now becomes the motion that we have on the table which is the staff recommendation do we have a seconder for the staff recommendation and Galloway thank you is there any further debate on this okay so I will put that Roshan all those in favor aye against and if we could please have a division on this as well the Gallup cancel a chance Oh David support these cancer properties counselor turn yes counselor go these counsel about yes counselor Livingston Carrie so we 'll declare that carried thank you _"

    "text": "so that now brings us to item 21 the finalized draft Cranford regeneration plan so we 've got staff here for this thank you so Richard welcome back thank you were there any opening remarks that you wanted to make on this report and just to update the leader representatives that this is for approval to submit the draft regeneration plan to regenerate Christchurch so it 's not for approval to say excuse me they will need to go through a process of considering it themselves there may be some changes that they consider appropriate and they would more than likely need to circulate those to the other strategic partners for comment and then they will do a report to make a recommendation to the minister and the minister will make a decision in terms the process just perhaps a quick overview of that and this is responding to a council resolution stemming from last year 's annual plan in relation to what 's referred to in the report the first step in the process was to prepare a draft outline which we did we circulated that to the strategic in December of last year and the gazetted by the minister subsequent to that we prepared a draft regeneration plan which was in accordance with the outline we notified that for public comments we received those comments and now we have the revised draft for you and as I said earlier on that is we are seeking approval to submit that to regenerate Christchurch for their consideration not for approval per se so that 's just a bit of an overview of the process we 're happy to take questions in relation to any other matters so are there questions Phil I do thank you for all the work that 's been done on this I 've asked a few questions has gone along in this the question really is in reference to the area where you the report refers to a flood minge material but also an area responding management and I 'm just really wondering and I think the solution that suggested as of the infill in that area so I 'm just wondering though given that there 's already a high water table how in fact in things at the answering that question there in the bigger context which follows on actually from the previous discussion on Eclair development funny enough and it is that this development is based around a low impact urban design philosophy so it 's around around water management and I think happy and pleased to say that most student planning in a city is hitting towards them so that the whole philosophy of developing this area is making ground water particularly a non-negotiable so the first thing that the developers and landowners need to do if this is approved is to spend a year monitoring groundwater levels and that is part of clearing a hydrogeological plan now there this used to be informed that that subdivision consent and will be part and then the the way in which the design ends up will be predicated largely on that hydrogeological plan now the provisions of the plan are flexible enough particularly at law and development plan to accommodate different housing pen cities so I don 't think there 's any question that at high level what strategic level that housing is the preferred should happen the scale of development and then how is that development implemented so the outline plan identifies some areas which are constrained and those areas I would anticipate being either quite low density in order to preserve that groundwater those groundwater systems or else they 'll be probably clustered but either way the the site coverage of the area I 'd anticipate when the sub when all that work is done as part of the subdivision cusine will be a lot of open ground there and at that stage as the plan notes there will be opportunities to probably acquire through these subdivision process additional linkages streams in that final network will be put in place so from our point of view of high groundwater use of this there have been the whole city 's probably saturated at the moment but there there is something which will be managed as part of that subdivision process so I got the in here from a geotechnical perspective and grogram Harrington from a drainage perspective there certainly may provider and an additional assessment on that but that 's that the approach that guess don 't my other concern too is that in 9 it 's quite clearly stated and it 's good that you have is that the named range system can cope really but the most extreme storm events and I have to say I 've have some concerns about there and you really sang up further technical work may find a way to actually resolve those concerns well personally grant actually interests that it could but around the Cranford basin I mean any it depends on on the on the extent of the stormy Viet that Graham could actually just elaborate on that force just before we jump into that though we need to be of this process with what you have in front of you and context so water does in essence as a as a proposal to change both the regional policy statement and the district plan so that the degree of assessments we 've done at this stage at that at that level we don 't know what people are going to build there yet we know the areas they 're going to build but we don like so there 's always a further degree of analysis that will come at the resource consent in the subdivision stage and and that 's natural that 's that 's anticipated so this is a normal part of the process where you go through a pretty thorough assessment at that kind of plan change stage and then there will be further assessment when the applicants come in for the subdivision and land use consent so they will need to be further analysis at that stage and that that is normal that is part of what happens is part of any process akin to this I 'll leave it up to Brian to speak to them okay there 's some a lot to say the the city itself in inversed areas is subject to flooding in extreme flood events in the area that has been rezoned here will complain to be resigned is no worse really than an awful lot of the rest of the city so we do get flooding in extreme flood events in large part in sea in rem talking about extreme flood events we 're talking about at least one and fifty year event or perhaps at one or two hundred year event so that 's extreme great Thank You Yanni I just wanted to put some wedding in around a requirement for a percentage to be affordable housing so what 's the best way of doing that I think from the outset we should acknowledge and unless there is intervention by social housing agency or something along those lines that there hasn 't much of the housing here won 't be cheap of your like because of the development costs but my understanding is that because of the range of housing that 's going to be provided and the exemplar standards that are imposed we will still get a starting point of around five hundred thousand now that 's anecdotal but and that is over and the the crow 's ears road area at five hundred to five hundred fifty thousand now there that 's not necessarily affordable housing but anything do you think this than there is going to require think more direct intervention relying on a private developed provider so my understanding is through their the developers of this land I presume all the owners are going to and experience a significant increase in value if the rezoning goes a year surely would be fair to expect that something goes back to the community through the provision of some affordable housing given that that 's one of the key objectives okay so what 's recommended in the plan is a memorandum of understanding now at the moment that is around expedited development rather than other private development agreements other than there I am unclear here we can actually negotiate that but that might be one mechanism do it it would be some sort of agreement of exclusionary zoning or something along those lines where there hasn 't being provided for the plaintiff date and given where we 're at in the process you know today what we 're doing is approving the regeneration plan for submission to regenerate Christchurch if there was a desire to do what Yanni suggesting is this the point in the process where we would do that or is there another point in the process where that would become a late in the process to be addressing that issue sorry a notice be clear there was a submission related to affordable housing sorry were you able to respond as councillors to the submissions or is that for someone else we 're we staff officers have considered all the submissions and presented a revised report to you which addresses the issues comments on the issues themselves and makes change it makes changes to the draft regenerate regeneration plan itself I think the key point that Ivan 's emphasized is that this is tricky land to develop it 's gonna cost money to get it out of the ground and the likelihood of getting affordable housing out of the slump that 's at the production and this you 've got someone who wants to intervene to do that and so it wouldn 't be our applies to you that we put something in there in relation to affordable housing because I think that would be tricky to deliver sorry can I just ask the supplementary and that has if in any work done around what the increase in value will be if of net profits or any of those things that will vary right across I imagine will vary across the whole development area there may well be some here is which will be higher than others but I can 't comment on that we haven 't done those sorts of valuations but it would be pretty significant is that fair to say well if the work hasn 't been done it 's probably not much yeah that made it look at man something is wet may not the others I don 't know thank you yeah thank you my questions about the current situation with night Tahu the report talks about the fact that still unresolved so I know that the council may have agreed some months ago or a year ago to go with this but subsequent reports have revealed more information and the status at the moment is that there are ongoing discussions so we don 't actually don 't have revolution around it you are a partner with them the various who know no secret I 'm just trying to reconcile how that works how do we actually where there was the officers have have the view that these there is a potential solution that we are unable to put that for because we don 't have control over that solution or there are possible solutions but they 're not part of this plane they lay out they lie somewhere else we 've put in supporting commitment and to the document effort as to be approved which talks about investigating those potential solutions which is essentially the existing discharge of the upper Dudley Creek diversion and to Horseshoe Lake in its location which is the greatest concern to Knight ah-hoo but that sits and that that decision is really a decision that needs to be made out of the both still water discharge permit Creek Megan Graham has probably I 've got to knowledge I rock the boat a Craven River corridor regeneration plan and it needs to be an LTP decision for this council so the best we can do is really indicate that that is certainly something that is worthy of Investigation and indeed you know staff to consider it as but but it 's not 's static different questions just over the current shovel-ready sections that we have in the whole city at the moment so we know we ever an excess supply of green fields have you got a current figure just approximately on it I was trying to remove it myself I don 't know Ivan might remember the number then the numbers pretty big I guess the benefit of this site is that while it 's technically green field it really is painful you know that it 's in close proximity to existing kic it 's in close proximity to good transport routes rather than expand on the outer fringes of christchurch we see this as an opportunity to use the existing urban area more efficiently Thank You Pauline thank you funny enough one of my questions was going to be that do you think that there 's a possibility that the costs of actually using any of these future houses consented in the whole project could actually outweigh the viability of building in there as opposed that opposite question to Yanni 's because it seems to me there 's so many actually become almost prohibitive but that metz not for us to decide now but do you have a feeling on there there isn 't as I said before the quality they in varies across this whole developing area some I think the indications we 've had from the landowners is that the land which is easy to develop they 're very keen to start so they can only indicate to me they see that there is a you know there 's feasible the other Lane which is going to be constrained I already can 't commit but I know that the price that they 're getting for large sections rounded areas quite high I 've I 've heard of one sitting going for half a million plus for a piece for a half acre piece of dirt down there and so that would seem to me that they are viable right and I think the the aim here is to to make sure they 're these are exemplar properties oh they 'll be in me and totally opposite to afford whether it be in the upper bracket and they 'll in this as potential future costs to counsel so we 've seen a Dudley diversion that went through in 1979 we 've seen another one in 89 and now we 've seen a 48 million dollar one going through in 2017 considering climate change and increased storm surges in school meetings could there be a likelihood that will be called to put and use another diversion through it possibly you know multi-million dollar costs and another 10 or 15 years we would pick up the tab for them don 't leave the typical answer to prayer about the diversion but but I think there 's a couple of broader issues to consider in terms of council 's role and enabling land supply look if we asked a lot my grow theory east we do have a lot of land around which is potentially ready for development but but we are one of the high growth areas across the country and if you don 't go here or go on the Central City you 'll go out of the edges of the city and there 's always costs with that as 're trying to encourage intensification is because generally the infrastructure costs at lease then what you faced with greenfield sites so as the land Truckee Issa does there 's no getting away from that but but it 's not a if the lands tricky here it doesn 't mean you need to do something somewhere else so there 's always a comparison there the other issue tonight is there will be development contributions associated with this now that 'll depend on the yield the the number of sections that come out of it and the residential neighborhoods owners quite enabling in that regard so we don 't have a an overall number to say this is what it will be but if you assume is going to be three to four hundreds at circa 30 K section that 's quite a reasonable amount of return to cow so in relation to development contributions to pay for infrastructure that will be required to enable this development to a cure so that 's just a I think you 're comparing apples with eggs here because the thing is this is a very yet another mitigation and the form of some sort of diversion could well be on the cards in the future but some of us that 's all taken into account regional colic groan speak to the STRs okay just immediately downstream of this proposed rezoning there 's a very large retention urea create the basin and that and all the site retention and so on can very adequately deal with any results of you know flooding and storm water management as a result of this particular rezoning so in terms of this particular site I don 't see it triggering any other major infrastructure requirements for the from stormwater that 's not to say that there won 't be major infrastructure requirements somewhere else in the city not associated with this particular rezoning and the other thing that regarding night ahoo so if could they actually hold up this process by requesting that we address the the current out lead under Horseshoe Lake before this goes ahead thereby also costing us quite a lot of money well if council approves to submit to regenerate Christchurch today and that 'll be as to whether they want to approve it and as it currently stands all go back to my Tahu so if they were ever mind to raise that issue that would come back to us for some further input so no one 's going to stitch this up to actually have to do that that 's what I 'm asking what we 've said in our draft regeneration plan is that we would investigate the possibility of the issue that night our who 's raised but we can 't do it as part of this process itself it is subject to alternative processes such as that there are attack Raven River corridor regeneration but in this process that may expediate that using that really keen deal you know domain so what I 'm trying to do is ascertain the potential for you know costs to the rate payer because of the state and to protect ourselves from it and the other issues too that the community offers you know traffic and immunity there 's a huge traffic impact here we 've got the cycleway down grass administration I 'm wondering team known about this going a heap because we 've already got the shoes at grass near in the main North 's Road and if that 's the only way that can get out well that 's going to be huge issues to so many costs they wouldn 't be picked up by who the council or the developers other ground respond to your earlier one and then I 'm happy to respond to the same in terms of the issues discussed with niter who should transpire that we alter the water outlet from Delhi Creek diversion and spend money there in terms of treatment of the storm water and so on that would meaning that we could probably defer works of a similar nature in krempe Basin because you would be actually treating the same water so you would be able to transfer some of the costs that you might spend at Great Basin down further into the redzone rather than rather than spending in terms of the cycleway I think that 's a real benefit that we 're looking to I guess intensify an area which is adjacent put cycleways in and make them accessible to everyone so the fact that we 're looking for a medium density development adjacent to one of our key transport nodes as I deal with my mind because people can jump on their jump on the bus which goes our main North Road or jump on the cycleway to take them take them into town so they 've got better transport accessibility than a lot of other areas around town yeah the only thing is to still be more you know and cars going across existing the driveways and things are there and just one last quick question if I may how many property owners are in that area at the moment I just noticed those 64 submissions support so I was wondering how many of the supporting submissions but from the actual she 's gonna write I think meet with two in one block enough there see them I think of remember and the other give or take and the grassman Bob asked me brother seeing the grassman we 're gonna cap one case of Rosie 's rock the yard but right thank you all right so do we have a move for the recommendation Mike seconded Dave any debate Yani sort of proposed an amendment okay we and again like I just I 'm a little bit confused about like normally with a district plan there be a hearings panel it 'd be chances to make changes from by that hearings panel this is what we 've been told is just staff recommendations and response the submissions so I just want to check that we 're okay to make amendments is that that 's fine so terms of the regeneration plan process what you 're proposing is what you 're proposing you only gonna be an amendment to the content of the plan yeah in response to the solutions around affordable housing so how does it can we get some advice and staff on how that sits in terms of the regeneration planning process so that the process of the regeneration act in itself was reasonably enabling but but what it does to read council to do is prepare an outline so the outline therefore takes that a step further public consultation which we did and we did offer those people who provided feedback to council and opportunity to come and speak to staff in an independent planning consultant no one took that up so and we did provide them with a revised proposal which we felt best addressed to all the the comments that we received so that was the process that was outlined in the outline itself and we 've got an obligation a legal obligation to follow that am actual were consistent with so if an amendments were to be moved and were to pass today how would that sit within that process does that present an issue or is it can he be out of the process might seek some legal advice on this one but it would depend on what the amendment was that the process to sit down the outline and we 're obligated to follow that process so if the amendment is to the regeneration plan itself that 's that 's something different to changing the process that were followed but perhaps brink and why would it be helpful to get the wording we can give general advice at this stage that an amendment can be made and the reason I say that is that the decision being made by the council today is whether to submit and what to submit to region regenerate christchurch from a draft a generation plan so there are two questions what does submit and whether to submit so the amendment being discussed about what isn 't up yet staff have drafted a draft regeneration plan which went out for community comment staff been made some changes to that plan following getting that community comment that 's for the council to decide whether it wants to submit that document that draft or a very draft to regenerate Constitution right thank you so let 's get some wording for the amendments and yannis or is he gonna move that and we 'll need to get a second to for that and then we can debate it yeah most that the council asked that the regeneration primary include an amendment to as part of the negotiated was it an development agreement or m-i-a m-i-a with the developers a set percentage that wording in the footwell we get either in the form of land or cash cool buildings this is a question to answer what sorry what 's that in question oh my no it 's just um so the concept is that as part of the developed development agreement in our you but like we did with night ah who with persons we had a set figure and we had a set time frame so I would see no reason why this couldn 't be something that we submit to region clusters that we would see that as being a requirement that is the intent of the MOU and that 's that is to make and regenerate cry ships expects us to do this to make to do our best to try and expedite development in to get a certain amount of development owned by certain time and that 's what Mau is seeking to do to know I wanted more explicit noting the value increase that end submission summers and requesting affordable housing right a sipper Center job development they be made available for okay so the wording of council requests that the regeneration plan include a set percentage of affordable housing in the developments is that you want to move so can we can we agree to the wording that we want this amendment to be first of all any way shape or form this there are options for trying to draft provisions that would go until a memorandum of understanding there 's already been a proposal and the draft regeneration plan sorry a draft regeneration plan for Cranford that there is a memorandum of understanding that the council attempts to intern to with developments so something along these lines could be added to it we 'd need to do a little bit of work on the precise drafting of it the resolution in front of the council today seeks support for memory to the general form of the document that 's in front of the council but with further further changes that could be with it made by the chief executive so if you wish to read a resolution and general terms surround me being an addition into the Memorandum of Understanding that would provide for affordable to add one one proviso to that it 's Richard highlighted a moment ago the first stage in the development of a draft regeneration plan is preparation of an outline and that outline was prepared last year and the council approved it and December of last year these requirements and the fact that the final form of the regeneration plan has to be consistent with the outline so I 'm simply flagging that as a possible issue of this resolution is laid ok so yummy what do you want to do yeah so you 'll come down with the wording that 's in front of us affordable housing in the development as negotiated through the email I can I suggest you go with prints suggestion that it 's slightly Vega that it allows for the Memorandum of Understanding to include a percentage of the uplift to be used for affordable housing either here or elsewhere by the council sure is that what you were saying Briggs isn 't something generally worded along the advice of the appropriate wedding I don 't want to derail and have an illegal amendment or happy to go off the staff advice on the best form of achieving that outcome yeah okay so the wording of the amendment then based on that advice is what printer mr. Chia do have a few concerns just that the Esprit mentioned earlier on the outline doesn 't including a reference to affordable housing the draft outlined development plan which forms the part of the regeneration plan doesn 't have any reference to that so the difficulty I see by including it within the and then the outlined development plan is what what 's get what gets included within the district plan so the difficulty with including it in the regeneration plan itself there 's one the consistency issue that brings alluded to but also I think there 's an issue of the the challenge with development developing the site will make it difficult to achieve that additional resolution okay so that 's advice that we would take into account in considering this amendment which has been put forward are we hearing advise that there 's some risk so there may be some there may be some difficulty in might be some practical economic that 's a development economics barrier to achieving there but are we hearing anything that are we getting any advice that 's telling us that we as a matter of process shouldn 't be considering an amendment that looks like this and in my view you 're not giving that advice the advice is you can consider making an amendment like this yeah yeah and and doing so you 're aware of the risks that the risks being the possibility that regenerate Christchurch are not supportive of that addition for whatever reason yeah and the other risk being the practicality of implementation you know okay so that 's I think that 's advice that we 're receiving on this now we 're also at in a position where we 've been going for almost three hours I had indicated we would take a lunch break at one o 'clock and it 's now two minutes past three minutes past in fact we can keep going or my suggestion actually would be that we adjourn this matter and reconvene at two o 'clock to do the do it two o 'clock and then come back and complete this as the last item on the open agenda after that which leaving this hanging at this point isn 't ideal but we had said that we would take a lunch break of one and we have committed that we will be back at 00 to do yell toast so rather than moving an amendment rather than moving that we go outside of Standing Orders and continue beyond 05 and what I would suggest is that we adjourn until two o 'clock at which point we 'll come back and we will do yelled Hurst and then we 'll pick this back up again and if there was any discussion required by staff around how this might sit in any further advice you want to bring us that might be an appropriate opportunity for that to occur as well all right so we 'll adjourn until two o 'clock we 'll be back you know put a gender or two to do yell toast and then we 'll complete this matter and at that point we 're going to public excluded _"

    "text": "we 're jumping around a little bit because we 've got people here for various things let 's now move to item 25 which is good Christchurch economic development strategy and we 've got Tom Hooper here for that does somebody want to bring Tom in thank you so item 25 the Christchurch economic development strategy Tom good morning thank you for joining us welcome and where we 've just moved on to item 25 which is the Christchurch economic development strategy were there any opening remarks that you wanted to make around this paper first of all I 'd like to just thank everybody that 's been involved in there and the development of the strategy in a really wide range of stakeholders engaged this really represents a little bit of a platform for for Christchurch NZ to really hit the ground running around some economic development opportunities and just to make the point as we discussed in the workshop that there there will be a further refinement of this document within the next 12 months in particular working with council around its LTP and the priorities that emerge to refine it further thank you are there any questions for Tom deal so what 's the first thing is that are going to come out of us probably the Christchurch story deal great the the narrative for the city and really focusing on that that positive messaging and an attraction for the city because I just want to say a loon really good saying at the local government conference this who are not doing and I want to see us actually doing some things that better doesn 't come out of this so it 's good to see the Kruschev story so maybe we can get a briefing update about that substage young um what changes have been made based on the feedback that councils gave at the workshop so now the paper was the paper was adjusted to reflect in particular the desire to thinker the desire to incorporate the change thinking around water so in the next in the next 12 months in terms of the review in particular there 'll be there 'll be recognition of the changing if you like the changing space and water tore up the notes that is part of the review that it will certainly consider the emerging issue the first of which tom was touched on which is the effective stewardship of water as a resource in the second is the bit of targeting of groups of citizens which are not in education employment or training but on internships actually in it yes notice if eclis related to not an employment educational training they 're not it 's not capitalized is what otherwise known as and the sorry mate acronym but we 're talking about those general focus so there is a project in the plane and that addresses those issues as there are projects in the plane that address the effective stewardship of water was wrong thank you any further questions pulling I think it 's come up that came up several times only the workshops that we weren 't I don 't think there was an appetite on page 5 1 7 to support the implementation of new irrigation schemes and so I 'm wondering while sex is still in me because I think the rest of it support and improve the efficiency of existing irrigation schemes to effectively and sustainably use the region 's water resource is it 's not is it up to us to the actual document itself also a very page 19 with realizing a potential realizing the potential of Canterbury 's rural economy another new paragraph this I support the introduction of new and improved yes efficiency of existing irrigation schemes typically sustainable use the region 's will release the first line support the implementation of new I so I think the key word in that is sustainably so it 's about the sustainable use of the resource idea okay a lot of odd lighted moves at that line that paragraph be changed to support and improve the efficiency of existing irrigation schemes at cetera so to remove the implementation of new route of the appliance and so you 're happy pauline to move the motion that 's in front of us but with an additional item 5 which proposes that change yes that will be fine these steps right so do you want to come up with some wording then for a first five words of that line six weeks that 's so if you can come up with something that can form part of this resolution that then you 're happy to move that would be great we 'll continue on with questions in the meantime and then when we come to moving we 'll take you as the mover of that amended resolution and we 'll go from there okay so back to you Yanni sorry I didn 't realize you have further questions you know I mean it was exactly on this on this one um so the priority is maximizing the value of land-based production I think that needs to be changed to actually minimizing the the in mitigating the environmental harm of the land-use production and also actually I mean a kind of key point that 's not really captured in here is our environmental well-being I think has a direct correlation to our economic well-being but it really seems still that this is really much focused on a lot a lot of a lot of old-fashioned thinking about you know having big super anchor projects for focused on a lot of things that are just kind of I guess business as usual in terms of an old way of thinking about where the world 's going and particularly around not a very clear priority of the environment than the sort of utmost importance so I mean I 'm just going to wonder like how do we change that emphasis given that we did have in the previous economic strategy a section around minimizing the environmental damage from land use but clearly that hasn 't happened and what we 've seen as a proliferation of rust and recordation to the environment so yeah and I mean I 'm really unhappy about the Christchurch City Council coming to us assess the rural economy for the new farm practices I mean I just want some advice around that whole section around how we can make it more environmentally focused and remove the priority of supporting the increased value of land based production just the specific question that maybe it 's just useful to provide some background context for why the document is what it is so in 2013 the refresh in renewal to reflect I 2017 Christchurch economic development strategy this has been 12 months and the my king and his ahead exhaustive consultation across business public and private sector in communities they 've been breakfast they 've been focus groups focused on the Thames and hundreds or people who have imported into their strategy as it currently sits these widespread support for the strategy and from almost all sectors of the community including the majority of the projects within the strategy so the strategy is made up or both the big game changes and also our I see individual projects the basement has been led I think an exemplary fashion boy said he say in Russia to Zealand has been to the executive Sadie say it 's been approved by the Board of CDC it 's been submitted a throwing the council 's ridiculous agency in we 've also received an informant boyfriend from Tom in the team on the development of it and the council approval as is your prerogative as the final step in this process and what we tried to do is these questions have we can and near effect the final step there are fundamental differences and challenges in the strategy as it 's been developed I think we run the risk of undoing the excellent work that has occurred in the engagement and that 's been successful across many sectors of the community with changes at a very light stage that 's not to say that and council as the formal approver can 't consider and debate changes but are just caution and that the process has been robust in his been thorough in as well supported to reflect the content of the strategy as it is today but having said that I think it is appropriate to have a chance to address Yanis particular question thanks look I would refer you to the very first sentence around maximizing the value of land-based land-based production which has implement the Canterbury water management strategy to effectively manage the region 's broad a resource for economic social and environmental benefit and just oetiker the conversation in the workshop this is not the document to address the approach to water there is the Canterbury water management the city and the region to move forward so trying to relitigate the the hair and wear the very very complex nature of water in the region is not the strategies purvey thank you now their further questions Glen thank you thank you Tom my questions around the a social dimension of the strategy so I it just really high level and kind of is a highlight at the beginning on the cover affordability over housing this how about it the audio think it is I know it looks good comparatively relation to the rest of New Zealand but their housing policy 360s the figure that is deemed to be affordable and if we 'd had a go at the living wage you know even with that according to lower links now there 's still a gap of a high res note 6 so weekly what I 'm thinking is what that along with our multicultural strategy that has been a highlight for the council this tomb where do those leaned in this is there a chance for them to reach higher when we do number two noting that livable is so yes absolutely it 's actually a comparative advantage of Christchurch at the moment in particular compared to compared to Auckland and and Wellington that housing affordability is significantly bit better in this region than it is and others and the other comment that I would make is that the quality of the housing stock is significantly better than other regions I am NOT suggesting that we that we can 't do that we can 't do better but the the relative position of housing affordability in the region is actually very strong and it 's nationally and internationally okay the others must be bathed I think you saw all right now sit in New Zealand applies to Christchurch Wellington and Auckland the quality of their houses is termined by that building code unfortunately it 's abysmal and it creates all sorts of problems so I don 't think it 's fair to say that the quality of housing impression is better than anywhere else because we 're still got a building code which we tried to change in a district plane so that it was up to a key predictor of kids education and health outcomes and the government has still not moved on it so sadly we still have a building code that is woefully so except that they may well be print improvements to the building code that can be made that the reason the building stock in Christchurch is significantly better than other cities there 's a percentage of it is far more modern so that the residential rebuild was built to modern building code standards rather than 1930s 1919 50s so that the percentage of double-glazed houses were to sit the percentage of modern installation is higher here than other places yeah and thanks for that for the exploration and one further question just looking at item 5 now in front of us suggesting the amended wording obviously just picking up on the comments that brendham made earlier this has been through a number of discussions and here we are at the final approval stage suggesting a amendment to the wording it 's not the first time that this matter has been discussed but here it is landing requesting a change is that achievable that achievable at this stage in the game okay enjoy I think it is given that given that we 've really clearly flagged we 're going to talk about water over over the next 12 months anyway and that there will be a conversation to have backup counsel I 'm comfortable with us making that change thus the slate stage all right that 's great thank you very much thank you just speaking I don 't think we 've got a choice but to make that change I think we have to look very very clearly at our water resource and not squander it in the way that we have and I think in terms of the quality of our water we know that the central plains irrigation scheme would not not be approved so we have a major issue with nitrates we know that we know that the problem does not occur for 10 to 30 years so it 's a long time in the making and that we are still dealing with the impact of pre-major intensification of the dairy industry in tentacley so there is no way the rules that were around in 2013 we have to recognize that in the last four years we are acutely aware of the potential damage we are doing to our water reserves so I 'm totally in favor of Paul Ince amendment so we 've now clearly moved into debate but once only got a mover and seconder yet so what Pauline you are happy to move with this amendment weren 't you and Vicki you 'd indicated you were happy second okay so nothing second it take the calm around after existing the on the Sikandar bottom line makes comment answer yeah existing all right yeah improve the efficiency of existing irrigation schemes no comment at the comma volley aides not yet great thank you all right is there any further debate yawning oh thank you I won 't be supporting this I appreciate the work that 's gone on we 've been told that there 's been extensive consultation there has been no public consultation on this as far as I can tell Isis I suspect it was well from the reading it was stakeholder engagement and that 's counsel if we 're signing off on this we should know what people have said and we don 't as far as I can tell have a list of what in the report who said what and when you look at it there 's a number of projects that people are doing and I have no surprise that the number of those people say that those are the best projects of course they want but actually when you think about what 's happening in our city there 's some amazing impacts post-earthquake we know the most disadvantaged communities have been hit the hardest and yet there 's nothing in the strategy that talks about addressing the growing iniquity in our city and in our region in fact what it seems to do is enshrine the wealth and those that already have it and things like irrigation that was a key part of the previous economic strategy to minimize the environmental harm caused by the irrigation and yet it was used to justify Central Plains getting central government funding to increase the environmental damage to our city in our region work that 's gone on I still think this is an old-fashioned approach to economic well-being which basically says if you go GDP everyone 's better off and will chuckle down and all be good for all of us there 's been some amazing programs then interviews on Radio New Zealand recently around the issue of youth suicide and economic welfare and I would encourage councils to think about that because what that research shows is that growing in equity and systems like free market Rajan omics have a direct correlation on our youth suicide rates and it 's very very interesting to hear the growing analysis of what leads to certain negative outcomes in our society so I personally think that our economic strategy as a city should be based on the well-being of our environment first and foremost the sustainability of everything that we do and the localization of delivery and support for people alongside a recognition that are growing iniquity should be proactively addressed and unfortunately unless all I can say as more business as usual where the wealthier will continue to get even richer while the 't see any solution for them and what 's more proposed here so I appreciate the work that 's gone on my preference would have been that there was a public consultation and that we do publicly have a record of who said what so we know which groups have supported this and which groups haven 't participated or have said maybe a contrary view so I won 't be supporting this today I will be supporting this from the basis that I think we need to start somewhere and there 's been a lot of talk about a lot of things over the last six years since the earthquake and we actually just need to get on and do something now I 've been sort of around about last couple of weeks talking to a lot of people about Christchurch and actually attracting talent here and it 's bloody hard there 's people out there that are going over to Auckland or going over to Queenstown or Erie West because they can do more money and we actually start needing to attract talent here retaining talent here so that other issues around social inequality and all those kind of things but if we don 't have the right people here we aren 't going to get the right things going on and this goes a long way to actually starting to work that thing but I really want out of this to start us having a conversation about the vision for Christchurch why is Christchurch here who are we and what are we doing into the future an object from the local government conference that I was just that we are actually in a really good position for the unsexy stuff the infrastructure the country is going to have a time bomb of infrastructure problems and coming up in the future and we actually have a long way down the track address a lot of those issues that the other parts of the country don 't so how do we sell that story for the unsexy stuff and actually say Christchurch is an affordable place it 's a good place to be there 's a lot of cool stuff gonna happen but it does look a bit messy and bit but this is actually a good start but I do want to start seeing that 's thoroughly coming out from from from this and I really want to challenge the new organisation to actually just get on and start let 's talking about it and list well during this hurry more dewy but that retention of talent I think is really important I want us to also sort of look at this and actually start thinking about how do we do that because if we don 't do that Christchurch won 't succeed into the future and we have to start somewhere and this is a good plan to do that thank you Dave well thank you look I 'll support the motion sorry Vicki the bubbles boost a bit in a bit number five that the the thing that worries me is you know this this documents being prepared over a long long period as Brendan Anstis elucidated just a short while ago it has involved a huge amount of discussions for the whole lot of sector groups around around the country and it does worry me at and there 's a source of illegal yes there have been some debate let 's let the debate continue so I would really ask are we going to put those together or we would prepare to if you 'd like me to provide apply separately I will thank you Thank You Glen you think you 're going to support it particularly on the grounds that it is a rieta reiterated the process as per number two so I would like to see a stronger emphasis on the social determinants coming through out of which a housing is a part but I think um housing is one of those things that we could have a tendency to undersell so I would have liked us today to have been able to say we are a council that employs staff on a on a living wage and that we promote housing affordability so we 'll just have to wait hopefully a week or their house prices might look better here but they are still very challenging so we might look better compared to the rest of the country if they 're challenging for is for the rest of New Zealand but I 'm particularly concerned that we actually do promote and celebrate that social dimension our housing multiculturalists and because they 've been itself as a statement to of our diversity and who we are I will support it I 'm happy to see that with number two we have a a chance to keep fine-tuning it and look forward to that coming back thank you Sarah okay so just like to UM touch on a couple of points that people have made already and most disagree with Dion on her some statement about attracting and retaining talent if you 've listened to the enormous range of accents from young people around Christchurch at the moment you 'll know that we have been attracting talent from overseas because they 're coming here or something different something new something innovative and they can see the potential and in us they 're here in Christchurch that 's not something plugged overseas and that 's what 's bringing people here I know there are many young people in Christchurch looking at going overseas but we always make sure that we build them rebuild them a city that they want to come back to and raise their kids here we 're a small country people do their own a hit overseas they go to big cities they come back and and that 's just what we 've always done in New Zealand I 'm just because people are choosing to go overseas doesn 't necessarily mean that we 're doing things wrong here because we 're attracting a huge number of people from overseas already I do agree with you only out of like this to see wider consultation and I think that we do need to be doing things about differently it 's it 's been shown in all manner of different ways now in research and things that the trickle down effect doesn 't work and just raising GDP does not make us a more equal equitable Society and if we 're looking at social enterprise and doing things differently and making a happier more prosperous City we actually do need to be doing in a different way 21st City Century City way not a us today thank you Pauline very quickly look um yeah I 'm really happy to see that the number two and the a little bit about the stewardship of water as a resource has been highlighted in there too and move to the top I think that 's one of our key priorities that council and I think there 's ways and I don 't don 't not want to buy into the rural-urban argument about water we all have to conserve water and we all have to do more with this water okay so we can do things with neurochemicals which would actually help too so if we adopted organic practices a citywide that would give us a huge benefit so this actually opens the door to all sorts of possibilities like that to go forward so I 'm really supportive of this document I know there 's a lot of work gone into it but we can actually use the as an umbrella for all our other council priorities which are becoming greener by the day so thank you for the work on this thank you I 'm work has gone into it and I think the combination of point two in our resolution and the fact that we now have the new converged organization which is Christchurch NZ presents a huge opportunity to further progress this piece of work and it 's good that we 've had the opportunity both at this meeting and at some previous workshops and forums and so on to have the ability to talk about what 's important for council to be built into that 's update and refresh that we we know is coming up so I 'm certainly very happy to see this approved today so I put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you oh sorry and I was going to put five separately was nine I didn 't date did you indicate that you were gonna vote against five yeah okay yeah so if we can note Davis 's vote against five in particular whether others that wanted to vote against five Sarah oh so you 're voting it so people voted against the whole thing Sarah you voted against the whole lot well okay and Dave in favor but against five great thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you now let 's move back to item 12 review of the rates postponement scheme now this came through the finance and performance committee ref do you want to UM start by making some comments on this one just by way of introduction okay thanks so this is really expanding and improving a policy that 's already there which enables people who are struggling to pay their rates to postpone that rates payment what we 're doing here is is making this universal access particularly for super and earth super annuitants who are on a fixed cashflow fixed fixed income and you know clearly over the last sort of five six years two things have happened one we 've had a huge bill for the earthquake and that is seeing rates go up and obviously there are people also in areas where their house prices have gone up quite a lot as well so they 've been hit twice so we don 't want people sitting in their homes not able to afford the basics when actually they have equity that they can postpone their rates against so this be reviewed in the long-term plan and will be reviewed each long-term plan and hopefully this will just provide a bit more accessibility for those people who are struggling financially great thank you so I 'm just noting that this is to amend the policy for consultation in the long term plan so any decision we make today is subject to consultation and decision-making through the long term plan and the proposal is that the policy be reviewed prior to each future long term plan so we 'll review every three years and there was some quite detailed question and answer and debate at the finance and performance committee around that so I 'm assuming that members of that committee probably won 't have too many questions today but some staff I 'm sure will be happy to to answer questions from councillors on this if there are any questions and was there any further comment from staff before we move to questions Steve was there anything you wanted to cite no nothing to add from my perspective as you said I hope that people have got whatever they need that 's great so are there any questions for staff okay so ray if you 're happy to move this I 'm happy to second is there any debate all in favor against that 's carried so there were people against Saudi on you voted against oh okay sorry I missed that I 'm not mean to yell in put my hand up I just put my hand up I 'm happy to Lyon speak oh yeah I 'll make it brief and just to explain the reason why I would vote against because obviously this has been through a committee and I wasn 't there my personal view is I 'm uncomfortable that we live in a city and have set up a rating system that 's got so expensive that elderly people can 't afford to live in their houses and pay their rates I I struggle with that I realized that this is to to help them but something 's gone wrong somewhere along the way that people are paying rent to the council just to stay in their house somewhere where they chose to local or just happened government value a lot and now beer income doesn 't match being able to live there and so they 're taking essentially a reverse mortgage on their property and so something 's wrong with our system and so that 's why I don 't support this that 's purely based on that I do guys this is a tool for them to users a lot saying they will have to use it but my position is just purely on that all right so Aaron you voted against and Dion you also voted against so if we can just note those two votes against an apologies for not noting that you were intending speaking great so that 's dealt with item 12 now let 's move to _"

    "text": "as well thank you very much okay so next we move to item 20 the Knights drain storm water storage and wetlands so if I could invite staff to the table for this one as well have we got people here no okay and let 's in that case then go back to item 12 the review of the Reiki engine all right okay so let 's do nice drain next it 's a city that we kept after yeah now my thinking was that I knew that some of the same staff were presenting on this one so we 'd move on to this and then we 'll go back to 12 then now so Knights drain storm water storage and wetland term then welcome to the Tom welcome to the table and we 'll start with any questions I just thinking if I could just quickly introduce this by saying that the busy committee and the coastal community board coastal in coastal would yeah I had a joint meet workshop I think only last week but I 'm not sure but great great was it yeah and Vickie really good we 've been over this and unfortunately David 's not in the room but the feedback from the inc coastal community board was favorable to the preferred option as well so get staff to talk us through great thank you so Ann were there any comments that staff wanted to make on the report before we move into questions I might just briefly mention that since we 've had this topic before Council on a number of occasions so I won 't dwell at length on the project we 're just to mention that we 've gone out to consultation on the preferred option that feedback has been positive for the majority and the written submissions were tabled and the report any table sorry paragraph 6.15 you can see that can you use improvements as a describe and that as the June feeling the public assets and support there were some comments provided or some concerns raised for some members of the public about the linkage with other open spaces maintenance of the devices once instructed also some shared path and along in tech job they destroyed all and relational design of the project noting that some of the open space linkages challenge for private landowner land ownership there 's also some concern around midgets mosquitoes and we 've sought some advice from internal staff on Ecology 's ecologists on that matter and report their pick and that last briefing and the view is that there is an issue e if it arises we can manage the proposed option does include the purchase of 15 properties which is fine and why the major impact of this option is still preferred from a technical perspective because of the nature of the land that I cash and address into the pump station the resilience that our office the total project has included construction or a or the completed pump station scoot enacted those works for council and that was within the previous topic within the subject matter of the previous report so that work is now being undertaken we 're now ready to take the next step great thank you very much are there any questions Pauline very quick one and I 'm sorry I didn 't think of this the properties to make way for this Wheatley and I suppose storage basins is there any opportunity to actually retain some of that for any housing or is it all needed for the project yeah we could sell some back and go put the purpose or do you think the land is just too low for it the land is very low that it 's embolized line residential and then the city below mean high tide level so this land is only occupiable because of the existing stop banking network and pump stations that are constructed in order to achieve the water quality benefits that we outlined the report the total area is required worden if we were to reduce the area available on being made available through the project they would have to compromise our other values and objectives young I was just wondering if then the new house whether that 's being built high enough to deal with the flooding yes so the new house was constructed in accordance with the building code and I 've been to that house and you do walk up quite a number what in terms of is it really able to be relocated it just seems such a waste to get rid of a brand-new house if we designate it so is there any solution around either having it remain or having it used for some other use unfortunately there is not an significant opportunity to have it remain it 's sort of in the middle of the area that we are discussing I believe there could be opportunities for relocating the house typically would engage in an open tender process for demolition of properties and that those contractors were identifying the opportunities for relocation and recovery of any material and I 'm sure that the any changes for demolition would consider that it made it very closely well I wanna cut sorry I don 't just turn understand why why because it 's just in the middle is that just because of the the space required the word you can 't require some of it which is not the building and put it around it or absolutely the reason for the area of the proposed bonds is that the groundwater levels we can make before we hit the ground water and so in terms of flood retention to achieve water quality objectives you need a relatively a wider footprint and unfortunately if we start compromising by leaving say an island in a pond to lick their property remain we would have to compromise as I mentioned earlier on the other objectives of the project and the second question is around the the city wide flood modeling like where is that when is that coming back to us and what 's the relationship between this project and that piece of work the city why flood Mullen and project is ongoing we 're seeing any results of that now for the Aven area and has been considered within the land range recovery program we haven 't been waiting on that modeling work to proceed to conclude before we make other decisions we already have hydraulic models of this area which we have been utilizing in our reporting to date and in investigating these options so we do have the tools available for making informed engineering assessments and I hope well informed decisions okay get information about the trees that I see in the report that we haven 't done a tree assessment and we don 't have the information about what we remain is that is that I know cheeser you know something that are quite important to local communities so is there anything that we can get in terms of trying to retain as many trees as possible and getting a report circulator typically that tree meters are decided upon at the local community board level and there aren 't a significant number of trees on the properties in question and existing delegations I 'd have to clarify however the proposal is to include extensive landscape treatment the number of trees we 'll be planting will far outweigh and assuming that council supports this proposal far outweigh any tree removals and I don 't know the exact number sorry but aware significant multiply thank you deal in terms of the properties on the other side of the road this strip of these that go on to Pixley air reserve I should say what 's the feedback from those people been there 's support of the project saying that they would like to see a proceeding in see some great and benefits to the community into themselves there has been one burden the submission an opposition from one of those landowners about flood risk and bringing more water to the site this treatment voice however is designed to manage the storm water that comes off the existing catchment so we 're looking to improve this situation not make it worse for those reasons and the other question I had was in terms of the resident red zone option have you spoken to loons about or region or across church we are in close conversations our three genera on a whole number of issues I think I 'll just like to identify that the preferred option and its location is also from engineering principles the further away we get from the river the more resilient our structures can be and also provide the maximum room or space for permanent stop banking measures on alignment so really the the driver and the multi in our more criteria assessment has identified that the location that is discussions of the ones are obviously I 'm going on holidays here thank you okay so Erin had indicated that you 're happy to move this Pauline your habit second yep so moved Erin seconded Pauline is there any debate yeah I appreciate what this project is going to do but it does seem to me that you 've got the red zone and Bexley part and so I just don 't support the idea of acquiring private property when we 've got so much public land and this facility I think it would be far better use of resource to actually utilize public land and so I won 't be supporting that I appreciate the work that staff have done on this but yeah my view is that we should be looking at either option for or using the red zone so I won 't support this today it might be useful to get some commentary from staff on the use of the red zone and whether that was actively considered and the reasons that that 's not recommended yeah but sure as I mentioned just before that there drives us to put these features for are away from the river as possible and order to provide the greatest resilience these for the future infrastructure and with particular reference to Pixley Park that is an old landfill and that presents significant risks and to Nintendo to land and and also it 's halfway up the catchment so we wouldn 't be able to collect all the water that discharges to the basin to achieve our water quality outcomes and come at an increased cost so it certainly wasn 't preferred for a whole lot of reasons okay thank you Dion and then Pauline yeah I I am so sorry my voice is really bad but I won 't be supporting this either from the point of view that I 'm actually concerned about the distorted nature of actually what we 're going to do to the community that 's going to be left down there you 're going to have a strip of houses that will just be left there and I appreciate the engineering advice that we 've seen but a minutes 4050 metres over the other side just reading the the reasoning around not using the residential red zone with the significant risk around the short-term access to the to the land I think this highlights a bigger issue around the actual disjointed nature of the land that we have in the city and the communication that we have with the crown and us about what the future of that residential their designers because I mean we have a great opportunity with the residential redzone to actually look at the flat modeling around the entire city yet instead of doing that in the immediate case with this we 're looking at sort of buying properties some well one which has already been rebuilt and I just think you know demolishing a house will have actually got other options to me it 's just not right and also the nature of disability in that whole community with just that strip of properties on the the right-hand side as you go out to New Brighton I just think it I don 't think the benefits outweigh the the implications that will happen to the area of the community and we do need to have a really strong conversation with the crowd with our region or at christchurch about these options and actually putting this as a whole package that 's just Thank You Pauline yep thank you look I 'll be supporting this I think that this is an opportunity to provide improved water quality which is one of our main goals in Christ Christ your City Council with enhancing environmental amenity now if you talk about the strip of houses on the other side what a wonderful outlook they 're going to have with us this is going to be nice to shame we haven 't got the picture up there of the proposal but you 'll see it on the report on page 128 and it 's got you know Nets naturalized it 's got rook ways there may be a cycle way going around the side of it I don 't know this is a really busy corner and I think that an actual fit because the land actually sits below the mean high tide level there 's not a huge really probably it 's not think that there is a sacrifice for a good house but I 'm sure that that can be moved and the end result is going to be outstanding and they 'll be community engagement here with is Thomas 's with the tree selection possibly community plantings who knows a community group might take it over and look after it I think this is a gift to the community and I really really congratulate the staff for coming up on this with this wonderful design here and I think the land drainage recovery program is really embracing these opportunities where we can to actually have some wounds and some environmental enhancement along with water quality improvements so I 'll definitely be supporting this Thank You Glenn and then Vicki thank you as the like ward councillor in City Councilor I support this option I support it for various reasons one is I think it 's a good response to the ongoing effects of climate change which the size of ik events and Canterbury have served to fast forward if you like the the land drop in this area is quite apparent can see it with your own eye it 's pretty obvious the these decisions over how we respond locally to global events are not always easy including the conversations we must have with the communities affected i have double-checked with one of my local eyes and ears being Tim Baker community board member who knows the other Nui community and it 's people 's intimately and I 've had assurance again then I think the staff have done well in communicating with the community over this because potentially this could have gone another way I think one of the local papers was hoping it would but it didn 't and it hasn 't when we look at the the options presented in the arc and report it 's not a simple case of is it for instance red zone or not so it 's a matrix with many dimensions and in fact if I recall the ORAC and information it says that if you went to the red zone option at one DHD prevent flooding and the residential parts of that area I think I recall that and that report it 's not just a matter of getting rid of houses it 's actually providing amenity it 's a good response picking up on some of the points councillor Cotterill eight so I urge you to support this this is important for the whole city not just this area Thank You Vicki um I sit through the similar that these guys ran for at Eddie I was hugely impressed with the work that had been done with the consultation that had happened with the community and with the responses what I like about this proposal and I know this land incredibly well having spent most of my primary school in high school on what was a much larger chunk of land at that stage so I know most of the most of the Larry well and I think what what 's really important is the point that Pauline made this affects our water quality and we have to do it we can 't go over the road to the big Sleater phone watch that being front and closed that you would not want to dig down there believe me but action which is what other parts of the city have just been in asking us for this protects sixty houses from from flood intrusion and it actually creates a really lovely environmental feature you will have seen some of those houses actually on the market and struggling for some time especially on near the corner of nzf and Paige 's road but they 're what we create here is a brilliant almost a feature and one that has all sorts of environmental responses and benefits in terms of flood prevention water quality which is along with climate change our number one priority and actually creates something that looks substantially it looks amazing I think when we finished this so I 'm not usually don 't usually enjoy drainage seminars that go on for a very long time but I to say I was hugely impressed by what 's been done here and by the logic and the compelling logic of what you 've come up with and so I 'm totally in favor of this thank you Dave thank you I 'm glad to support this motion again and probably think LeAnn alluded to earlier this piece of land is actually sunk more than even the lowest part of surf Braaten and it is particularly vulnerable to to a log flooding and the intersection near boy to spot recent expensive work still floods and I think this this wetlands would obviously benefit for that no I cancel the Buckskin flow off each year and win it but I support everything she said and if it 's becoming a bit of a habit really but it 's a good one and likewise the comments that works best for you councillor Cotterill so very valid points now with respect to the residential redesign look I have absolute confidence in the messaging we have had from the engineer 's that creating a basin close to the river is going to create issues they have come to and fro and it 's really not an ideal option to to go there this is the sort of natural and obvious place for this system to be implemented and lastly I think it 's quite evident that the consultation that was conducted on this project was but also a number of adjoining residents were well supportive of this as well so I think for a huge number of reasons that 's been well researched the engineering and the work the staff have gone into this project has been superb and and I think it 's it just should be best thank you and finally Alan yeah I started my position here on on this decision in the same places yoni and deal I was quite opposed mainly my grounds were around removing houses especially one good one because it just seems like such an incredible waste but that two hours spent and that seminar with Tom and normally outsides two hours I 'll never get back it 's actually two hours that I 'll keep because you you you won me over with good science and the main reason for not doing it across my biggest point was why wouldn 't you do it across the road in the redzone was just pumping the water over and back again under the road it made made no sense just to achieve the same thing if we had scratch and we should think like that a lot during a recovery of such a mess of event is that we wouldn 't be building houses here there won 't be anyone living in this spot in fact if this loses today and these people do stay there we should rename the area a little Lance to them because it 's below sea level at certain times of the day so but maybe that could be its way forward if it loses the debate but following the earthquakes in those weeks and months you 'll remember on pages wrote for those that visited that area it looked like pages road was just filled with truckloads of gravel and it was like a big boom in the middle just to have a road to get through because there was water down exciting huge pumps like the place was a mess and that 's how much it dropped so yeah I think it 's a great way forward thanks to the staff for doing the work and let 's support it we don 't need a little imps the dam in the always for me these things to get excited about but you know here we 've got something that has got some real immunity it 'll become a real feature for the area some very positive environmental outcomes and and actually will really be an enhancement not only of the environment but of the the situation in that in that part of town um I was always as with these projects where local people are going to be affected I 'm very pleased to hear that there 's local resident support community board supports the ward counsel obviously speaking in support and other councillors from that side of town speaking in support as well so like our and I certainly don 't want to be embracing the concept of little Amsterdam and I 'll be supporting this today so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against as carried thank you

    "text": "so now we 'll come to item 17 south near Brighton regeneration planning so if we could have staff to the table for this please and we 'll take any questions first of all but my thinking is that it might be good just to get an overview from staff as we move into this and particularly bearing in mind the issues that have been raised through the deputation and the petition Richard would it be possible for us just to get a very brief overview of current work that 's going on or that 's proposed to be happening related to the South Shore area just so that we can get an overview of the various streams of work that are going on and what 's proposed and when it 's likely to happen just briefly yep so the the report itself is response to a resolution which is specific to South New Brighton so it 's the reason for focusing on that area it does touch on that resolution was Nestor than three resolutions in total one of them was in relation to the oasl report and which staff will be reporting back to Council by the end of August so that is already in train so that 's one piece of work which are specific to social the other one which is not specific to South Shore but does address issues that occurred there over the weekend as the emergency management recovery plan which sir the chief executive just referred to so that 's obviously broader than than south through itself because it deals with all the areas of multiply the weekends means but some of those areas were obviously in the South Shore so it would look at what happened there and we 'll respond to it and the third piece of work which is a broader piece of work which is I 'm going to be lead by regenerate Christchurch as a regeneration strategy for the wider South Shore south more Brighton area and that also responds to a council resolution that that stem from the annual plan so there are three resolutions in total one that directed council staff to look at South New Brighton which was specific to the earthquake and impacts of the oasl report which you 'll get a staff report back to you by the end of august and the other one was in relation to seeking there to regenerate christchurch proceed and progress with the regeneration strategy as quickly as possible thank you very much indeed for that no I think you know the the underlying message there is that and it probably addresses one of the concerns that we may otherwise have had clearly there 's a need for a joined-up approach here and obviously to joined-up approach that we 're taking wherever possible great so that allows for further questions now so Glen Dave Pauline blank thank you would it be your view that there would be scope here and feel free to say just know that you know editor a call on to the government please hurry up with an initial policy statement on city blocks I happen to be in attendance that used two days i-team a scene and so that 's that 's obviously something which is underway the government openness and if you consider that that would be in the scope of this good idea well apparently we 've all written to the crown twice on these matters over the last few years as was discussed at Easter days ite meeting so I think it was a greediest though that a another letter should be forthcoming from Council to raise their matter with the crown but so so Pauline as the chair of the committee clearly and there was some discussion that your meeting yesterday with us to request counsel to write Evita so if we can do that today it would be even better all right so do you want to come up with some wording that report yes that we retrieved that wording that we came up with yesterday good for I think all right so if we can do that in the meantime well we 've got the other Q&A going on that would be good and then we 'll see whether we can incorporate that into the resolutions here next question is from Dave thank you and well I 'm just I find that section five point one to five point for us a little but not misleading but to work on the Southshore I sell consultant 's report and here we may deal with that the second action talks about regenerate cross sutures review of proposed timelines and the third action refers to the report that we 've got in front of us except their self can you run I 've been hammering on for god knows hell on now about the fact that there is a gap in the whole process with the domain frontage of of South New Brighton doesn 't flow into anything and it 's just something that that system I avoid we have a situation in the weekend where contractors to the fantastic job filling in the gaps its South Shore and preventing flooding down there if not for the quick and prompt action as a request from the camping ground the camp would a flooded as well so here we have a situation where the weather the history age and the domain frontage is eroded badly the high ground is just getting eaten away because it 's got my protection in front of it and very shortly we 'll we 'll be Graham will flood so I 'm concerned that he is very good that we 've got a regeneration plan that 's going to address issues and the sefirot near Eva saw the bridge straight and yes we are expecting a report back at the end of August what 's going to deal with the South Shore regeneration plan maybe with the SL thing but in the middle does this look that 's us no way so this is the context of a question the context of the question is that really is are we are we are we going to come up with a strategy now that deals with that book because we 've got the skip and the whole program tom but my understanding is that they the ISO report they will come back and August will address that area but but no it 's not it 's kind of a report that 's coming back at the end of and are very from from Tom himself he does not have a mandate to do with anything other than South Shore you can 't leave there creates three or site the current resolution describes South Shore in isolation as a parent that it would be to say the concerns raised by the community relate to many issues some in addition some erosion some of what the storm would Nick because we here today considering these issues in hotel he along the frontage of the history makes logical sense and it would be appropriate to respond to these matters and totality given a short timeframe we 've had with addressing the Southshore issues and the concerns raised by this community I would be recommending that we continue with our reporting in the end of August and endeavor to include this area in their reporting as much as possible but I just highlight that F directed by Council that some additional time might be appropriate to consider this area and and fulness well Lots not sort of encouraged that we 're going to get a much of a show on this area and maybe if I could ask the chief executive and under the recovery process post the event can we address some action on this area here in fact we this work that we 're not going to live we have to be really clear about what the recovery and temporary work as a place of what will be medium and long term and we need to link those up but not confuse something so the workaround they you know the medium term response I think needs to we need to figure that out quite carefully make sure we 've got um the engineering it 's not just a contracting estroux I need to really understand how it 's gonna impact and what we need to do well we have a situation where just signed a lease with the camping-ground the question continue asking Cuomo asking questions to you so here we have one of the council 's asses of some value there was of extreme risk during their event and I 'm really asking why we cannot just progress with some emergency to prevent that acid being at risk and further events we seem to be sitting on our hands with this particular piece of their coastline that it 's not an enormous piece of work coming up it to keep furthering and and be a trustee renovation and a major asset of ours as a risk yeah so let 's get an answer to the specific question so those things that we considered under the recovery plan it 's not something that we can say right now this is what we 're going to do because we need to actually assess what needs to happen right now and what the engineering solutions and supports are for it okay just seems that we have to actually get to a critical status before anything gets done so as a classic example of that we had to have a head to have a storm of some magnitude to actually executions okay I 'm keen to move on and stick to questions now and there will be the opportunity obviously to raise any of these issues in debate for length I just wonder if you can expand on the coastal futures project I 'm just not sure so that this will Punk response to the council resolution right which is specific to South New Brighton but what we sought to do as on other related work streams now one of the medes that regenerate christchurch are looking to progress as a regeneration strategy for the wider area so that we 'll look at a range of issues which are both immediate medium and long term which will be similar to those sorts of matters that would be considered as part of the coastal futures project now the coastal futures project is a separate program work which envisages extensive community participation engagement around a depth of management measures and really what it was was an opportunity that we didn 't have through the district plan review to engage with the community on those coastal hazard type issues so if you 'll recall back from a couple of years ago that specific chapter was removed from the district plan and we were given an opportunity to address it outside of that streamlined process so really that the coastal futures project was going to be a front-runner to some kind of coastal hazards plan change so what we envisage was extensive community participation engagement as part of that project and then what would likely flow and that 's what the revised ordering Council and visitors but what we 're talking about here is a possibility of specifically looking at the South Shore and south of Brighton yuria through a regeneration strategy and addressing some of those issues specific to that area there and using that as a bit of a frontrunner to the wider coastal hazards project no regeneration regenerate Christchurch is leading the regeneration strategy either that we will be working and tandem with them so the region strategy is called the coastal futures and just know that the region that so the region strategy will be specific to South New Brighton the South Shore area coastal futures would be a wider piece of work to look at the coastline throughout the district and that would be outwards from and that 's something that council would lead yes right thank you I just want a bit clarified thank you do thank you okay I 've got Yanni and then deal just three questions one is do we have a copy of the response from the previous letters we 've sent before we agree to been is that a do we have that information I don 't have that hand I was only made aware that we 'd written to them previously at yesterday 's ITU committee meeting so I can I just think if we right first time and we went through this with heritage it 's quite good to be able to refer to the response we will sit with the state-owned enterprise Minister for New Zealand post it 's quite good to know what they 've seed so that we can actually respond and obviously you 've got Skype with them that to tailor the letter but it would be good for us as counselors to know what we 've actually been told previously so that we can give I think greater direction so maybe we can get those replies circulated yes and then by the middle is drafted circulated rather than we can feed them any points that we yeah I mean certainly for the content of the letter referred to in three to be informed by any responses that we 've had to previous correspondence would be a reasonable expectation flooding report the South Shore red zone clearance was highlighted as a key recommendation for future work investigation action it said we were waiting for agreement with Sarah as the reason that nothing 's happened in this area been around that the ongoing lack of agreement with government over what we do I 'm just trying to understand why it 's taken so long given we knew about this in 2014 and if there 's any other things we need to do in terms of not just writing to the Minister for the environment but actually writing to Linton 's or the earthquake recovery minister and look I 'm not familiar with the mural task force and the directions that set within it we were asked to respond to the resolutions that stin from this year 's annual plan and this report is specific to South New Brighton but seeks to provide a bit of wider context on the other work that 's happening I mean and as I indicated regenerate Christchurch I came to lead and tandem with us a regeneration strategy for that area that came to get is we identified the problem in 2014 I 'm interested in understanding and maybe we need a separate resolution to get a report back on the mural task force for flooding on what works being done what works outstanding and how that 's been monitored and I am thinking that perhaps need to consider setting up a task force around there sorry establishing the task force because it does seem to me concerning the length of time taken and also obviously you 've heard the community frustration and it seems like new entities keep getting set up we heard someone say we don 't want to be told again that the reason for the delay is we 're waiting on council for action so I think from a governance point of view well my question really is who 's monitoring the following task force recommendations work and do you think actually it would be better to have a governance structure that actually focused you know on what the solutions are for this area to get it done quicker rather than just waiting and waiting and waiting so sort of some rather than for staff to give advice on and certainly relate to the wider issue of flooding and the work done by the male Task Force on flooding in 2014 and subsequent rather than on this particular paper I don 't know going with less something that you wanted to provide some comment on or whether it may be something that should be referred to the land drainage recovery program or to the the et Committee for further consideration as to what appropriate next steps would be well can we get a report back then on what 's happened with the flooding task force I 'm just concerned that we keep reinventing the wheel when we 've actually sent a huge amount of effort and resource and understanding what some of these issues are and we have solutions that have been identified but it works not happening so it may be I mean is that something that would be more appropriately dealt with by way of a briefing or a workshop in the first instance to inform any changes to priority or any yeah any resolution around that particular work any land drainage recovery program projects that a plan for South Shore and we 're out of timeline yeah and that certainly I mean really that 's a we got that brief overview on the various work streams that are underway or proposed to be underway from Richard at the start of this session so maybe a more detailed workshop on that but also extended to the recommended recommendations from the mayoral Task Force on flooding and what the implementation of those has been or what implementation is proposed but that 's the sort of thing I think that would be more I mean this is information that we 're gonna want sooner rather than later because of course the events of the weekend of have brought this into perspective and there may be some urgency around some of this work there 's certainly an interest in it so it may be more appropriately dealt with by way of a workshop or a briefing and a thing they were thought coming back can we just have that noted or recorded that the council asks for an urgent workshop briefing on the noted by the chief executive I think we can be confident that the requests for a briefing or a workshop whatever 's most appropriate on the the work that 's related to South Shore the land drainage recovery program and the implementation of the recommendations of the mayoral task force in on flooding in 2014 and that would pick up pretty much everything Yanni I think that you 've mentioned there okay just on that note we 've got another working group meeting on the 4th of August and I 'm sure that we will be discussing the recent events and particularly the areas affected like South Shore and even could do that yeah under the workshop or briefing that we 've just talked about means that you know this is a lot of information held by those on the land drainage recovery working group there 's more information held by those on the it E committee than by the the wider council is an opportunity for everybody to be brought up to speed with some of the great work that 's already been going on some of the to take a joined up approach over what we 've seen this morning are a number of work streams that clearly need to be coordinated that 's fine thank you so back to questions I got deal one might be a bit silly but what 's actually Expedia actually meaning so what 's you what do you mean by Expedia like actually what is it meaning expediter so as quickly as possible yeah I mean so that 's call back but what 's what does it actually mean in terms of the work that you 're doing like figure one of the report on page when I find with the agenda outlines a time frame for I 'll be at least mated for delivering on the work and so what was the original time frame this response to a resolution that came out of the annual plan the senior plan so we were asked to respond by the end of August we 've responded now there wasn 't a time frame set as far as I 'm aware this we were simply asked to respond to a report on South the end of August so that 's that 's what we 're doing that will use that opportunity to provide some wider context in terms of the work that 's undergoing been undergoing and the wider area and so obviously your expediate in this work is there anything that was in your original work plans that might be delayed or anything like that to expediate this well I think the coastal futures project is one thing which is a wider work stream that if we look to focus on a regeneration strategy for this area which is a bit of a test case for coastal futures then there might be some difficulty and progressing those two work streams in parallel okay and and have you done is there any work that you 've done in terms of what the priorities is in terms of the coastal futures versus this well I think this area is obviously you know it 's it 's got a shoe so it logically it would be one of the areas that we would focus on first if we were progressing coastal futures regardless but the area and its totality including the area that counsel least referred to come up with a way forward which does address some of those issues that normally you 'd we would have looked at through the coastal futures project but it will be specific to this locality so it 's it 's it 's based on immediate medium and long term so it does pick up your coastal hazard type issues such as sea level rise succeed so so some of that coastal future stuff that will be delayed is there any risk on in the other areas that have potential coastal problems so that may not be delayed I think that store decision that Council will need to take and we we need to sit down with regenerate Christchurch and work through the proposed regeneration strategy and what it means but inherently one would imagine if you 're saying well if that 's gonna be a frontrunner for coastal futures why would you run the two in parallel so council was you to make that decision and but but if we are to progress with a regeneration strategy for issues that you speaks through coastal futures then I could see some complexities and running the two in parallel and that would come down to resourcing for resourcing and I think potentially consultation confusion as well if you 're going out with a regeneration strategy at the same time as you were doing coastal futures which looked at other parts of the district it could get confusing for members of the public right so I mean one one thing I 'm thinking of here is is is there going to be any extra resource that you will need to be able to do this or is it going to be balanced for what sells near Brighton we can 't fool we 've got the resources we required to do that work and we 're comfortable with the timeframes we have suggested they 'll biet those being tight in terms of the wider regeneration strategy will be working with regenerate christ roots we 've got a project plan not quite signed off but almost done we 've got the resourcing in place for that as well but but I think there they 're doing it in parallel with the white acoustic coastal futures project in the East there would be a resourcing issue in my mind if you were to run the tool in parallel okay thank you very much thank you I 'm Phillip thanks Richard and I 'm coming from the port view point of having things joined up in like there 's a key section on the South Brighton legacy earthquake issues and I 'm just wanting to ensure that for example the work that has been done by oh sell that in fact let 's start with the staff examined that and its possible implementation well will a multi hazard assessment process be used because a narrative committee yesterday we had a report on that and I 'm just wondering if in fact that kind of approach is going to be used in a system for example work that 's read unlikely oh syllable they started to fit one of my more lunar colleagues on their counselors the end Europe technical lead so would you like to Persephone bars and letters and Tom can pip speak to hazard study pertaining to flood plains so that 's it 's a large study looking at the mood of our hazards we 're not using that approach for south near Barton it 's more streamlined but we are looking at multiple hazards we are looking some simpler approach so we 're not just looking at earthquake or flood with by sticking to be looking at the earthquake effects flooding as well as groundwater and some of those decisions to to bring those into the reasons why the potentially the barriers were in red zone that might be in the earth you know that some of the criteria that wasn 't looked in so that that 's we 're extending the study to end some hazards but it 's not the definitive multi hazard study there which is a longer-term program we don 't have the time mobility to give you that full studied okay thanks Ian so that 's for selfie Breitenbach so just for sake of right and Tom might be up speak to his response to the ISIL report I 'd just like to reiterate that yes we that was a nine tragic tragic every program we are looking to expedite all works as possible and that we haven 't already undertaken significant physical works across the city and will continue to do so in that in this instance short-term medium-term and long-term measures can be considered in the multi-year so that 's definitely looking for that long-term decision making being this appropriate that 's not stopping us or slowing us down from making immediate and gains thanks time I was just going to add that in terms of the work that regenerate Christchurch you 're doing with the regeneration strategy there is also that opportunity to look at multiple hazards which we will have to do across the South Shore South New Brighton so that will take in the area and totality and if we 've got some gaps and information then we all will need to fill those gaps we 'll be using the approach so the part on the wider is speak of the whole of us a brighter including self brighten the fool the system will become is going to come later do the on the south shore on South you Brighton so not all of you Brighton but but but that would fit into the wider coastal futures project thanks Richard all right thank you very much so that brings us to the end of questions so we 've got a set of resolutions in front of us item 3 Pauline that reflects what you wanted there given the previous comments that you made yep great all right so do we have a mover for these resolutions pulling seconder Yanni oh right we need a second to first do I have a seconder for the resolution TM ref okay so moving now into debate yawning well I think um you know it 's good to see something happening but I have to say the more that we see around the regeneration planning I think there 's a real issue with the complication and the complexity of multi layers of bureaucracy and governance in our city and it just comes back to seems to come back to me that if it 's complicated for us to understand who 's responsible for what who 's happening and who 's responsible and I think we 've heard that today through the deputation so you know I 'm all for this going ahead but I do think at some stage as council we do need to actually think about not just reinventing the wheel but actually looking at what 's the best way to do things or to respond to community concerns and at the moment seems to me that the whole regeneration stuff is actually so high level that it ends up taking forever and in the meantime the community are waiting and waiting and becoming very impatient so I 'm happy to support this today because we are going to get that report back I would ask that when it comes back that we can actually think about how we can simplify these things we have done as a council huge amount of work after the 2014 floods and yet it just feels like that work isn 't being incorporated into what we 're doing now particularly in regards to South Shore so I 'll support this today but I do think when that report simple way and process for which we can address these very serious issues I don 't think we need to over complicate it I think there 's a very simple way that it can be done and that should be through local decision-making and local elected representatives both the community board and the council so I look forward to that before coming back then thank you or fuse on this side that obviously we need to listen to the people of South Shore they 're looking for certainty in an uncertain environment they have a range of views and that 's absolutely fine as we have in in our communities to my view in this working towards regeneration for them and regeneration as they 're it 's an entirely new thing that 's essentially what generation means is that we have a duty of care so in the short term I 'm supportive actually that we need to ensure that we are responsive over what 's happened over the last few days and in that and the time ahead enter the long term over regeneration planning in the south you been difficult because there have been many messages received so if you look at the the red and green zone zoning of South Shore for instance that looks like blotting paper you 've got streaks of red because there are many long driveways and houses off driveways and streaks of green so what I 'm trying to say is after being in a state of kind of orange for a long time some certainty was provided but there still been some mixed messages sent out central government had decreed that central South New Brighton school would stay and all those changes that send out a signal of permanence and certainty we 've done the same over the camp and ground and other facilities there at the playground the GT fixing the ball the boardwalk is citrus so what the community wants is actually some some certainty and I read you to support this it 's no secret David and I cover different places on the climate change spectrum as does the community and I think that 's actually quite to it because we reflect back in many ways what the oasl report is that 98 percent are behind it I 've walked with Scott butcher along the history edge he will point out to you the different local ecosystems which may respond to a soft edge or perhaps even a hard edge treatment the thing is we need a response and and so that 's where David and I I think are on the same page that we we need certainty for this community on on number three my view on this over a national policy statement at active is a vacuum of leadership we need the government to step up you look at what 's going on in South Dunedin and other places and these events have amplified the the rolling trend of climate change which we 're seeing so we need some leadership here and I would like some initial response before the election from the Minister concerned I don 't want them to use the election as an excuse not to get back so we need some initial response before that but all in all I hope that you support these resolutions today thank you Dave thank but my calm is really around regeneration planning probably the highlights of blood disappointment that this storm frame is so protracted not entirely support the comments that councillor Johansen elaborated on a short while ago om will really probably concerned that this plenary focuses on the map area in the report and exclude some some of the ears a wee bit further downstream the lease over the weekend last weekend really highlighted many of the problems and issues and the self brought in south shore and among naught these issues were served and veto issues that total centres and Kim money and all have been advocating for many years it is disappointing that things seem to get to cross a stage in the eastern suburbs before we get any action well that 's a little off the subject or what would really like to see some immediate action on the domain frontage and if it wasn 't for action over the weekend the camping gram would have wanted flooded residence in the had been incredibly incredibly toured but the trust in the City Council is severely strained and look I meeting that we had recent recent days Richard Joseph which i think is pretty adept to the situation relationships would benefit from a more professional and respectful approach on both sides in order to create trust confidence in respect and it seems to be sadly lacking in the South Rotten South Shore area at the moment humming you think you look I 'll support this but at the same time we we 've got to be careful we don 't underestimate the challenges here I mean this is the classic multi has an area there 's a lot of things to consider and that 's why we can 't really rush long term solutions so I think we 've as we 've said already we 've got quite a few work strings that we can hook into this as well besides this one of the mussel and drainage recovery program and we will do some more investigations into the neural task force of flooding is councillor Hansen has suggested here and so regarding the litter at the bottom I just want to say that at the local government conference on people but particularly LG and said that they are also putting pressure on the government to come up with this statement as well it 's needed not just in our area but all around New Zealand and and increasingly so as these events become more frequent and more intense and sorry I 'll support this but also promised to be working on it as hard as I can in any other areas that I can as well expedite the progress thank you so I mean clearly there are a number of complex work streams that all come together in a joined up way or need to come together and it joined up and coordinated when Pauline I think you make a good point you know this work is complex there are a number of big pieces of work here and I think when you join up the comments that you 've just made with the points that were very clearly made in the deputation and in the petitioners as regards community expectation and people 's ability to know what the future looks like and to be comfortable in their homes or you know when is a piece of work that needs to be done going to be done and you 're going to be done and so on so I think the the suggestion of the the workshop or the briefing which gets all counselors familiar with the various work streams that are going on and the priorities and going back to 2014 and the the mayoral Task Force on flooding and those recommendations are so on a really joined up approach across all of these work streams will be particularly helpful but in terms of the resolution today point one is is a noting provision point two clearly there 's this more detailed report coming back in in September 2017 to the committee and that really will be the next stage in getting some of this work underway the letter to the minister I mean that really reiterates a position that we 've already taken and there is a sense of frustration that there is some work that clearly needs to be done in this space it 's not the first time we 've had the conversation that 's three so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you and thank _"

    "text": "the first of which being the living wage report which as I already explained my thinking is that it 's certainly more appropriate to debate and decide on that and when the mayor is present we 've heard the deputation we 've got the commitment that those that aren 't present today we 'll review the deputation through the the livestream the video footage prior to the debate next week so I 'm happy to move that we leave that lying on the table and the other piece that we leave lying on the table I 'm proposing is the strategic directions decision clearly strategic directions is a piece of work which has been led by the mayor it 's entirely appropriate that we debate that and make a decision on it with the mayor in the room as well so I 'm happy to move the motion that we leave both of these matters lying on the table until next week 's meeting seconded by Jamie Gough all those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "item three the public participation 3.1 public forum and Jenny gillies regarding the enchanted garden in the tea kiosk in the Botanic Gardens so we as we came into the chamber this morning obviously we saw that there was going to be some very visual public participation Jenny and thank you for being with us this morning if you 'd like to come forward to the table and you have five minutes to make your presentation great to have you with us this morning councillors well I 'm Jenny gillies I 've currently got an exhibition on in the tea kiosk and the gardens I 'm running this in conjunction with the Botanic Gardens and of course the Christchurch City Council and that we have been running since December so up to date up to the end of June we have actually had getting or over 8,000 people in wherever doing probably 40 for a day of course very weather dependent you know some days we will have hundreds others not quite you know not quite as busy as that and we 're getting lots of things which was actually that people would love to see this actually as a permanent feature actually in the city and I think they regard that as sort of as almost as a replacement for the festival of flowers and of course of late Ellis Lee so I 'm trying to reflect currently what 's going on in the gardens by changing my costumes and seasonally and so it is a rotating and growing exhibition now in winners opened in December the 16th the media caught the attention of a very prestigious Flower Show in the UK the Harrogate Flower Show which has guard regarded as the premiere event for floral art and I was invited and funded over there and I found this a great opportunity to promote Christchurch though though they she was recording at the Christchurch connection and when I was actually over there I discovered this in the 1950s the superintendent of a Botanic Gardens had supplied seed and given up to the valley gardens in Harrogate and I was they were talking around and showed me the native garden there so this that was actually basically he started here and I have actually been approached over the last few months to take it elsewhere but my aim is actually to keep it here I 'm a contrarian I 'm very Storch about that I 'm very staunch about Garden City image and I want to promote this as a tourist venture and also as I also like to see it as an education from an educational point of view now we 've had a lot of high schools through with have isolde students we 've had visually impaired it which is great because the size of my costumes that you 'll understand I have a lot of design and textile students I have technology teachers coming through a lot of exchange overseas students that are affiliated with various high schools around and we have used u3a the University for slightly older people like me and we as I said before intermediate and a lot of high schools I 'm currently mentoring or a mistake holder for some of the NCAA 's students pursuing technology and this is a part of what I really enjoy and would like to see appealing to you for as well currently as extended until December now anyone would realize that 's the height of the tourism season and this is when we really get huge numbers through now as I feel this is totally unique and this has been stated by the numerous visitors that come through and I might add the majority as as well as locals and tourists from her up New Zealand a huge number of UK visitors that 's where I found really nice I would like to get into the Chinese market and things through trips but I have to go to source for the and this is where I 'm not asking for rate payer money I 'm asking for support from City Council and practicing this is a more permanent venture and perhaps support with marketing and given the inroads into these markets where I can actually develop this more as a tourist attraction for our beautiful Garden City thank you thank you very much indeed and that does allow time for a couple of questions if indeed there are the opportunity for questions it was a part-timers and these are two of my delightful flower girls that helped me down at the kiosk so that does leave the opportunity for a couple of questions if any counselors do have questions Tim just want to ask have you been in touch with Christchurch Cinzia the new tourism and economic no I haven 't yet I was waiting for this to be made more permanent as you understand for six months it was rather Tim pre and I didn 't want to put coz I am financing it myself I didn 't really want to well I 'm paying the wages I didn 't really want to be putting a lot of money into something which could have at any time I could be asked to move on so but I feel that Christchurch you 're really behind it and I 've got a huge amount of support from the community I 'd say there 'd probably be a great place that sort of going talk to next I don 't yes oh well I wanted to do that and well whatever else that you could advise me don 't actually we don 't know those contexts which is so important for something like this so I 'm going to move in a minute that we refer the matters raised in the public participation to the appropriate committee so that they can be picked up at the committee level so I 'll do that in a moment I 've got a further question now from Erin yes we like to include you 've run up this accounts of Ginny do you make them boys sizes yes I don 't my at my husband sorry I probably was meant to press something on here I don 't know but oh oh no you saying it anyway I don 't know if you 've got a page which yeah there was a page with a red-hot poker on it you could actually you could actually sorry now that we can have a slideshow there 's actually there 's actually the red-hot poker now that 's my husband 's and there you can see are not good on the computer sorry I 'm lightening up the meeting for you there are the girls were freezing in the freezing Yorkshire weather there I had so much news media I couldn 't believe that BBC National Covenant and it went worldwide to New York China and the London Times and everything so there was a good bit of coverage Li and yes sorry now I 'm learning how to use a computer that 's another thing I 'd like advice on I 'm not I 'm okay on a sewing machine huh let 's run it sure Jimmy alright well thank you very much indeed for bringing such a colorful and vibrant bit of public participation to our meetings is something about meeting off to a good start thank you for Larry 's talk great thank you very much indeed for joining us so I will now move that we thank jenny gillies for the participation for her participation in the meeting and refer the matters raised to the appropriate committee thank Jenny gillies for her participation in the public forum and refer the matters raised to the appropriate committee so I 'm happy to move that do I have a seconder I not just participating here but also keeping Christchurch New Zealand as the Garden City on the world map as well I think it 's important words yeah yeah great ambassador for the Garden City well the most hotels in Adelaide and of course that was that doing and I was had a shot a meeting with the Lord mirror over there and actually the Lord pirates that had a meeting with the mirror people and the mayor of Harrogate he wants to come over to see me yes so I thank you great thank you very much so Aaron you 're suggesting a change in the wording thank Jenna gillies for her participation in the meeting and maybe just and for the important work she 's doing a moat in Gloucester an international ambassador of the Garden City let 's let 's bestow their honor okay so food yeah for the important work yet for the important work she is doing as an international ambassador ambassador for the Garden City yep and refers to the masters race and probably for us the appropriate committee that 's ready okay great and all right great so I 'm happy to move that day on you 'll have it second all those in favor against as carried thank you very much indeed for providing such a colorful start to our meeting tonight great okay now that then brings us to item 3.2 deputations by appointments and the first deputation relates to the living wage item on our agenda today now as became obvious through the apologies the mayor 's absent today an indicator of a matter as important as the living wage and in particular where there are aspects of this decision which could have depending how the debate and the decision goes could have an implication for the long term plan of course the long term plan is a piece of work which is led by the mayor so my thinking certainly is that it 's important that the mayor is part of the decision so I 'll be moving shortly as a procedural motion that the living wage matter be left lying on the table until next week 's meeting so delayed by just one week so that the mayor is still hear the deputation today and certainly acknowledging the fact that some people have traveled some distance to be here to make this deputation and the other commitment that we will make is that before this is debated next week anybody who 'll be part of that debate and decision next week who 's not in the room at the moment will review the footage of the deputation which is going out on the livestream today and will be available for review so that everybody has got the same information as have the ability to see the information that 's about to be presented to us now before we get to the point of the debate and decision next week so at that point I 'd like to invite Matt Donahoe from representing air two and the living wage steering group Matt I know you 've traveled some distance to be with us today thank you for joining us and certainly take out from the comments that I 've made around the opportunity for review of the footage of the deputation that you 're about to make to us so questions if you wanted to leave time over to you thank you for joining us thank you Kyra Coto thank you everyone I would like to acknowledge first of all before I started I tried knowledge people in the room I 'd like to acknowledge all of you as counselors and the deputy mayor and I 'd like to acknowledge the mayor who can 't be here today for giving us the opportunity to make this deputation today we really appreciate it and I hope the fact that I 've come here from Auckland is evidence of sort of how much we have invested in your views and how much we we care about what happens in Christchurch I 'd also like to acknowledge the people supplying the ratepayers of Christchurch who have sat behind me many of them respondents maybe not quite as colorful as the the flower-garden people but certainly colorful in red t-shirts and I 'd also like to acknowledge the people that are behind them because I think it 's really important when we 're talking about the living wage movement to recognize that we 're it 's unions whether it 's faith groups whether it 's employers and I know I think Christian world services are in the room today who are accredited living wage employer here in Christchurch so you know I think it 's really important to remember those people and I 'd also just like to extend a special acknowledgement to that to the nine councillors who sign that pledge on the living wage when they stood for election and kind of were prepared to test support for that idea with the public and obviously you know they 're here today so it goes to show that that was worth doing now I realize I 've only got ten minutes and there 's there 's some factual stuff that we 'll probably want to go over but I think that 's probably best to leave that for questions and answers and I just like to start by talking about my journey here today which actually didn 't just start a half past 00 this morning when I left my house it actually started in the early 80s when I was when I up in England you learn several things about New Zealand you learn that it 's a beautiful country with amazing scenery and environment you learn about the culture and diversity and the fact that it 's a society of equality or that aims for equality where possible and a society that has overcome kind of issues to grow together and you also learn about the three cities and you know any English person can name three cities in New Zealand and they are Auckland Wellington and Christchurch and you know a popular pop quiz question in the UK is what is the capital of New Zealand and you would not be surprised probably to hear how many people maybe not in Harrogate who know it is the Garden City but elsewhere who would put Christchurch down potentially as the capital you know it really is seen as one of the great cities of New Zealand this is my first time here actually and I wish I had a bit longer to spend here but the reason I 'm here today and my journey though I referred to is because when of trying to find ways whether it 's for the Union movement or food community groups trying to find ways of improving people 's lives ways of helping people will put food on the table and so on you know we would make arguments with employers with communities with politicians and so on in the UK where you say look these things can work in other countries other countries can be more equal societies you know we can learn from now and we can do that here and you always look in the UK you always look at the Nordic countries when you 're making that argument you might look at Germany you also always referred or used to refer to certainly refer to New Zealand as an example of a more equal society a better way of doing things and you know that led to me wanting to come here myself as an immigrant and move into this country in November last year so I 've not been here long and so far what I 've seen here has not disappointed me at all except for one thing I a country in 2016 which was basically a low wage economy from what I could see it was pretty clear to me arriving in Auckland that there were hundreds of thousands of people in New Zealand working two three jobs working 50 60 hours a week you know just to put food on the table sometimes not even to keep a roof over their heads but just to keep that car on the road because that 's what they 're living on and I know you know all about that and I don 't need to go into any more detail about that but what I would like to say is that in 2017 it feels like I 've arrived at exactly the right moment because 2017 is there is the moment that New Zealand said no to being a low waged economy with the equal pay settlement for thousands of caregivers and with the increasing adoption of the living wage by a whole range of employers whether a private sector whether a small medium or large whether a voluntary sector whether their local government are deciding to stand alongside that have been saying actually we don 't think it 's enough to pay people poverty wages we want to pay them enough to live on and it really feels like a moment like the tide is turning and we 're going to once again be able to sell New Zealand as being the most one of the most equal countries in the world and I think that the living wage is a key part of that and that 's why I 'm here today and that 's why Christ 's Church as well because as you will know Wellington City Council and I understand their mailings and confusing reports on the radio this morning but when is the City Council is pretty much paying nearly all its contractors and always dollar to employed staff already the living wage which is 20 20 an hour all clean City Council has you know made a decision this year to start moving directly employed staff towards a living wage we now have an opportunity for the third great city of New Zealand to join them to stand shoulder-to-shoulder and say yes we enough to live on and we 're gonna lead by example so that 's why I 'm here today that 's the reason for my journey just to move on now to what we took why we put in our written submission of the interpretation story which hopefully you 've got in front of you in your iPad 's there 's a lot of that now a lot of this is responding to the report you received that was made to the strategic capability committee on the 11th of May I would like to start by just saying by also acknowledging actually the people to put the hard work people who work for the council and who are on the strategic committee and you put the hard work into producing this report it 's a really interesting useful and helpful report for us and in particular I 'm very interested in the demographic information that is provided which obviously touch a lot about the sort of age profile and the the kind of nature of work that is done by the people that are currently receiving less than the living do have to say I am a little disappointed that there 's actually no gender or ethnicity break back in here because I think if I 've seen anything over over the years I 've been involved in trying you know be part of a movement in terms of people 's lives it 's that overwhelmingly the people who suffer from like you have to put up with life on low wages then look like with multiple jobs life working really long hours when they can 't_''_1163.46 be with their family is women and it 's also quite clear to me certainly in Auckland probably more than here that there 's also a NIC dimension to low wages as well and I think it actually really interesting to start gathering that information as well at this level so we can start measuring the difference that can be made to people 's lives by low wages now just as well I was in the in the submission I referred to several other papers which I understand have also been distributed now I understand how questions about some of them but I was actually slightly wary about including because it 's the the Treasury paper on using ID ID data to estimate fiscal impact sorry I have to look at it while I 'm saying such a long title using the data to estimate fiscal impacts of better social sector performance now I 'm sure we will read through the 28 pages of this last night and have come up with some some questions around it but if you haven 't had a chance to do that I just like to make it clear the reason why I decided on the end in the end to include this and it was literally was the last minute 10 minutes of 3 decision to include this that 's because one of the issues I found going around to New Zealand talking about the benefits and some of them elicited in the paper that I 've submitted to you the benefits of the living wage the experiences we 're using the stories we 'll be using especially when we talk about large-scale public sector employers and overseas and they 're from the UK in fact living wage movement in the UK I have seen these firsthand so I can speak to them with some you know and I am convinced however what we don 't have yet is real quantitative data that demonstrates the real benefits of the living wage in a New Zealand context why this interests me this Treasury report is because it is a suggestion that going forward the Treasury is going to be analyzing that 's along with other things to look at the ongoing fiscal impact of introducing that living wage fiscal and social impact I should add of introducing a living wage to low pay people in an at-risk people and certain vulnerable groups within New Zealand society going forward what this is is a evidence based kind of underlying is going to be created as being created that will help us tell our own story of the benefits of the living wage in an entirely new zeeland context and that 's why I think it 's really exciting because you 'll also see that Christchurch is one of the cities looked at as well so we are actually 're going to be able to look back in two or three years and see what kind of impacts your decision that you 'll be taking next Thursday now has had on your people in however smaller scale um now there 's much more Michael Piper talk to but I 've actually run out of time apologies for that I understand who may have questions of course now taken into account that you are going to be voting next week it may be that questions come to us afterwards by email and I 'm happy to ask Joe Daly or someone to circulate my details and happy to talk to any council on the phone or via email about any questions you may have thank you yep and thank you very much indeed for the deputation this morning now there are three people have signaled questions to me and on the basis that we 'll have one question per person and we 'll keep them really brief and succinct I will allow those three questions which are from Sarah Phil and Erin but there won 't be time for any really brief and succinct that weekly okay thank you and thanks for providing all that extra information it was really really useful you 've mentioned that both Wellington and Auckland and my understanding is that they haven 't made a decision to sort of go ahead and fully implement immediately they 've done a stepped approach is that right so solely in Auckland they 've decided to take a step approach yes well they 're starting in September the the first kind of increments are going to start coming in which will substantially lift up the lowest paid workers and it 's also just worth briefly mentioning that it 's being implemented as part of a working group which includes representatives from the living wage movement including employers and includes representatives from the PSA and and council staff and H hours on working together see how they can make it work thank you thank you very much Mia and any report you may have seen one there 's a reference to a government in Treasury report 2014 I think where the argument is that one reason not that we don the people are below the very aged affect young or their part-time though there may be students and the implicit they won 't have children or dependents there 's wonder if you might call me to bail that kept using government 's Treasury argument yeah I mean I certainly there is evidence of age based evidence there and you 've provided it yourself in your own counsel report in regards to the counsel however what we would say is you know just cause someone 's young doesn 't mean they don 't have children doesn 't mean I don 't have dependents doesn 't mean I don 't have elderly relatives that they 're supporting you know it doesn 't mean they 're they 're not the kind of person that I 've spoken to who puts the fuel in their parents car so their parent can get to their low paid parent can get to work so I would I would personally argue that age is absolutely irrelevant and I would also just wonderful point as simply as I can on that you know in your report it shows living less than the living wage at the moment are lifeguards and swimming instructors and it occurs to me they 're the people teaching your kids to swim you know your kids are not gonna so do you want to be paying on poverty raises or do you want to pay them enough to live on irrespective of whether they 're supporting a family or not thank you and finally Erin yeah so I would have asked you some questions we are out of time met but my one point I 'd like to make is around the disability sector that in this country people with disabilities across the board in a third less than the rest of society and I think that should be a key part of your debate and argument going forward because that 's not an assist that is not a Society of the new form of equity I only found out about that recently and I yeah I absolutely think she needs to be part of her it needs me part of the movement going forward absolutely thank you all right thank you very much taking the time to come and speak to us this morning and do come back to Christchurch and then the next time you come stay a little longer thank you so that brings us to our second deputation of the morning and I called bill Simpson from the South Shore residents Association chair of the South Shore residents Association of this deputation is regarding item 17 South New Brighton regeneration planning now my intention once we 've heard this deputation we 've got a number of procedural motions that we need to put but once we 've done that my intention is to bring this item to the top of the agenda so that we can debate them item 17 while you 're still in the room at the readings away so thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning and you have ten minutes to make the deputation and if you wanted to allow some time for questions and that 's entirely your choice thank you great thank you and thank you counselors for and giving us the opportunity to talk to you this morning it 's Denise George whose committee member and she did a lot of the mechanics behind a petition that 's been floating in South Shore recently and Tim sentece a lot of you of know but is also on our committee so the agenda item I wish to speak to is item 17 which is on page 99 of your agenda and this is basically an update for you on the regeneration plan for South New Brighton but there are lots of references in there to South Shore as well now South Shore is a community of 500 households we were the 700 before the earthquakes and I see it on page 101 of your agenda and section 5.3 that the councillors agreed to look at the ocl proposal for flood protection for South Shore this was the Gary T report that was commissioned by the South Shore residents Association in with press probe I know it 's a very professional piece of work so it 's a step forward from our point being for you to agree to review that report and for staff to report back to you I also your agenda on page 104 section 5.2 six that the council will work with regenerate Christchurch 's review the time frame for regeneration planning for South Shore more concise thing goodness we 're not very happy with the time frame that we 've heard of from regeneration christchurch and if you can put pressure on for that to be speeded up thank you very much and that leads me on to what I really want to say to you the over the recent week there have been other parts of the city that have been far more badly affected than South Shore me realize that and people were risk to a greater degree than we were but the fact is that what happened in South Shore was entirely preventable unnecessary we appreciate the work that your staff did a very quick notice on Friday night in particular to build up the temporary structures they protected us on the following tides in South Shore that came in on the Saturday and Sunday but we did have flooding through South Shore on Friday afternoon with the high tide and a lot of as I say the flooding was predictable there were similar floods three years ago to slightly less to the Greek and your own flooding task force did some work and South Shore as a result of that but not enough the work was to strengthen a sea or a stop bank yet Caspian Street well it didn 't follow through on work that was proposed further down south shore which would have protected us when Serena cleaned up the red sign along South Shore the managed to build a low payment on their own land and it 's barely a meter high if you go down there it 's just like a walking track it 's not obtrusive but it does and it has particulars from some of the high tides over the last two or three years but it was always a temporary measure it 's no more than topsoil that was all it 's not compacted and it could easily wash away didn 't pit anytime and worst thing for us is that it 's not continuous there are gaps and that embankment and that 's what happened roads the side roads go through to the ester II so if you know Southshore these are gaps like pigment strip club er Street and so on we 've being wrong the council 's attention to that for several years now that those gaps really needed closing and sure enough from Friday afternoon with a high tide high rainfall and the change of wind that 's where the water kept on the history came through there 's a lot of unnecessary damage to garden sheds garages conservatories and water flowed through the living areas of at least three properties that we know of in South Shore so those people hid itself evacuate the main road broad north road was flooded to new height and a lot of people had to leave their cars up in South Brighton on line parade and then try and wade home through a flooded street and that was on a Friday as they 're coming home from work on Saturday the community reacted in a spontaneous way a petition was organized the South Shore residents Association was asked to sanction the petition and we say through and as part of our deputation today I just want to table that permit that petition and we Hibbs the Priya reads please can we hit the Priya read plays on the petition the residents of South Shore like to express our anger and disappointments at the late and inadequate response from counsel in relations flood risk the flood events of this weekend highlight what we have been saying to the council for six and a half years since the earthquake the previous flood defences on red zone property were demolished and the land scraped and lowered by red zone clearance and not reinstated a new stormwater system has been installed to half the community but this inadequate prevent provision is a point of flooding as witnessed in the last few days water from the estuary comes up through the drains and floods the street during high tide once the high tide has receded the outlets do not allow water to drain out the temporary bond has gaps Innes which lo and behold caused us to flood this is man-made this is a man-made and negligence issue and one we have even offered a solution to try and help which has been met with yet more obstruction turning up with diggers after we have flooded is appalling the time for action is now as residents of Christchurch we urgently need the City Council to sow some long overdue leadership on this issue and we seek urgent effective remedial action rather than band-aids the council talk of resilient cities yet the lack of action by the council is resulting in exactly the opposite and causing immense social upset mental health issues and stress signed by 344 residents of South Shore so heading there you 'll see this petition or anger and frustration basically there is no a lot and a petition specifically in a tracing for there is mentioning of the stormwater system which simply needs it and a good overhaul from our point of view badly designed badly maintained underlying the petition though is a plea from our residents to say for heaven 's sake speed up the regeneration planning for South Shore so that we get a permanent solution this yes is there any regeneration planning for South three years yet the public consultation for South Shore has not even started and after that you 'll know that there 's design processes and implementation processes destory over the last six years since the earthquake has not been very good so in the meantime are we left I shouldn 't say they have to be hanging out and dried because we 're not dry and that 's that 's the risk that we face until the regeneration planning has completed we 're still exposed to a high risk of flooding now that risk has been reduced somewhat on emergency basis and we thank you for that but it still exists and it still needs to be and South Shore still needs to be protected one particular thing that asks you to think of is there please don 't give any other agency in the city the ability to say to us we want to do a piece of work but we 're waiting for the council to do their bit first we 've heard that excuse several times and we would like you to keep up the pressure on not left as unnecessary flooding again Thank You counselors thank you very much indeed for taking the time to to become a presenter as this morning and for presenting this petition we 'll take a couple of questions in a moment there will be time for that but I 'll just ask you a question if I can to start off with just to clarify obviously the points that you 're raising relate to on going frustration over a number of years as set out in the petition rather than anything particularly relating to the the response and the recovery to the flood event that happened over this last few days yes yes that 's that 's why I mean certainly what I 'm hearing is that you know the message that you 're raising have been ongoing for some time the need to deal with these is urgent and the events of the last few days serve to demonstrate the urgency that is required exactly great thank you okay so that does leave us with time for a couple of questions are there any questions from counselors felt thank information but could you just clarify for me what the Garrity report the OSHA report which as you say was actually done proficiently so has that been peer-reviewed in terms of for future work I don 't think so okay and I guess my other question told was I 'm not sure if you 're able to give us any approximate number of the of houses which in fact we 're flooded about floor level do do we do you have any social there are three that we know of where the water actually flowed through the living area a lot of people here hundreds consider the trees and garages and so we 're gonna see me yeah thank you thanks for me Thank You Glen thank you thank you cool you weren 't just by way of long-term response and this is getting down in detail and we can 't second-guess it but do the residents have a variety of views over for instance what you would do with the history each so some may want hard protection some may want softer cetera and is there a range of both extremes and in our community was initially I supposed to be honest quite split had aged soft edge those are the terms that we used when Gary tears it was commissioned to do this report he came up with solution that satisfied 98% of our community we know that by survey so it does combine all those views for the earth and that proposal thank you David thank you vote following the episode last weekend are there any immediate actions that you would like to see council and act following the one that 's been done over the weekend in terms of operations on the cement yes certainly to look at whether those topics they put on Tim Curley enough I suspect that we 're still at risk because the abatements that sarah put in two years ago now which are just tops all will stand up to another serious float as I say it 's uncompacted it 's low it could give away at any moment 's notice so whether your people could look at that see when it needs to be added to and that 's probably that needs to be looked at that would be the first thing the second thing is make sure the petitioners that stormwater system the drainage stormwater drainage system the valves look to act to most residents as a very poor design as I say not easily maintained over and what about would contend finishing off work on the bones that have been constructed isn 't certainly that at the moment is pretty short it 's a stopping it needs I mean I 'm not an engineer although we all become engineers very quickly don 't we but I would assume that at some stage your staff will be looking at consolidating compacting and covering that with grass and stabilizing it and the sooner the better from a a beautifying point of view okay thank you very much indeed once again thank you very much for taking the time to come and present to us this morning on what we know is a very important issue thank you very much indeed for your time they can cancel so we have a resolution in front of us noting and receiving the petition edge issues of South Shore including through the recovery planning response deploying events of 21st 23rd July staff report back counsel on the Oh cell proposal of options for short-term measures and the South Shore and South New Brighton regeneration strategy led by regenerate Christchurch and City Council and then request that the chief executive consider the petition in the context of the various work streams already underway related to the South Shore area including the regeneration strategy work been led by regenerate Christchurch do I have a move for this resolution Pauline and a seconder Dave yonni thank you I was just interested in number two given that we can 't well I guess we have contractors who have just done work there it is any work underway looking at maximizing the efficiency of what 's just being done because there 's nothing in that those resolutions that highlight if we are or if we aren 't what 's been done under the emergency response yeah that 's right there a temporary response okay and so what part of the recovery panel look at is what can be maintained meeting team longer term as well so I 'll just is there any other temporary emergency works or short term works that are being considered while we 've got the contractors there so the contractor the beer just to put on the capes and the bund ones we 've been talking to learns about what they might do to the apart of the fund as well okay so sorry so we 've heard from the deputation concern that the funds land so we do have a process underway to make sure that part the recovery planning and how long is that going to take well that 's it that 's happening now right do we have a time frame for hmm 28 days we have we with powers within that time to be able to do things cool so we 've got the power than the mean time to do stuff and if we can do it say no we 'll do it sooner do a single game okay okay thank you thank you okay so we 've got a resolution in front of us which has been moved and 've had a question and nobody else signal questions did you want to debate this okay so we 're now in two phases wait look I do support the notion of regeneration plans but the the really disappointed at times that the time frame is so protracted and we 've heard from bill and the South Shore people about you know they 've waited for six years and we 'll never get things going I 'm also concerned that this plan really only focuses on the mapped area shown in the report and now we are we debating the deputation or are we debating the paper that we have that we 're not considering yet because what we this is just around the deputation of the resolution that 's in front of us we will then move very shortly to debate the paper which is on our agenda yes so it sounds as though what you 're saying will be more appropriate to bring up when we get to the debate on the paper all right now Glen you signaled you 're the same yet because we 'll come to is dealing with the matters raised in the deputation and how we 're going to deal with the petition all right so I will put the motion which is in front of us all those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "but to get them registered so in Indian and the the dedication was a very very unusual way process to to actually try and help a developer just to just to gain a few weeks and just wondered why and the City Council were really going down that trick and thought that we that we haven 't been we haven 't heard from the other part parties to this resource conceit we 're only hearing from one party the people that have been referred to is some neighbors from a party to us can see they have not been consulted and the reports are in the staffs report that says with the community views only the views of the other landowners ethic is applicable but where is that here that is other landowners have not had the opportunity to put their views to either the community board or to this council other than the opportunity they had for 10 minutes each today so that was that was one of the things that we hadn 't heard the other party 's views when this came to our community board so then them with both option one and option two and when we have a look at the risks of option one and option two option to actually carries the least risk appalled and it reads the full risk formed by the developer to place the matter before the court for a mediation because we 've since found out that the risk mediation and mediation has taken place at 30 tomorrow so but by the end of next week this issue may well be sorted with a bit down to court but anyway getting back to the information that we had at the board we could be considered that and the other others 7.12 and that there was residual risk writing of this is as low and we 've since they ended up in pH that there is that statement there is 7.1 to run is factually incorrect so that was you know that 's it 's those reasons why we think that the safest option is to actually if there 's any issues between the parties to the to the resource consent that they can be suited that through the property community board or the City Council or s can make a really informed decision on this that you must hear both sides of the story and we were aware before our community board meeting that the offer was sent here to councilors and to the community board members with the invitation to meet the affected parties and that that done request was declined so I think we are in a very very tricky position as a community board at the time to actually make a decision to run to allow that the dedication of these roads just for the to help a developer and not take any notice or even listen to the affected parties who we represent we represent the ratepayers of fruit of our Ward not necessarily a developer so that 's where our priorities Lloyd like and that is why our community board made the decision that they did and and headed on the that the cows will agree to meet with the adjoining property owners to discuss options on a way forward regarding the shortest village subdivision thank you Helen Helen was there anything to add true we saw as a cleaner process it involves the developer taking the process whichever way he or she want wishes to and it 's involves the residents and the the developer to do option one with tangling Council up in this process we are going with a procedure that Christ futures never done before a dedication it 's been in North since 1974 I had a look at the Local Government Act but we have never used it so we 're using this process on a first time on a really contentious issue in going back to having a cleaner process when I first got involved in this and just after the February earthquake I was called in by a sick I went and saw a Senior Planner and a junior planner on this issue and they said to me you must keep clear of the contract between the developer and the residents that 's their private contract so we 're doing a sort of turn around it as a council and allowing this dedication to go through the advice all the way throughout head keep away from the I understand it is very closely tied with with noble it 's a similar joint venture party and Delta as I understand it and I can be corrected on this Delta is a party to V the company it 's not just a contracting company so got very ill in some way endless joint to future company yes I think there 's risks an option one and the risks are if if the developer has taken to court and now if we are taken to court and we lose that the developer will underwrite that indemnify as the word but what happens if the developer has been corrupt at the time well as short of funding I can 't see that this developer would be able to reimburse Council for a court costs a of five court costs and proceedings are 500,000 all right now I indicated the point you have risks either way and one you 've been told that one the developer might take you to court option two so sorry option if you go with option two you 're being told that the developer might take you a chance that the residents take action against Council so I think it goes both ways so I think we should stay away from this or at the very least have a committee look at it and more careful with detail we 've lived with this for a long time there are no most people in this room that 's feeling you and I just think it 's a cipher just used to wrap up what thank you very much all right now I 've got a couple of questions in your community board option you 're suggesting that kemp 's will agree to meet with the adjoining property owners just when you say counsel you mean the elected councillors the people sitting Raiders table yes sure because on Android because there are the people who will be making a decision and they need to have that balance of information to actually make an infer the decision at this stage so they 're okay thanks for the question X the answer so the role of counsel in having that meeting in your resolution it says to discuss options on a of reckoning of that would be to work up a different set of recommendations than we 've got in front of us as a result of that meeting maybe it maybe Optive head after there 's been a people sit around the table never discussion about it then maybe a way forward and but I 'm not saying that the City Council should be the mediator I 'm saying that we haven 't heard from the other part I think well maybe the castle could do this or maybe you guys would be bidded to go and do this or that or the other thing at prison does a huge vacuum of information we 've got a whole lot of information up here some of some of it is may not be hundred percent correct as we found it and we 've got a lot of information down here that nobody knows anything about other than the very very short bursts of it that we had this morning and when the depth when the other property owners or parties to this resource consent had the opportunity to speak that 's and then I think you 've answered the question a question for Helen even that you 've had advice that we shouldn 't get involved in private property disputes yes how do you reconcile that with us getting involved in the type of negotiation you 're suggesting an option to yes look I probably was lukewarm on getting tequila but it was the view of in fact the board yeah now we see that this is the recommendation from the boards so maybe Mike 's supporting that more strongly than the newer yes and I 'm I 'm really strong on on option to being the the cleaner option all right thank you that 's clear so I don 't any more questions for Mike or Helen Tim thanks mr. chair I 'm mark and Helen so I received on some deputations by residents because you kind of saying what the sounded lights residents versus a developer type thing well we had deputations for some of the residents that were in favor of the option one so a new one tells it work well and we hope for the other many how many of those affected residents are actually in favor do you know and two and three that have done done deals so that 's that 's out of 13 okay no seven two and three so seven can we get a clear answer to the question please so the question term was how many of the residents are in favor or whether they stand all there is the servant of the parties are in favor yeah two of them not sure and the others have done deals and over some access to to watch 22 etcetera etcetera and then and then so and I agree that they had an agreement I believe that they won 't take any then it was referred to by the deputies so and and I have spoken to mr. O 'Malley and quite a while ago where he put his where he put his issues and that was that was back in the days of noble noble investments limited I haven 't spoken to him since the changeover but but he said that they hadn 't but anyway him and I sat in seven of the parties and wanting us to actually want any development directionally go ahead with with with the original conceits and and the covenants remain in place until such time as they get deep at their issues to the boundary I spoke to them out there at the break and I was assured that seven airbase air based and those people seven of them are actually supported with this of this group of people 's concerns okay thank you fine right as you put it that way at least this group of people 's concerns the 7th ed of the 12th theater thank you there any other questions for the like if I could just add it was a really simple question in his behind on with the numbers the Tim wanted one landowner said to me who 's supportive of of the residents action or what he said 80 to 90 percent of the land which is owned 80 to 90 percent of the owners of their land in favor of what the board 's advocating in favor of option to yes so it 's some had your got now we 've got Dion Jimmie and Dave so these are questions really because I 'm really confused about lot 600 I 'm just reading the information I can 't find anything that actually mentions 600 and any other reports that I 've read correctly so what 's the deal with 600 okay that 's a question sorry Mike that 's a question for staff up and grab them for Mike because we were provided that information oh that is critical because I 've just been read it I haven 't_''_863.3 I mean this is a lot of information to try and draw yeah but it 's just a lot of information to crawl through and others and they 'll incredible cross any of the information that I 've had from the reports do we need to do that that then actually doesn 't sort of talk about 600 because okay can we get the advice on so to answer Dion 's question can we get the further advice such as it can be given in this meeting again as on lot 600 600 so when we originally the six zero six zero one wasn 't a lot script but the day before the community board meeting after talking to museum trains well agency I realize there was an issue to connect the state highway so I did raise verbally at the community board meeting that not 600 was also an issue it is my mistake there was originally liftoff Mary port but it was until later that talking to New Zealand Transport Agency that I realized it could be but the information was provided to the community board at the time that they made their recommendation then that information has been provided to us and pxm I did yeah yes it 's it 's not an our report that was presented to us greatly escalade absolutely right and it 's an issue right okay are there any further questions for the community board chair or deputy chair Jimmy and this would be a question last time coming for make these issues without any notification but who they have a saving The Temptations for is a support option to Street support option one purpose on the community for the the deputation already so that regarding to a paraquat what 's the purpose need to consider engaging with those four people as a member we had the the the affected parties weren 't consulted with them Jimmy there were they were given the opportunity to have a 10 minute slot here to present a history whole whole world of information about this matter and ten minutes and one of the one of the deputies and had to perform surgery today yeah and and his son deputation or verbal deputation or sent through the year-end here before and once I got it from from yes I thought of that through the year so he hasn 't that person hasn 't had an opportunity to present anything here today either and and that 's that 's it that we had but we haven 't_''_1036.8 we didn 't they didn 't want wish to give them the opportunity to make a deputation to our community board at that stage because we didn 't know what resolution it was that we were going to resolver their community board anyway but thought the best option was a part a to actually proceed and to to make the deputation to the council today who are the decision Malthus rather than to a community buried here are any Reich in a recommendation so we made the recommendation on the best information that we had at the time even though some of it was and throwing a the very last minute than px and no record of it as you found out was turned up until about a half an hour ago it 's popped up under the screen which is the crucial part of this whole matter crucial part of this all better mr. Trump which so okay and I mean councillors are aware of the way in which the information has been presented and I 'm sure they 'll take that into account in their decision-making Jimmy was that your final question yeah all right so we 're now through questions so now we are looking for somebody to move something Aaron yes I would like to move and then try and talk you 've run into it into doing nothing that we don 't touch fraught and there 'll be issues either way and also I 'm going to move that we do nothing 's we 're going to signal speaker so we 've got moved and seconded that we do nothing great okay cool can I speak pose the mover if you 'd like to speak to that cool actually I 'm staying up the song and I take a leaf out of the blades book when he stood on things but where he stood up to the east I honestly care not to the people over in Yonkers yes I the reason why I 'm Singh opted to do nothing is and I learned a lot this morning so I 've heard about this for quite some time Andrew I need your attention so I 've got to try and talk you into it as well same option is option to the date on the almost ends up being the same as option two because if we don 't intervene it 's the same as what I 'm going to tell them in front of the others that go to the courts I 're in if it affects the advice okay can we put up do nothing yeah but the arbitration as I understand it 's on a different matter okay hang on so we 've got them let 's just get some advice first of all on whether the arbitration is on the same matter that we 're considering today it 's not okay so what we 've got is something that you might want to consider whether you want to move on not once the mover of this motion was finished speaking to his motion whether you want to foreshadow or further motion that we leave the matter line in the table pending the outcome of the arbitration but we now know that the arbitration is actually on a different matter I can 't take comment from the public gallery I 'm sorry it is it relates to the subdivision does not relate thank you thank you my response to that is that if we resolved matters between the developer and the reasons this is likely okay so we 've now gotten two different we 've now got into debating a seconder of the motion we 're currently debating happy to have their motion amended to reflect what David 's asking for or do we take that as a foreshadowed motion to deal with after we 've dealt with what you 're doing here yeah so my motion will be to leave it on the table of arbitration so do nothing at the moment leave the matter lying on the table until arbitration is complete I mean we don 't know the answer to that question so six weeks for arbitration on alright so we need to come up with okay so as a matter of process our and you 're now changing the motion that you 're putting the report lie on the table until yes I do have concerns and around that because it still leaves this potential process open which I think and I was going to use it in the mud debate as part of a tool that the developer is using okay so what do you want to do so expensive okay yeah yep so I will land on the table until we until the arbitrations that motion you 're comfortable with that so now we 're debating then the amended motion go ahead yeah so what we heard this morning was from the affected residences that that essentially and it 's taken me a long time to understand this board into a property deal where you buy a big chunk of land you scale it down you get a token feet for at the major portion of it which is in a different part it gets divvied up at subdivision happens and then you can because you get lipids your land you are allowed to subdivide the parcel you live with it but you have services in a row at you 'll go sounds like a good deal a lot of us will probably sign up to it I would would myself it sounds fantastic and some of them had gone into that with the intention what 's happened since and this is where it kind of becomes a legal versus a moral debate I believe and do we have a choice we do have choices today luckily because I do believe that these things on and I think it it 's a good thing that has come in front of the council what happened then is win the original developer fell over you get a mortgagee sale which is referred to like a bag and so you then Russian and buy something for its cheap as you can and then you have an option when you buy something whilst they 're already deal on the table and will I be a good neighbor and honor the original deal or legally I don 't have to and I can walk away and start again and that 's to me what this feels like on no one but that 's exactly how this feels and this is about being a good neighbor and we want to encourage that and I think this is a way that is legally they can get out of your obligations to provide those services but is that the right thing and is that the right thing for the people that invested we 've heard today that some still want to try and win back their right to the services at the to just go ahead I think the ones that have opted for it to go ahead like we didn 't hear for most of them have given up because it 's a certain point you break like we 've had with the cathedral debate and you hear people often go on about our years ago I want to see affects it but it 's been so long now they just people give up and we live in an environment where that happens so are we going to let greed be used as a tool through our council and take away the dedication of this road or we 're going to allow it to happen and for me it 's a case of let 's let this lie on the table hopefully arbitration will give us a good result for everyone involved I do think it will cost the developer they will lose something but they will get a result so that for me is where hopefully the arbitration will go that the new developer will step up meet the old obligations get on with the development because this is a neighborhood one day and hopefully this will be put behind all of these people and give up any other speakers on this motion Phil I am very reluctant to support this motion and it just just seems to me to be delaying something which in fact you know just this has tacked been going for 15 years and the big previous attempts at mediation and resolving the conflicts to absolutely no avail so I think it 's absolutely clear that we we were advised today that in fact basically this is in fact for council a legal decision of course as always moral principles involved from all sides but in fact these the previous attempts at resolution have failed yes what do we learn from history well nothing was Churchill 's here we learn nothing from history anything real universities are learn nothing and I think we 'll be back here and the 27th of July hopefully if this is going I know one team to vote against it in the same position we are now it is a legal matter I 'm H I 'm going to vote against 'm going to explain why I supported the residents in the first place over the dangerous road no question of that I just want to give you an illustration I think it was a couple of years ago the local MP and I were invited to a meeting and Travis country about a house that was moved into that subdivision where a covenant exists now through various provisions a relocatable was allowed to be put in there but what we discovered the debate was between the developer and the residents it 's nothing to do with the council so these are sense in which HD echo accounts are clear waters view our decision that the background is legal other considerations are between the developers and the residents if you go with this option today you just about attach yourself to business which actually isn 't yours or else okay it 's between the developers and the residents if I look at this this started off this whole thing about unsafe roads you look at the process over time this kind of filibusters it okay it just pushes it out potentially certainty for everyone so on that it 's on those grounds that I 'm actually not going to support that resolution productive Thank You Jimmy and then Jimmy and then dive Jimmy thank you think it 's you yeah I support a light on the table because why the way they send uh say when the repetitions Nikko arise the this actually this issue is the ima consent in the issue should be the proper way go to the the consenting and and the resort consented posses but right now if there 's an arbitration of this environment call that make the mediation arbitration this why not we waiting for the result we go to the absolute one a moment because we heard this kind of offer the council dedicate the the world it looks like we care that you walk but if we go to the option to know it 's the developers remove the Covenant soon occult and then public council still have a legal the challenge es hecho it 's very hard to make us that you know no make that decision where we harm only stir waiting for lions April waiting for the resort I suppose and also based on community board their presentation if we right now when it considers kind of openers we cannot adjust in line to the one side about the acknowledged to the other side I 'm almost not here that the parents with winner we just waiting we can give us the the powerful time preview account to make a decision I think they in they can make decision is a kind of popper that the decision rather than right now is difficult for me to make this issue to take take anything you look I think I 've been involved in various iterations of this subdivision problem for probably six or seven years and it 's being a thorn on the side a council the local residents the community for all that time I appreciate the legal opinion that you know we probably don 't have any of the course but to approve this roading but I would like to support this motion and in giving arbitration one last chance to actually see if we can broker a solution to have been around the subject the developers initial obligation that they would provide services to the gate of these properties I don 't seem to have a lot of sympathy for the iterations of reformation of companies and things but it doesn 't sort of sit back comfortably with me so I don 't think was any harm and actually delaying this decision for a month maybe we do come back here in exactly the same position but at least from our point of view we have hang the olive branch out to see if we could come to some resolution in this sorry saga that is great on and on and on and a simple resolution to honor some of the original developer covenants would probably solve this and people would withdraw all their objections we 've got a road that doesn 't really comply and only we 're going to ever do much about that we have put those sort of things behind us but I think we actually owe it to residents some of which if this all goes through could be completely landlocked and and give this another chance why not see if we can once and for all and maybe with a bit of publicity behind this decision try and get to some resolve to put this to bed once and for all its dragged on too damn long six seven eight years or more it 's probably the worst example of a development and cross futures created the most problems the most anks for for people that are associated with it and it 's time that an amicable solution was found and we put the damn thing to be thank you thank you Pauline yeah so I mean look I basically agree with what Dave said but today I was coming and after the discussion I I see that actually the council 's perfectly in our rights to support option one I think that we there 's no reason for us not to legally however as we 've gone this long it could even be ten years and I know what councillor Clearwater is saying he you know if it hasn 't been resolved by now what 's the chances but hey three it this actually may provide a little bit of leverage and incentive to to help these this arbitration to actually be a fruit so for that reason and also because I know that there 's grumblings underneath the legalities that are a little bit unsettling but legally option one is as fine for us to support but in light of that I 'm happy to support the lie on the table and really hope that this community of developers residents will find a solution in three weeks time thank you know I 've got a procedural question just before we go any further with this if this resolution is passed now assuming asking question in this direction if this resolution is passed then the report lies on the table and it comes back to us on the 27th of July presumably with an update alongside on what the results of V or we need some update on what the results of the arbitration have been just in case that changes our decision-making anyway so that 's what would happen if this persons if this fails option one or option two on this afternoon and they yes yes all right thank you I share the view of some others that have spoken I mean this has rumbled on for how many years my level of confidence in anything changing in the next three or four weeks is pretty minimal it 's fair to say I mean yes we need to put this to bed once and for all and I believe our opportunity to do that is today I 'm not hearing anything in the deputations that we 've heard or in the positioning of various parties that gives me any level of confidence that there can be what 's been described as an amicable agreement on not hearing much amicable at all I 've got to say and I think there 's a real danger that debate we 've had today Jessica it 's been long and we 've heard the deputation and they 've listened to the deputations when we 've taken all of that into account well I don 't think any of us any of the parties concerned want to go through all of that again in be a useful useful use of anyone 's time so I 'm gonna vote against this and then we 'll see where we go whether this passes or whether it doesn 't_''_2226.96 after that film and through you Andrew if this fails I 'm just flagging option one as a further recommendation all right so you 're indicating that if this fails you would move option one thank you all right so I 'll put this to a vote all the other words in favor against no so how many were against yeah we 'll have a division if we can service yeah so against was myself Vicki buck Glenn Livingstone Phil Clearwater and and Galloway so its loss yep so it 's so it 's yes or yes so it 's okay with people you and so it 's carried so this will come back to us on the 27th of July but we need to make sure that we get any update of information alongside so that if there is anything new we can take that into account okay we 'll need to make sure that what will well understood and I 'm sure our staff can make that clear all right great looks _"

    "text": "it appears that a way forward here might be rather than considering changing of major changes to the submission or detail changes the submission here and now it may well be that to refer that to a group of counselors who are happy to spend the time doing this and then circulate a changed final draft to counsel us for feedback and then delegate to a couple of people to make a final decision on that submission bearing in mind that it needs to be submitted by the 21st maybe a more sensible way forward maybe we can get some comment from staff first of all and then they 'll be opportunity for some question and answer and then if we can perhaps think of that as a way forward so I 'm John thank you very much was there any comment that you want you to make around the submission and before we move to questions yes okay then thank you for the opportunity so we 're well aware of the stage one report that was released in March that gave the finding is about what happened and Havelock that issue as a nation so do we need to review the legislation do we need to review the drinking water standards do we need to look at ecoli as being the indicator that we 're looking for when we 're testing for water quality does there need to be changes in the way that we deliver water services and they come up with 24 separate questions all with multiple parts that so it 's a standard sort of format for preparing submissions that that myself and staff have tried to put together some Advisory notes to guide the way that you might consider the submission there are some questions in here that do relate almost directly to governance and some of those might be around they should there be a single water regulator at the moment there are several organizations that come into the space of regulation and do we look at other offshore models and what would be what would council consider to be appropriate it also talks about and should there be larger water utility organizations and big questions around should all water be treated and just Havelock North have been submitting quite strongly to say that the in their professional opinion that the days of secure Brewers might should well might well be numbered but because they believe the risk of managing untreated water supplies from from our groundwater sources is too risky because of the delays and the time it takes to get results so I agree with the approach that a subcommittee to workshop some of these things might be the best way forward because this is our one opportunity to have some feedback on this we have a largest water supplier in the country that serves a large population with what is on virtually untreated water what we believe we 're from secure sources and but there 's a body of opinion that some challenging that view so I 'd be happy to answer any questions on what 's been presented so far all right Thank You Polly do you have a question on one point two in the introduction you talked about the key to breed drinking water reference group and I 've made a submission so got two questions personally who is not intended to replace or detract from the submission can you tell me is this aligned to the submission or was these very different was there anything in the election so okay the the drinking water reference group was established in October 2016 in response to the have locked North outbreak and Bill Bayfield was probably the the person who actually put his hand up so it wouldn 't be a great idea what we know we collaborate on this we have different working groups like swim and wouldn 't be great to have everybody in the room so we got together with Environment Canterbury we 've got representatives from the six territorial local authorities around the Canterbury region we 've got MIT representation from the the CDHP so both the medical officer of Health and the drinking water Assessors and we 've invited Knight Tahu to come on to that group as well so that we can actually have one joined up of water issues a drinking water issues in the Canterbury region and they admit on floor occasions since October and we have put together a joint where we we look for areas of those 24 questions we look for the areas that we all had an a common view on or the draft had a common view so that draft submission from the drinking water reference group is waiting for the outcomes of our submission and and others like the the CDHP so that when we do submit we can actually submit with one voice to to the Commission in Hastings what that tells me too is that we 've already embarked on a collaborative process was their view of our water yeah great mr. chair the yum although we already had a very collaborative working arrangement will actually formalize that and in a formally established group with the terms of reference and some reporting outcomes will be put to the chief executives for amending and the Mirel form and so those two form will be looking at the joint submission before that gets ratified Phil thanks John I think it would be good to have discussion with a working group around just some basics cuz a huge amount of work has gone into this and was just like at the stage explanation for us like in terms of some other options that government may require or that we in that we may support but one that you refer to and this is on page sex and it 's I think it 's under point seven stool but it 's that there could be a regional water service entities as Terry so just if you could give us some picture of the components of that and how that might look like yes so there 's been a lot of work done on the benefits of larger water utilities and they got larger scale they I think when when they 're considering the delivery of water services in New Zealand we 've got one water company that delivers water to 1.5 million customers and Auckland that 's water here and then there 's 66 other utilities dealing with populations as small as 3,000 people so it 's quite disparate in the way that they deliver the services but they all have to meet the same statutory obligations under the legislation and under the drinking water standards that case and Havelock North by having larger regions you do share a lot of that in that that knowledge that it 's easier to attract and retain the right professional staff and you 've got a larger funding base and that they tend to have better outcomes as a result okay that explains that your did you want think one thing the mayor offered and we 've taken up is to look at regional approach section 17 a review incorporating all those areas now it hasn 't progressed as fast as we possibly can but east we 've been having those discussions on it and it 's been facilitated by one of the staff members in here but it was an effort made by the meal at the meal is full and which the me refer and cook up so those conversations is quite a bit of work around I think that 's sitting underneath the chief executive from hurinui is the project sponsor for that but we 're providing the resource to facilitate some of those discussions what are the pros and the cons of that but that 's think that cooperation across the region Thank You Vicki strike me is don 't have shallow bores as one of them rather than talk to your Regional Council it may be further down the list the consumer have is that when we met with again the information that you gave us on that somebody gave us might have been again on the surrounding authorities quality of water was that 25 of their wells were not compliant and that was what concerned me so I 'm just so the concern I have about Havelock North is that it affected the whole of the Hawke 's Bay region so nobody from outside of that region knew we 're have locked North particularly was so it affected all of the wrister surrounding towns so if something happens in Canterbury Christ Church well be seen as the place where you can 't drink the water despite the work that 's going on in the northwest so what concerns me is exactly the issue you 've just raised is the what happens around cows Ford what happens with all the dairy and runoff into our the rural area I 'm looking for a solution that doesn 't involve us necessarily being responsible for the 30 year delay in the nitrate build-up that other people have approved for dairying and farming and stockholding and on too much of Canterbury so I have a problem with you know suddenly we will take responsibility for the rest of the region the rest of the region is you know at peak care and the effects are not known for 10 or 30 years what are the rest of the local authorities around Christchurch during about the fact that their wells are in some instances not component it 's my concern yeah to the chair that that 's the point I made about smaller local government we already heard about some of the issues around our food and the issues that they 've had and thus the question from the inquiry members about should or ought to be treated because can we really rely on groundwater being protected in any sense what they thought were protected at wells in Havelock we 're obviously not when we have the same and long ago that if you do have an outbreak and a small rule local authority in Canterbury it 's going to damage the brand Canterbury and so that that 's one measure and that also leads the question do we need a a single dedicated water regulator that manages all of those issues rather than Regional Council so there 's different models around the world that they 're looking to to see if they would bring any value to New Zealand so sorry to press it but it seems to be probably the most important issue in the region and we have a situation where far too many land-use rights have been allowed by an unelected Regional Council which has which we will pay the cost of for the next 30 years and part of that cost is the quality of our water so just really directly like a networking group what are the other local authorities doing to make sure that their wells are actually compliant because if you go through that list there are 25 and my addition that that aren 't yeah well be aware that Environment they feel made very well aware all the issues yeah well again that 's a conversation that we need to have with Environment Canterbury who are the regulator that 's not our our particular role in fact when you look at their state of the groundwater the deep aquifers were what we termed the secure actors are actually if as far as water quality is concerned is it is is excellent it 's that surface aquifer that 's at risk of what you 're talking about that influence from nitrates and other surface activities the deep aquifers do not appear to be at risk of that but it 's the rest of the network and other activities that might impact on the water quality once it gets into the district distribution pipes yeah just just an answer a little bit further I would say have walk north actually has dark the New Zealand and there 's overseas you know we are a clean green and say well it 's it locally we think of that corks by a tree I think I 've receives I think of as a New but if you look at 8 9 10 and 11 those specific questions cover exactly what you 're talking about what 's the responsibility of the regulator 's to try and regulate that then what is the responsibility of the drinking water supplier to do the right thing to keep there and so that 's what they 're specifically asking what are the responsibilities are the responsibilities white we hopefully have answered them in some sort of form in there as they put their together but those are the heart of the questions that they 're asking they want submissions on thank you okay I 've got questions from Yanni and Glen Kelly I mean I think we 're gonna delegate this to a small group of counselors which um so just my question was really around the whole industry and that 's quite a bit of conversation around that so I 'm just trying to find a page number so well actually I just wanted to understand a little bit more about this whole regional wider entity and you know that there 's been a lot of I guess I just really want to my staff have put that in the submission and whether we can take it out so yeah if I could answer that through the chair you know the question was put forward by the private by the commissioners so the first three columns are actually the questions posed by the pound so should there be one of the questions they 're asking that they 're asking all the submitters should there be a drink dedicated drinking water supply entity or entities that 's the question they 've asked and what option then are asking us to answer the questions what options that paid through I think a through G one of the options for the management delivery of water services arguments and favor a for and against a water supply IVA T so that 's the question that they have asked us and it 's what we 're trying to do here is put together and a response to that that we 're all happy with so we 've we haven 't come out in favor of in fact words that no yes no things haven 't recommended treatment or otherwise we 're just saying this is the disadvantages these are the advantages that is full governance to decide what 's your view on how we respond to these questions posed by the by the Commission but sorry just through the Chairman in seven box seven it doesn 't I mean in the submission we talked about Orion as an example like what entities have several advantages that are well documented and we use Orion like although like the electricity mark have you talked to the consumers I 'm not sure that they would agree that you know prices have been good that what they affect what they 've seen it 's chief executives unaccountable boards a whole range of power prices just going up and up and are maybe reductions in energy efficiency exchanger smoking I don 't know there 's no disadvantages really spelled out very much in that section under 7 that kind of balance it and I don 't know I don 't know we as a council really had that conversation about why we would think those advantages exist I not sure where the evidence is to support the advantages that we 've got in there but the line was put in there as an example over a single focused utility provider and it 's not really saying that whole model was right or wrong you can have a look at some of the things that came out after the earthquakes and their ability to respond in a single environment so what we 're saying and there there 's examples of single utilities not necessary don 't know anything what I think you know there 's pros and cons we 're trying to just say that there are a variety of different models out there that they may be looking at and you may like to look at and you may want to give reasons why you don 't want to go down that track but we 're just giving you examples that there are a whole pile of utility services not only water that are provided in New Zealand by a whole pile of different models I think it 's important to note this is a draft submission from before governors sign off on it so this is simply a draft submission there may be parts of this that remain there might be parts of it but to change there might be parts of it they get taken out so this is purely a draft so is it then to address that particular one which i think is probably them the one that has quite a lot of political connotations around private probably privatizing or corporate izing water delivery that that group you know amend it or what 's of this way oh I 'm happy too unless less add your name to the group that 's fine no I 'm King for it to go to the group rather than spending a lot of time on it now that was exactly my thinking I mean there was the opportunity to ask answer a few questions but any detail I think really needs to be looked at by that group that 's the whole point of giving it to a group to deal with so I 'll take one more question from Glenn and then we 'll have a of this report it talks about christchurch being New Zealand 's largest secure groundwater supplier 255 thousand people so my question is over where it says on page one one four through the regional efficiencies and economies of scale may be realized to whom with the the value 8 go to so I mean if if we 're the largest and through their economies of scale where would that go given that we are really the largest point you towards see there 's a Waikato study and those economic advantages went to a variety of different places in the end I think help me here John I think that it was originally proposing about seven authorities joined together into a single I think three we intervened yes those benefits don 't necessary for even a across those supply authorities they sometimes go to the small ones more than the bigger ones however that there were benefits that that flowed into all of those ability to and it 's a little bit like council a buck said that if something fails out there and the people of Williston get sick it and so there is advantages us helping neighbors and Labor 's helping us so yeah yes and it could be disadvantages as well and that 's what that submission says is advantages and disadvantages at the certification to share this a recent report from the from the infrastructure council who sent a delegation to UK and Scotland back and March they released the report in June and it reinforces work with the observations that I made in 2010 about the efficiencies that were gained in Scottish water who reduced their operating costs by 40 percent when they amalgamated the three water utilities in Scotland reduced the staff numbers by half operating costs by 40 percent and they were the lowest delivery price of water across UK and northern islands so and that that 's now available on the national infrastructure unit website and that took took 33 delegates with them to do the study so I 'm quite keen at further detailed discussion happen within the group that we 've got named here the proposal being that the counselors the named would would form a group to work up a final draft which will be circulated to council us I 'd suggest if councillors were able to have at least 24 hours feedback that would be reasonable and then chair and Deputy Chair of it II be given the delegation to sign off on the submission given that it needs to be lodged before our next council meeting so we 've done that so councilors say we 've got councillors Clearwater Cotter Davidson Galloway your handsome count and Livingstone so do I have a mover for this resolution Pauline is happy to move Mike Davidson 's happy to second we 've had some questions is there any debate on this I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried now we need to jump back to item 17

I 'm just filling out from last month 's report in this month we 've established a center of excellence within the organization around policy development and as a quasi hub and also the benchmarking in terms of reviewing our published policies and strategies was actually to get a baseline oh sure she was quite good but the really the focus is on making sure that we give you good policy advice that you made safe informed and robust decisions so there 's training throughout the organization there 's expertise being developed so that we ensure that we do that we 've also as part of the new years setting our priorities for the organization you see on the page run around delivering excellence citizens centric value for money robust informed decision-making enabling delivery and leaders of people in ideas and it 's cascaded now into everybody 's will be personal development and performance plans really around the contacts into upgrades so we have something like 50,000 contacts through that per month and we 've done an extraordinary job of actually exceeding their targets in terms of making the customer service needs and but there was an upgrade in terms of the technology to actually help that business intelligence and to be able to make that improve to improve that an ongoing way as well so actually making it easy for people to contact and get the results that they need great thank you sir if we now move to questions Glen thank you thank you Kelly my questions on the wheelie bins page 102 I know there are 2337 removed from circulation is the my question is is there anything preventing us from looking at an options report I how to put those back in it on a discretionary user basis for rate payers they 've already been paid for so I 'm not envisaging that people need to pay for them again but there are people who from time to time do need extra so that some people might have kleavon 's is neat spaces here so they removed for a whole variety of region reason some because we 're damaged some because we 're duplicate and something because there 's no longer you know a property video and we could look at that certainly they will be reused where people actually got the right then in the right place so it 's really like a massive audit on it we deliver I think my understanding me about 29% through the program so eager to be legitimate you 're suggesting another option with people yeah I am aware I know it 's problematic and I 'm aware of the contractual obligations but I just wonder whether we could explore some options and in certain circumstances we know we don 't want to kind of less a fear thing but we do want some kind of I think it 'd be good to look at some options for people that I know and that 's part of the okay well it 's either York of any one agency because you are the Eddie cheer so yeah I think there 's a good idea in something to be followed up with Pauline 's yeah do we need a note of a resolution no I think committee have a discussion about it as a priority and it can be picked up that way yeah great so I 've got Dave and then Yanni David I 'm just count the points one on the wheelie bins again just a clarification David might 've answered part of it was going to ask about how long it 's going to take and are we staging are we doing this tagging in the area by area or is it sort of random thank you and the second question was under the wastewater treatment plant and just on the midge issue and in the coastal world and I note there that current complaints have ceased with the colder winter that are we progressing with measures to come forward this summer and can we have some sort of a an ongoing status report on where we 're going with with that issue I think an ongoing report would be useful it 's certainly not something that 's disappeared all together but you terms of how to address this but I think we can update on what networkers and the approach to next summer will be is it 'll be great because one the last thing we really want to do is sort of have a continuation of what we 've had after the last couple of years Yani just just on the really burn one I do think it would be good to formalize that with a resolution come and write a similar question to Glen I fought for two proposal that community groups that do community cleanups for example might have access to burns but obviously there 's details and contractual things that need to be worked through but it does seem to me that we talk about encouraging communities to do more in local areas but it 's often been a struggle to get the support in terms of things like rubbish collection so I just wonder whether we can formalize that and ask for a tiki mo dito or the sustainable innovation and sustainable committee to look at options for us so it would be a resolution to refer to a committee so it like basically the whole idea of and empowering people who are cleaning up the city there 's people that will you know look after berms that are a lot more than than theirs and there 's people that look up to parks and actually if we could have a system of allocating some additional burns for them for cleanups there might be a really cost-effective way of doing it one clear the scope of what you want and you know they 're different parts of it so I think it 's with a committee just thinking about what is it that you actually want and that just about clean up so it 's a broader than that and it can come to stand yeah I think we don 't clear yeah no I understand that so um you know if you think of the gold crate thing that we had a few years ago you know things that encourage people to contribute to the city active citizens as we want to call them I think should be doing that so but so you just want committee well I think we 're given that we 've just heard from the chief executive that you know the committee can have a do whichever they appropriate committee is and I imagine it would be eating but there may be some thinking we 'll go to that as well can have a discussion about how they best wish to proceed staff can then do some work and it can be picked up through the committee 's work program where all of that can be done without a resolution how can we help you do more things in the community basically because any rubbish wins we leoben 's as a means of collecting I might be one of them yeah Oh like a green burn so just for example someone that might know is a boom that basically is five times as big as the normal boom and and goes around a corner or some vacant sections but they do it but then they don 't have enough space in the Grimpen previously they 've asked how can I have an additional agreement no no you can 't_''_515.21 you know might have a system with the additional buttons to just make that really easy for someone so we can we can pick that up without the need for a resolution other than the company that 's gonna help erm I think there needs to be a bigger discussion because there are costs to these things there are a lot of practical things and is it about and you say citizenship or pride in your community those sort of things being that 's a different approach to is that about you know we 're bound to provide at a reduced price or free additional business will say households which was a first column so I think there needs to be just a bit of discussion to clarify what it is that you 're asking for and making developing policy on the who flatters it 's probably not a good way of doing it yeah I think my name is that a residential level for instance Yanni 's more talking about our kind of social group service level so that said and so I have some work but I think does it want we can do that right here yeah all right on certainly happy to take that advice that 's fine deal you know we 're just working on the same sort of thing with them a school and the city as well so I think actually it would be really good to actually have that discussion around that policy so I mean maybe we can get that out of a resolution attention I mean this is something we can do to just make that start their process from this meeting at all I think that 's what we 've just done I think that 's exactly the conversation we 've just had on confident that we can progress it on the basis of the discussion that we 've had this afternoon Paul link oh right okay any further questions on Colleen 's report all right in which case I 'm happy to move that we receive the report Tim 's happy to second all those in favor against that 's carried

    "text": "please vote noted against item 26 in particular all right so that then brings us back to item 10 the Ferry Road master plan project fr4 now we were needing some staff advice on this which was the reason that we deferred it until after lunch Lynette thank you ice not you it is you okay that 's good so we 'll try that again Lynette welcome to the table all right that 's all right I had a couple of questions on this just to kick things off and then others may have questions as well the proposal is to bring it forward into the current year or the request from the community board is to consider bringing it forward into the current year if we were to make a decision to do that if we were is this project capable have been delivered within this financial year or we 're able to do that do we have capacity to do that a weirder stage of planning where we can do that what would be the result if we made that decision we 're at a very early stage a lot of the scope of this is about of this project is not just about the crossing point so there is has been some discussions of the school there 's not just a bit the cross importance about water parking issues around Woolston Park especially on the weekends so we haven 't made a concentration and if we were putting it we have to do that six months probably broadly in these a 16 to 20 week lead time on any gear once you actually get a project that you can so I just don 't think that we can implement it this year so even if we brought the funding forward to implement it this year there wouldn 't be the capacity for a number of reasons to do that but we are we are we are moving forward with the planning in the design and the consultation and everything else my understanding is the money is actually in 1920 not so the aim was to bring it back to 1819 these two things must even if you have a look at the minutes you 've just passed 've made a resolution asking staff to report back to that community group regarding the planning of the program including the consultation over now we 've got to go through obviously some design get those documents out go and talk to the community and then really the timing of it to bring it back into 18 19 or whatever would be part of your LTP discussions but by the time we do the design go through and please appreciate and we have got a 560 million dollar capital program already to try and deliver next year which is a pretty big program sorry this year now I 'm already spending it on Drive basically there 's a lot of work to be done and we don 't believe that if you bought it back to you be bringing back a few hundred thousand or you know a little bit it wouldn 't be done in the right time of the year you 'd be building it starting to build at the end of winter so y-yeah you 've made a resolution on it which we are intending to act as further questions Jonnie so we 're talking about a signalized pedestrian cross phone so we 've got certainly one thousand dollars on budget for this yeah this financial year so what why why does it take so long like it 's a pretty straightforward project is not just a signal ice crossing as I said before the project is about parking parking solutions around Morstan Park there 's a lot of integration with other projects in the area including then would lower playing fields Waterton park playground it 's what it is one of the projects out of the master plan that is that we 're talking about so what like what are just a cut understand like so there 's all that planning we have to do parking surveys we have to understand what the needs are we have to find appropriate solutions that it states on for the parking around Morstan Park and then understand what we need to do it there it is Sigma at the school what the appropriate positioning is winning juicy vases all sorts of work that has to be done to find the with a scheme and then we have to take it to the community board and then we have to get to consultation so and then we can start designing it and building it in ordering the gear so we can order the gear until we have a contractor so it is a 16 to 20 weight lead time on the gear so if we finish the consultation by the end of the year six six months and approve the design then how long then it needs to be designed and tended right and then you 've got a sixteen to twenty wait lay time on the gear for signals and they stained it across the marker yeah because it comes them from offshore so even with that time frame there is a 70 his financial year yeah we went over that before july 2019 2010 18 i 'm saying but they it gets you into the start of your LTP discussions and then we can make any sense you 're now in tune yeah so when would you need sign off on the design in terms of this calendar year earlier in early in the new financial year no in the new calendar year but in the new economy yeah it would have been needed to be done at the beginning of this funny to you the beginning of this calendar yes sorry yes so last one actual year okay thank you any further questions okay for the question just do we haven 't kind of crushed record of this area like there was another crash last week or the week before that we all saw going to the community board acoustic crisis sorry so I 'm just started I don 't know my heat sir information was actually an impact to the community board as as being requested by council we are going to bring you back a report around the master plan of there that 's what you asked us to do as part of your own and deliberations what I 'm hearing loud and clear is this work that can be done she 's going to take the best part of this financial year to complete which will inform our decision-making in the long term plan and well have a positive discussion about bringing forward into 1819 at that time so we go what the considerations are if it 's not capable have been sped up regardless of the considerations then you know the bottom line is it 's not been capable sped up it 's not capable of in sped up so is it anything at the final question is it anything else that you 'd recommend based on the submissions you heard from the school children as to what we can do to make this a safe place given that they 're pretty stressed about the the level of safety at the moment and we heard that through Daniel and then counsels put in for six school zones and we are you know we had three in our plan so we will go and look at the priorities for where they are so and as we said when that happened to me would be stretch we will be stretched to deliver those sucks through that time period so they will go into the mix of priorities across all of our schools however in that case master plan so that looks at the integrated arena solution we will also continue talking with the school about and there 's also potential we can go down and get the parking outside the school gate program down there as well so that we actually manage people crossing at the right point as well kisses I will make sure our school safety team go down we have the school I 'm sure that they are okay I mean one thing that 's made clear from this discussion is that clearly this is a high priority for the board and some intervention is required but the other thing that 's made clear is that to do the job properly he 's going to take some time yeah just continuing the discussion about the three extra crossings outside schools that we 've signed off on is there any way that those who have submitted to us about their concealed for example and tomorrow sorry I 'm going to need to rule this question out of order and I 'm sorry because it 's a general question about that long term plan decision so it 's a valid question but it 's actually on a different matter okay any further questions do I have a move for well I 'm happy to move the text in blue that we say on the board behind which is a slight change to the staff recommendation that was in the agenda so I 'm happy to move that text and do I have a seconder Glen so so at least so let 's note then in that case was okay so lesson note what we 've heard note that note the staff of advice there is the planning and capacity would prevent this planning engagement incapacity would prevent this project going ahead prior to June 2008 of the prior to the 30th of June 2018 and therefore this is a matter for consideration through the LTP process no anger we will continue with the work that we 've got on budget this year we will continue with the planing week this year so planning engagement would continue yet will continue we have delivery delivery of the outcomes that won 't appear until the 2018 financial year so maybe we note that as well and we 'll be subject to decision-making through the LTP process because at the moment is sitting in 1920 but we can bring it forward as part of LTP decision making it is already sitting out in Newton so sorry I was the other student listen 1920 so it is 1819 and every one thing I would do any quicker if you move forward mr. keema yeah so what we 've got here actually reflects the reality yeah all right so as a way of moving this forward then I 'm happy to move the wording which is now in blue on the board behind us do I have a seconder Phil great thank you yeah please do yeah I 'll speak against this motion you know this is about a project that is already underway that I think we can you know I just don 't accept that we shouldn 't take it Prem afford the funding and and if we don 't use all of that funding there 's a little bit of carry forward to the next financially then so this project done as soon as possible given the concerns that we heard from the children they went out of their way to come and talk to us as counselors as a draft annual plan about the very real concerns outside their school now the good thing was that this project had already been identified work had already started on it and I just can 't understand why if we can do it sooner we shouldn 't strive to do that and it may be that it takes a bit longer but actually we 're talking about a pretty simple piece of ride that 's four already had a huge amount of work there was work done only about a year and a half ago around safety improvements around the school and and we did a whole bunch of parking surveys and put in some parking tucks and some side streets and conversations with the school that they felt that that would be something to start with clearly what 's happened is the schools bursting at the seams that 's had all the concerns that were raised when the school there 's a huge issue in terms of safety and now the children have come to us and said we want something done about it and you know I just think it 's really important that we get this done as soon as possible we 're not talking I think about a massive project that 's going to be controversial and divided community was talking about a pretty straightforward crossing between Ferry Road to walk it in or the park and the other side of the street and I can 't understand why we would delay this any more than we needed to so you know I think if we put number one which I won 't support then we sort of we sort of roll out the opportunity of trying to do it sooner and I think we should be trying to do it sooner and if we don 't quite meet that deadline then fine carry forward the but you know I 'll foreshadow a motion that we do move the funding and 1819 to 1718 and our stuff to aim to complete the project by the end treat that as I foreshadowed motion so in the event that the motion which is in front of us fails will then debate that foreshadowed motion Sara I 'm just wondering if that I mean that might help to add to that to say that if if staff if engagement of planning an engagement and it 's done soon enough that staff could come back to Council to request the funding be brought forward yeah that would make sense we could deal with it as a bring back in the event that planning was progressed such that it could be done in this financial year so that would be 8 to 1 so that would be so which is noting the staff of our voice that 's exact so then and I don 't know the final in the annual plan but that and it was seventy one thousand and this year and 417 in the next financial year so there is some capital funding available some in the events things forward all I 'm saying is we have got a large capital project project program already set and so would like us to put our priorities just an amendment that I think you know if things progressed quickly we can bring yeah so if we were able to add at the point yeah to this resolution in the event that planning is able to be expedited such that the project can be delivered in this financial year staff bring a proposal to bring the funding for Wichita bring the proposal back to council to bring the funding forward to allow the project to be completed earlier commutes I don 't know if it 'll be delivery of length so in the event the planning is able to be expedited such that the project is able to be delivered in this financial year against commenced okay yeah able to be commenced in this financial year if necessary staff bring up proposal back to Council for funding to be brought forward Sara that picks up the point that you wanting to make yep so in the event the planning is able to be expedited such a prodigious able to be coming to this potential year if necessary standard service if necessary program then so be it staff bring a proposal back to Council for funding to be brought forward okay great all right yep no if I move on a second to happy anxious builds 90 here that 's fine all right great so I 'm done with questions is there any debate on this I 'll put the motion okay so I 'll put paragraph 1 or losing well to really is in the context of one there 's just no chances will not appear so may not staff about voice the planning and engagement will continue ever delivery and of it and of outcomes so staff of advice the delivery of outcomes yeah that 's that 's the reality of what we 've been told and we 're saying well do what you can to do it faster and if you can then come back and ask for money all right so I put close one all those in favor against okay so the votes against Dion Yanni and Sarah through against okay and I 'll put some clause to all those in favor against as carried right thank you _"

    "text": "thank you so then we move last but not least to the sprayed in Kashmir community board Carolyn Potter and Melanie coca here as well today so welcome to the table thank you for waiting all morning for the opportunity to talk to us and we look forward to hearing what 's happening in spray and Kashmir Thank You curator time we wanted to start off just with a little comment about the annual plan we were desperate for some operational expenditures some in our first in the first round of the annual plan and and literally we would like to have made several applications for operational expenditure and the annual plan and we 're told no uncertain terms that we weren 't allowed to and so we 're very surprised to see in the end you 're playing a heck of a lot of operational expenditure just for example Little rivers got 10,000 for planning and that 's great we our board who were incredibly modest in our applications in the annual plan so modest was the response from the City Council to our modest applications in the annual the annual plan I 'm sure it is I 'm sure it is but we just can 't find it at the moment we would have loved some operational expenditure we had plans that we wanted to do we did want to consult the community just for example about an adult playground and we would have loved to have had that opportunity and the chance to have done there I hope next year that people aren 't told what we were told this year let 's think about the Barrington playground renewal this has been playing for quite a long time and the significant thing about it is that it 's going to be accessible to people with a range of disabilities and ability and we are very glad to we we 're very glad to have seen the staff who put proposals to us that looked imaginative and interesting and we we hope that really are successful in rebuilt in in that rebuild we did suggest that we 'd like a bus stop shelter further down the pact to accommodate those people who who have interests in the local way a little bit away from the children 's play in a really rural center so I 'm in this picture up here so the woman with Jersey the stripy jersey that 's Alma and she had been working at rarely Resource Center which as you know first histo part of a ward for 25 years or 20 years over a period of 25 years and she had her farewell which was beautiful and emotional and um she had a great time but she sort of she got these wonderful presence at the top and that left-hand picture as how the Carver who is quite well known I didn 't realize until Easter day 's meeting in the area who 'd made her the statue in the corner if he can see it and I hate when he showed it to he he was whispering about how the top of the top of it was rough and then the bottom of it was smooth like because she 's rough on the exterior but a lovely person on the inside so everyone 's really said to myself yeah but we 're work and the rail and community with the West Bay in the school Paul is that the next older the way this is just a great story I think we might well have mentioned it before it first opened in 1935 and there they all are and the huge effort that communities put into creating swimming pools and in those decades it 's just this is this is this is being in the middle of the depression and here they are building a school pool and so that was just fantastic and it closed and you know just warmin Tibet 's and clothes along with others called pools in 2007 and and 2009 the community got together again and said they missed the school pool and they started to fundraise the hundreds and thousands of dollars it took to raise the money to build to rebuild their school pool it we spent in school and they opened this beautiful Turtles actually wonderful infants and one for bigger kids and quite deep as well and they open the two pools on the 17th of February 2011 after raising hundreds and thousands major the buyer of the beach whose heavily involved and we sprayed in school he brought to the board a few months later a video of the opening of the school Paul that had happened in 2011 and people on our ward on our board weren 't tears it was just the most amazing experience well back again now off to admire the way they talk about fundraising 200 thousands it 's like sort of going down the road and how holding your hand out they just go for it and they 've got the money and imported a Paul from America which will break up into bits if there 's an earthquake and will be much easier to rebuild they 've got the hole in the ground in the outside of it looks fairly shell-shocked but it 's there and they 're now fundraising for additional money to do these the pull side work and accessible toilets and all that kind of thing and we our contribution which we voted on after this report was written that was is 18,000 the really interesting thing about this is that do for the summer for 80 which is a lot of money but the mix and the number of people in our family and nets for the family 80 for the family but the fair maximum number of people that can be counted as a family for entry to the pool on that families ticket is 10 lots of cuz ease and next door neighbors can go along and the rest Braden school has emphasized throughout that at the community pool and the board is talking about the idea of contributing to the family tickets and given them to the principals of neighboring schools so that their communities can participate in the West spray-tanned community school pool and membership thereof as well so we 're really chuffed with that and that 's the kind of thing that makes your heart go room a little bit like Kim 's fridge and we we had concerns the border concerns for all the years that I 've been on it about the tree planting in our ward and the removal of trees periodically we have discussions about can we please be advised on the be and then trees removed and we don 't and secondly the planting of the trees seems somewhat random around especially around the riverbanks and our board has a well-established and long-held views on the kind of things that they would like to see planted particularly in terms of complying with the biodiversity policy that the council has and so we would like discussions to be held about how boards are advised as to events in the awards or or over but beyond that our staff has taken the initiative to get together with other units and other staff that are dealing with issues in our ward to see if we can get more better communication going and we look forward to the results of the staffs work in that regard and we thank them for the effort that they 've put in community board planning never forgot was right we have we went to multiple sites the last one we went to was we spread and school we went to the fair and a like cold morning on a Sunday and got heaps of responses from people I think that responses from people within our ward or filling in two pages of a survey which was hard work to get them to do and then there were a whole lot of people out of our Ward as well so I 'm a really pleased with them we 're obviously on the way to doing our plan the Kashmir State Development you we will have told you about that this is the issue which this is the near walls Lee 's Road and the intersection with Kashmir Road where and it 's just aside south west side of their Beach Park and that 's 396 houses unbelievable and it 's going to place a great deal of pressure on what has been a relatively secluded and quiet community and they that traffic and the The Adventure Pack traffic plus the logging of the trees that got burnt during the Flyers all of that has placed quite a lot of pressure on that community and we are really pleased to have had a presentation by traffic engineers the other day which are telling us that the lights will be put in match 2018 and just to mention also that on Christchurch community response that had been door-knocking since the earthquakes have done near finished doing it they did 1200 homes and sprayed and just recently and people are obviously something well hopefully they 're better now after really improving since I 'm the earth quite the community 's feeling better so that was good to hear and we were just really grateful for the work and all knocking that they 're done in our area another thing that the boards recently done has had we 've hit a lot of feedback from residents about bus services which I 'm sure people and either Ward story so we hate got we hit a passenger transport was transport workshop where we had staff from a cane come along and so the residents could talk about all the issues that they had in terms of passenger transport so there 's certain routes that have been taken away in people of God you know got to walk too far to get to somewhere and we talked about electric buses on the city and all sorts it 's just to let you know that our people and our would have got issues and that we are trying to hip connections there with a cane as much as possible also I thought I 'd bring this along um I don 't know if you can say this but I boarded a meeting this week we gave four thousand dollars towards the first Thursday 's which is an event and can you see that but I 've been turn certain them and they 've been going for several years and sometimes no longer in our ward but we still gave money towards that because we think it 's such a great initiative and we have been supporting it for all of these years and we wanted to let you all know that know that we 're really supportive of it and if you want to go to the next one called dreamscapes that 's on the 3rd of august 528 sand it 's a great time and food to eat and heaps of poetry and all sorts of things that do a different theme each time so currently Feeney who organizes that he involves the communities so much that it 's really Community Development and we 're delighted that they central limb with his cat ward is his or because Sydenham is now in their ward they have also contributed six thousand dollars towards that we 're thrilled that they 're carrying on the contribution to this effort because we think it 's great community development and that such fun in it involve all those small businesses there that had such a rough time during the news quake they put stuff in the windows they have activities they 're open during the night the lights are on the people are around it 's great thanks we enjoy it very much and we make Community Awards the other night and for people in our community who have done honorable and committed work the one man one man had been for 25 years doing prison visiting and he was quite elderly and his son came down from Auckland for the award and I sometimes think when we do these things like community awards and garden awards we don 't appreciate so it 's always a really good night when we acknowledge the contribution of the people in our community you do so much work and and finally we had a meeting of Vista Place residents police staff of the the big at the Beacon um service center City Council staff at the Beacon um service center and and traffic engineers hit so I was wondering who I was missing out about how to resolve the issues of the people who smoke bongs up at Vista place and run around on people 's property collecting water from their hoses to fill up their bongs and and honestly and the the consensus seems to be that we will try and get a closure of entry into Vista place and its environs between 00 p.m. and 00 a.m. at night none of us are happy with those suggestions it 's always something that you know is a breach or a dent in the bill of rights freedom of movement we there 's a lot around town that we 've done which just shoves the problem on to someone else you sort of think do this you personally would like to have a circle with a view over the sea and say to the people the young people go for it you know a well away from anybody who they might be disturbing because it 's just not resolving the issue shifting them on but these people were very distressed about the things that have happened and the noise that made right through to 00 a.m. most mornings so we hope we 're looking at a process but that might resolve the issues it 's up thank you very much now you haven 't left us a lot of time for questions does anybody have questions for Caroline felt more just a brief comment Andrew Justin I think all the report board reports today to show how much work the community will err Kamiya boards are doing but I think one thing in terms of and that stands out too with the Spade and Kashmir water is what you referred to Carolyn with the engagement of the community for the for the community board plane and I think that that 's been outstanding really there isn 't there 's a counselor here great thank you very much do we have a mover to receive the report Phil seconded Tim all those in favor against that 's carried okay so that brings _"

    "text": "take it thank you okay so now we come to the Pappa Nui Innes is Ali here all right yeah pepper knew it in his community board and a Lee Jones alley great welcome to the table thanks for joining us tell us what 's happening in pepper new Guinness already so it 's our bring with them signs and our seats we 're going to change that each report so it reflects something from the report arts on a timer okay so I 'll just let that roll through and if something comes up I 'll talk to that I 'm there only a couple of things to come out we had last night the poppin or unis community service awards we had 18 individuals and two groups for those it was a really really good event and thanks to the staff for putting up essentially the same sort of thing as this it was a rolling visual of slides while we were there it gave stats out about the ward it had images about the ward and it was really interesting you know it was a great opportunity information about the ward so that was fantastic everyone got a tree which was cool so there was a plum cot which has a plum combined with an apricot which sounds quite cool and a prune plum as well some people couldn 't fit them in their cars so that was interesting so that was very cool we had here 18 19 so 20 of awards last night and great kapa haka group from North Curt primary as well they were absolutely fantastic the subin 's park amenities rebuild that 's on our radar at the moment it 's a was a much used facility in our warden sand albans park severely damaged after the quakes and can 't_''_123.6 be used so there is now getting underway and we 're expecting a report to come to us very shortly with regards to what the community she wants to see there we 're doing older adults research at the moment or undertaking that and that is something I 've mentioned before the data has now been gathered and the board will be getting a report by mid-july two of the things so far is that some of the elderly in the ward are less likely to leave their homes at the moment because of the roadworks and the damaged roads in the area national with the roadworks as clearly they change regularly so it can vary and they just losing their confidence and that 's really concerning the board because for elderly who are still driving it 's a huge and you know source of Independence for them and if we remove that or in some way hamper that it affects their ability to link socially with the wider community so that that 's of a big concern they are more likely to leave the house if they have a point of contact so if they have a concern or a question about roadworks or about anything in the ward if they have a number or somewhere that they can ring that seemed to come across as being positive for them so we want to consider that right what we 've got up randal street that 's handy so Rendell Street has been on our radar as well in the last directly what has happened is not all of Randall 's Street which has right at one of the main points of the Dudley Creek conversion project not all of Randall 's Street is going to be renewed or be part of the street renewal so a 3 of as of it is not going to be and in that 3 50% of the residents of Randall 's Street living and and that 's part of the street that is not being renewed it has been heavily damaged if you like or affected by heavy trucks that have been using it for the work and the rest of Randall Street so we can assume that there 's not the funding there for that at the moment and we are working hard to see if that can happen because the road renewal is due to happen in about September this year that seems slightly made not to do that at the same time so we are looking at that very very good outcome though through engagement with the community I have to acknowledge Keith Davis in the head of land drainage and and donors for coming on site and talking about this one of the residents was having tea and her family were having terrible trouble sleeping plus fumes from a diesel generator within about two or three days of us talking about that it was replaced with a newer it might even have been electric generator yeah and and so the reason it is absolutely stoked and I think that 's a really good outcome it 's a shame that it got to that point the issue was a problem it should have in our opinion have been dealt with much sooner than that consultation has been raised as an issue and Randall Street as well and you may have seen the media report this week let 's put in flies into little boxes and email in flies the best way to do it do we need to regularly meet with residents do we need to do not to make sure they 're okay you know as one of the residents said to me we get so many of these things really I just can 't understand them when I look for people who are already stressed and anxious dealing with insurance and EQC as well we need to think of better ways of doing things with our communities and one last thing up there which is the know it might not be this aisle if any yes so this is polyphony which i 've mentioned before as well it 's a project that has involved the purp Inori high school student it 's involved young people from case prep up a new high to Auto Hope up no youth development intellectually disabled youth alternative education and Canterbury University and monitors as a visual project students take photographs of things that they don 't reflect them in their community and then they present them on the windows of the purple new library and that 's gone very well the main papillary parallel cycleways thingy opened recently good at was about rainy but that was fine and the last thing is we are considering a project in the ward which will involve the smiled couch and I 'm not going to go into any more detail because it 's very early days not each version used at Ashburton District Council used it to introduce immigrants to each other into the local community people are coming in seasonally to pick fruit we 're talking about possibly using it to reintroduce people to their neighbors to try and get some conversations going the elderly I mentioned before you know let 's see what 's happening with the elderly in our community that 's the couch there interestingly when two women sat on that couch and speak they will search shoulder-to-shoulder and torn a tune and speak to each other I 've seen the videos we men sit on that couch they physically move their bums around as far away from each other as they can and talk to one another like that now I 'm not suggesting anything I don 't know how that could be analyzed but there was a very interesting difference between the genders when I saw it on the Ashburton District Council website ok bubbles I don 't know I think maybe men just want to size each other up a bit more and women not so much but who you great thank you very much and we look forward to hearing more about that particular project go with interesting stuff are there any questions from counselors for Alec stone okay so do we have a mirror the report and Mike seconded Pauline all those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "thank you very much and thank you sure you are thank you excellent thank you so now we come to the Pendleton why Marie Harewood community board now David Cartwright was with us earlier I 'm guessing he 's had to go so we now have sang Sam MacDonald the deputy chair Sam welcome to the table good take us it 's great well I 'm sorry I didn 't bring a balloon with me so I feel like I 've fallen off and that presentation will be a wee bit difficult first time here so I really excited to be able to present our area report I think I 'll take it as read because there isn 't too much for this week there is a lot happening in our community so that 's a positive thing a couple of things I just wanted to point out the first one was around our board planning so we 've already meeting and have got some really good initiatives underway in terms of how we formulate that are the second one and hopefully you 've all received an invitation to that July so it 's a Saturday morning and if you do have time it 'll be really nice to see you there would be a strong crowd and it 's a really nice celebration for our community yah no we haven 't got we even got any other subsidence I 'll leave it under whelming for you but I can assure you there 's a lot happening in that area a couple of the other things I just wanted to mention was that we are actively engaging with the community and some of the delegated decisions we 've made recently and reflect that and I want acknowledge Jamie for the work he 's been doing at Homewood Road so that was quite a contentious issue we had petitions with businesses and community board at community sort of resonance actively involved and I 'm pleased to say that common sense prevailed and we didn 't adopt the staff recommendation and I think we 're better for that as a community the other thing just to sort of point out to you is that we 've met recently with development Christchurch to a better work happening there but I think before we can progress that we need to seemed it was agreed a direction to Carlene as chief executive and for them to go away and do some work on that so yeah we 're in a pretty good shape in our warden I think I 'm happy to take any questions if anyone 's got them great thanks very much indeed for the for the update great information I 'm certainly looking forward you 've been at the opening at Bishop Dale and I guess that the other counselors will be happy to be there as well so we look forward to that one these questions Vickie and then Pauline just at the last presentation from your community board we asked about the artist-in-residence concept at the end of motor Vale yeah and we have that was great how that was coming along because no much seems to be no no so so we met recently with the arts advisors and there seems to have been a mismatch and communication between what would ask them to do and what been actually and terms of how that 's going to work through and it was my understanding they 're actually coming back to talk to you as well yes still too early to say so what the idea was there was a real mismatch in communication so we want basically everyone that was involved to come back to us with a proper proposal and then we 'll decide how we progressed that the idea is that it is used for that purpose and but it 's the Mickey ministries for that purpose and you 're just keen to get it going yes yeah great Thank You Pauline it 's our page 65 that 's item 3 on your keyboard decisions under delegations in the fourth bullet point you talked about the bikes and schools project and you funded some money for a trip construction can you tell us more about that sounds really exciting yeah so cots would schools in Aaron 's warden here would and I 've got a fantastic principle and it 's quite an open school to the community so and they came along and provided a deputation to a way to get kids on school on bikes and doing physical activity but also in a residential area giving families the opportunity at night to use the area so they were in a way came back with a good proposal and we decided that from our discretionary fund we would put some a towards that so it 's been really warmly received by the community school it 's a grant from us to again to carry all into it and so I 'm just wondering because cuz it 's so good is there anyone who is going to be perhaps collecting some data on this too so we can meter the six seats to see if actually it is going to be cycling to school that 's a really really good point so Marion and community advisor works quite closely with them anyway yeah but I can certainly take that back feel good because we need that we 're really trying to keep the kids on their bikes into school and quick hopefully using our um any cycle ways absolutely geez Alan yes so the bikes and schools are round the field because only half the kids at Cotswolds can bike to school because the other half can 't get across here rode without lights thank you good make goes a long way man all right so do I have a mover for this report Jamie seconded ref great so goodbye Jamie second by RAF all those in favor against it right that 's Kelly 's lip Sam thank you very much indeed for a great presentation thank you _"

    "text": "thank you thanks Mike so now we come to the coastal board community board Kim money Kim welcome to the table good to have you with us and sing you 're with us as well this afternoon so not only do we have a presentation we 've also got props this gets better and I 'm assuming the you are special at well no we 'll hear what you 've got to say about it actually we want to see you many counselors in staff and community it 's great to be here I 've got it since antiquity chair and Jo well as a governance board manager part of the next slide is the community I have already thanked you prior to the decision but really we just wanted to say today thank you very much for that hot sort of pulse money and the in your plan and the other things that you person in your plan I couldn 't there 's some of them beer that you saw and the engl plan process we couldn 't go through the entire thing but when I was out trying a little bit more special because all of you are very special we do really appreciate that decision so thank you our community is so excited because of it the injection of hope that it is given and the boost confidence that 's just amazing and we also just want to take this opportunity to thank the community for the work that they had done to get the further line that really has been a real working together so it 's been the community the community board the council staff and development Christchurch so I can 't thank you enough thanks so now moving on to you can enjoy that well I just talked about other things the under the board discussion response photos just want to highlight a really fantastic community initiative which is the Verizon community fridge you will no doubt seen quite a bit of publicity on this it has huge community support the idea what came sympathy from an amazing community person it was just started as an idea based on an Auckland model and so a very very professional initiative here and it 's free week 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and a good amount of volunteers have to actually look after it not space that 's not faith church so that kept our council staff have also been helping the lady Trudy Burroughs and some faiths Church going through this process so really fantastic could even be a pilot for other areas and the city but a great way to sort of recycle food a lot of supermarkets and chef throwing it out they can put it in the fridge and it 's change over and sometimes it 's empty three times a day but it just seems to get stopped up all the time so a lot of people were from the community putting internet and contributing to it and also their businesses around an area so it so that you fantastic initiative there under the significant community issues we 've got here I 've got tongue today I will just speak on this one here thanks Tim well I just worry about the the flood protection proposal look I can 't_''_220.87 say enough about what the council did the other in the the fact that you 're going to look at the south-south brought in each it 's a huge look at the community and 15 accountants you 're know from and actually on behalf the community are to thank you for that it 's a huge lift and just something else also just a few things that have happened recently the news of the history going to be included as a feasibility study cluster GA the boardwalk being done plus they think most amazing children 's playground and sort we were Paul coming on you 've got no idea how much that 's lift at the community I know we 've had already sprint in their area but it 's mainly been underground but this is actually what people can really appreciate and personally I just just moving around of the community I can see the whole mood changing people s you think something 's happening now and as I said I know if things they happen he has a graham but it 's on top that people are curing would it care about so just a few things that 's cannot thank you enough for that and honestly yeah it 'll just it 's created a momentum and we believe other people are seeing that and I think you know particularly saltwater pools I think will be investors out there who are seeing a commitment by council who want to come on board thank you also the new draft and regeneration the beachside playgrounds that going out at virtually the same time by development crisis and the consultation is just again addicted and excitement into the community and also you know the delivery by Christmas has been fantastic it 's like literally all their Christmases have come at once so very exciting about that and do appreciate all that development Christchurch has done around those works and are still doing when we got next oh yes here 's some other amazing comedian Assessors that have been going I mention the Imagination Station it 's just booming with all the kids there we go which has probably got about another seven weeks to go and New Brighton is a bit of a pilot yeah and also some other awesome person Dena area in a different way and so the empty shops he 's partnered with our other students there and as you can see on the screen at the bottom there 's the transferred a photo don 't ask me how onto the shop front window so it looks like the shop is a bicycle shop it actually was the LTTE shop but has been taken since that was actually done either empty shots in the area have also put the hill up and said I would love to have that on our shop window so until I get the real people these are the people that we 've got in the meantime so awesome to have been initiative here by one of our community Daniel mean she 's sorts as fantastic as my community services award are absolutely amazing we have a lot to be thankful for as you can see up there is the formal photo but the more exciting photos are at the bottom we have one of the recipients Floyd Rudolph or there 's two beautiful daughters and Floyd plays why I see every day at Rafferty of the day and he 's been doing it for years and on the left you can see did it as a group we had the special privilege of seeing one of those songs so it wasn 't a juror I can tell you it wasn 't the two of us it was all of us singing together so that was just fantastic to be able to celebrate those volunteers in our community and that make our city as Mike said a lot richer because of the generosity and it 's really nice to publicly acknowledge him and we had 18 prisons at that time so that was amazing here we thing that we did we haven 't got a picture full but you can look at that one in the meantime was we our community I stood a Residents Association forum and it was over dinner an hour south of amazing job of putting us together it was an informal get-together but it was the opportunity for the residents associations to do some networking with the board in with themselves other residents associations sure what they were actually doing put onto our community board plan so there was team within its associations as a team of that and because it was so successful and enjoyed we 're going to have or move aside busy we couldn 't take any photos that there 'll be a follow-up to in a few months but we 'd also like to sort of take a similar I have a similar events with the general community groups in the area and also were their youth great way of getting feedback and helping the a decision making process the oh here we have the Shortland Street playground which was a great as you can see one of our counselors attended and whether community board members there and it was this is a real great collaboration between counsel and the wynonie Pekka safe to activate and old playgrounds and do something very special but I 'd like you to note in that photo who 's actually doing the real work that those shoes you 're wearing you 're actually more appropriate for dancing than planting the next one here we we had a great celebration via Network celebrations of motor taking at that nakai except a site on exact drive there also included was the opening of the poppies Gallipoli sculpture garden and the community board contributed funding towards this and David a spear was able to represent us as a board and later wreath and you might notice there that the actual garden is shaped as a poppy and half of the stones with stones on the left from the Waimakariri river and the other half are from actually from Gallipoli so that is a very special garden yes so that there 's a meaning but perhaps that shouldn 't go out too far because we do want them to stay there so that was just an awesome completion of that site which we 're very grateful for and just to wind up with just a lovely photo here just to remind you how beautiful our city is of the East UVA and is he still wearing his dancing shoes thank you great thanks very much indeed Kim that does leave this time just for a couple of very quick questions so Phil and then you about the community fridge has really ideas are equal Don so just wondering too though for people for older people say who are quite isolated and not able to get to it this is a way that perhaps some of the agencies Keir agencies in your community might be able to work with some of them it so maybe the thought and I 'll take it back to tree I don 't know the answer of course but I 'll actually take that to try and see if effectively could be some register or something put beside the fridge maybe oh one slightly bit yeah thanks great so Glen yours wasn 't a question nope so I 'll take Aaron 's question in that case yeah so I 'm one slow Christian was a compliment actually your first and last photos Kemp if someone was I know we get a lot of immigrants into New Zealand people moving here to live here if you were going through an airport and you saw those photos on a billboard that sees medium property price in this neighborhood as 320,000 we wouldn 's a stunning neighborhood and your photos capture that so I thank you for that because we too often see in the media the really crappy ones and yours the gems so yeah thank you for the good work and consider it as a billboard where you guys a council may go house with you and if you need any sales if you need any sales and marketing advice on that he 's your man clearing her okay great do we have a mover and a seconder for Bishop also moved David seconded Glen Livingstone Glen you won 't speak to this if I may you might very quick once multiple of time the first is I think there is a noticeable looked in your Brighton can check out a couple of the cafes there one that was busy can 't_``_738.36 keep up the other that was quiet it has been really lifting for quite a while just on the Shortland playground Ziya I think that 's a good example of a PPP where wine only PAK 'nSAVE invests significantly in the community and you may not have seen in so that 's kind of a passive surveillance that so that 's another good outcome in terms of planning and meeting our objectives our septet objectives so they pick and save and the council went in halves over the funding for they 're all up it was a really good really good thing and have to give credit to Marcel out there while stepping safe does great things to the community so great thank you very much all right so I 'll put a motion all those in favor against that 's carried _"

    "text": "it 's carried and then we 'll move on to the part a which is the item 10 Ferry Road master plan now there 's some additional staff advice which has come as part of this reporting noting really referring to that annual plan decision that Jake referred to noting the staff have been asked to report back on options for implementing school school speed zones more efficiently as part of the annual planned option and the board will receive a copy of this report once completed so Jake has signaled the community board a comfortable with that recommendation in the way that it picks up that work and the wording has changed ever so slightly okay notice definitely refers to consider additional options such as film school speed zones to us access greater cost efficiencies implementing school speed zones and the community board will receive a copy of staff advice once completed fine okay yummy thank you I 'm sorry I didn 't hear the chair of the board say that they were happy with what was on the annual plan in regards to this particular request and I between a school speed zone and what this project is this is a master plan project and effectively you wouldn 't have a school speed zone through here for a whole bunch of reasons as per the normal criteria for school speed zone but what you can do is have a safety zone for the school which is a safer crossing going across which as I understand it has being looked at as a pedestrian sigmas crossing so the money 's on budget for next year there 's a little bit of money this year to do the planning and what the board is asking for which I support and I think it is consistent with what we 've put on the annual plan is that that funding gets brought forward a year so that we can get on and get this project on there seems to be no reason to delay it for further advice given this project is already underway it 's simply a question of timing of the funding to enable it to be delivered and the either this current financial year or next financial year so to that but I was concerned that the staff advice doesn 't all the information we 've had doesn 't quite reflect what the intent of this was maybe we need to staff advice on this wasn 't sure because did we did we deal with this through the annual plan process and make a decision on it or did we not now can 't remember on this specification the the council as I understand it said to the community board in terms of the Wolfson master plan and in this area that we were happy to bring forward the funding of the community board came back to Council and requested oh and this one is a very sensible one and that basically what we 're talking about is whether we do the project this year or next year the funding is only one year so it 's got a very small impact on on a budget and the staff are already started work on it so so what are the implications question and really isn 't overnight and whether you 're the person to answer this work what are the community broad why don 't we defer this matter because I noticed that jake has already gone so we can deal with this in his absence even now or later I 'd suggest we defer this matter till the first item we come back to this afternoon and that will give you time to get the advice and it means that we can still deal with all of the community board chairs so that nobody 's waiting over lunch time so we 'll come back to we 'll leave this and come back to which is the first item we deal with this afternoon testa to know we 're here at prices with the annual plan we 've agreed budgets etc there are six goals and we 're talking safety and speed zones and other areas in this one as well that I 'm sure counselors would like to move forward so if we 're going to start readjusting their budgets and pushing things forward then odd Synod put forward the skills of my area and I 'm sure other councils were too yeah okay so we 'll we after lunch and that may well be a consideration we take into account at that time okay let 's I 'm going to move on from this otherwise we 're gonna have the community board chairs waiting over lunch time we will come back and deal with item ten at two o 'clock do I we can 't support that it 's asking staff to look at options for that area it may not be a speed sign that co-op so they may as well progress with it and deal with the funding later this is what okay let 's come back and deal with it two o 'clock it may well be that it can be dealt with quite simply at that time but I 'm just quite keen if there 's a need for staff advice that we get as staff advice before we make the decision okay so we 'll deal with it two o 'clock and that 'll give people an opportunity to have conversations about it if they want to in the lunch break as well all right now Mike Moore are still not back _"

    "text": "okay now I 've just a little calculation if we can keep strictly to ten minutes per community board we can be through the community boards by one o 'clock and we 're going to break for lunch that would mean that none of the community board chairs would need to wait for an hour before coming back at two o 'clock so that 's what I intend to to stick to so I would invite Mike Maurer from the halls well Hornby Rickett and community board to join us is Mike here alright so we 'll come back to Mike then in that case I 'd invite Jake McClellan from the Linwood Central heathcote community board to join us so Jake over any highlights that you want to point out from your report first of all and then we 'll deal with the part a matter I promise I will be very quick there 's just a couple of things I wanted to pull out from the report just to note that we 've started a process of of coming up with a community board plan and depth is that through a robust plan we can get a really a good result in the master plan in long term plans or the master plan revision I 'll just I 'll scatter at the end so what 's become really clear through our through our community board plan process is that the real need for recalibration of the suburban master plans revolve obviously got a lot of of those master plans in their board area and as passed I guess in terms of touching on annual planned stuff we were of course happy to see that some school is school zone was was was worked into the to the fury road master plan and we 're also happy to say that as part of councils annual plan and decision that support was offered to to consulting with reaching Christchurch and rechecking the Linwood village master plan and which which is obviously not working as it as it currently stands and I 'm also personally happy with the commitment I see for reaching a viable solution to the addressing the homelessness issue and the inner city ace there was and I when we heard that the proposed drop-in center hadn 't received funding but now seeing the decision and t 'east I 'm pretty happy personally with the commitment council has made and around this issue and and even now saying that this is something that 's probably going to require a little bit of spending in the 2018 28 long term plan and it was pretty much it that 's pretty much it great thank you are there any questions on this um community board report for Jake all right so I 'll move off L thanks Jake and just around the homelessness issue more people being homeless and also though that the suggestion of the drop-in center yeah so once I guess that worker the initial work has been done by using health of the housing first model is is there a way that the community board might also be involved in supporting the drop-in center part if we can if it 's if that 's when an option supporting supporting the formation of the idea of I guess it will be working with and we 're working with think that 's where tensions going to turn now before the the long-term plan is helping we work with with social service agencies with council staff with in health care community board staff obviously facilitate some of this yeah thanks Jake thank you and there is a PowerPoint which should be remiss of by the throat this is pretty much there 's a communal planning process some of the master plans in their area in the States and the city east on Lynwood village and signing the eatable Canterbury charter this day on sweeps neared a great job of holding it open and and meeting with account he can councillors and down the community services award hey close thank you come again did you have questions well but I just want to offer yeah great thank you okay just yesterday Jake we threw on Phil 's committee social community development we affirmed the resolutions over the housing first approach so I know that people would want a very quick response but these are scenes in which we have to take our time to do it quicker because if we just up all the ducks we could make a mess of it so we actually it was pretty clear in the text of the annual plan that that 's what council is attempting to do and I was very supportive when I when I read that that seems very committed to addressing the issue which is the main thing okay excellent thank you very much so do we have a mover to receive this report dim seconded Sarah all those in favor against that 's carried _"

    "text": "grace thank you all right so staff have just answered the room for item five so we will now come back to item 5 which is the presentation on the event sustainer to pronounce event sustainability framework if we can please invite staff to the table greater welcome to our meeting this morning good to have you with us so this is an update on the event sustainability framework and the event compostable packaging trial we 've set just 10 minutes aside this morning for this presentation we 've got quite a full agenda today but it 'll be great to hear from you in that 10 minutes so I 'm over to you thank you very much indeed for joining us presentation oh there we go I 've worked within the team since 2009 and although I love delivering a diverse calendar of events to the people of Christchurch I was becoming increasingly concerned and disheartened by the environmental impact that our events were having on the city so I took these concerns to my management and I got backing to look towards building a sustainability framework where we organ company called Green Street Pacific to help us with this and after an audit they came up with a few areas we could look at to improve our practices namely waste management transport so help we get people to our events food and beverage options our procurement process and things like that so what that we then needed to decide how we 've moved forward and we thought that waste management was a really visible area of events that we could make change and we we chose this to look at first and so we knew from our events that the main area that we produce waste was from food vendors so we thought we 'd start here and we knew that to reduce our landfill we needed to make changes here so we looked at a few options from whether we go to reusable food packaging options whether we look to try and reduce our contamination rate in our recycling but I mean that was the resource here on our doorstep and they 're living with compost facility that as you know processes organic curbside waste that prompted so this is what we did now at the stage I was due to go on maternity leave for a year so this is where Santa Campbell stepped in and it was her job to make the whole project come to life all right Thank You Kate I 'm as kinda deceived my name is Shanti and I 've now been working in the council for just 14 months so I was faced with this huge task of bringing this idea to life and one of the biggest problems we had is there 's this thing called by plastic PLA I 'm not sure if anyone in the room was aware of it it 's basically made from corn and it was developed to replace plastic now the problem with PLA is it can 't go into our organic composting facilities and as christchurch users a living nurse to process our organics waste it couldn 't go in there so you might get a coffee cup and you think it 's you 're doing a good thing by putting that into the recycling or into the green bin but you go to landfill so it 's a huge problem we have at the moment so we were set up with the task if they can take the pizza boxes they can take cardboard right so we need to find a supplier in New Zealand who had plain packaging which was cardboard only we managed to find a supplier and we developed this logo here I think of possible only to go on the outside of them so we set up the supply chain we had a range of distributors within the city that supplied 12 Enders for the events and this is where trial 2.0 oh sorry trial 2.0 trial 1.0 was born so trial 1.0 was three events that was that Christchurch lantern festival in fear fix media run night noodle markets now that was a hundred and approximately a hundred and ninety thousand attendees now I just want to point out that 's just under half the population of Christchurch all of the food vendors that these events had to use the compostable food packaging that we had suggested and we had waste loaders on site which hand just to move on only you can see a picture of the waste quarters at 00 a.m. in the morning morning hand sorting the waste and on the right there I just want to point out that 's the one of the compost loaves at living earth now that load would have gone to landfill had we not done this project this was a collaborative effort on project we had to work with many other council teams to make this happen work with our local organic processing facility which is living in earth as we have pointed out our product suppliers and our many distributors within the city over a hundred local food vendors local social enterprises and our on-site volunteers like this group here who stood in front of the bins throughout the whole event directing the public where they should be putting the product into the Greenman so just a bit of the results now many of these are the other details are in the booklet that we 've handed out to you so sixty one percent of the total waste from these three events were diverted to diverted away from landfill and just a bit of a break down in the middle there that 's 42 percent of that a total waste was compost we also analyzed the public 's thoughts the attendees and what they thought of the initiative and 88% of the attendees at these events said it was important for them to see sustainability initiatives at our events here in Christchurch in 93 15 of these people had noticed the sustainability and they should have at this event and when I 'm really important exciting fact there was 33 percent of those who answered this survey said as a result of seeing what the council had done they would now recycle and compost more at home now that 's an intention for behavioural change which is something that we all want to achieve are we also engaged with the stakeholders and got their feedback on the project and it was really exciting to see that a hundred percent of the stakeholders involved so it was either very important or quite important for sustainability inertia initiatives to be at events and 97 percent this was be involved with this sort of stuff and even more information again about the statistics in the booklet that we 've handed you I just also want to touch on the amazing media coverage that we 've had about this project from Facebook posts to different organizations sharing it getting in contact pressure put on the Auckland City Council to follow our lead also we 've had our two articles and some magazines as well so it 's been really successful from our point of view now this has brought us to a point where we need to take this to the next level so we 've now started planning trial 2.0 so this is versus Louie moved from three events and trial 1.0 to 30 events and trial 2.0 medium to large over an 18-month period starting this September in 2017 and this involves not only Ellen our internal events that we produce here in Council but also the external events in the city from event organizers who are already sustainably driven and want to be part of this just to let you know how we 're tracking at we 're confirming our product range and supplies we 're trying to expand our range and expand our suppliers to bring the cost down for the vendors and make this more affordable and easier for everybody involved we 're investigating potential composting facilities that may be out to take this bioplastic that I was talking about earlier and we are testing example products for their compost ability and investigating funding options to reduce this cost for everybody so as you can see me and charity and our team are really passionate about this project I just want to kind of point out how well it sits within the city councillors strategic framework especially looking at livable cities and health healthy environments it also checks the boxes in regards to the strategic priorities of being climate change leaders and building a sustainable 21st century but where I really got excited armours when I came across the resource efficiency and greenhouse gas emission policy that 's recently been signed which it clearly pledges or clearly states that the council will pledge to reduce its solid waste into landfill so I think that support and it takes all the boxes so I just wanted to leave you I just wanted to leave you with one thought I went and did anybody here go to the Jane Goodall and evening with Jane go to last week to anyone in the room okay so she said something that really resonated with me she said we must remember that we have not inherited this planet from appearance we have borrowed it from our children but we have not been borrowing their future we have to still win it and we keep stealing it and I just want to point out that every single person in this room is here to make a difference you came to work today to make a difference and that was your chance that we can make that difference thank you for listening thank you very much now we would have time for probably a couple of questions so pour lean and then Vicki thank you I like this finish so if we increase the amount of containers going out to the living Earth what does the capacity for that now they the size of the pile that you though but even a pile wasn 't actually a huge amount for them they they do handle a little more than their we 're nicely we 're looking at other potential facilities that 's if we open it up open the range up but I with in discussions with living earth to carry out these makes a lot of events wouldn 't they in a shoe for me and they said that should be fine in comparison to the rest of the waste that comes from internal or from the Christchurch region the curbside collection but there is an option to look at other facilities other than the other ships that can take the toilets yeah and the when you talk about landfill we talk about Kate Valley do they emit a lot of emissions I thought that they actually can do to me saying with your emissions yes so wealthy fireplace tax they have a lot of pre life benefits so they reduced sixty to eighty percent less carbon fuel emissions and they 're from renewable resources then unfortunately if they go have met me things so in Christchurch I mean the methane we collected it and we have a solution for that but we 're trying to come up for a solution that we can go across the whole country with other councils can take it on board and use this as well and not all all councils and userland have that facility no but my point is if I may that the PLA s and know is going to our Kate Valley are not causing emissions because we kept showing it here but I guess there 's also the fact that the from a landfill point of view it 's taking up land and there 's some other kind of negative ones yeah and it limits the the length of the landfill as well on the space great thank you and then just a quick question from Vicki it 's really quick thank you for a lovely presentation that 's lovely to see such amazing enthusiasm and action the only question I 've got is what else would you like to do area I would my dream would be to so we once we were kind of quite resource tight at the moment but once we can get the waste management area sorted we want to look at how do we get people to our events more sustainably getting on public transport getting on bikes how do we power our sites more efficiently whether we use wind Sun whatever I would love to look at every area and that 's what the framework kind of overlooks it and it looks at those areas so you know hopefully we can keep on for this momentum yes you can there is narrow net innovation and sustainability fund and we 're very happy to talk yes yep we 've got ideas for compostable toilets and everything great thank you very much indeed look thanks for taking the time to come and present to us this morning really interesting stuff really exciting thanks very much indeed _"

    "text": "pation and we have Anna young woman who is here to present as part of that public participation Anna if you 'd like to come to the table please thank you very much now under the standing orders for this public forum part of the meeting you have five minutes to make your presentation to us I do need to advise that this morning there will not be the opportunity for questions on this matter in the context of some media coverage this morning suggesting a threat of legal action against council so it wouldn 't be appropriate for us to have that degree of interaction but we 're certainly pleased to to hear from Anna for the five minutes and I 'll make that clear so this Anna you can use the whole five minutes for your presentation and we 've got a clock that 'll tell you where we are with that as well so good to have you with us and welcome to the table over to you actually before we start I would like to make a correction about the legal action that was quite incorrect and the words were would your group consider taking legal action against the quarry 's and I said I 'm not a hundred percent sure at this stage so I would like to clarify that to the councillors please all right thank you all we start thanks for that clarification yep the advice I 've received is that it wouldn 't be appropriate to our questions and answers but I 'm certainly happy to to hear the presentation and I 'm also happy to take the clock back two and five minutes if we can please so that the full five minutes for the presentation but thank you for that clarification thank you good morning my name is Anna young man and I 'm a resident of the oldest Post Road Indian Hurst some of you may have heard of crystalline silica the crystalline silica issue that we have in our area and some of you may have not quarry 's in our area and although the Canterbury have been allowed to come very close to dwellings people have been having health issues so testin was done and the result next door to me this is considered extremely high crystalline silica particles aren 't invisible and so they they are so tiny that they get right into the base of the lungs and because of their jagged edges they lodge into the lung and make their area non-functional breathing in this dust can lead to very serious health issues silicosis which is similar to asbestos and a terrible death because of the dangers of crystalline silica dr. Alistair Humphrey and he can have made a public statement and that was on the 9th of March four months ago that no dust would leave Quarry boundaries I and other residents have been having health issues for a long time and it 's not been taken seriously I had extensive lung tests done by a respiratory specialist of Christchurch Hospital in April and the results came back that the symptoms I am experiencing with a result of crystalline silica and the specialist words were that hopefully sanity will prevail and the cause will be stopped we and other residents have been told by our GPS to sell and move because of the to we are not going to put another family at risk environmental protection agencies recommend a separation distance of 500 metres when crystalline silica is involved attached as a letter from Amy Adams also endorsing 500 metres unfortunately CCC and eke and planners brought us in to the Smiths by endorsing Winstone 's extension to the quarry less than 200 metres from six dwellings CCC planners do not use their own dust experts at resource consent hearings your planners have been relying on the applicants experts the choirs dust expert knows about the composition of greywacke aggregate and high silica content you only need to go to Winston 's website to find this information unfortunately at resource consent hearings this information has not been disclosed by experts but was mentioned by residents submissions and ignored it is only because residents have been very active along with the help of dr. Kelvin Duncan x10 of science of Canterbury University that the true dangers have surfaced it 's very disappointing that CC planners think they know better than environmental protection agencies also resource consents can be reviewed but your planner John Higgins other times if health dangers would not be a reason to review what would be so here in my hand is a mass now this mass has been recommended by Alistair Humphrey that I wear in my home indoors and outdoors I can tell you this is terrible I get very baseless also outdoors I only just wear the mask I have done not only do I wear the mask I had to put on protection over my eyes to protect them they get so itchy and so runny it 's like sandpaper in my eyes and this is Christchurch I just can 't tell you how bad it is the some have experienced regular some direct neighbors regular discharge from their noses when they blow their nose I personally every morning have gunk in my mouth after a show it is gray on the face cloth or washer when I have washed my face our stock are suffering from a disease called pinkeye one resident has had to move her horses away from the area on the advice of the vet and her young teenagers had to go elsewhere ratepayers we are highly disappointed that the mayor and CEO of CCC have not been replying to emails or I personally have sent emails two or three months ago that I couldn 't breathe I was indoors this was Tilly N and Colleen Edwards I couldn 't breathe and Here I am in my own home wearing a mask could they please help me I 've just been ignored instead of helping the residents a decision was made just to ignore us it is frustrating paying rates to CCC and II can when you 're not protecting our health where 's your duty of care counselors I would appreciate if you could take some time to Google crystalline silica and read for yourself just how toxic and dangerous it is what we need now is for CCC to acknowledge the environmental pollution agency 's separation distance of 500 meters this is urgent because our health is deteriorating not just for our area but for the lights of the gilda thought school with young children a preschool opposite that are going to have to endure what I 'm having to endure Erin Brokovich she just cannot believe it she told me to keep it out there and to keep talking to keep keep it up because that 's not right I 'm not going to go away well it 's if I can help it if there 's not an autopsy done look why aren 't you all listening to the experts that know better because they do in third-world countries why I say a third-world country Pakistan and India 500 meters is the setback distance the queries are running riot there have been Cowboys for some time and they have been allowed to self-monitor okay that brings us to the end of the point there 's the silica on my windows here 's the dust along our road and thank you very much for the opportunity of telling you what it 's like to be a prisoner in Christchurch the garden city yeah thank you very much indeed for taking the time to come along and present to explore sure there are masses of interest that you 've right can I just make a comment that there is no legal able to you know that 's ask questions that 's been made clear that we are at the end of the five minutes so there wouldn 't be the opportunity for that in any case thank you very much indeed for taking the time to come along to talk to me okay so now we move into the next part of the meeting which is the deputations by appointment now we have eight deputations this morning all of which are on the same issue which is the yelled Hurst subdivision the Infinity yard her some issue with eight deputations it 's important that we keep closely to time so there is ten minutes allowed for each of those deputations and ten minutes would include questions I 'm expecting that the deputations will be pertaining to the matter that we 're debating and deciding today I 'm aware that there are a number of historic matters that contribute to the environment in which we 're making that decision but I think what councillors will be interested in hearing will be matters that pertain to the decision that we 're making today already for those making deputations to provide new information to us rather than repeating simply what a previous deputation has has said to us and if there is time for questions from Council as I would also encourage councillors to think about whether their question is relevant to the issues that we 're discussing today rather than to other matters so there will be limited time for questions because of the number of deputations that we 've got it 's important that we use that time wisely and I will be attempting to share the opportunity for questions equally around those councillors who wish to ask questions so really is making sure that we get the most value from the limited time that there may be to to answer questions on these deputations all right so item 3.2 deputations by appointment i invite collin Stokes to the table please going morning thank you for joining us thank you very much hard to say these documents around great thank you for joining us as I mentioned you have ten minutes and that would include any time for questions okay I just we 've got the paperwork distributed just is there a pattern you rang powerpoints as well yes I 'm just so happy [Music] grace okay thank you very much okay okay I 'm not ready to go yeah all right great so if you 'd like to make a start they 'll be great thank you thanks very much indeed for joining us you have ten minutes and we 'll we 'll start the clock now thank you okay thank you much for chatting here here is just a plain of the subdivision where I 'll just rotate it yeah so he knows at the top no this is at the top there and the outline of the yellow there over there there is the subdivision concede that we 're talking about so our land is included in the subdivision consent there 's a lot of misinterpretation that were adjoined to it you 're actually part of it in our loading is a requirement of the results conceived without our right vesting there 's a known compliance with it we first found out about infinities discussions with the council behind protecting our inclusion in the subdivision its memorandum we got as with 2 December 2016 and it 's in your bundle of documents that 's got that plain picture on the front what the forth taejun or just that summer couple of things in there the council only asking for infinity legal advice in their own they didn 't ask ask for our legal advice or what our interpretations were however three of their that sees infinities legal advice is that the the covenants and Christian will be met by infinities development proceeding with the stage one survey plan and the council 's legal advice concludes with that where we complete with that too because the Covenant requires they are working to be included in the first stage once our writing is included we 'll of course the County it 's not necessary anymore and I believe someone else will have the excellence from Goulburn and Nobles own lawyers stating exactly the same thing and they were the ones that passed the garage to infinity also paragraph four of that same memorandum from the council as infinity said that they affected residents and said there was some resistance from them and specifically named himself Stokes well the only resistance the world was getting a nice foot round our neck and the still kicked out from underneath us we did everything we could we bent over backwards to work with infinity we offered to take the Covenant self we offered to give them their app so Lexus right yo destroyed which they need to open their subdivision we offered the whole front of our exes lot which is the green but at the top they 're going to yoga throw we own there that 's part of their conceit for their super market area we offered to give them that as well so we offered to give them everything and we even offered in the finish after negotiations to contribute to complying with the conditions they must comply under the resistance II by actually chipping in and undertaking the raving ourselves which is a condition of their but they refused it they the whole issue around it is is that the council staff have allowed variations to the consent then notified 've removed through weather conditions such that they are waiting which is a requirement of that can see cannot be visited with musiah they 're complete and total permanent non-compliance with the subdivision consent now if we look at that plan where you 'll see those blue basins in the middle they will be consented study other basins at the very outset you see those lead squares trust each side of them they 're the original can just conditions that the conceit conditions 9.5 acquired that Lane to be satisfied with easements over it and favored the council in case it was required for stormwater provision which it is however somewhere along the line within council they just eliminated that condition as part of their variations no assessment no application to remove it it just went gone so the resistance for us was we didn 't rework the Covenant so if we don 't know the covenants off can that 's off we won 't have subdivision but the comments are protecting what you 're including them so the cabinets are not preventing the subdivision going in here they 're want the what is okay we want our roads in there you 've been led to believe that there 's our connection to get the covenants off that 's not true anew there 's an arbitration clause in ourselves and purchase agreement back to 2002 the Methos carry an arbitration right now we have a conference call tomorrow then relation to it now the arbitration could be over at any time so it doesn 't go to court to get the covenants that this force then he 's documentation coming up no they weren 't double up on that now but the point is even if a cabin itself there 's no the information we have is that until he don 't want to vist the agent for council anyway now we 've got definites dialect to 2000 team to rather metals but we 've got four official information ex and other things that noble had always planned to open the roads and the services and charge rights for them to people and that they were never gonna wish them and that data we 're going to buy and fifty own the infrastructure the the services the pipe distilled water etc in charge people for which will include us because we need those utilities coming through to get to us and concede that we 're paddled includes us so I would be completely a transom notwithstanding the fact that I can 't be vote at the Ryman because there 's nice room with a provision than the variations that might yeah I 'll just run through the I 've done a review via which obviously you won 't get throwing the time with God but what that is sitting l just asked for a few documents D on the front page of that that starts at the top covers protecting residents inclusion review and summary the fifth part there 2002 2003 is when residents brought the land and then you see further ten fifteen clearly requires our inclusion of a road accepted hit hit within two years of rezoning rezoning was 2006 our road for June 2008 the developer would need and the council staff changed the conditions such that are made impossible below that 2003 is when we registered inclusion now you 've been misrepresented via that it was all about pig farming and trimming trees and the likes of effect well yes they win the Covenant but the terms of extinguishment of the Covenant is a Schedule C and that 's at the bottom of that front page there and you see that requires a 1.2 and 1.3 Wentworth 's frequent or just read that this movie to this to dedicate the part of the Soviet land including the excess lot of the rewarding year is defined on the minutes for sale and purchase or which the Syrian land was sold our development as legal Road and transfer link which all the state will interest in those ero to local authority for one dollar that needs to happen before the Covenant comes off nothing to do with pig farming the Covenant what it does it combines into spare homers in there is so many different only in the end the only way this could work is to join them all together and that even if they didn 't want the right they 've got to get it because doesn 't wanted or other residents in here that the lifestyle block it doesn 't matter they knew that covenant was on the lam and they 've bought it and the requirement come left was the right distant so that 's what my board into and that 's particularly our legal interests and this what the council 's voting them to circumvent a legal interest the sickness solution is very simple when the council needs to do is require infinity to comply with the conditions of the results conceit which is they have to do well there anyway and value of the council has been full size that they do that then the road leads to be visited it 's legally quad by the subdivision conceit legally required by the RMA and the legally required by a protective covenant that you 're writing to circumvent there 's no risk to this proposal if you look at the council 's report to your city for one one that says that the full risk is being rather developer that language to the council so while you 're being told by the lives council just bought a council complying with the law enforcing the conditions of the conceit the infinities we lose no novella well I can 't see any sin from doing that the Mill Creek forest in fact is partially resist management act that which is in here section one to eight which actually requires the council to review their conditions of the conceit if they can see that they 're not being affected correctly which would include reinstating the condition nine point five which took that ways we battled with one distilling winter so the council can legally do that there 's no you fierce right there and finish a little is known about the resistance eat they took on animal about the past issues Delta is the major financial of the project Delta came in and built the roads and put the finance into buildin and while you 're part of the joint venture with noble they use mortgagee powers to transfer it to a new joint venture called infinity which is Delta 's part of that as well so doses part of both two adventures Delta 's always the stormwater infrastructure there is no that we weren 't included in it required to cut the razor movies on the lane they needed out conceit we put change its own with a particular with respect in 2008 they knew about that we 're consented to their mortgage on the basis that included our provisions they took the mortgage on that basis so that all is known about it don 't have put in about fifteen and a half million of the a three and a half million it was passed from one current Richard to the next floor know it brings us to the end of the ten minutes set aside for the deputation and as I mentioned earlier we do need to keep strictly to the ten minutes because the number of deputations that we 've got this morning so apologize for interrupting but we do need to end the deputation at that point I don 't whether there 's a couple of finishing up comments that you 'd like to make just around things off yeah all I can say is thank you to know all I that makes the I and to make a decision based on this with everywhere information that 's very critical we 've actually asked to come and see the councillors before through our lures and we haven 't had any think that we 're saying you cannot make a decision without the full effects there was only a fraction of the just a fraction so we would suggest that keep with us and meet with us we just want this resolved we wanted to go ahead we 're not Lindy 's next door we 're part of the same subdivision we 've been fighting for years for inclusion and has cost us a fortune so they made a giggle and it 's resolved that so please meet with us and solve these issues thank you thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us this morning I 'll just make a comment now about the order of the meeting this particular matter is going to involve us taking some legal advice and there may well be questions that councillors want to ask of our lawyers based on that in the the number of deputations that we 've got this morning so that means that we need to go into public excluded to hear that legal advice my intention therefore is that we hear the deputation the number of deputations we 've got this morning that we then will deal with the community board reports and the other open agenda items of the meeting will then go into public excluded and will consider the legal advice in that public exclusion part of the meeting at which point one we 've done that we 'll come back out of the public excluded section and we 'll have the full debate and the decision-making on this matter in the open meeting after we 've come out of public excluded so I appreciate that that means that there will be a delay for those submitters that want to hear the debate and the decision I would remind everybody concerned that there 's the ability to do that either by coming back into the room once we come out of public excluded or on the livestream which will carry all of the public just suggest that we 're actually not the public were actually affected parties in this matter and we would be welcome to be coming along to the public exclude because we 're not public we 're affected we 're part of it and we think that our legal opinion is important too you 're only getting a legal opinion of the developer um like a council so we would like to be part of that a few Alerus thank you for your comments we 've obviously taken some advice on that but thank you for your comments thank you will now move to the second deputation and I invite Shane Philpott to the table place excuse me okay we 'll just wait for the distribution of the papers and then we 'll make a start okay thank you for joining us this morning you have ten minutes for the deputation and that would allow time for any questions if you wanted to leave time within the ten okay I think I do thank you counselors for hearing me here today I 'll try and live through this as quickly as pages if we just go through them the first eleven is a bit of a concern with the the memo mr. Han 's memo to the council that he hasn 't developed default details of the covenant the Covenant on page to you as you can see there in which column has gone over himself you 'll see down here at one point three point two I was go over this again this will dedicate the part of the Soviet land included in the excess level the road widening area as defined and the agreements for sale and purchase which go back to 2002 and 2003 I 've watched enjoyed of us here with Part II and were sold to the developer as legal Road in to transfer or languish all estate or interest in those areas to the local authority for 1 that 's the Covenant as protecting that our Road vests and the council this wasn 't page three via there 's a further clause in our 2002 and 2003 agreements which is the vesting of dedication of wrote excess lot in the road one year and again undertaken through the subdivision to vendor wall on behalf of the picture and other noble owners apply for the vesting of dedication of the excess flow including alok road widening area and the relevant Authority there 's a theater tomb near that column has mentioned in terms of the rotten on owners the event and the event the further subdivisions approved and we 're going to taken for residential subdivision by the vendor or the journey on the adjoining development then the vendor undertakes to provide food with loading to living one standards now being superseded to living G I think it 's even being superseded again it 's cost together a sewer power telephone River and stormwater connection to what 's own standard lot nine so the developer was obligated to provide those services to us within the two years the residential rezoning which was August 2008 our gang of next page versus stuffs I 'm uh so sorry a 4.0 versus on the resource can see new roads devious the new roads being what 606 bonfires are to be formed invested in the council yeah access road is very close Nexus lost x12 you spend latest in wood a clue as nine point five which was originally in the resource concede and what the stood if you just glared right into the bottom yet to ensure this what to ensure this required as yet but conceit holder shall register on deposit of the plans for stage run of a subdivision a drainage reason easement over lots seventy-two reentered 166 others but I lost that the council easements were lodged in favor of the council to protect the area of the areas required for the stormwater fall of those roads 606 one five and on the very next page and this is the the colored plan that column had provided you you see those red areas there on the right and they were the ear is that we have to be protected for the stormwater for all of the roads including our right on page five you 'll see the there 's a picture B of the flooding this is at the eastern end of the exit slit of our road and this is at the point where it short section of land west of about 40 meters which is being joined straight to the spine road so obviously we 've got 30 problems every time it rains if you look right up the India passed the water you can sort of vaguely see where the road goes right to the endless trees that that 's about probably three hundred and fifty meters long so what the current stormwater planners and can see the storm water plane as basically taking the river which you can see paddle here about 1.5 meters uphill about 400 meters past the trees at the back this was these sort of bases were surprised I 'm not tweeting okay and I proposed to be about for me to stake you know there 's a bit of a problem with getting the stormwater to these basins up the hill because of the in the event of an extreme event sturm or system failure the Bisons must either slide to pepper or strain which is the nearest natural our fault and there 's a height problem with that strength well you just ask them to put I could connect with the picture of the laptop yeah we 're going on the page hi Steven jun 20 2013 22 printed that commissioner consists of a narrow spine road and the same report mr. tyler strikes out this storm will applause 9.5 i wished was protecting the storm what effects this law for our road the second non notified on adversely affected parties you see there that that this is actually as as shown in his planning report that that cause is actually struck through and july 2000 living the commissioner web stamp the duration concentric mean the narrow roads and the storm water clause protecting the axis that was still mother disappeared going on to the next page December the 2nd 2011 there 's an email via from a Senior Council Planning Engineer to Cardinal who 's the designer was the designer for the subdivision and other council engineers and just down here it says that this development has caused a few hiccups with construction moving ahead of acceptance of plans so effectively noble put the infrastructure and the ground without having a resource conceit and the insufficient and capacity to cater for our exit slit road so the queue of result of these hiccups is look as I 've just said as the particular loss of 30 to least consented medium to low density flats on the east-west League of the XS lot Road the low DC lots were requirement of their living G 's I 'm to provide a balance between nobles mostly high density loss fail innovation of X film world occurs in January 2012 karma provides a storm water catchment plan revision B to the council draining oil axis that storm would be possibly to lots on lock 20 and 21 per to 1.5 meters higher than the eastern end of the exodus level in revision betas their space let 's say there wasn 't revision day but they left 20 Bisons our stove a resource consented Bisons next page page nine in June 2014 the Carnot engineer Mark Thompson submits a split storm with a complaint to the council and you can see your vision gift as near the back then what he 's doing is he 's draining half of what half West and uphills a lot 20 this plan shows a change from draining all of the excess flat load and possibly up to up hillock 20 instead only draining approximately half west to let pretty with the other half draining east of the Nobel Poland basins the existing last Basin large dwellings remain draining directly to individual soak this mr. Mortman who 's the swimmer engineer replied that this was approaching something that may be acceptable but the devil was in the details pail f13 the Karno designers Kate McKenzie submits a fear the stormwater Vision Plan to Council November 28 2014 revision G which should be a bit food down at the back their plan at the back it is essentially essentially the same as revision if that shows that noble Lots behind the base in 3a have been reduced from 7 to 5 there are seconds to enter deputation okay so effectively the result of the list is that there 's a requirement for spec catchment of s3 water and at least harvest one ruler needs to go on to infinity land and in doing that the in size the rods actually need to be dug up and well at the back there is a plan there presented to us by infinity which shows lines on a plan which show the ears of the spawn rod which would need to be dug up and which were fitted with extra stormwater capacity to cater for the exit slot road thank you very much indeed for your presentation this morning that unfortunately doesn 't leave any time for questions but thanks for the papers that your distribution is like faithfully very much two minutes there 's crap so we now move on to our third deputation and I invite Greg Smith to the table place that page one is a planet okay we 'll just wait for the papers to the distributor on Exeter thank you for joining us so you have 10 minutes that 10 minutes would include any time that you wanted to leave for questions thank you okay thank you I 'm Greg Smith I own some property in this subdivision here I just really like to look at this from a take away some of from cohen-chang which is all really relevant and I do hope that it 's read through before you can make a decision on what 's gonna happen with this Road and the covenants I like to take a look at it from an overview really and look at look at it from a moral standpoint and also what the Covenant means to us and how it 's dated the history does have a lot to do with us the land you can see here inside that yellow band up on the board and on the document you 've got in front of you there 's the whole subdivision and that was owned by the ten lot on us and those smaller Lots to the left here and so this subdivision really only came about when all land owners gave that land for ten dollars each so around at that stage 80 dollars to the developer 24 heap years of a residential zoned land for eighty dollars and the only requirement really was from that point was for inclusion in the subdivision and that was set out and in sales and with counsel but one of the other lot of problems with development companies as they come and go and this one 's gone when he signed up one of the protections though that we had was the the covenants that were registered over the land and that 's what we 're talking about here today clears one point three point two was our poly are insurance or our certainty that our road would be vested and counseled and it put a requirement on the developer to to make application for their vesting and amongst other things the promises that we had that they would fluent the kept the yes the counselor is known about that the the road turning into that lot 22 should be a road will rotate this here and we 'll take you to its page fool and some poems and I went for Collins Falls yeah actually do you think couple eventually offered them yeah yeah in any case counsel always been a aware that this was going to turn to legal Road that the handle of giving you via in the highlighted section this is at that stage in terms of negotiating with us yeah I 'll leave it for moment and you severe that their interpretation actual people that set up this covenant their lawyers own interpretation of this was that the that lot 22 the reason that for the covenants was a lot 22 would be legal Road and would vest I was consistent with the representations they made to us through their time and and really what that 's the that 's the intent of that on page four of that document i 'll call me process okay so i was referring to here you can see on the screen in they are their sherman email Sonja 's plate what 22 will become road so nearly everyone 's been on the same page the representations made to us the council was view and in fact the lawyers of the people has set up this covenant everyone is consistent a lot 22 would become road investors legal road to counsel the the decisions that have been contemplated at the moment about dedicating it will mean that it 's potentially never invested a lot subdivision and Anna 's never vistas legal Road the solution only a little bit more solution focused and most irritation and say it 's been covered a little but quite simply the solutions are very simple the council has the opportunity to say to enforce this listing it 's a part of the resource consent conditions and it 's part of the council 's role in it we 've seen documents from between infinity and council and their lawyers talking about and dignifying counsel from legal action etc no I won 't go into that too much other than to say that development companies come and go and I don 't think I 'd be grabbing hold of any kind of indemnity from a company when it may come back on council themselves there 's no need for that council don 't have to go down this path they can simply actually follow the resource consent conditions put back in there the conditions that were taken out without notification and without any reasons for doing so they can ensure that the developer has the approvals from all parties which is and in this should be no 2 to 3 or section 24 issued without our even works carrying on without the approval of the relevant heir landowners and was certainly a part of the resource consent as Collins outlined no one 's ever come to us to talk about this and so it 's just it 's just another thing that council can easily enforce to to take this problem away and push it back to to the timeline that should have gone through in a proper process no that 's that that 's all for me I just urge you to look at the solutions point of year in to avoid problems in the future thank you thank you so that does leave some time for questions so Pauline don 't find this quite challenging to keep up with the course but are you basically saying that you 're claiming that the king resource consent conditions have not been complied with even the variations and if they were you would then be happy yes the original consent conditions have dropped off at as I said without explanation or without order to cater for this riding this is really the crux the problem there was just taken out with no no it 's different than the question I asked so the question I asked that consent was granted for the variation yes are you saying that they 're not complying with the variation or they are but you don 't agree that the variation should have been granted I don 't agree with that their condition should have been drank but they 're not complying with the-- get there not because of the current resource consent requires them to ensure there 's adequate sperm water at the end engineering phase for all of the subdivision and they 're not complying with that because the council know that there 's not enough yep so that 's what you say nothing quite like the variations I 'm assuming that the gentleman making the deputation is happy for mr. Stokes to answer clear you 're nothing this way never good on the detail all right thank you if it was resolved and you felt that it was compliant then you would be happy quarter this thing of all the roads is that is it the conditions of the consent require the excess lot lot six one two under conceit to vist as part of the conditions of the conceit and it should actually be shown on the section two to three certificate which it 's not it never happened if this dedication process goes it hit us today at view just on its own forever all right let 's take a further question yawning yeah I think you thank you for the deputation so just um obviously the development has changed hands and there 's a new owner um have you got any have you had any response from them in terms of a request to do the stormwater and what 's that response because we yeah that 's what I don 't quite understand like they 've got a requirement under the resource consent there 's still water obviously we 've seen the photos that have been produced from the previous yeah deputation where looks clear that the stormwater isn 't being can address so have you gone to the new owners what 's the response mean well started off well I can 't prove it on the detailer there used to be help we 've had negotiations with Infiniti on us we in covent cronkite cover the earlier that we did offer to contribute some of the money to it to work with them to give up land to give them land that wouldn 't otherwise go to them to get that done we were offered something that basically wouldn 't work there was no certainty of us getting that and so what it wasn 't an offer that was capable of acceptance in fact they didn 't accept our offer which was was was quite clear what would give them so we have tried to mitigate it through through those channels just let 's get the answer the first question first they may or may not be time for a second question you know if the storm water assured yes we did discuss that that 's been the issue for years and we will know at the council know to develop a nose at Delta knows it been infinity yet infinity pool CREF they promised us that the storm would it could go to the lane that 's about a meter and a half two meters higher we said firemen if it goes that we 're happy with that we 'll certainly take our covenant self give us the engineering approval just to give us that certainty so we know and they wouldn 't give it to us and it was only a matter of an hour to work to do so if it was possible because it 's only a matter of levels and things and then it 's overflow from the basins we 've been through in depth but yes we had that discussion and we know from what we 've established in from the report done by Delta a Raley 's through will review it 's not possible now that we don 't have time for further questions so thank you very much indeed for the presentation and for leaving the opportunity for questions to be asked and answered thanks very much indeed for joining us this morning thank you thank you our next call our fourth thank you good morning and welcome you 've got some papers to distribute yep if you just put them on to the end of each row there we 'll pass them down that 's great thank you great so as with others you have ten minutes and that ten minutes would include time for questions thank you okay thank you I 'm Stuart Lindsay this is my wife Julie I 'll take about four or five minutes with us and Julie 's got a couple of paragraphs you 'd like to add great thank you so good morning counselors we came here today to ask you to not circumvent our covenants on our properties that protect their inclusion they all subdiver I 'll give you a brief description of how we get to where we are today we purchased our four hectare block back in 2002 we were the first purchase at first to purchase one up ten blocks the agreements was such that noble investments that the vendor had up to 20 years to get that land resigned and accepted for residential subdivision if they achieved this we were return for the excess of lot 22 had been upgraded to a full Road with full services for the further subdivision investing with the council the first three purchases are all had some of further conditions and their Sales and Purchase Agreements that was that noble investments agreed to upgrade lot 22 to further subdivision with all services required for beasting at their cost the rezoning was achieved in August 2006 rezoning was now living G the current subdivision resource consent was for applied from 2007 and was issued in May 2009 in that consent the developers decided not to use the excess lot 22 as the main entrance as was intended when we purchased instead opting for a new spine road continuing right through to Buchanan 's Road at that stage there was no consulting or renegotiate renegotiating of our contracts many years the residents have been trying to get counseled to have Noble follow procedure and regards to the resource consent so as to protect our part of the subdivision as it states in the consent that all roads must be stin cluding the excess lot 22 and conditions such as 9.5 which was to provide easements over Nobles land to ensure there was enough area for storm water basins this clause has mysteriously vanished without it seems in any explanation that condition alone could have saved all this anguish stormwater storage has been a major issue was noble not wanting to use its bend under the pylon basins for lot 22 stormwater the filling to show storm would have going to the west of the subdivision some 1.5 meters higher this for obvious reasons does not work as your stormwater engineers to tell you this was also on land it did not own to this day we have not been shown a stormwater system that works as required by the resource consent when it became obvious noble we 're trying to design us out of the subdivision we were forced to place caveats over their titles I believe this would not have been needed if council had made noble follow procedure namely having stormwater engineering designs completed for the whole subdivision frightening building roads not living work proceed with unconsented variations and consenting unsafe and dangerous roads in the high court noble investments by this time formed of joint venture with gold Bend who were the fine inches and Delta who built the roads they join a joint venture with gold band elder who chose to use mortgagee powers to overturn our caveats and transfer the development the result being a company created to take over the subdivision called infinity yoke host and we thought great finally maybe we have a reputable developer that might do what is needed to get everything back on track after two months of negotiations we were closed but sadly infinite he wanted a deal that only suited them namely we gave them everything they needed straight away which was signing back the covenants on their titles giving up the knob which is the first part of lock 22 which was required for our intersection giving them approximately eleven hundred and fifty square meters of lot 22 which at present goes right through their commercial and in two years time they would start to provide our stormwater and contribute 300,000 towards our roading with no form of guarantee in the meantime all stormwater could work they would not give their the allot their lawyer did say to us if we didn 't honor the deed you could sue us that didn 't instill us with any confidence especially after they 'd lost over 100 million dollars of investors money in a project and Pegasus now we find that Infiniti wants the council to help do its dirty work to get around their covenants even more disturbing is the argument they offer you for the removal doesn 't even have the vari clause that prohibits them from being removed their Clause being one point three point two to vest will dedicate the part of the Serbian land included in the excess lot or road widening area as defined in the agreements for sale and purchased by which the Soviet land was sold by the developer as legal Road and to transfer or a link which all estate and interests in those areas to the local authority for one dollar this is backed up by a document found the discovery between lawyers Mears Williams and Carol leech dated 19th of May 2010 your client only because once the intersection opens locked 22 must vest as legal Road as per the covenants recorded in your clients title and the resource consent obtained by noble all we ask for is the status quo let the covenants be decided at mediation and the correct verdict will result remember we bought for Hector 's of land in 2002 was two options opt in one we gift back three hypnotism develop our one hectare of land option two we live happily ever after were therefore Hecht is at present we have neither thank you I thought I 'd finish our talk explaining a little about us in the very unfortunate position we are in we aren 't the bear guys I think some to believe we are we brought the me that Yahoo is Road fifteen years ago with the intent of being able to subdivide the land once it was resigned as soon as a bill that was perfect for us now for children no rush to develop but of sheets we look forward to seeing soon we would get a road in our services to the boundary could outsmart who I asked why you would not build the road first get the reason sorted in the move on to start the subdivision what average person would understand the legal writing that became the job big dog in who 's the biggest and richest and it wasn 't us residents the clause and our covenant as the air for a specific reason to protect us if you dedicate the road we lose our protection we have loved us nightmare too long we have always brought our children up that honesty is abuse policy please don 't make that not be the case we leave our future in your hands thank you thank you and that has left some time for questions if there are any questions nope alright thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning and thanks for the documentation as well thank you so that brings us now to our fifth deputation and I invite David Rumble to the table place is David Rumble here all right so will maybe come back to him if he 's here by the end of this section deputation and environment to the table place [Music] well good morning thank you for joining us you have 10 minutes and that time would include any time that you might choose to leave for questions thank you by way of introduction on one of the neighboring lanterns that part of the shared driveway that is the boundary between the development and their properties the this dispute relating to this subdivision dates world back before the cathedral repeal reboot dispute the dispute is not only between the neighbors and the developer the sort of a subdivision but it is a possible agreement even between the neighbors a number of parties over a number of years have tried to facilitate a reserve division unsuccessfully there was a reference to the solution would have been as easy well if it was easy we wouldn 't be here today I congratulate the council on the initiative it 's taken in this manner and Feliz upon what the council 's stars recommendation get some comfort that the council has been involved in this for some time they 've good legal advice and and certain the long way through the process so I congratulate council initiative I support the recommendations of the council for the sake of progress I have yeah I believe thousands will benefit from the land in question creating row through from youngest about weekend providing alternative routes enhance the excellent or weather soccer fields and facilities brought across the road confer this facilities a bravura be built and improve the safety of the road owned by transit I previously raised issues to requite transit about some of the safety issues in this in the rating it appears objective relates to the removal of the covenants referred to in page 41 of your papers and particularly point to under point five four and I understand like most developments infinity his a set of covenants that they wouldn 't put on the lane that does cover some of those covenants that are they to predict obviously the value of subdivision and the value of the neighboring properties I encourage the council to vote McLean for the council staff reclamation as a say for the sake of progress and to sit and inept objectors and appropriate courts I think they 've got arbitration coming up and and how the process is this is extremely complicated legal issues around it while we 're trying to simplify it I 'm not sure that 's council 's responsibility my own legal advice or my rights as a landowner I mean resource conceits can agree things but that doesn 't mean to say they 're going to happen landowner certainly have stalled their own rights and the elegant voice I have from white fox Jones varies from some of the Egypt as a legal advice or my rights related to it so it 's not a simple if there 's a very simple solution would we be this many years down the track and certainly I think it did eventuate from a developer who was probably well known for being creative and I 'm sure you know I 've worked at me to speak for ever did but you know it is Rosen from some pretty difficult developer at the initial stage and I do have sympathy for some of the people that have that was talked under objecting some sympathy for them but I vote for progress and I just thank you for the opportunity to talk to you okay thank you very much indeed and that doesn 't leave time for some questions if councillors have questions Jimmy Chang that 's the you pick okay with several owners the particular concern this is the comes consent in the issue RMA issue she 'll be back to normal channel Sula our email of posses so that 's a Sula kind of the court it will remove lost the Covenant rather than the counsel to you in order to kind of dedicated of votes but you mention that this the solution is difficult you know to can reserve so what 's your impression they are difficult well I think the kidding agreement between our new developers come on and previously well I think it 's very difficult it 's like when you 're in a driveway and all the owners go to approach to something status quo is perceived until they all get to agree to it and it 's I 'm sure the council 's faced this and the original comments were a question to me but in terms of the Queen so I don 't think there 's a simpler solution and I 'm really supporting the council 's proposal for the sake of thousands of others in terms of this I don 't think if the council voted either way there 's any personal gain to me there 's pluses and minuses both way so as oppose the previous objectives and I can understand they have land they can develop their inhibited from developing so they certainly have some significant financial aspects around it but flooding national pictures of Lighting 's outside a couple of properties what others mine it clears pretty quickly but it does illustrate that they further development would mean that there 's a stool stool water problem any further questions thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning thank you so now our seventh deputation of the morning I invite Brian O 'Malley to the table and Margaret O 'Malley welcome to both of you thank you we 've got some documentation here that 's been distributed as with the and if you wanted to allow time for questions that would be pass over that ten minutes and in that there are a fine thank you thank you [Applause] aggression do you like my first answer thank you but I feel firstly a little bit of info event in ourselves we 're both stupid mutants we 're in our 70s you wouldn 't guess that would you and I 'm a former accountant we have five children ten grandchildren we purchased what one at the oldest in 2003 and others did in 2002 we also purchased Lots two and three as an investment which the adjacent Lots so we never 29% share of the otter slots and 9% of this as a beneficial interest in lot one we built a house on lot one November 2006 we unfortunately world worker was necessarily incurred a significant dip in order to do that at that time though it appeared that there was a real prospect we could subdivide Lots on air ever got one noticed and bye-bye this means we 'll retire and add it however as time went on there was therefore we found that we were in the unfortunate position that we had to sell our house property and this occurred in May of last year and we are now living in a cottage in the Ashburton area I give you all this sort of vivid just in order for you to understand this is the real and practical effect of an on resolution of this europeís problem extending now for a period of around about 15 years and as you can see it has certainly had a critically negative effect on our lives I look back over the last few years and I found that there will be nine hearings in the High Court three hearings on the Court of Appeal a safety audit under the auspices of the council various council hearings maybe three to resolve issues at least two hearings for the Commissioner to resolve issues that our commissioners required for there is a perfectly reasonably from in CTA the protocol resolution which was rejected there were possibly three offers from Delta which is owned indirectly bodied the leading City Council all those offers were rejected infinity and finally just on this question of actions it 's unfortunately to say that however it mr. Stokes and others present today in August 2016 placed a fixation scariet on the properties of all adjoining landowners this has meant that each owner has not been able to deal independently with their own property they did that presumably just for their own means and I regard it as oh no let 's just continue with the deputation place regarding the community board with inundation and so I 've sit that out there which is to have the same waiting pretty much is what was in the resolution it was put forward by the community board that have included both say the its promoted the idea that there should be furtherly depiction and under the property law act however given past five years which are both in do you know of detailed the various hearings and what procedures that have gone on over time it seems to me that there 'd be little or no hope of reaching agreement in order to get this necessary removal of covenants I 'll record also Council of recent times about any about any matter as an adjoining landowner I would have thought that I would have been contacted maybe by mr. Maurer before now but I certainly have had no contact my views have never been soared and we represent 29% of the area that this effect is I think it 's demonstrated by the detail regarding the election that the legal system necessarily just seems to take an awfully long time so if we launch into some sort of further legal action we 're looking back on what 's happened that 's it it seems to me that it it can take up to two years to resolve something in the High Court followed by a third or two years in the Court of Appeal so potentially there 's a fear that four years down the track before the thing gets resolved if it went that way in our note that despite the fact that the community board discussed this matter on a public excluded basis for a for our know reasons were supplied in the minutes of the meeting first decision not to how explicitly that the community board could recommend further legal action through the court why would they recommend an action which could provide us probably not for many years ahead so we a right now to address the the Christian of safety on the on the mistake Highway your first Road we believe there is universal agreement that effect that the egress and entrance from both Lilliquist Road and the new football academy opposite is not legally available that it was not legally available it 's detrimental to public safety margit my wife here has personal experience of nearly being known down in her car one day by a big truck with a trailer moving at speed through the orifice road end of our lot 22 access road mr. by a meter and that 's because this was the only legal access to the Yorkist Road site across the krusty the the industry in section 2b crater is not yet illegal legal access so in addition is abundantly clear to the drive of any vehicle trying to cross your first road from the current egress at the end of lot time and that it will inevitably become more difficult as time goes on and we certainly noticed a major increase in the number of vehicles post-earthquake and it 's really just accelerated year upon year when we were there some level is adjacent to you of his village including ourselves have been very much disadvantaged by the impasse surrounding this development the staff recommendation provides an opportunity to resolve this matter in a positive way the need to provide certainty well after 15 years people including us just want to get on with their lives it is unfortunate that each and every offer has been healthy made has been turned down it seems to us that all these offers were made in good faith for the purpose of obtaining a solution to the problem and I do note that in the course of the opposition to council procedures and and what staff have done that in the past that there 's been allusions made to council ethics and conduct you know I just like to say that that most of us neighbors did not go along with with those those you some of you may remember them of may or may not consider the staff would that we don 't we don 't share vet thank you so it normally beliefs of others from infinity did provide a way forward for all parties that 's what we thought and would have avoided this current difficulty this company or trust has brought hope to a bleak situation we believe the staff recommendation has been made in good faith in attempt to finally resolve this difficult matter so we commend it to you thank you thank you very much and that has left time for perhaps one question Colleen a lot 22 do you imply them that are you saying that you actually support the spine Road oh I think everyone does there 's support the eventual whatever it is it 's going to become its it 'll be certainly a firm bitter access to your face right then from what 22 because it will be light right end up in and so safety or V will be there will be achieved yeah thank you thank you thank you very much indeed and will be taking into account obviously along with the other deputations what you 've told us when we come to make a decision thank you very much indeed so I now for call our final deputation on this matter infinity yelled Hurst limited so Mike Kerr welcome to the table thank you please take a seat thank you very much and as with the other deputations you have 10 minutes and that one would include if you wish time left for questions thank you very much for the opportunity to present on behalf of infinity old hearse this morning my name is Mike Pierre I 'm a partner in the law firm of Venice and Lloyd that we 've acted for infinity old Hurst limited through the due diligence period in acquiring the development land through the acquisition by infinity in August 2016 subsequent to that where you have been assisting infinity to try and progress this development which his long stagnated and previous developers so just wanted to give you a little bit of background about the acquisition and what infinity has been doing since as I say sale that was a sale by the mortgagee of the previous development mobile investments limited the purchase price was eighteen point three five million and since acquiring that property in August last year infinity has spent over eight hundred thousand dollars on carrying out the subdivision works to comply with every counsel condition on the stage one subdivision consent infinity has also spent a further one point four million dollars in upgrading the main intersection which is a controlled intersection with yalter strode that intersection is the main gateway to the development and also provides access to Canterbury sport limited 's soccer facility across the road to replace their temporary access the new intersection which has been constructed will replace the lock 22 access earlier this week we have had written confirmation from the New Zealand Transport Agency that they will open the new intersection it has meet all of the requirements of the New Zealand Transport Agency end of Council at the same time as that intersection has opened the lock 22 access which was referred to earlier as being the unsafe access TLDs Road will be closed because have one access within the proximity there is no question that Infiniti is trying to restrict access to the other owners that simply can 't happen on the deposit of this plan which would be allowed for by the dedication that plan will in itself create the legal access from all of the properties adjoining the subdivision right throughout TLDs Road and also south to the other bestirred roads and the subdivisions to the south there has been a safety audit report carried out by council following some of the roading works carried out by the previous developer noble Investments Limited there were some concerns around the width of some of the roads and some of the other traffic treatments that report was tuned into subject of subdivision consent variations through Council which have all been approved the engineering plans for those safety audit works have been approved by council and all of those works have been carried out by Infiniti LTS limited so Infiniti is now carried out all of the work that is required to do to complete the stage one of the subdivision it is now ready hip titles issued the thing that is stopping that occurring as the land covenant that 's registered on the titles the land covenant prevents the vesting of Road that does not prevent the dedication of Road so the decision to be made by Council today in regard to dedication is the thing that unlocks the subdivision I just want to be very clear all of the work has been done for this development for the relevant stage there has been a lot of talk about stormwater earlier today the stormwater Honor Development like any other physical work is something that council signs up through its section 24 procedure under the Resource Management Act that consents have been varied along the way through this development to cater for what is now being built there is a completely separate process for council to go through in terms of signing off those physical works and then as under Section two to four counts were to trust their staff who sign off on those in the Subdivision team is with any other development we do not consider the detriment to dedication it sounds when of roads is not particularly unusual in fact dedication of roads is as the air for the severe circumstance we there are historic interests registered on titles to land that are preventing the vesting of a road and a subdivision the land governments themselves only relate to building on the lens so it talks about dwellings being approved those are the things that also restrict certain farming activities and it refers to maintenance of shelter belts that aren 't on our clients property there is nothing in those land covenants that would be breached by the dedication of this Road this covenant does not prevent roads the land covenants also lets on subdivision in its our clients position that they have already lapsed there have been previous subdivisions that have occurred that means that these these covenants are no longer in effect in any event there is no risk to council because at the point at which the subdivision plan deposits the covenants will not apply unfortunately that means that it doesn 't mean that they come off the title to the property and that 's the core process that developer and not progressing the dedications the option turn the staff report which has not been recommended as that infinity go to court to to progress this that will considerably take at least nine months to you through the first court hearing we don 't have a we believe that that if decided in favor of infinity would be appealed so we 're probably looking at at least another two years to get this development open to open this intersection that 's been fully built and to get this development going that has been dormant for at least five or six years and finally has newly banking covenants so they have a first mortgage in favor of being zip which requires titles to issue by a certain timeframe initially that was by the end of June beings it has granted some indulgence to the developer because it understands the difficulties that we have in this without the dedication this development will continue to stall it 's been sitting idle and I honestly believe that people driving past this development over the last five or six years must wonder what on around 2000 even 2012 yes there have been some three of the weeks our client has carried up all those works Infiniti has carried out all of the subdivision in Section works to be a big deposit then there is commercial sales that will flow on from the subdivision and create jobs there are significant buyers in the commercial area NZTA has given its permission to open the interception but will not do so until this road is dedicated they don 't want an intersection that 's going to flow into something that is not a public road the intersection will provide the link to canterbury sport it also links roads into other developments to the south which is the delle main development into the east which is the enterprise development infiniti has tried for several months to obtain the written consent of the adjoining land owners to remove this land covenant the objectors issues that you 've heard about today issues with the former developer there with contracts with the former developer our client purchased at mortgagee sale it does not take on those obligations Infinity 's not trying been talk about lot 22 vesting in the road widening area there was nothing being done by Infiniti to stop that happening the road widening area referred to and the Covenant isn 't on infiniti 's land and for that he cannot do a thing about it it 's for the neighbors to build it 's on their land it 's a part of the subdivision consent at at stage 20 this is a stage subdivision consent that must be done in order there are 13 neighbors to this development of those 13 neighbors seven of the 13 have signed the documents required to remove this covenant from the titles affair the two of the 13 have signed not opposites not opposition provisions in a contractually obliged not to object the variable of the Covenant so the 13 neighbors 9 will not stand in its way what we urge Council to do is not lead four of the 13 hold this development up for several more years while it 's tied up in litigation just in closing this is a perfect example of where dedication should be used this is Council to accept the staff recommendation to dedicate the road thank you thank you for the deputation that some leaves time for one question if there is a question Glen Livingston its noticed on the Delta website that an August 24th August the sale went through to infinity to 16 and according to the previous submitted Cabot 's were placed by landowners in the same month so you could even comment on the sequence of events did you say the work habits on all of the development land titles while still registered in the name of the overall investments limited there was court action taken by gold band finances mortgagee of noble in order to have those covenants removed and allow the mortgagee sale to progress that was objected to by the neighbors who had placed the Cabot 's on the development land and there was a high court decision issued that allowed those came in at those caveats tulips and allow the mortgagee sale to go through an appeal against that decision was lodged by the neighbors to the Court of Appeal their appeal was not progressed in there go through an August sorry is long answer to a short question now that 's great thank you so that some now brings us to the end of the ten minutes thank you very much indeed for taking the time to join us this morning and that brings us in fact I probably should just check that David Rumble hasn 't entered the room in the meantime David rumbles not here alright so that brings us to the end of the deputations by appointment thanks to all of those who 've taken the time to participate _"

Nikki Wagner the Honorable nikki Wagner Minister supporter in Greater Christchurch regeneration Jane Brighton and Mike Shepherd from the minister 's office and Calvin Smith Department of Prime Minister and cabinet remain after the public have been excluded for item four of the public excluded agenda as she and they have knowledge that is relevant to their teittleman and will assist the

today is already public information the only new books are one of the attachments and the actual staff recommendation and I was wondering why the majority of the report isn 't public and that we move into px4 though for discussion on small bits that are not you are right we have in the past made a distinction most frequently when we 're dealing with a property transaction and we we deal with the transaction and open and have the financial commercial details and + px '_''_1960.539 I don 't have a view but I just pick up from the minister 's Lisa where she did express the wish that the initial discussion be dealt with in px and because you have a report in front of you that you will be discussing it would seem to make sense that the document remains in px but that it 's released as soon as it 's it possibly can be once the minister has completed her negotiations cabinets approved the the minister 's leisure of attachment a and I understand that the minister also has some further information for us that should be dealt with in public excluded and I can understand that but the actual rest of the content of the report is already public information and I 'm wondering why there wait we can 't split that is it normal practice for us to keep something in confidence just because someone has asked us to or does it get us out of our local government imact obligations the the weight that you good to the ministers request is up to the council but I would assume that if that 's what the minister wants us to do then we should probably do it in terms of what could be in and what could be out of the report we haven 't done that exercise and also make the point that it is not going to be much of a gap between this meeting and when the information will be to be released so I just come back to the point that what 's in the report whilst oven maybe have information that is public the fact that you will be discussing that I think my invite my view anyway is that you should keep it in GX and just release it at the earliest opportunity glean thank you on that basis in would it be your view that essentially we 're telling we 're dealing with two circles so us as council where our default setting should be public but we 're dealing with you know the other party which doesn 't share the same sitting so it 's just how it is it 's kind of central local and and this situation was quite frequent post-earthquake when we were getting information from the crown and the only way we could get it as if we had complied with their obligation of confidence and they that worked we knew what the rules were they have different rules to us I 'm not opposed to the openness and transparency but I think to be practical this is the the situation that we 're dealing with let 's get on and do it and release the information as soon as aids the when it comes to the principles that the local government is supposed to act under the prime one is that the need to act in an open transparent in democratically accountable manner and the actors clear that if there 's a conflict between practicality and efficiency and other principles that the openness transparency and progressively accountable ones should be the prime one that we look at isn 't that the legume er legislation that we 're talking about we 're not talking about the Local Government Act this is the local government official reservation and principles about how we operate the local government official information in meetings act yet the act that determines whether a message can be dealt with in a public excluded environment or whether is required to be dealt with in an open but we were we were just hearing that it 's a matter of practicalities and speed for this one no it 's not what in said you can 't reinterpret what the lawyers told us so can you can you advise on the local government official information and meetings act on the Act sets out a number of situations where an organization would be entitled to withhold information from the public and we are in compliance with one of those provisions which is that we have and we will be discussing information that 's been provided to us on condition of confidence and we 're entitled to rely on that specific provision and the crown has asked that we do thank you so when we get into the pig 's secret unka this is obviously going to pass it would be really good if you could point out which but have been provided in confidence so I can be sure there is the pic that we 're going to invite the minister to remain will be parently perfectly clear what elements are excluded at the stage all right I will put the motion then all those in favor say aye those opposed say no show of hands all those in favor say aye I mean put their hands up just to go into the pigs and those opposed that 's carried yeah so Templeton Davidson back and swags and queuing you _"

no that 's carried the declarations of interest haven 't been is some Mike Davidson on item so 25 and then we come to public participation and we 've ed Clark on the on the out bike so could I invite our grant Johnson and inquire if you 'd like to come and join us at the table thank you give us turn it on first if you settle down the green mark severe thanks for doing that before the meeting officially started that sort of satisfies every level in terms of the formality of the council meeting but it has given us a demonstration of what what you 're here to talk about thank you thank grant from guide bike and this is Clark from yacht boy not sure if you 're aware the eye pipe has been built and designed in christchurch we 've been around for about seven years and this is coming up into eighth year now and what we want to do want to demonstrate our new products and this is to introduce you to our company so your bike is a fully electric transport product it is not got pedals which go round as such it is fully electric it 's also very portable as you can see it 's a perfect product to be able to be used for transporting around a busy city it falls down into a very much compact size so you can use it to go on a bus or a train we in the back foot of your car or take it on a boat or on a health private helicopter or plane but it 's only product in New Zealand which is got sonde legal classification that is called the most of the classification is VI pike in terms of as a product with not many companies in New Zealand that something 's holy any which actually can set it be on the front which magazine Time magazine what 's been the ghost book records we 're currently in the guest book rigs as well as in terms of classification you can see we talk about electric transport is it 's rock the yoke bike in terms of the product itself the clock will demonstrate here the safety features so in terms a lot of the bike you can see there that the bike is fully lit up as was up during the day and at night time it has lights and also has the rear lights and when you 're sitting upright as well you 're very easy to be seen here 's anti-skate brakes as ABS braking so when you when you go to break it 's not like a pedal bike that you will lurch forward the back itself gradually slows down so it 's a gradual slow down in terms of our braking it 's not one which you actually will tip over some people look at it they go it 'll gradually slow down the handlebars have been designed to be on the side and the reasons being designed on the side is number reasons one is safety again you you won 't go hit over the handlebars and hit yourself muscle so when you write the point you lean on the bike it 's actually glide you don 't use ahead of bars to fully steer you more lean side to side developed and maneuver its built-in indicators so it has as your little right indicators it has very good acceleration now there 's a lot of token the from the motor so you can get up and go if you want to an a very quick class speed but you can also limit it as well so from a tourism point of view if we want to we can actually limit the speed so that take it be slowly because we see this as being that we are designed and built in christchurch we see this could be a wonderful tourism product for christchurch its speed limitation as well as 3 3 h speed we deem it know I mean there is a lot products at here these electric bikes and is Maalik source code between 30 to 35 kilometers we deem that is not safe so when we got the classification done through the government we made sure that it was 23 kilometers per hour but also you need to wear a helmet the noise of the bike which Clark will demonstrate as well there 's an equation a number of times why we have a noise the reason you have a noise is from a safety point of view because this bike is deemed legal to go in footpaths and paths and so through on the side of the road the last thing you want to do is have something which is totally quiet come out behind you so the sound of the bike itself is a safety factor the bike itself is one of the tools as well for branding as you see here from the slide this was that had the bike to look like when it 's fully skin so again from the point of view from a tourism point you can 's skin in terms of a product it 's advertising our city area innovation in the city and also in terms of what we believe towards green technologies this is the model see this one here is a full carbon product so it 's more the top in product it is slightly different design but in terms from a branding point of view like the one you can see up there on the slide you can brand the fall frame and also the wheel the beauty of the wheel as well because it doesn 't go around like a normal middle bike because of mobile billboard this is the model B brand it up as you can see the one which Clark brought out the moral V comes single into will as a adapter some people find it much easier to learn to arrive in free will than a single wheel so the model v comes with both options when we make it and yeah there 's my brief introduction to the outline so what I like to do I 'd like to basically put a formal introduction and also could work with you to develop her using the I parks in their city thank you thank you thank you very much well it was a very interesting way to start the meeting but thank you for the presentation and I 'm sure that counselors would would welcome the opportunity to you know have further discussions with the item open you can see where we go to here I think we might we might get the innovation and sustainability committee to to do some brush up some initial contact and take it from here thank you if I could invite Matt Felton and impress them to come forward thank you morning good morning well thank you for this opportunity look I just want to focus very quickly on what is the biggest issue already facing our city and how our city will be judged in history as to how its dealt with the trauma of the quakes I 'm referring to the Cathedral there is no other building in the city that is so important for the identity and character and also the attachment of the citizens of the city now we you are aware of course that we are facing a supposed decision of the Cathedral from being considered I should say that Tim and I both Anglicans as well as strong advocates for restoration but the process is that the senator has been given the opportunity to vote it can 't_''_2636.76 be a vote to take away the Cathedral and have it rebuilt it can only be a vote to take the matter to court but that is the wish of Synod and what we would like to Prince you will know if it doesn 't decide to restore so you mean if it doesn 't decide to restore yea there 's only one solution that leads to decision that leads to a solution that 's right and that 's restoration for the city but in the context of this issue we have just had released in the last three weeks the Cathedral working groups report and unfortunately the media has not helped communicate that to the wider public and every day you see communications in the press Brian adores article letters that show people of Christchurch are committee of five people to appointed by the church church property trust they had 40% representation and that report is a central reading for all leaders and decision makers in the city so what I would suggest and urge is it is time for this council to show its hand at six years since the council actually had a vote on anything to do with the cathedral and at that time the council voted 10 votes for a pause on restoration until an engineering assessment had been done when flawlessly and voted floor against that motion so I would suggest it is time for the entire council to give this matter it 's focused consideration and for counselors as individuals to ensure that they read the cathedral working groups report it 's extremely well-written it 's very succinct and clear and it is the only authoritative report on the cathedral situation that we have six years ago you voted the council to pause the motion and two lives where was engineering assessment we now have the complete assessment and it is now over duty of the council to ensure veterans let the people of Christchurch know what you are elected leaders and representatives positions on this matter is I would also suggest that because of the issue about the wider public understanding it would be bones of you supported the distribution of this report to all council libraries and conspicuous places and drew attention to it it would also be really helpful if the council actually used the media and the press to get the essential messages from this report objectively out there in the public to may looks sadly they haven 't got there yet but no one should be writing letters or even opinions about this matter unless they have read this report which will taxpayers have spent well over 400,000 and a lot of time waiting for to have this report and if we get this wrong this will books it a part of the evidence that will shame our city forever because the report concludes that it 's entirely feasible to restore the Cathedral it would be as safe as any modern building and that the fundraising could be done in three to five years and essential this council steps up and the public know the people for City know that you have given at your in-depth consideration and they 've formed a view and a position on it and hopefully a supportive position because previously the council is to contribute on an annual basis to the Cathedral in the square and recognition of its value to the city as a whole and there 's no reason of course if the cathedral is recovered in a way we can all be proud of that the council isn 't making that a situation again supporting it on an ongoing basis that 's worth searching didn 't go I 'll be much briefer than mark if I could Leanne just two quick points equip and I would ask the council consider whether the position of the eyesore of the current Cathedral is acceptable to the city certainly not acceptable to me and that a request to enable various benefactors which we could readily put the council in touch with to actually do a bit of improvement in the immediate eyesore situation of it in the next month or is that there is opportunity for counselors or the mere and to attend the Senate pre centered meetings I 'm planning to go to them and speak at those but it would be great to have some representation from our city leaders at those meetings and again would be happy to and arrange and enable that those appointments if people are interested just please be in touch all right well look thank you for that and you know well I 'm sorry that 's I mean the the downside of this using this component of the meeting is that is literally a five slipshod can have ten seconds there 's just one other point yeah thank you I would like the council also to consider endorsing and also in the report what I was going to say was that as you say the report was presented in the public arena only three weeks ago I have taken the responsibility as mere to ask staff to prepare a report on it as a matter of agency and the the reason that I 've done there is that there has been no other than that report because of course it is anger can check property and it is ultimately the Anglican church 's decision I was don 't write using the word but blindsided by the decision to refer it to the Synod I didn 't know that that was going to be coming out as a position and so I have I initiated a meeting with the bishop because I felt that we hadn 't had a meeting since my reelection last year and it is really important for the city to be fully engaged and what as an incredibly important part of our city I want to just reinforce the point that you made right at the start if the Synod make the decision not to restore the Cathedral we will have uncertainty for years and that is something that I don 't like the city can tolerate so I think there is only one decision that actually takes us forward as a city and there is no other decision that will lead to anything else other than uncertainty and legal wrangles for years so so that 's that 's staff to report urgently so I 'm hoping that within you know within a very short space of time we will have a that will give us some sense of direction about what we as a city can promote by way of a contribution in terms of the speaking right set at the Synod or at any of the pre Senate meetings will certainly be really happy to explore those opportunities and so thank you very much thank you yes right the next item is deputations and we don 't have any deputations by appointment and no presentation of petitions and I 'd like a resolution now to include two supplementary reports on the meeting with someone like to move that those two papers be included Pauline Cottard David East I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know there 's carries a number of council committee minutes to receive I 'll I 'll move those drive a seconder Hendrick tuna or put those all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carry the item number 8 the enliven places of sustainable development committee so I 'd like Vicki buck to introduce this item yep very simple support from the committee board us and to do this and the other issue that came up at the committee was the waste minimization fund and the fact that we are not actually putting in applications we haven 't put in applications to use this fund so we 've asked for some work to happen on making sure that we do because it 's currently all going to the rural authorities so you 'd like to move I 'm happy to recommendation yeah seconded by Thomas Kendra any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carriage thank you next item is the we 've done a minute item number 11 maintenance level with road maintenance then drainage water and wastewater maintenance status report this came through this came through which committee finance and performance so red hello oK we 've got two reports here one on road maintenance and one on parts which we 'll get to and the important thing really and without good data you can 't have good accountability and good governance this is a real step forward so congratulations to staff on that wherever they are some points of interest if you go to page 72 of the report for those who haven 't dug through the whole thing there 's a lot of data here it 's got a good sense of where the trends are and in general when we look at the numbers of maintenance requests it looks like we probably peaked in terms of the worst of it and we 're starting to trend down the other side which is good news you can see the peak over the last couple of years so that suggests a slight improvement and maybe we 're over the worst especially with author that I guess the rebuild externalities an interesting point on page 69 now item 3.3 out of the customer service requests we get there 's one quite strange anomaly where where one complainant has raised 1500 CSR 's about sign and line maintenance I have asked for some information I don 't know if we 50 percent of the CSR so that 's an that 's quite interesting so overall some good data in here and it tends to show that we 're probably over the peak of high complaints and we 're coming down the other side good seems like to me maybe I have to move that shall we do reports oh no because I 've got something else about my okay so you 'll move that one shielded by Jamie um questions is it o debate so um okay yeah Yanni just to back up I guess the the appreciation for the detailed information I think it 's really useful I think there 's two other things that just need to be said and that is that part of the problems is the way in which we 're monitoring the requests and the work that 's being done allocated to each request so I think staff have advised that there is ongoing work with the contractors and with our IT systems to get a much more robust way of monitoring what happens when people put complaints in and at the moment the it 's quite hard to track where the hot spots are so obviously look forward to that work being done and I think the other thing that 's worth pointing out as well is that the the levels of service we 're going to review how we do things as part of the section 17a reports for the long term plan so there 's a number of things in here like the baseline for the number of complaints which is you know a thousand more than what the previous figure was that we were measuring against so as we go through the LTP I think that 's the opportunity where we start to really look at how we doing the maintenance for these things but also what are the measures that were holding the organization accountable to so that we 're all clear about what we 're trying to achieve the final player makers that I think you know we do have to take some responsibility I think for the budget cuts that came in as part of the LTP that led to some of the complaints the rise significant to the LTP I think you know this is um the time that we can address those issues so I just I really do appreciate getting this information back it 's a good start still a few things that need to be done to get on top of it but we are going in the right ear from now lien thank you and almost so grateful for this report I note on page 70 under 9 rather five-point sorry 4.2 the fourth bullet point there consider options for reservation red zone I think there 's another space as well and that 's that space between red and green and that interface so I think going forward it would be good to literally explore that because we could Bend that space for some time we don 't know how long the red zone will take to be developed and even if it is we could still have quite some separation than there you know that kind of undeveloped area so I think for many communities there that could be it 's a difficult piece of work but it could be a on it okay all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they note that 's carried thank you riff right on to the favorite stuff which is mine so this is a very big report the one on parks and maintenance and has some incredible detail especially at the ward level so that would be of interest to all Ward members the the pages I think that are very interesting so if you go to page 91 and 92 what it shows is where the spikes in maintenance requests come from and primarily these are weather related obviously we deal with weather related stuff in a whole bunch of different areas but clearly last year we had a lot of rain in spring and it caught the contractors by surprise and then they see the grass all over the city grows like crazy everyone calls up and says well we can 't play cricket here and so your request spike goes up and then there 's a period where the mowers get onto it and get round and mow so that if you what is going on and so that 's really good information another piece is also the parks maintenance and this is where the the budget increase for Park Rangers has come in so if you go to page 95 and it shows you that mowing is really the big well that 's when people get on the phones parks maintenance is also another issue as well and on page 97 it is a very good graph of the parks maintenance related a customer service request jobs and you can see we 're not we 're not clearing a lot of those and that 's what we 've just doubled in the annual plan in terms of having sort of more ranges that come in 5 thing so so that that really that really is a basic resource issue for us so we 've doubled the amount so hopefully we 'll get better response there again page 99 and 1 page 98 actually you can see the spike again in October and December in terms of maintenance related complaints so they will come in at the same time of year so that they 've got to resource up for that period another piece of very interesting data if you go to page 131 we have a dashboard system which is very interesting and it really shows how we manage the contracts across the city this is a really really detailed piece of information it shows that in general actually the trends are pretty good these people are doing generally a good job if you take out the spikes because of the rain and iron maintenance issues but it shows how we actually manage this data so the fact that we 're getting the state anomalies we can really drill into stuff and really see what 's going on so that 's that 's really you know pretty exciting if you 're a data junkie I tend to think that you know the trends are actually reasonably good and if we take out last spring and we take out the fact that we do have to improve our general maintenance which we 're doing with the park rangers so there you go enjoy thank you so you 'd like to move it Vikki and one of the things that came through strongly at the committee was the spring impact across after our own staff but also across all contractors and that comes through year after year after year so it doesn 't really matter how much rains things grown spring and what seemed to be the situation was that there was simply not enough staff to be able to deal with it I wonder if it would be sensible if we asked Andrew at some stage just for one page it doesn 't need to be major on what could possibly be done to address that staffing issue you know it 's really difficult issue if you look at so we had a lot of rain in spring last year the previous year actually the rain came late so the spike was actually later but you always get this yeah the issue I mean this is just this is any kind of seasonal issues how do you get a huge amount of staff in for a particular time of the year to do something now the one I mean here 's a is the citizens so I mean you know that that is potentially an option is actually just getting everyone out there with their Mo 's okay what this digital resource up just for say two months a year is quite tricky for the contractors yeah well I suggested because Andrew raised it as an issue not just for us but for contractors and that they lose the brownie point says that we 're in beer mmm whatever it is the kpi 's and during that time and I wonder if we shouldn 't address actually how we address that now because that deals with the majority of their complaints and I 'm just Andrews made and we know it 's sort of assuming is okay with it suppose we have an outcome for free fall right it 's a good discussion because it happens every year yeah so how do you deal with it I just wondered whether it 's because of a larger conversation that 's been going on around immigration policies that you 've got the recognized seasonal workers who actually work at a different time of the just a fit Christchurch it must be the same and Auckland Wellington and other major metros around the country that I mean I don 't think we would be without what to think whether there 's a way of linking into a workforce that is moving around the country at different time every year and whether that literally is an external work force that come on and assist a bit and even students or you know retired people mean that there is a way of doing this the difficulties here that 's problem yes but the difficult is what you mentioned before if as the other year it was like two months difference so you 've got a work force really though they 're required elsewhere at certain times so you know it 's going to happen or it may hit them but you don 't know when it 's kind of HIPAA and it 's a real pain I knew that it I knew the word intend would come up and gleam on various over a cup of wards there would be has a lot of people Burwood there lot of spikes over them there you go to shoe the mowing with it see some winds own influence in there and ruin the bill would spike over and completed no these are all patch edge will maintain receive some rapport in regard either yellow grass and obviously associated retain limbs look after the red zone at the end at the moment then there 's a lot of bits and pieces right that we have to look out it 's quite difficult way it was oh sorry sound can 't pick you up Andrew so you want to come up here come to the into the Taylor over microphone she just put the roving microphone away thank you thanks is in the burma tyrion in the east as i was saying lens are responsible for the red zone at the moment and there is a lot of grass over there this is a whole lot of bits and pieces that we are responsible for and in the contractors response to getting on top of that last spring was was less than optimal it 's getting better but the discussion that the peak time the way we 've actually set the contract up as we 've worked with the contractors to ensure that all the demands don 't come on at the same time so that they can release as many people as they can to that high mowing activity i think the reality is that they haven 't planned that well and a lot of that a lot of the complaints that got registered we 're not necessarily because of a whole lotta grass not being managed as you can see the Marling 's being the spike but it 's really been around how they 've managed that resource they were typically not doing the same sites over and over and over again they go back to the start of their schedule and get as far as they could so there was some sort of common sense things that need to improve as well so it 's it 's not just that it 's uncontrollable it 's fair to say that how the the available resource is used needs to improve as well there 's an expectation in our contracts have performance measures set at 90 percent of the agreed program and banding for quality so i guess from a learning perspective going into this spring it 's going to be a where spring it 's going to be a harder spring this year whenever that happens to tune up because we 've already got a lot of moisture in the ground that we didn 't have following three years of near drought so there 's going to be some challenges coming up the spring be picking up a crown work or what is crown responsibility in there in respect to the red zone yeah hopefully not okay but not in the short term times we 're certainly not funded to deal with the level of service that they 've been delivering in that red zone okay so that 's not behind the spike you know David and Dionne thank you still for me but crazy I think of circles and pops up waterfalls will help this morning but not quite there Andrew I 'm just curious with the performance management of some of our contracts and write to the hear a lot of conversation about some of their contractors are losing it Vicki said brownie points now they 're being a little I 'm feeling penalized with the spike situation we 've got or or are our contractors expected to to recognize we have this problem at this time of the year and and be able to cope with it it 's the letter I mean the way the programs set up and the frequencies are set up they are set up to deal with the spikes and if in a nature shifts that spike along we always were the contractors to make sure that the frequencies they need to deliver the product are correct look I think they had a bit of a honeymoon in the first year in the first spring it wasn 't that bad and they got there quite nicely and I think it hit them a little bit by surprise but I think it 's been put it out the council back might have pointed out this is not new city care had the same issues when they were the contractor whenever the spring it wasn 't so much that it was a complete failure I think they just didn 't understand quite how to deploy resource so that they didn 't have repeat failures at the same location now that 's a learning that I would like to think that we can work with them so to eradicate going forward you go easier around punishment we believe that the contract is a really good pain game contract and that it fairly reflects good performance and that the community on the other side of the coin if you like that if the contract is not performing year after year after year well then someone you should be brought to the table so it 's it 's black and white it 's very clear they won 't get paid for week they haven 't done but and it 's challenging for them the challenge for them is to be really good at resource management and counselor mangie pointed out some contractors do that by holding their staff for the bulk of the year and trying to bring in tempstar for the pigs it 's a peak if they get ready for it so we think easily speak this year that the message is there that it is going to be a exceptional growth here and now we talk we 're talking we 've been talking to them for a while that as soon as the rain started in late April in May that they need to be well established to deal with spray goo stay on bin Aaron yeah it 's just quickly around the different you keep talking about product but the change of product that we 've had and has just that impact has that been quite in terms of the education about how do we apply the new product that we 've been using in terms of being better for the environment as they have much of an impact I 'll say you 're sorry and respect to the non glyphosate approach and yeah okay so removal of roundup or website if you like and look there 's no evidence that the efficacy of the organic based product is having a major impact at all we increase the frequency that we have that it 's not that good at dealing with we 've given the contra as more resource council recognized that in the report that we would have to up the operational expenditure in that space Council at the time also gave us some extra capital so we 're out there at the moment re mulching gardens to make sure that it 's a bit more balanced I 'd have to say at this point we 're probably another 12 months away from seeing it being quite successful in the park and bottom it 's challenging in some other environments and it 's challenging first for some people and past because it 's a it pawns frankly that 's quite a caught a nasty smell it goes away pretty quickly but we 've had a few complaints about the smell yeah we haven 't had anyone say they like it but as that resource I mean I 'm just where I 'm asking is the resource that you had obviously when you changed the product has that been sufficient to be able to to drive there through the organizations that are you referring to the contractors look you know it was it it was a best guess from them they were given an open opportunity to they understand how long it takes their people I mean our contracts are simple its bums on seats of a mower or people doing work and they understand that you know better than we do and so they were given an open invitation to put to us the case of shifting away from glyphosate to the new product what is the likely impact to be and they 've still got that opportunity right now we 're reviewing how that 's gone there might be some minor tweaks but there was certainly as I said at the beginning there 's no evidence that that is the major contributor to the customers concerns Aaron 's next yeah hair my question is around how open we are to allowing certain neighborhoods to manage their own contracts have we ever looked at that with a residence of quite a large strong residents association and the water I represent who have a number of parks and pocket parks and public open to that and saying hey look the square meter it 's rate per year is this you 've got this much park space this will be your budget are you still interested in can we have those conversations is that reasonable here typically they 've come to us at over the last while through sports clubs that have an association with a particular part when we explain to them that for example it costs around 1,200 per annum to look after a school 's field they quickly change their mind and the reason for that is of course is the amortization of all of the equipment and resource across the entire city brings the rate right down so we need to look at the cost on an asset by asset basis it 's quite low and look we 're very open it we more interested I guess in exploring an expanding volunteer input we did some stuff the last couple of weeks ago when this report was requested for and we sort of calculate that the monetary value of the voluntary volunteer hours that we get into parks at not to be sniffed at and we really want to explore pushing that angle more so rather than saying here you go you manage the contractors and you have to manage the risk of course associated with health and safety etc etc and access and so forth that we encourage the community to get a bit closer to whomever the workforces and work with them we believe that 's a better mechanism all right such a question I just wanted to jump in on Dion 's question if you go to page 132 there 's an excellent dashboard there and what it looks at is a particular contract in a particular area which is the eastern contract so we tend to get the headline bits mowing and sports field safety and parts but then you can actually drill down into that and see what the particular issues are so if you look at a bottom one which is general park maintenance year-to-date trend you know for playground equipment hedges Gardens that 's already good and then it 's the weed control that 's getting the issue so there 's a areas are causing the issues so you know that 's really useful stuff not falling through to follow up that was this incredible data we can actually become more proactive and how we address these things rather than reactive and so that 's the way that we 're trending across the board that 's a really good thing but isn 't that the theory behind the new park ranger absolutely yeah absolutely I mean this data is available to both the the contractor and council staff and that was pointed out before that it 's quite complex to get good information out of our customer service information at the moment but we can get some and that 's what we want to use to get that proactive management going and it really just has simply been we 've been too stretched yeah in the past other contractors sitting down with each community board and going through this data with them when the contract was set up it was a requirement that the contractors present themselves to community boards on a monthly basis different community boards responded differently to that some 's sort of dropped away but I 'll follow up to make sure that we had good response from some community boards wanted a monthly catch-up another said look three monthly or less is fine so more than willing to give that energy D yeah I 'd really like the data to inform the discussions you know so I mean that Eastern one is a really good example of how you can drill down into the data to see what the real problems actually are because it 's very easy to say there 's a there 's a service level you know must is that actually to find out what that is focused on and the timing of it yeah it 's all very relevant to any decision making that you want to make or resourcing decisions yeah I was just thinking just on that I mean we get updates every month on graffiti and I think this would be quite good just in the board area report to actually have this stuff included it 'll be quite good yeah but to actually sit with the contractor at the board landry sitting there however if you 'd like to just say when the lights are going to happen on botanic and the potentially could you speaking from sorry chief you took a completely irrelevant question I 've had a certain property not 2000 applies I don 't have that information in front of me at the moment captain daddy thank thanks Indra and thanks for the information in the report just um just that are you able just to give us a bit of a timeframe for when we 'll get an improved customer service interface in terms of the ability to manage the complaints coming in versus the completion work so are you talking about that the information system yeah number of people like I mean there 's a number of complaints that have come in where people have repeatedly lodged complaints ray and things don 't don 't happen so really closing the loop with the customers or I mean I don 't like calling customers but that 's you having which we use but when people make a complaint having the ability to close that complaint by should have been done or actually we did the work and you know just being able to come back to people in a reasonable time frame with an just closing off the the request that 's been made so the people part of it that I mean that 's the driver behind that Ranger increase in resources of face to face works we know face to face works better than technology frankly the technological part of it is it 's a it 's a Colombian clumsy and cumbersome process for staff and to be frank it you often gets forgotten because they have to close it out in two separate systems so I 'm not going to promise a you know a rapid increase in closing out our data what I am going to promise is we 're already thinking and starting about how quickly we can get those ranges out in the field so that our customer interaction improves dramatically yeah I think I think this point you know it 's been an irritant for me to sort of right from the get-go of smart snaps in solve is a function that returns to the to the customer but I think smart cities are looking at it whether that prey yeah I can 't_''_4911.19 I feel that the new system is on the way but it 's an IT driven project sorry and I don 't heavily yeah that 's calm okay and just you did mention about the three new Rangers yeah what have you got to cut a timeframe for when they might start at all rooted on cheese day no no they just air Brazil sometime next week and they hit where we 've already started the process of coordinating how they need to be equipped and we 're already starting the process of the recruitment and just the final question for me was and it was picking up on the point that was both made a committee and Vicky 's made is in terms of the whole labor force relevant to I guess it 's not I mean it 's maintenance but it 's also gardening and and and you know there 's a whole bunch of things I think that you 've raised at attract people into these different fields have have we got a kind of discrete work program happening around things like the apprenticeships and turn ships maybe scholarships to kind of you know and just do a bit of labor force planning around that our intention is to approach the LTP with options and for that we think that 's the appropriate way to address it workforce retention is challenging at the moment because of Christchurch 's construction environment it doesn 't mean we can 't improve it and that 's that 's really what we 're going to bring to the LTP for consideration right is it anything in the contracts that we have that requires sort of a number of internships or anything around the labor force or is it well we have quite a lot of requirements in the contract around skill base training development the reality has been for the contractors that with the relatively consistent movement of workforce particularly early on it 's a very difficult thing to achieve yeah thank you is um just thinking about what you were talking about in terms of volunteers how we can encourage our young people to sort of partner and get involved with for example sponsoring a park their local park or and doing something like then terms are they 're growing its sense of citizenship um I 'm not sure that 's the word we 're using at the moment that in terms of taking some responsibility and how we could how we could develop that yesterday we went to some of the heritage sites and Richie more got quite excited about the idea of young people taking some responsibility for heritage buildings and they 're in their community and I just think there 's a kind of a big picture thing that could happen here if we could get some kind of proceeds through community boards some sort of vehicle to engage young people in these things what do you can you see that working okay and the the three Rangers and the urban parks that we have now have had some success they 've only been they 've only existed for just over a year in working particularly with sports clubs they have a lot and working days and helping that 's that trying to encourage people to give up in a big chunk of their life and make it a hobby is quite challenging encouraging people to get there by incremental contribution is really successful and they 've had great success to date and we we 're going to develop a program where we can recruit for one of a better phrase even if it 's just three times a year like like the giant cleanups mmm that the impact of that is is enormous in terms of obviously what you achieve but the engagement that people have with their own spaces and places well I saw it there out at South Shore that day with the student volunteer army and other you know service groups coming out they did they did something like three months work and one morning yes not just the present the sheer numbers the other opportunity we have with young people is through our education team is you know they get great engagement through those education environmental education programs and you know it won 't be hard to explore 're going sorry just to finished it just wondering you know I used to have science pages and things like there that kids could earn I wonder if a program like that where kids could actually earn this sort of thing in become sort of you know junior ranger or something like that could be an idea sure I 'll take that up with tasting it 's good right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carry thank you very much Andrew very helpful the next one is the chilla message i don 't think anyone will be opposing this breath can I hand it over to you you 're moving it Sikandar by Andrew any discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried next one is the development Christchurch is next but um I don 't think oh well I 'd ask them to come at 12 so I do think there 'd be many issues this is kind of yeah so how 'd update so I just put it anyone 's got any questions that 's what we they come in later they 're coming in makeup people happy that we just wait till they come later what do you want to I can defer the paper until they come so okay yeah I come in at 12 case so we 'll deal with that it 's Republican stuff mixed ones the tea free alcohol ban and Rickerson and I 'll hand over to David East as the chair of Riga trip reports don 't thank you this is relatively straightforward we 've had a temporary ban and the liquid is an area for the races last year so it 's essentially a rollover while these things have been trolled and the intention would be that during 2018 that would be incorporated as a permanent provision so I 'm happy to move the recommendation let 's move by David a second divided Jimmy chin is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much City Council smoke-free 2025 action plan that 's come that 's been really successful actually because in terms of that the developments of what you know has been started with smoke-free day and has continued annually but councilors are record that um back in 2014 we many of you will we set up or ask for smoke-free conditions in here social housing and really the smoke-free action plan has developed since there and the the most recent work has been the voluntary smoke-free outdoor dining is in council living so might like to comment on that later because that 's been gone especially well in actually the day we and we had our meeting was smoke-free day and counsel attorney and council Livingston spoke at this on the Kiwi it was a good partnership with the Cancer Society in the smoke-free program so you 'd like to move there on reveal item clean seconded yep it 's only discussion hi Michael yes just following on from Phillip it was a good day in terms of the trial over smoke-free outdoor dining being released which over overwhelmingly demonstrated a success for business so I think that you know we can to business now that 's certainly overcome any initial fear that non smoking would be banned to a business of it that 's tremendous we talked about data before that 's more data to have it in terms of that I think it 's also important to know that crushes city is seen as taking a real lead on this so it 's having a domino effect on other councils around the country they are also following suit and we 're all working together towards arriving at a smoke-free 2025 I 'd said or goal which will be here probably before we you know pretty quickly the one thing which I think the action plan notes though it 's about providing a voluntary environment so not a regulatory I think that will definitely be a second option so it 's voluntary and in all this we 're not looking at it Bibles so I think that 's part of the power of it that we 've got this buying obviously throughout what who we are as council but also in the private sector there 's real momentum gathering over that and add Aaron yeah I just draw people 's attention to 0.5 there where the committee had requested staff to come back with considerations around a campaign to address cigarette butts in public places I don 't know for the rest of you but that certainly gets raised with me from time to time when people see cars stopped at traffic lights especially and people finish smoking and flick the cigarette butt out of window that makes its way into our water if you extrapolate out the percentage of people who smoke and the amount they have and they often drop their butts in public places that 's millions of cigarette butts per year going into our waterways and so if we can get a solution to that I think the rest of the world may start to copy us I think Singapore might have it really sewn up but that for me would be a big one if we can get towards people just thinking about it a bit more being more responsible with those cigarette butts a lot of businesses in the city already are I noticed with staff to smoke outside they have those tin boxes that you stub your thing out and put it in that 's where they put them in any places ourselves that I know of maybe we should and that could be a way forward we used to Mike and Andrew thanks I 'll just kind of follow up a little bit for Aaron Sachs I totally support this goal I think it 's really actually important but we look at the cigarette butt so I do a lot of regular walking around the city and actually one of the worst places that I see is I 'm around the hospital now obviously the hospital has banned smoking on the grounds that everyone is actually going onto the footpath outside the hospital grounds and put in all their cigarettes there and it 's just filling up the gutters and obviously ended in our waterways so I think we really need to look at what we 're doing to actually eliminate that type of a rubbish getting into wear into our waterways Andrew reference was made to the event sign of the Kiwi committee and it was a pleasure to be there I think it was particularly appropriate LED event happened on the eve of smoke-free day and that Phil 's committee had them the discussion that 's led to these resolutions on smoke-free day and certainly the partnership between community and Public Health District Health Board and the Cancer Society has been council has been a successful one is something that the Chad committee in the last term of council certainly was very proactive around and it 's great to see and Phil 's committee continuing that good work and further progressing that good work the key message from the event at the sign of the Kiwi was that at the start of the outdoor dining trial and there was certainly some that were claiming that outdoor or smoke-free areas would be bad for business exactly the opposite has turned out to be the case in fact there are some of the businesses that took part in that trial who have seen a reasonably significant uplift in business as a result of those outdoor areas been smoke-free so it 's good to I expect that this will be well supported today thank you all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much next one is the draft healthy food action plan that was also your committee thank you though so this has also been an incredible success really the whole healthy food movement and Christchurch and I think in Christchurch we 're very much right in front and championing this in particularly in working with the other organizations the other other community groups who have said well they 've led the way really and we 've supported them so like there 's been some great initiatives which are outlined in that report the the fruit that the fruit and veggie coops the support for them some which have been long-standing also though the healthy foods and schools lots of schools actually have those programs and the whole edible planting including on council end also though the one about focusing instead of focusing on having clean good pure drinking water and instead of the sugar drinks those initiatives the edible garden words that some committee boards have developed they might have kicked it off and and other boards have picked that up for lean the the other SP that 's not in the plan but I have referred to the staff is it at some stage I think the action plan might be able to develop a sort of strategic alignment with in fact focusing on some of the target groups who are most at risk for example obesity diseases and those sort of things however there is scope for some community groups and that there could be a petit to in for for say those ethnic groups to be included but this I think this potential development there at a happy to have other discussion yes you look I really support this that 's fantastic and I think that particularly the community gardens are I think a real basis for this you cannot force change on people so the community gardens actually become a magnet for activating communities and switching the concept of food and actually being part of that food that they eventually each they 're program it 's a social cohesion it 's all sort so I think that the community gardens are actually a real core of changing our attitudes to food and becoming a far healthier City and not just nutritionally but socially as well so it 's really good to see and I think I 'm really proud of this council for the work that we 're doing it if I may say the grassroots level because you know it 's that 's where it all starts and it 's it 's about people and this is the only way forward so fantastic yeah Mike and then yarny Dionne Thanks and I just want to touch on action 14 which was the edible garden awards which obviously the Papa Nui owners community board has been a leader and I think it 's actually a really really important award for the communities and what it 's doing is actually although we 're acknowledging residents that are actually doing eatable Gardens but it 's the school 's we get into and the preschools and we 're getting them to start off young and it four full life and it 's really encouraging to see that obviously the target us have all Ward 's doing this awards which I hope to see before that actual did deadline Jonnie um I think some of us may have had some people read this and then send us an email but one thing that that raised with me is that we haven 't actually engaged on this or consulted and I just wondered if people I mean obviously people have strong views and opinions and I just wondered whether there was any way in which we were going to consult or engage and whether we had any plans to go through each action and have a separate consultation or whether we just approve it I mean there 's a few things in here that I think people would probably want to provide some feedback on and I 'm not quite sure how they do that I think I mean what my view of is this is an action plan and all of the actions that involve the community are open to negotiation and consultation and engagement because they of the items on the agenda is community fridges well you bright and just started a give a little page you know I just brought it up I give a little page New Brighton community fridge and pantry was set up yesterday and closes on the 30th of July so feel free to go online and contribute it 's a non nonprofit organization that provides a place with people to donate food and other products for those in need the fridge and pantry is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. available blah blah this amazing project needs funding we are all in need of finances for the shed that the fridge and pantry will be in so I mean the point is is that it so these things aren 't going to happen because the council has put them on an action plan they 're going to happen when the council engages with those communities that have these initiatives and supports them right so the board 's given money to on yeah that 's fine for like for ones that the communities are doing but for ones that council house for example the future use of the tea ask we haven 't had any I think there 's a current use in there at the moment I doesn 't quite know where it 's got to and so is that going to have another report come to us with community views or is that exists is going to be today around how that gets used which one is that number 13 so you know that there are a few things in here um it says investigate the opportunity to utilize the old tea house so we put a temporary use in there so it will come back to Council yeah if you look at the measure of success its educational facilities are set up in the tea house yeah that would be a great gray house um well well them that 's fine all I 'm saying is that the community might have a view but they will have to be consulted okay so that 's called so they will be consulted on what 's proposed there yeah um and the other one I just we can probably cross think just just yesterday okay Tuesday so number 16 this is an action plan and and we 're doing a trial that what there 's what we signed off as part of the annual plan so um probably we can get a report back on there I thought we 'd agreed to do it for next year for the policy yeah yeah it 's a trial yeah as a trial it 's not so that 's that 's final decisions that 's all yeah we in debate or will we ask my question IIIi don 't know why this is switched on to questions that 's why but um have you maybe got a contribution to make to the debate oh yeah sure right so um you know that we do normally we do we do normally consult on our action plans and you know I just think we do need to be mindful that there will be alternative you it could be alternative years to some of the more contentious things in here but I 've heard that we will as those contentious things come to the fore there and you know I 'm happy to accept that and I mean I just think you know when you reflect on the huge marketing that goes into unhealthy food in our city and in our communities that actually looking at what we do through the whole event sponsorship use of public space for messaging and marketing I think is really important and certainly I think we 've still the work going on I think around the national policy statement around things like obesity and how we deal with that so I don 't know lose sight of the fact that there 's other things that are mentioned in here that can actually make a difference as well and particularly things like just district plan and and and land-use decisions so anyway I just commend staff for the work that they 've done on this I think this does give a good framework and I welcome the opportunity to have more detailed discussions as these projects go through and Dion and is it yeah oh sorry can I start Aaron is it yes all right oh god um I just wanted is an absolutely fantastic thing and I just wanted to sort of go back to when I was younger from Patty occur we had market gardens we looked after each other right growing up when mum was you know when we 're a little bit older mums working at the market gardens and supplied the people around the suburbs with food and fresh food and it just creates communities and I think it 's really good in that respect to actually start fostering creating communities and also there was there was one thing I was actually going to talk about but I think Yanni kind of got me off the track a little bit it was around and I 've lost it sorry um another mapping there we go I think that 's actually really really cool and I think one of the things that we should be thinking about further there is there 's already the mapping done by the residential red zone stuff from in the Sira days so there 's already an opportunity for people who do want to get involved in that stuff to to go and actually look at all of the fruit trees that were left behind from people 's backyards and things like that so this is already embedded into Christchurch 's philosophy and I think it 's really cool to sort of move this forward I also support this from the point of view of mental health I think in society we 're starting to see sugar actually may be more of a problem than smoking and I think the evidence is only just starting to come through and some of the research so when we start further going down the track around sugar and and how food affects mental health I think this start you know the steps that we 're going to take today and moving forward I think as a city we do need to lead because we do have big mental health issues in this country and in this city especially and I think it will start with good food and good communities and I think moving that way we do have long-term resilience so so I think you know from that perspective I 'll fully support listen it 's um yeah we keep preaching I think to to to the computer than many respects I think this is actually fantastic way to get full go forward and when I so pressure to computed it everybody jumps in because they believe in and that 's right but there are so many areas where we must know keep going to those fast foods they keep going to the bad stuff you go to school fears for instance the staple at a school fear a chips and candy floss and I just wanted it 's a it 's a 360 degree approach from our organization which is wonderful one of the groups that is leading it in one of these areas as their events team where they are leading healthy food and events because if you have an event generally you want the turnover etc so hopefully through that that 's going to start opening the eyes of some of those school fears some of the private operators and supported with their staff that are driving those Celsus they 'll see that this body as a leader in this and thank you to the staff that are leading this year 's okay and Erin yeah I was dubious of this to start with because I was scared it was all going to be about the stick but it 's more about the carrot excuse the pun this is our healthy food policy not our unhealthy food policy and so this is about showing the way and good food leadership within the community and I have an issue being on the health board as well around obesity and in some of the issues that face a huge portion of our population excuse the pun again around that and it is because New Zealanders and most of the Western world of food illiterate they don 't understand what they 're eating and they make so many bad choices and if we were as good at our food as we are at our meth we would be a lot healthier as a nation and it needs to go right back to the education system this draft policy as it was before it went to the committee and then it come through the committee the second most phone calls I 've had in this term behind an intersection and here with Road and it was around some of the things that run here the food fridge people got excited about that and thought it sounded kind of really cool and weird at the same time until you explain this when you grow food at your own property or in a community garden you always have an excess of certain things at a certain time for javis being the big one and what happens is you can 't_''_6473.89 eat all the food you have and to just take it down put it in a box and set it at the local food pantry and then see it disappear when you drive past or bike paths later that day is a really cool thing because it 's just not going to waste and we waste a huge amount of food in this country and to just share a little more around into the concept of kids where I grew up in and whilst in a waster have in their own minds a map of the fruit 'm just going to say that was in the public domain technically and you would pick it and take it and we 're going to now encourage that and see more of it and parks and things encourage kids to come along and just brighten eyes themselves on fresh fruit or vegetables in a pack how cool is that that 's a great thing in a great city to live in so I applaud this and thank you to all those involved NJ I 'm really encouraged by this it brings together a number of conversations that have been going on for some time and certainly work that 's been going on in some communities for some time as well in Littleton we 've had a very successful community garden for many years we 've got the plenty to share table that sits on London Street and little somewhere people do take along the kind of excess that Aaron was just referring to from their own gardens and also from the community garden so I 'm particularly encouraged by the content of Klaus and 5.9 actions include increase the number presents an opportunity for education education around healthy food choices and of course there is plenty of education about poor food choices in the sort of advertising that promotes food that are often providers of gratuitous sugar and get you gratuitous fat that lead to preferred choices also community garden leads to education around gardening planting the seasons the way of nature in some ways a Back to the Future approach this is the way that things were done in communities in the past I 'd like to think that it 's the way that things will be done at the local level in the future as well so whether planting on public land ends up with a situation we 've got where we 've got fennel along the footpaths or potatoes at the park or Rockets at the roundabout or beet roots in the berms who knows but it 's certainly a good initiative and I think it 's one that 'll lead to some good educational and community health outcomes as well so really pleased to see it well on self-involved a degree of community engagement because it entirely with what Aaron said is that it takes a proactive leadership role but it requires engagement to make it make it happen at a community level so on that note I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried yes and then thank you to staff for their efforts in that regard so I 'm just I 'm just waiting for something out can I just go to the presumably it 's not going to take a long time if the conservation consent for 53 Gloucester Street and the Heritage incentive grant if they 're going to take a long time because if they are then oh I 'll move for two I would have thought they 'd be straightforward both of them okay um right um all right well I 'll move to item 20 though well um you 'll see it 's really the recommendation to council as for a conservation covenant a lot of work has been the building it 's called mildenhall on Gloucester Street right we haven 't seen it anyway it 's around making post to earthquake that in fact that that is done in conjunction with the with the Heritage requirements it 's particularly work on the chimneys which collapsed in the fireplaces which have to all be removed but retaining that the Heritage fabric so you 'd like to move that I 'll move it do I have a seconder bloom any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all right those opposed say no that 's carried I 've just wondering whether we should we should start this next one I 'm just waiting for something to come down so I 'm sorry so we 'll move on to the Duncans building heritage incentive grant Phil can I hand back to you yes well and thus these buildings are well known to Moyle known like the Duncans building in High Street which had become the issue has come before this council before but basically you might remember this eight commercial units all in a row in the aim with this heritage grant which is for three hundred sixty two thousand and six hundred I think was remember that previously they 've been trees growing along here there 's been some debate about this part of High Street but these are the buildings the total work is over seven hundred thousand dollars in the grant application is 360 mm I say so the committee recommended that council support it and there might be some other discussion around it though right and so you 'd like to move it on mover and seconder by mic so questions kind of wanted to check that I think staff are here so I mean basically the government has set up a Heritage grant for this exact sort of thing and we don 't seem to be getting but had a great one and category to your historic places on the New Zealand Heritage List yet are of national significance right that 's what you 've seen through yeah so this building is registered as category two by Heritage New Zealand but is this is it author is it a nationally significant heritage building yeah not a good yeah hey grouped oh no no no no but it says it only is sorry I 've only just received this so why don 't we have a a an additional recommendation that we investigate that we investigate the problem disengage the applicability of the heritage equip thank you of the heritage equip program which is heritage earthquake upgrade incentive program vista gate this is it 's all capitals for a clip because it 's short for yeah investigate no uip yeah and so that quiz stuff investigate take out the word of the heritage equipped well they loop instead of program because it 's what the P stands for can you change that to an initiative in in weather and be that any funding for this project would be able to be fine yeah or whether any funding whether this project would qualify for any funding this again is that right yeah I mean basically um the issue with these grants is that they actually require match funding as well it 's from and they even make reference to local already much funding yeah so being done come to that just in that we 're just adding a line on there council yah which was announced by the Minister following the November 2016 earthquakes it 's for nationally significant buildings that are privately owned at our earthquake prone and whether they fit on the Historic Places list category 1 and category 2 and medium and high risk areas so I don 't we don 't know whether the the buildings qualify or whether so we 've just put in here request staff investigate the initiative and whether this project would qualify for funding the thing would be equipped from funding scheme is yes it 's national it 's meant for high status buildings it 's also meant for those buildings that are not damaged it 's a proactive scheme to take buildings out of earthquake prone status right oh we 're dealing with with buildings that have already been damaged and and our earthquake prone for either damage reasons or or for the same same reasons as possibly with a not said they wouldn 't qualify so that 's all we 're asking you they might but the other factors to bear in mind obviously there are two I think there are two yeah and they may not work with the timeframes that that are currently underway for this set of buildings the owner of these buildings has already kicked off and started some of the work whether or not they they believe that they 've got a chance that there 's nothing stopping them applying for that fund but what what the fund administrators might say to them is that you 're not actually you 're not earthquake strengthening this building what you 're doing is you 're demolishing everything except the facade retaining the facade and then tying a whole new building onto the back of it of that facade so in effect you 're you 're not actually upgrading a building you 're building a new building with the facade of the old building hmm which you you you use the new building to tie on to so I will leave it we 'll leave it like a new surprise of it qualified based yeah I wouldn 't be surprised to hit and read what Yanni sent through but um yeah I don 't know for sure that 's not 've we 've recommended people applied for that fund right yes we definitely we know we know about it and there may be other buildings which are more suitable for it where you 've got a bit more time and a bit more ability to save the entire building yeah okay it 's good all right so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you good right now we will move to item 22 and I 'd like to invite and Ron Clements to come to the front I 'd like to invite you to speak to the paper even though it 's been to a committee I think under the circumstances that would be appropriate to invite you to say a few words well thank you very much it 's a privilege to be here today to talk to this item it 's a lot of people behind the item obviously and in particular we have Laurie Metcalf wife Lena his sister Allison and one of his daughters Victoria lives with us today we have sue Malloy who was a very important person in the Botanic Gardens look to us looks after our botanical records and the committee has studied this recommendation that 's come to the council I just wanted to provide you a little bit more information about the item that some of the councillors might not be aware of it takes it takes many people over many years to to create successful effective attractive council facilities Botanic Gardens is no exception the Botanic Gardens has been in existence now for a cross over 150 years and there been many noble people hard working people on the staff as well as counselors as well as volunteers who 've contributed to making what it is today so without trying to detract from anything that those many many people have contributed I just like to talk about two people briefly who really excelled in their contributions to to making it what it is today one of them of course is Laurie Metcalf and we 're here to talk about York here to consider naming the herbarium in the Botanic Gardens the Laurie Metcalf precedent for a staff member 's name being used to attach it to a part of the botanic gardens and that is John Francis Armstrong one of the very earliest long-standing curators he did a fantastic job of looking after both introduced plants as well as native plants and his name was recommended to council in 1961 that 's the front lawn of the Botanic Gardens be named the Armstrong law and the person making that recommendation in 1961 was LJ Metcalf Laurie Metcalf who whose name we 're actually wanting to attach to the herbarium today so there 's a nice circularity there if you like and and up an important precedent just in case just in case you 're worried about putting a name on something in the botanical if I 'm more important I 'm putting money into a botanical eventually serving for over 20 years and creating the place and thank you well I 'd like to begin by acknowledging well acknowledging everyone that 's been involved in the Botanic Gardens over many years it 's just the jewel in the crown really as far as its existence means that we can be New Zealand 's Garden City without the Botanic Gardens we could not be New Zealand 's Garden City it wouldn 't it wouldn 't meet the criteria so it 's very much a part of our identity and who we are so I want to acknowledge you John and and and the team the whole team and I do acknowledge the precedent-setting nature of the decision back in 1961 and and and it was fitting that we honor Laurie Metcalf for his contribution and this way and it was interesting I turned on the radio this morning and heard there Allen herbarium being mentioned which is at Lincoln and and I thought you know again it was just it is appropriate that we name these places for people whose contribution as exceptional I want to acknowledge the family as well I haven 't_''_7439.719 met the family but I will do soon and lino Metcalf Victoria Metcalf and and Ellison I you know thank you for being here and and being a part of the special occasion and I hope that I you get and you know how much we 're all expressing our appreciation for what he has done for the city so I have a I have a sort of a biography and I do want to read it out because I do want to place on record this extraordinary contribution and then I 'll invite other councillors to say a few words so Laurie Metcalf was born in Christchurch in 1928 when he was at primary school he was given six native tree seedlings by Lance McCaskill McCaskill at the time was a lecturer an agriculture and biology at Christchurch Teachers Training College through his encouragement and enthusiasm to grow New Zealand native plants Laurie chose horticulture as his profession during the 1940s Laurie spent three years as a horticultural trainee with the Christchurch domains board at that time the domains board managed the Botanic Gardens in Hagley Park it was during this time Laurie collected possibly his earliest plant specimens to drive press and mount onto herbarium card these were collected in 1946 from rigaton bush and included the mighty Totoro and cabbage tree laurie was just 18 years of the herbarium on a growth path which at the time possibly amounted to no more than a hundred specimens in the late 1940s Laurie left Christchurch for New Plymouth where he worked for one year with New Zealand 's largest plant nursery Duncan and Davies Laurie then left New Zealand and worked another year in the Melbourne and Adelaide Botanic Gardens from there Laurie went to the UK where he apparently wanted to work for the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew however upon seeing them he felt they weren 't up to the standard of a botanic and he then found work with the famous now I 'm going to say this wrong I think that in existence Hardy plant nursery in Sussex who specialized in Alpine plants he stayed there twelve months after which he spent a short time working at one of the most famous nurseries in the UK if not the world Kaleo nurseries he then went on to be a gardener at Winfield place and Berkshire this was where the famous British educator florist and author constant spray together with rosemary Hume we 're running a domestic 1955 to take up the position of assistant curator of the Christchurch Botanic Gardens until approximately 1967 in 1968 through a restructure the position became assistant director Christchurch Botanic Gardens which he held until 1977 during these 22 years Lori made a significant contribution to the development and management of particularly the Botanic Gardens his vision skills and determination focused on establishing the gardens on a more scientific and educational footing for the benefit of all users they included the general public and botanical horticultural professionals and students Laurie initiated a sweeping program to improve the gardens plant collections including their documentation and labeling also included and thus was a sustained effort to build up reference specimens in the herbarium Laurie lodged at least 1789 new specimens of both wild and cultivated plants from throughout New Zealand and New Caledonia where he spent one month in 1961 staff fond that fondly remember Laurie drying specimens and endless plant presses suspended from the bars of cold frames by the end of the 1970s Laurie had contributed to over half of all the specimens and the herbarium with this unique collection of of the New Zealand national hobart herbarium network and bears the official abbreviation CH BG this registration was probably another lorry inspired effort in 1977 lorry moved to Amber Cargill to take the position of Director of Parks and Recreation for the embark Argyll City Council in addition to all of us lorry is a well-known and highly respected author of numerous botanical and horticultural books he began writing around 1960 today his publications include writing about New Zealand plants and cultivation propagation and photographic guides on New Zealand plants the International Register of cultivars and contributing to the gardens centennial Book of 1963 Laurie had an enormous willingness to share his knowledge and experience with those working with them including teaching training sessions and field trips in terms of the awards Laurie was an outstanding horticultural student for this he was awarded a number of horticultural prizes medals cups and accolades in 1957 the first recipient of the David Tennant Memorial Prize from the Royal New Zealand Institute of horticulture the gaining the highest marks in New Zealand an oral and practical stage-three examination for the National Diploma in Royal New Zealand Institute of horticulture in 1959 the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horta horticulture cocain gold medal for the most successful candidate to complete the National Diploma of horticulture this included his thesis on New Zealand Alpine plants in 1978 the Lauder cup for his contribution to the protection and cultivation of New Zealand flora and 1988 award of the associate of honour NZ with the Royal New Zealand Institute of horticulture and 1991 the prestigious Gold Beach memorial medal by the Royal Horticultural Society UK is one of the few New Zealanders to do so and in 2010 appointed a companion of the Queen 's service order for services to horticulture and conservation so on that note I 'd like to move the adoption of the report and the approval of the Christchurch Botanic Gardens herbarium to be named the Laurie Metcalf herbarium seconded by Phil Clearwater and I 'd like to invite Phil speak well I 'm I was actually really privileged was in Vacaville that I remember meeting Laurie Metcalf and he was famous then and did huge amount for the Invercargill gardens but and he finished as and had a long illustrious career which is really stunning in terms of the academic work he did but also in and just the practical contribution he made to our Christchurch Botanic Gardens and I think we often take our Botanic Gardens are granted but in fact there 's a huge amount of horticultural science and research has gone and work and buy and the team that Laurie met because the other thing I wanted to say is that I not so long ago yes I mean who had been one of Laurie 's apprentices Laurie he had appointed him and he he really was enthused about the huge work that was done many years ago well he was a good number of apprentices and he said that Laurie was a great boss to have and I see John not in here too and and particularly in the way he instructed the young apprentices and guided them and I would I guess at this stage for us as a council to in the whole concept of developing apprenticeships in the Botanic Gardens and we 've made a is also sort of part of Laurie 's legacy because um yeah I just think it 's very fitting for a wonderful mean Thank You Danny well a lot has been said already so but I just think it is really important to acknowledge that one of the reasons I think Chrysler just such a special place as the special people that have contributed to making it so and I think we 've got a perfect example of someone who has really done so much to to support our city and particularly the Botanic Gardens which is really fantastic that we can in a very small way acknowledge significantly his contribution and I think it raises the whole question as has been discussed around education and the importance of involving young people and children and in our environment and also right through to training on going through apprenticeships and internships scholarships possibly so I think you know it 's a wonderful way in which we can recognize someone who was a very special person with a special name to what is a really significant asset to our city and I do this today I 'm very supportive of it and just wanted to place on record the appreciation to the family that we have for this this for Laurie and the work that he 's done thank you could we just add that he set the benchmark really high John all right welcome on that note I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and I think we should acknowledge now we 're going to a June for morning tea and we 'll invite the family to come and join us reconvene at 12 o 'clock yeah you to the PX position and we could deal with Rob last and then the first item on P X as well so and that would be a good thing so I 'm prepping on I 'll move to the taylors mistake pictures working party which I think Vicki wants to cheer oh sorry sorry sorry that was a it was a mistake there was a there wasn 't a tailor 's mistake that was a black mistake for right we put a proposal in front of us that the working party be established comprising counselor Templeton as chair deputy mayor tuner counselor east and councillor Johansson now counsel the East might be surprised to find an idea because he wasn 't he wasn 't involved I really did want to be part of this having been part of the earlier working party so I 'm happy with it yeah but it was in particular because of your role as the chair of the relevant committee so yeah thank you thank you for generously accepting something that you were nominated to in your absence all right so um would someone like to move this for a start Vicki in seeking to find chummy chin you couldn 't get further away from the issue okay so um are there any questions any just written Jannik how are we communicating to the batch owners about what we 're doing and what 's going on there so what will be the communication that goes out to batch owners after this working groups re-established into the water community this was put on hold issues around the earthquake and things and so this is the first time it 's come back but now here correct and the district plan now we 've got a blows together we 'll look at putting a common strategy around we move this whole thing forward we really bring it up to you just to say look are you happy that we restart the process so the next one of the first things will be a common strategy around exactly what we were intending to do great Andrew just a very simple question the resolution from the 11th of December 2014 specifically talks about taylors mistake Boulder Bay and Mari Gardens I 'm correct in expecting that the new working party will deal with taylors mistake Boulder Bay and Mari gardens and I thank you yep it 's what ie sees yep cool so it 's been moved and seconded any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they no that 's carried okay thank you the next item is the remuneration Authority local government review consultation document Joe Daly will join and tough Joe do you want to give us a deluxe neck shot of the two-stage process that the remuneration authority is going through I 'm sure you would have all got the paper and it 's an attachment to the report the remuneration Authority have put out some proposals for local government and this what we 're addressing today is part two of the document which is the short term implications relating to the determination for that upcoming year and we 've provided that feedback the longer term implications which is in part three of the document relate to more directly to remuneration to sizing of roles to also how remuneration and decided whether they decide or the council decides itself there 's reference to targeted rates with regard to community boards so at the moment staff are working through that part three just with some summaries on those and then we 'll engage in seek feedback from counselors and community board members before put on some information together with regard to that one and to be submitted to the remuneration Authority by the 20th of October so we committee or submissions because of the time frame so we have to have the Sun that 's right and so the document was sent to all elected members requesting feedback on part 2 and a reminder sent and so the information that 's in the submission has been put together with the feedback received and also council processes with regard to the medes that are in there okay so questions first or do I go okay yeah yeah yep Sarah I think you 're on page 246 of the agenda which is page 2 of our feedback we 've got a comment here that 's about parental leave is one of the reasons and I 'd quite like us to be able to be a bit stronger on that one hmm so it says Countess of Iran Council notes a query raised yet with a parental leave may be a reason for a leave of absence and when sicknesses and you know illnesses amongst our then I think that it would make sense to have parental leave as well I know Palmerston North and recently deserted accounts Lihue and has get some leave as she has a baby we have a are dead to be around the table as well and in any other employment sort of situation you get you know after six months you do get your entitlements and so I 'd like I set you to say that we think that this should be part of and the reasons for absence rather than just noting a query doesn 't really question sorry can we do that if that 's what the council would like we can strengthen that sentence to say that the council is supportive of this being one of those provisions yep so are you suggesting that should a woman have a baby they would be able to be absent from the council a role for six months and an entirety and not be able to return a teemed like the odd council meet something like that it would be another pervert provisions I mean it wasn 't something that was specifically asked about by the renumeration authority that has been raised and it wouldn 't just be a mother it 'd be either parent day but not in that 's it but so it 's one of the that 's why it has to be done at an age or enumeration authority type level because we 're not employees because we 're not covered by the other stuff it has to be covered by something else so I think that we should get them to look at that and support it um if if you are ill with your partner that 's all you 're allowed you 're able to through the through the current system but not not if you 're having a baby and if you 've got a three year term or a six year term you know six years of you if your own counsel for the sex using and we 're all for having diversity around the table we want you know the average age of elected members is quite audibly want younger people around the table we have to be able to allow them to also you know do the other things that couples do have you know then families if they choose during that time um Tim table I totally agree but it 's a complicated by a number of things isn 't it I mean because with a normal 40 hour week job you can 't just turn up for the odd meeting whereas this you could probably work around it and the other thing is you 've stood for public office to receive public funds to represent so would that be with full pay the documents clear that it 's without pay yes oh yeah well and I mean my thing you know the other change never the trees yeah no it 's not so represent much about the money but but but the trouble that behave now and I 've got a very clear recollection of a situation that occurred we know counselor was was absent perfectly justifiably I mean a terrible condition that she so she needed time for an operation etc etc so but it was a it was a ward that only had one representative and and the the community including the community board felt that the council hadn 't provided it with any other councilor to replace and we 're from a citywide point of view we would want to think about how that kind of you know support could be offered to the community that 's not really been represented for a six months that is one of the reasons that the local government Commission generally don 't like single council Awards because if something happens to a counselor the waters need with a big presentation always look that 's right well hopefully yeah that 's right but I think that it 's not about that City thing it 's about the you know the rights of working in a woman and if you choose is a younger person maybe under 40 along as the elected members kind of young young elected members to be elected you maybe get into a relationship after that choose to have a family you shouldn 't be disadvantaged because you have chosen to serve your community while Christ church and in Christ accounts that we get page well for the you know we work long hours we get paid well you know look at her in a way they get their 19,000 on other councils are not like us most District Council 's are part-time and not paid ridiculous and being able to have time at home with your family in the first six months of your baby 's life with you other dead or the mum we all know the research sees is actually absolutely essential and we should be supporting that currently up don 't we don 't agree with I 'm just saying that we also have to take into account the needs of the community that son represented for six months yes that 's all I 'm seeing yeah absolutely okay no I 'm saying yes but you have to and when we get that representation review and we go to at large within community board areas that would be awesome I still don 't see I mean as a mother myself within six months you could still be a functioning counselor it 's more you know I but it is a representation issue so if you enabled someone to just step out for six months we we 're not this is not a normal job now that main there for six months that 's a considerable amount of time so we need to manage it somehow I mean I agree with your principle but this is not a normal job where you could get someone to step in for you and pick up the funeral you know I think I actually think that it 's something that the council has to take responsibility for because I totally agree with Sarah that you 've got to have flexibility and the arrangements otherwise you will not attract diversity around the table you know that 's you know that 's that 's my very strong view on that but you know I mean people are entitled to their own views Aaron look I do sympathize with the single councilor Ward situation that 's been raised can we not have something in our claws that if you if you do need to take time out for any reason that someone could be away for a considerable amount of time that someone else from the board can be nominated to step in for that amount of time and be paid for it with the sensible way to go they 've been elected and not just be stepping in for three months six month at you they 're working with it not not paid for but so but but it could be seen to be a wider obligation belonging to the council so the council might want to split it over a period of time what was brought to my attention around the bank 's lunch hour one is that people actually felt they 've been abandoned by the council not the not the ward councillor because it was not her you know sort of initiative it was completely you know but they really felt that there nothing had been done to actually make up for it and they saw that as a council responsibility so I 'd be reluctant to make it a community board responsibility I 'm just saying that going down this track we would have to say that we would see the obligation sitting with the whole council to provide you know a go to person and each of the wards over that period of time and it might be one person for six weeks it 's one person for ya Glen oh I support the general move with this given that the effects could be work with any one of us around the table I know as a dad you know every child you know is unpredictable from day one so it could be that you need to be there your partner for several weeks on end with its physical mental health issues whatever so yeah I think we need to provide for this and and I 'd like to support our colleagues and colleague one of whom we met the other day at the joint councils meeting from hurinui so yeah I think it 's important we really get behind yep so people would generally happy with the with the recommendations no no um yeah yeah well then maybe if you just get the sign off on it too so me and and you yeah so just just to be confirmed the final sign-off will come from the mayor and counselor temperature Yanni um I thought I saw some feedback coming about superannuation and ACC did you receive about that I kept and I think as I went back in the email to counselors and community board members seeking feedback was um or the report might reference at sorry and that feedback related to matters that weren 't the the short-term questions has have been put aside for them to be included and that longer-term feedback this feedbacks directly related to the the points that were raised by the remuneration authority and number two yeah I mean I understand it would be good for them to think about that sooner rather than later I 'll make reference to their and the correspondence that goes back to them I think they 'll agree with it useful yeah all right Thanks okay so um so do I have a mover and a seconder for this Sierra Mike I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's scary so a point of directors to transition Holdings Limited we had we made appointments of council directors also it 's on it 's on the second the second agenda and yeah we we appointed the will approve the extension of the term of appointment of the deputy mayor and councillors Scandrick as directors to the 31st of December or the AGM whichever occurs first moved by Jamie seconded by Becky I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no that 's carried next one is councillor director fees crusher City Holdings Limited this is not the paper that is going to deal with the whole question of directors fees its Christchurch City Holdings pay the directors fees as a single payment on direction and last time it was split between Imagination Station and the me as Welfare Fund and we 're simply asking that that occurs again this year and for the year ended 30th of June 2017 to direct CCH old to do that and that we will consider and July the whole policy question David I was to speak against them this motion and I just want to raise three points and hope some of them may be dealt with well we need a mover and a seconder before you speak so oh okay I 'm well don 't see why not yeah okay move by ref seconded by sarah but could you just advise on that ginger i was relatively like relaxed about that assuming that the the council was agreeing with the proposal and the factors it 's just way too technical report and effect just validating the payment before the 30th of June this year as yeah as it was last year the major issues that I think that you have are going to have how when you deal with the July July paper you see that 's true okay but jamie has a question so before we get your debate okay yes so it is really a process quite literally the process question with us just wondering obviously last year or whenever it was odd signal that may be equivalent of our fees would go to Imagination Station that 's fine but I 'm just wondering is it appropriate that we 're doing this right now in that July paper hasn 't come I don 't have an issue with where this is going but I 'm talking about like cart horse rotate the CC HL meeting where this was discussed they need a direction before the 30th of June we 're not considering the paper until July this is for the financial year been and gone this is for the all-important idea yeah mate show you yeah it makes sure it as opposed to the upcoming what doesn 't make any to drive it 's got nothing to do with the fight the decision that will be made and just thank you for clearing it up it is thing it is the currents the current board yeah right so I 'll open up for debate all that explanation I think I might hold my comments toward July barriner no that 's fine okay I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed they no knows that 's carried and opposed David East and Dion slugs and Aaron killer from so um here that brings us now to development Christchurch so that 's item and he was told to be here at twelve o 'clock and how 's that so this is item number fourteen their update piece of papers circulated to us and and maybe you 'd like to start with that Rob yeah and I look thank you and I personally just like to thank you all for your approval on the Tuesday which reinforces councils commitment to New Brighton and end of the East just does by way of update hot saltwater pools project phase one a not just circulated to handout that 's information that 's been released the day-to-day so right now is asking for feedback from the community for the part play area we intend phase one be that the hot pools and September October to go out for public feedback and just to remind that within the cost that were approved there 's a million dollars towards the surface up we 've had an acknowledgement and agreement with them now to look to relocate to fit in with the with the planning of the shore development the money also provides for some coastal mitigation measures meeting in front of that facility the intention will be to bring the project costs and under budget if we can so I just wanted exciting is this weekend in New Brighton DCL will have a stall at the market and be the first of four of the next coming weeks to talk about to further engage with the community around around these works and at ten o 'clock and the New Brighton hub will also be the opening of imagination station which has had some funding from DCL as well which would be a great contribution to the community there interesting we 're starting to see some activity around some of the local business there 's a lot of work going on behind the scenes which has which will be you 'll be able to update and some point in the future they 're good um Aaron um yeah thanks for this so I did have one question around security at night times because this is quite amazing obviously it 's not going to be fenced off and but I will make a comment first I think this is stunning I think for New Brighton this is a game changer this will make people drive across the city and in fact we should have brochure even though it 's a free place that 's not a place you pay to get in to encourage people that are staying at one of the campgrounds or motels or hotels to go there with their children because this is at that level it 's just a bonus that it 's free to get it you know people pay to go to something that 's good this is amazing and it should be celebrated and this will be a game-changer for New Brighton I do believe you actually consider opening your own motel block across the road because you would get bookings when people saw that you know stay in this I couldn 't speak to later about that thing yeah yeah I would seriously consider it myself it 's actually that good so thank you so much David thank you a lot just to endorse Aaron 's comments and compliment DCL for a fine piece of work that I think will certainly put New Brighton on the map again and we could have this brochure at our board meeting the other day rather than the only sort picture of the whale and the and the Pooh and I thought we were going to change that I have a bee that is mode and sure we 'll get that amended and then the second page the way it was there but he 's around the wrong way from where he was so we just hope that he 's not going to be too disorientated than the new conflicts but that so yes I think abroad could discuss this last weekend earlier in the week I should say and you know a unanimous support for what we 're trying to achieve so brother I don 't know is it quite unanimous Tim bacon may have gone the other way yep mine thank you oh yeah this this is what you brought it needs I totally agree and support this the whole way along in the editorial today there was a comment about the mayor Graham a he has done wonderful things for the city center and the reason for that is because it is a free X 's playground and it 's bringing people in and this is what people to new bright and so I 'm really looking forward to this finger okay Jonnie yeah thank you um thank you to get the planet probably would have been good to have this as part of the draft annual plan so that the people that came and we could have shown them what we 'd already agreed to but appreciate that you 've been working hard on this just one of the things I really like about it as you talked about this is based on our ideas are your ideas and from listening to the children of New Brighton and I just wanted to ask whether you 've considered them whether it 's possible or how it 's possible that you could involve the children in the construction of it and I just give you a reference to the Masterton kids own playground which you know I think it cost about quarter of a million dollars huge amount of volunteer effort and end charity contributions and I just thought wouldn 't it be wonderful to do something similar here and you talked about saving money so obviously there it 's next week or the week after we 've got the team are going to be at out an early primary school discussing the the designs with them so looking for feedback so that that 's as far as we thought at this point on but in terms of like the contract to build it all the way in which it 's built is it possible to get some thinking around community contribution and I mean I don 't know if you 're aware of the Masterton one but you know this huge huge community by into that and it seemed to be really successful and I will give it some consideration research this series clubs and the student volunteer army and places like that to you know and if you may well actually be able to bring the price down while building the community contribution you know um Jimmy and Tom we got into the consultation in the in gates when the process I just want to know although this is the New Brighton Beach beachside playground facility in New Brighton area but a consultation my view you or budget so I 'm not sure this one weather is a failure to a council website or not I think the intention is the way this is rather than the more traditional consultation because we 've done quite a bit of consultation around your bottom already so this is more about seeking simply feedback from the community so we don 't intend this to be a long process because some of the feedback we 've had today has been about getting on excessive consultation so this is around just direct giving feedback into the design dude there will be on the 23rd of July in the right do they say what the rotation due date is very date yeah yeah yeah so still have long one month to go yes yeah weather is open to the whole city yeah it 's going to be on the council website so other people will be able to contribute that we 're trying to keep it okay thank you I 've got Tim Phil Dion clean thank you Robert everyone see this as if she outstanding please pass on it thanks to though as is there an age limit I 'm just thinking in a selfish though thank you rob this is very exciting and very pleased of course if there are going to coastal mitigation features of course I just want to in terms of the engagement part which we need to keep simple is it a way of making sure that the schoolchildren are involved with some of us as well yes so as I said before we 're going directly into how to know your primary school that 's already being Muslims they cannot know a primary school okay pus-y other junior junior department yeah yeah and we 'll also have some stuff at the hub on Saturday for the opening of imagination station which would expect until you two of some of the other coastal schools like roughly zero fees on PC and South price and Sylvia if they could put a rough eating in South okay Molly could be included have a look at it right yeah thanks Rob um Dion so when is the some winners the construction there sorry when does the start of the prior to this Christmas well really seriously yep and in what if it 's not another larger Christmas so it 's saying we have to buy me some something nicely so but when you actually looking to start in summer so this is just to be clear this is just phase one I so we 're going through the design getting the feedback over the next month we 'll complete design we have we 're parsh a fair way through the procurement of the various services we 've identified the equipment providers so we 've been running a number of processes and parallel to get this up and running as quickly as we can the idea is for the summer to be oh that 's pretty good it would be awesome right um Glenn and then Yanni thank you and I notice you 've got the same team on board just a good comfort for Dion they that built the mounted bike park so I know things will be done a good speed how about the time frame for the hot salt water poses that still just connect it up year yes so will be some of the contracts will be run in parallel we looking to go out for the the public consultation September October then to complete the design by the end of this year the the uncertainty is just around that you know the normal process of consent in which we just need to ensure we sort out working also alongside John for sales team as the ultimate asset owners but but we you know we 're looking to you to move it as quickly as we can once the first boat goes on the ground it 's going to be really significant for the people once they see that they 'll start to believe in it yeah that 's right yeah huge um yeah Darren just don 't underestimate the confidence boost that this will go on it 's going to be awesome so a Yanni and in Sarah so just obviously we 've focused on New Brighton which is great but there 's some other things that details doings Oh Sarah wish it was New Brighton or okay well I 'll take you first if just on this I mean I just wonder whether we can involve schools from other parts of Christchurch because we hid the message from you writing through the submissions that isn 't that 's not really an issue of the people that live there they want other people from other sides of the city to see how great the Brighton is so I just wondered if that they 've had a lot of consultation already this is the final a feedback loop I know I know but they 've got a month and there are three schools that I would target in that area well actually four because I throw in some James as well and I mean I just yeah and you 're Brian Catholic as well so said that just the five the five schools if you start to go out wider than that you 'll be more than a month know that so we did it so like with the massive it 's gonna be get online 2300 always want to take the initiative then fine but you know I mean don 't don 't don 't but I 'm but I just think like if you looked at the must and I 'm not saying that you 'll do the same but they had 2300 volunteers and they build it over six days and they get huge community buy-in and I just you know if there 's a way in which there can be some wider engagement with the community across the city as it gets constructed or I just think of CLE relief I think there will be components of it and around it that will be capable of being embraced in that way so my point was exactly Yanni 's actually because if you want to end with being this is being played the whole the whole thing of this has being plugged as a citywide SH the entire time and while we don 't need to each individually visit every school in Christchurch we do need to make people aware we need to put it in the libraries that kind of stuff like we do with any normal council consultation doesn 't take more than a month we still do our consultations in engage the rest of the city and get them excited about going to Brighton the summer then we need to do it at this point when they 're looking at the playground and giving feedback on it is kids my point I 'm not disagreeing with their what Rob was talking about was particularly targeting a visit to you we were just making sure that I 'm saying that not beyond the school in an immediate area because we don 't want to tie them down but I think that the headline you know that I 'm hearing from us is that DCL expect us to be open by Christmas that 's going to be a fantastic boost for the people of Christchurch yeah in this one in you 're talking about this Christmas yeah that 's the that that is why I 'm here alone today because the team are back there ensuring that we had that was either this Christmas present ever I could say the Beast yeah all right now Jana you had some other questions just wondering if you can give any update on just where yeah but doing do we want to discuss it in ours because part of our report some PPX yeah no we can we can leave it to Dean I think that the what yonni no no what what what Jonnie was keen to heaven the and the public arena i guess was the the fact that DCL are able to work collaboratively with the community boards over the what was the word that we used in the resolution the other day to make sure that they 'll fit for purpose there was a not a real agent realignment ree-ree we collaborate no not recalibrate yeah yeah recalibration of the suburban master plans so it just to just to have an indication that DCL can work collaboratively directly with the community boards over that recalibration prices you 're only working alongside council staff with that as well and and also we could collectively with staff and ourselves with regenerate christchurch yeah and i see i think that in terms of because of all the work that you 're doing a new brighton that there 's a very close working relationship with Kurt Linwood ferry made our reaching out for a similar engagement yeah understood good great right oh well um so now do I have a mover and a seconder that comes from your committee ref seconded by David I 'll take it under the circumstances um I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and now I removed that we exclude the public for all of the reasons set out on the agenda allowing the following people to remain Rob Hall from development Christchurch for item 37 pool Monroe and Lea scales from Kashyap sitting audience for item 39 Paul Monroe and Lea scales Malcolm Morrison Tessa McGregor from Morrison low and on a molder and Hugh Martin from City care for item 43 brink King and Catherine Tate from Marsh for item 44 I 'll move that

first I think this is stunning I think for New Brighton this is a game changer this will make people drive across the city and in fact we should have brochures and all about tourist outlets like a nice glossy brochure even though it 's a free place it 's not a place you pay to get in to encourage people that are staying at one of the campgrounds or motels or hotels to go there with their children because this is at that level it 's just a bonus that it 's free to get it you know people pay to go to something that 's good this is amazing and it should be celebrated and this will be a

certainly put New Brighton on the map again we did have this crusher at our board meeting the other day rather than the only sort of comment about the front page didn 't have a picture of the whale

Masterton kids own playground which you know I think it cost about and end charity contributions and I just thought wouldn 't it be wonderful to do something similar here and you talk about saving

give it some consideration research this service clubs and the student volunteer army and places like that to you know and you may well actually be able to bring the price down while building the community contribution know um Jimmy and Tom we got into the want to know although this is the New Brighton Beach beachside Prague one facility in New Brighton area but consultation my view energy Opie lasers citywide benefit for all the people our budget so I 'm not sure this one weather is affiliate Allah council website or not you having the intention is the the way this is rather than the more traditional consultation because we 've done quite a bit of consultation around abortion already so this is more about seeking simply feedback from the community so we don 't intend this to be a long process because some of the feedback we 've had today has been about excessive consultation so this is around just direct getting feedback into the design dude there will be on the 23rd of July in the right do they so what was rotation due date is very deep yeah yeah yes Ostia have long one month to go yes yeah weather is open to the whole CG yeah it 's going to be on the council websites other people will be able to contribute that we 're trying to keep it okay you Rob this is one see this is actually outstanding please pass on it thanks to your team this is really super forum unconcern I have though as there an age limit I 'm just thinkin they 're selfish though thank you rob this is very exciting and very pleased of course that there are going to be coastal mitigation features of course and I just want to in terms of the engagement part which we need to keep simple is it a way of making sure that the schoolchildren are involved with some of us as well yes so as I said before we 're going directly into our Denari primary school that 's already been Muslims they cannot know a primary school okay IATA the other junior junior department yeah yeah and we 'll also have some stuff at the hub on Saturday for the opening of imagination station which would expect I 'm turning to of some of the other coastal schools like roughly CSUN BC and South price and Sylvia if they could be a refugee in South okay could be included we 'll have a when there 's the Sun when is the construction there sorry when does the start of the building happening oh we are attempting to have this open prior to this Christmas laughs really seriously yes and um and in what if it 's not another little after Christmas so so you would have to buy me some something nice so but when you actually looking to start in summer so this is just to be clear this is just phase one a so we 're going through the design getting the feedback over the next month we 'll complete design we have where parsh yeah we 're a fair way through the procurement of the various services we 've identified the equipment providers so we 've been running a number of processes and parallel to get this up and running as quickly as we can each and it 's the idea is for the summer to the oh that 's pretty sad you would be awesome right um Glenn and then Yanni thank you and I notice you 've got the same team on board just a good comfort for will be done a good speed how about the time frame for the hot salt water poses that still just connect it up with this is that still looking good into next year yes so will be some of the contracts will be run in parallel we looking to go out for the the public consultation September October then to complete the design by the end of this year the uncertainty is just around that you know the normal process of consent in which we just need to ensure we sort out working also alongside John four sales team as the ultimate asset owners but but we you know we 're looking to you know to move it as quickly as we can once that first boat goes in the ground it 's it 's going to be really significant for the people once they see that they 'll start to believe in it yeah that 's right a huge um yeah don 't mean just don 't underestimate the confidence boost that this will go on it 's going to be awesome so a Yanni and in Sarah so great but there 's some other things that details doings Oh Sarah wish it was New Brighton or okay well I 'll take goofy so if you don 't know okay well just and just um just on this I mean I just wonder whether we can involve schools from other parts of Christchurch because we heard the message from you writing through the submissions that isn 't that 's not really an issue of the people that live there they want other people from other sides of the city to see how great the Brighton is so I just wondered that they 've had a lot of consultation already this is the final feedback loop I know I know but they 've got a month and there are three schools that I would target in that area well actually for because I throw in some James as well and I mean I just yeah you brighten the hayflick as well so said that just the five the five schools if you start to go out wider than that you 'll be more than a month know that so we make it online 2300 all we want to take the initiative then fine but you know I mean don 't don 't don 't hamper don 't hamper what is an incredibly exciting story but I 'm but I just think that if you looked at the must and I 'm not saying that you 'll do the same but they had twenty three hundred volunteers and they built it over six days and they get huge community buy-in and I just you know if there 's a way in which there can be some wider engagement with the community across the city as it gets constructed or I just think it would be really I think there will be components of it and around it that will be capable of being embraced in that way so my point was exactly Yanni 's actually because if you 're wanting we 've been this has being played the whole the whole thing of this has been plugged as a citywide sh the entire time and while we don 't need to actually individually visit every school in Christchurch we do need the libraries that kind of stuff like we do with any normal council consultation doesn 't take more than a month we still do air consultations in a month with big projects but if we wanting to engage the rest of the city and get them excited about going to Brighton the summer then we need to do it at this point when they 're looking at the playground and giving feedback on it is kids okay my point I 'm not disagreeing with their what Rob was talking about was particularly targeting a visit to you we were just making sure that I 'm not beyond the school in an immediate area because we don 't want to tie them down but I think that the headline you know that I 'm hearing from this is that DCL expect us to be open by Christmas that 's going to be a fantastic boost for the people of Christchurch yeah in this one and you 're talking about this Christmas yeah that 's the that that is why I 'm here alone today because the team are back there ensuring ever I could say the beast yeah all right now Jana you had some other questions just wondering if you can get any update on just where you 've got to with work on the master plans yeah I 'm doing do we want to discuss it in ours because part of our reports and PPX yeah no we can we can leave it till then I think that the what yonni no no what what what what Jonnie was keen to heaven the and the public arena i guess was the the fact that DCL are able to work collaboratively with the community boards over the what was the word that we used in the resolution the other day to make sure that they 'll fit for purpose there 's a not a real agent realignment ree-ree we collaborate no not recalibrate yeah yeah we good calibration of the suburban master plans so it just to just to have an indication that DCL can work collaboratively directly with the community boards over there recalibration pricey who are we working alongside council staff for that as well and and also yeah and i see i think that in terms of because of all the work that you 're doing a new brighton that there 's a very close working relationship with the coastal bare wood community board and I think that Heath Curt than would very made our reaching out for a similar engagement yeah understood good great right oh well um so now do I have a mover and a seconder that it comes from your ref seconded by David I 'll take it under the circumstances um I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and now I remove that we expect _"

    "text": "Hey the next item is the remuneration Authority local government review consultation document Joe Daly will join us at the table now this is a two-stage processes and tough Joe do you want to give us a deluxe neck shot of the two-stage process that the remuneration Authority is going through I 'm sure you would have all got the paper and it 's an attachment to the report the remuneration Authority have put out some proposals for local government and this what we 're addressing today is part two of the document which is the short term implications relating to their determination for that upcoming year and we 've provided that feedback the longer term implications which is in part three of the document relate to more directly to remuneration to sizing of roles to also how remuneration and decided whether they decide or the council decides itself there 's reference to targeted rates with regard to community boards so at the moment staff are working through that part three just with some summaries on those and then we 'll engage and seek feedback from councilors and community board one and to be submitted to the remuneration Authority by the 20th of October so we haven 't had an opportunity to discuss the sort of committee or submissions because of the time frame so we have to have the son that 's right and so the document was sent to all elected members and requesting feedback on part two and a reminder sent and so the information that 's in the submission has been put together with the feedback received and also council processes whether we go to the medes that are in there okay so questions first or do I go okay yeah yeah yep Sarah I think you 're on page 246 of the agenda which is page 2 of our feedback we 've got a comment here that 's about parental leave is one of the reasons and I 'd quite like us to be able to be a bit stronger on that one so it says countess we 're a council no it 's a query raised yet with a parental leave may be a reason for a leave of absence and when sicknesses and it would make sense to have parental leave as well I know Palmerston North and recently deserted as a councillor who um has had to go through a special process to try and get some leave as she has your baby we have a are dead to be around the table as well and in any other employment that a situation you get you know after six months you do get your entitlements and so I 'd like I set you to say that we think that this should be part of and the reasons for ever since rather than just noting a query does a really question sorry can we do that if that 's what the council would like we can strengthen that sentence to say that the council is supportive of this being one of those provisions yep so are you suggesting that should a woman have a baby they would be able to be absent from the council a role for six months and an entirety and not be able to attend like the odd council meeting or something like that it wouldn 't be another was specifically asked about by the renumeration authority that has been raised and it wouldn 't just be a mother of the eighth appearance because our normal employment law has either parent for parental leave you know in that 's it but so it 's one of the that 's why it has to be done in an eight-hour enumeration authority type level because we 're not employees because we 're not covered by the other stuff it has to be covered by something else so I think that we should get them to look at that and support it if if you are ill with your partner 's elder ill out you 're able to through the through the current system but not not if you 're having a baby and if you 've got a three year term or see you term you know six years of you if your own counsel for the sixties and we 're all for having diversity around the table we want you know the average age of elite des members is quite audibly want younger people around the table we have to the other things that couples do have you know their families if they choose during that time um Tim thank you for believing my name um yeah that 's actually didn 't take long I totally agree but it 's complicated by a number of things isn 't it I mean because with a normal forty hour week job you can 't just turn up for the odd meeting whereas this you could probably work around it and the other thing is you 've stood for public office to receive public funds to represent so would that be with full pay documents clear that it 's without pay yes oh yeah well I mean my things maybe also change whatever three please yeah no it 's not the representation much about the money but the trouble that we have now and I 've got a very clear recollection of a situation that occurred when I count sort of was was absent perfectly justifiably I mean a terrible condition that she so she needed time for an operation etc etc so but it was a it was a ward that only community board felt that the council hadn 't provided it with any other counselor to replace and we 're all one Ward now so you know I think that from a citywide point of view we would want to think about how that kind of you know support could be offered to the to the community that 's not really been represented for a six months that is one of the reasons that the local government Commission generally don 't like single council Awards because if something happens to a counselor the waters leave we have X reason Tatian always look that 's right well hopefully yeah that 's right but I think that it 's not about that city thing it 's about the you know the rights of working in a woman and I 'm a few choose as a younger person maybe under 40 along as the elected members kind of young young elected members um to be elected you maybe get into a relationship after that choose to have a family you shouldn 't be disadvantaged because you have chosen to serve your community while Christchurch you know we work long hours we get paid well you know look at her in a way they get their 19,000 on council you know it 's it 's it 's not other councils are not like us most district councils are part-time and not paid ridiculous and being able to have time at home with your family in the first six months of your baby 's life with you other dead all the mum we all know the research says is actually absolutely essential and we should be supporting that currently I don 't we don 't agree with it I 'm just saying that we also have to take into account the needs of the community that son represented for six months yeah that 's what I 'm saying yeah today I 'm saying no I 'm saying yes but if you have to I don 't when we get that representation review and we go to at large within community board areas that would be awesome I still don 't see I mean as a mother myself within six months you could still be a functioning representation issue so if you enabled someone to just step out for six months we we 're not this is not a normal job now that main primary job is representing the people if you 're not there for six months it 's a considerable amount of time so we need to manage it somehow I mean I agree with your principal but this is not a normal job where you could get someone to step in for you and pick up the few no I think I actually think that it 's something that the council has to take responsibility for because I totally agree with Sarah that you 've got to have flexibility and the arrangements otherwise you will not attract diversity around the table you know that 's you know that 's that 's my very strong view on it but you know I mean people are entitled to their own views Aaron look I do sympathize with the single counselor per ward situation that 's been raised can we not have something in our claws that if you if you do need to take time out considerable amount of time that someone else from the board can be nominated to step in for that amount of time and be paid for it with agreeance but that would seem to work and be the sensible way to go they 've been elected and they 'll just be stepping in for three months six month at you they 're working with it not not paid for but so but but it could be seemed to be a wider obligation belonging to the council so the council might want to split over a period of time what was brought to my attention around the bank 's potential one is that people actually felt they 've been abandoned by the council not the not the ward councillor because it was not her you know sort of initiative it was completely you know but they really felt that there nothing had been done to actually make up for it and they saw that as a council responsibility so I 'd be reluctant to make it a community board responsibility I 'm just saying that going down this track we would have the whole council to provide you know a go-to person and each of the wards over that period of time and it might be that it 's one person for two weeks it 's one person for six weeks it 's one person for yeah Glen oh I support the general move with this given that the effects could be work with any one of us around the table I know as a dad you know every child I was unpredictable from day one so it could be that you need to be there for your partner for several weeks on end with its physical mental health issues whatever so yeah I think we need to provide for this in and I 'd like to support our colleagues and colleague one of whom we met the other day at the joint councils meeting from her to nuit so yeah I think it 's important we really get behind yep and so people would generally happy with the with the recommendations no no that yeah yeah what then maybe if you just get the sign off on it too so me final sign-off from the mirror and counselor temperature Jonnie oh I thought I saw some feedback coming about superannuation and ACC did you receive anything around that and I think there was a comment about that I am kept and I think guys I went back in the email to counselors and community board members seeking feedback was all the report might reference it sorry and that feedback related to matters that weren 't the the short-term questions has have been put aside for to be included and that longer-term feedback this feedbacks directly related to the the points that were raised by the remuneration authority and number two yeah I mean I understand it would be good for them to think about that sooner rather than later I 'll make reference to that and the correspondence that goes back to them I think that would be really useful yeah okay thanks okay so so do I have a mover and a seconder for this Sierra Mike I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie _"

    "text": "very much thank you good right now we will move to item 22 and I 'd like to invite and John Clements to come to the front I 'd like to invite you to speak to the paper even though it 's been to a committee I think under the circumstances that would be appropriate to invite you to say a few weeks ago well thank you very much it 's a privilege to be here today to talk to this item a lot of people behind the item obviously and in particular we have Laurie Metcalf squash Lena his sister Allison and one of his daughters Victoria lives with us today and and sitting next to them in the gallery here we have seen Malloy who was a very important person in the Botanic Gardens look to us looks after our botanical records and the committee has studied this recommendation that 's come to the council I just want to provide you a little bit more information about the item that some of the councillors might not be aware of it takes it takes many people over many years is no exception the Botanic Gardens has been in existence now for a course over 150 years and there being many noble people hard-working people on the staff as well as counselors as well as volunteers who 've contributed to making what it is today so without trying to detract from anything that those many many people have contributed I just like to talk about two people briefly who really excelled in their contributions to to making it what it is today one of them of course is Laurie Metcalf and we 're here to talk about York here to consider naming the herbarium in the Botanic Gardens the Laurie Metcalf her but there 's one other person who was a precedent for a staff member 's name being used to attach it to a part of the Botanic Gardens and that is John Francis Armstrong one of the very earliest long-standing curators he did a fantastic job of looking after both the introduced plants as well as native plants and his name was recommended to council in 1961 that 's the front lawn of the Botanic Gardens been named 1961 was LJ Metcalf Laurie Metcalf who whose name we 're actually wanting to attach to the herbarium today there 's a nice circularity there if you like and end up an important precedent just in case just in case you 're worried about putting a name on something in the botanical far more important I 'm putting money into the Botanic Gardens is actually serving for over 20 years and creating this place thank you well I 'd like to begin by acknowledging what knowledge never e1 that 's been involved in the Botanic Gardens over many years it 's just the jewel in the crown really as far as the city 's said it goes and it is that it 's its existence means that we can be New Zealand 's Garden City without the Botanic Gardens we could not be New Zealand 's Garden City it wouldn 't it wouldn 't meet the criteria so it 's very much a part of our identity and who we are so I want to acknowledge you John and and and the team the whole team and I do acknowledge 1961 and and and it was fitting that we honor Laurie Metcalf for his contribution and this way and it was interesting I turned on the radio this morning and heard their Ellen herbarium being mentioned which is at Lincoln and and I thought you know again that was just it is appropriate that we name these places for people whose contribution is exceptional I want to acknowledge the family as well I haven 't_''_261.37 met the family but I will do soon and lino Metcalfe Victoria Metcalfe and Alison I you know thank you for being here and and being a part of the special occasion and I hope that I you get to show Laurie this the video of today and you know how much we 're all expressing our appreciation for what he has done for the city so I have a I have a sort of a biography and I do want to read it out because I do want to place on record this extraordinary contribution and then I 'll invite other councillors to safety with so Laurie Metcalf was born in Christchurch in 1928 native tree seedlings by Lance McCaskill McCaskill at the time was a lecturer and agriculture and biology at Christchurch Teachers Training College through his encouragement and enthusiasm to grow New Zealand native plants Laurie chose horticulture as his profession during the 1940s Laurie spent three years as a horticultural trainee with the Christchurch domains board at that time the domains board managed the Botanic Gardens in Hagley Park was during this time Laurie collected possibly his earliest plant specimens to drive press and mount onto herbarium card these were collected in 1946 from rugged ambush and included the mighty Totoro and cabbage tree laurie was just 18 years of age being a dedicated horticultural student he had now set the herbarium on a growth path which at the time possibly amounted to no more than a hundred specimens in the late 1940s Laurie left Christchurch for New Plymouth where he worked for one year with New Zealand 's larger plant nursery Duncan and Davies Laurie then left New Zealand and worked another year in the Melbourne and Adelaide Botanic Gardens from there Laurie went to the UK where he apparently upon seeing them he felt they weren 't up to the standard of lieutenant he then found work with the famous now I 'm going to say this wrong I think that in existence hardy plant nursery in Sussex who specialized in Alpine plants he stayed there 12 months after which he spent a short time working at one of the most famous nurseries in the UK if not the world júlio nurseries he then went on to be a gardener at Wingfield place and Berkshire this was where the famous British educator florist and author constant spray together with rosemary Hume we 're running a domestic science school for girls Laurie returned to New Zealand in 1955 to take up the position of assistant curator of the Christchurch Botanic Gardens until approximately 1967 in 1968 through a restructure the position became assistant director Christchurch Botanic Gardens which he held until 1977 during these 22 years Laurie made a significant contribution to the development and management of particularly the Botanic Gardens his vision skills and determination focused on establishing the gardens on a more scientific and educational footing for the botanical horticultural professionals and students Laurie initiated a sweeping program to improve the gardens plant collections including their documentation and labeling also included and thus was a sustained effort to build up reference specimens in the herbarium Laurie lodged at least 1789 new specimens of both wild and cultivated plants from throughout New Zealand and New Caledonia where he spent one month in 1961 staff from that fondly remember Laurie drying specimens and in this plant presses suspended from the bars of cold frames by the end of the 1970s lorry had contributed to over half of all the specimens and the herbarium with this unique collection of around 5,000 specimens the herbarium as a participating member of the New Zealand national Hobart herbarium network and bears the official abbreviation CH BG this registration was probably another lorry inspired effort in 1977 lorry moved to embark Argyll to take the position of Director of Parks and Recreation for the embark Argyll City Council in addition to all of us lorry is a well-known and highly respected author of numerous botanical and horticultural books he began writing around 1960 today his and photographic guides on New Zealand plants the International Register of cultivars and contributing to the gardens Centennial Book of 1963 Laurie had an enormous willingness to share his knowledge and experience with those working with him including teaching training sessions and field trips in terms of the awards Laurie was an outstanding horticultural student for this he was awarded a number of horticultural prizes medals cups and accolades in 1957 the first recipient of the David Tennant Memorial Prize from the Royal New Zealand Institute of horticulture for gaining the highest marks in New Zealand an oral and practical stage three examination for the National Diploma in horticulture in 1958 the National Diploma of horticulture from the Royal New Zealand Institute of horticulture and 1959 the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horta horticulture cocaine gold medal for the most successful candidate to complete the National Diploma of horticulture this included his thesis on New Zealand Alpine plants in 1978 the Lauder cup for his contribution to the protection and cultivation of New Zealand flora and 1988 award of the associate of honour NZD with the Royal New Zealand Institute medal by the Royal Horticultural Society UK is one of the few New Zealanders to do so and in 2010 appointed a Companion of the Queen 's service order for services to horticulture and conservation so on that note I 'd like to move the adoption of the report and the approval of the Christchurch Botanic Gardens herbarium to be named the Laurie Metcalf herbarium seconded by Phil Clearwater and I 'd like to invite Phil speak well I 'm I was actually really privileged runs in Vacaville that I remember meeting Laurie Metcalf and he was famous lean and did huge amount for the Invercargill gardens but and I guess that so in Christchurch we are you know he finished as and head along illustrious career which is really stunning in terms of the academic work he did but also in and just the practical contribution he made to our Christchurch Botanic Gardens and I think we often take our Botanic Gardens are granted but in fact there 's a huge amount of horticultural science and research has gone and work and buy and the team that Laurie met I not so long ago yes I mean who had been one of Laurie 's apprentices Laurie he had appointed him and he he he really was enthused about the huge work that was done me years ago will there was a good number of apprentices and he said that Laurie was a great boss to have and I see John not in here too and in a particularly way he instructed the young apprentices and guided them and I would I guess at this stage for us as a council to in the whole concept of developing apprenticeships in the Botanic Gardens and we 've made a start on that recently that 's I hope that that is also sort of part of Laurie 's legacy because um yeah I just think it 's very fitting for a wonderful mean Thank You Annie well a lot has been said already so but I just think it is really important to acknowledge that one of the reasons I think Chrysler just such a special place as the special people that have contributed to making it so and I think we done so much to to support our city and particularly the Botanic Gardens which is really fantastic that we can in a very small way acknowledge significantly his contribution and I think it raises the whole question as has been discussed around education and the importance of involving young people and children and in our environment and also right through to training on going through apprenticeships and internships scholarships possibly so I think you know it 's a wonderful way in which we can recognize someone who was a very special person with a special name to what is a really significant asset to our city and I just you know I think it 's important that we do this today I 'm very supportive of it and just wanted to place on record the appreciation to the family that we have for this this for Laurie and the work that he 's done thank you could we just add that he set the benchmark really high John all right welcome on that note I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that should acknowledge you [Applause] _"

    "text": "um I 've just wondering whether we should we should start this next one I 'm just waiting for something to come down so I 'm sorry so we 'll move on to the the Duncans building heritage incentive grant Phil can I hand back to you yes well and thus these buildings are well known to a more known like the Duncans building in High Street which had become the issue has come before this council before but basically you might remember this 8 commercial units all in a row in the aim with this heritage grant which is for three hundred sixty two thousand and six hundred I think the story we preserve that the really beautiful facade you might remember that previously they 've been trees growing along here there 's been some debate about this part of High Street but these are the buildings the total work is over seven hundred thousand dollars and they 're the grant application is 360 mm so say so the committee recommended that council support it and there might be some other discussion around it though right and so you up by Mike so questions kind of wanted to check I don 't think staffer here so I mean basically the government has set up a heritage grant for this exact sort of thing and we don 't seem to be getting they had a great one and category to your Historic Places on a New Zealand Heritage List yet are of national significance right that 's what you 've seen through yeah so this building is registered as category two by Heritage New Zealand but is this is it author is it a nationally significant heritage building yeah what a good yeah hey grouped oh no no no no but it sees that Oney is to assist private owners of nationally significant heritage buildings so sorry I 've only just received this so why don 't we have a an additional recommendation that we investigate that we investigate the four we investigate the applicability of the heritage equip thank you of the heritage equip program which is Heritage earthquake upgrade incentive program mr. gage this is it 's all capitals for a quip because it 's short for yeah take out the word of the heritage equipped well get the instead of program because that 's what the P stands for can you translate to an initiative in in weather and way that any funding for this project would be able to be yeah or whether any funding whether this project would qualify for any funding this again is that right yeah I mean basically the issue with these grants is that they actually require match funding as well and they even make reference to local authority match funding so Breen didn 't come to though just in that we 're just adding a line on their council Johansson raise the question of the Heritage equip initiative which was announced by the minister following the November 2016 earthquakes it 's for nationally significant buildings that are privately owned at a earthquake prone and whether they fit on the Historic Places list category one and category two and medium and high risk areas so I don 't we don 't know whether the the buildings qualify or whether so we 're just put in here request staff investigate the initiative would be equipped from funding scheme is yes it 's national it 's meant for high status buildings it 's also meant for those buildings that are not damaged it 's a proactive scheme to take buildings out of earthquake prone status rattle we 're dealing with with buildings that have already been damaged and and and our earthquake prone for either damage reasons or or for the same same reasons as possible either not said they wouldn 't qualify so that 's all we 're asking you they might but the other factors to bear in mind obviously there are two I think there are two funding phases throughout the year that have closed off dates yeah and they may not work with the timeframes that that are currently underway for this set of buildings the owner of these buildings has already kicked off and started some of the work whether or not they they believe that they 've got a chance that there 's nothing stopping them applying for that fund but what what the fund administrators might say to them is look you 're not actually you is you 're demolishing everything except the facade retaining the facade and then tying a whole new building onto the back of the of the of that facade so in effect you 're you 're not actually upgrading a building you 're building a new building with the facade of the old building hmm which you you you use the new building to tie on to so I will leave it we 'll leave it like a surprise of it qualified based yeah I would be surprised to having read what Yanni sent through but um yeah I don 't know for sure that 's not to say that there aren 't other buildings that we 've we 've recommended people applied for that fund right yes we definitely we know we know about it and there may be other buildings which are more suitable for it where you 've got a bit more time and a bit more ability to save the entire building yeah okay it 's good all right so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the _"

    "text": "very much next one is the draft healthy food action plan that was also your committee Thank You Phil so this has also been a uncredible success really the whole healthy food movement and Christchurch and I think in Christchurch were very much right in front and championing this in particularly in working with the other organisations the other other community groups who have saluted well they 've read the way really and we 've supported them so like there 's been some great initiatives which are outlined in that report the the fruit the fruit and veggie coops the support for them some which have been long-standing also though the healthy foods and schools lots of schools actually have those programs and the whole edible planting including on council and also though the one about focusing instead of focusing on having clean good pure drinking water and instead of the sugar drinks those initiatives you know to support those basic things in certainly expanding the edible garden words that some community boards have developed they might have kicked it off in and other bullets have picked that up Pauline I have referred to the staff is it at some stage I think the action plan might be able to develop a sort of strategic alignment with in fact focusing on some of the target groups who are most at risk for example obesity diseases and those sort of things however there are scope for some community groups and that there could be a petite two in alpha for say that those ethnic groups to be included but this I think this potential development they 're happy to have other discussion yes you look I really support this that 's fantastic and I think that particularly the community gardens are I think a real basis for this you cannot force change on people so the community gardens actually become a magnet for activating communities and switching their concept of food and actually being part of that food that they eventually each they 're actually part of producing that and it 's an education program it 's a social cohesion it 's all sort so I think that the community gardens are actually a real core of changing our attitudes to nutritionally but socially as well so it 's really good to see and I think I 'm really proud of this council for the work that we 're doing it if I may say the grassroots level because you know it 's that 's where it all starts and it 's about people and this is the only way forward so fantastic yeah Mike and then yarny Dionne thanks and I just want to touch on action 14 which was the edible garden Awards which obviously the Papa Nui owners community board has been a leader and I think it 's actually a really really important award for the communities and what it 's doing is actually although were acknowledging residents that are actually doing eatable Gardens but it 's the school 's we get into and the preschools and we 're getting them to start off young and it 's a skill they 'll in and I 'll have four for life and it 's really encouraging to see that obviously the targets have all wards doing this awards which I hope to see before that actual did deadline had some people read this and then send us an email but one thing that that raised with me is that we haven 't actually engaged on this or consulted and I just wondered if people I mean obviously people have strong views and opinions and I just wondered whether there was any way in which um we were going to consult or engage and whether we had any plans to go through each action and have a separate consultation or whether we just approve it I mean there 's a few things in here that I think people would probably want to provide some feedback on and I 'm not quite sure how they do that I think I mean what my view of is this is an action plan and all of the actions that involve the community are open to negotiation and consultation and engagement because they weren 't happen otherwise when was one of the one of the items on the agenda is community fridges well you brush and just started a give a little page you know I just brought it up the give a up yesterday and closes on the 30th of July so feel free to go online and contribute it 's a non non non profit organization that provides a place people to donate food and other products for those in need the fridge and pantry is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. available blah blah this amazing project needs funding we are all in need of finances for the shed that the fridge and pantry will be in so I mean the point is is that so these things aren 't going to happen because the council has put them on an action plan they 're going to happen when the council engages with those communities that have these initiatives and supports them right so but the board 's given money gone yeah that 's fine for like for ones that the communities are doing but for ones that council are doing like to give you an example the tea house for example the future use of the tea house we haven 't had any I think there 's a current use in there at the moment I don 't that going to have another report come to us with community views or is that is this just going to be the decision today around how that gets used which one is that number 13 so you know that there are a few things in here um it says investigate the opportunity to utilize the old tea house so we put a temporary use in there so it will come back to council yeah if you look at the measure of success its educational facilities are set up in the tea house yeah that would be a great great house um well well them that 's fine all I 'm saying is that the community might have a view but they will have to be consulted okay so that 's called so they will be consulted on what 's proposed there yeah um and the other one I just we can probably cross green prescriptions off with we 've already done that I think just just yesterday then Tuesday so number 16 wait I think this is an action fan yeah and and we 're doing a trial that what annual plan so um probably we can get a report back on there I thought we 'd agreed to do it for next year but for the see yeah yeah it 's a trial yeah as a trial it 's not so that 's that 's final decisions that 's all yeah we in debate or will we ask a question IIIi don 't know why this is switched on to questions that 's why but um have you ever got a contribution to make to the debate oh yeah sure right so um you know like we do normally we do we do normally consult on our action plans and you know I just think we do need to be mindful that there will be alternative there could be alternative years to some of the more contentious things in here but I 've heard that we will as those contentious things come to the fore there will be a chance for the community to expressive you and you know I 'm happy to accept that and I mean I just think you know when you reflect on the huge in our communities that actually looking at what we do through the whole event sponsorship use of public space for messaging and marketing I think is really important and certainly I think we 've still got the work going on I think around the national policy statement around things like obesity and how we deal with that so I don 't want to lose sight of the fact that there 's other things that are mentioned and here that can actually make a difference as well and particularly things like district plan and and and land use decisions so anyway I just commend staff for the work that they 've done on this I think this does give a good framework and I welcome the opportunity to have more detailed discussions as these projects go through Dion and is it yeah oh sorry can I start Aaron is it yes all right okay um I just wanted to serve voice my full support for this I think this is an absolutely fantastic thing and I just wanted to sort of go back to when I was younger from Patti akka growing up when mum was you know when we 're a little bit older I was working at the market gardens and supplied the people around the the suburbs with food and fresh food and it just creates communities and I think it 's really good in that respect to actually start fostering creating communities and also there was there was one thing I was actually going to talk about but I think Yanni kind of got me off the track a little bit it was around enough gov lost it okay sorry um not a mapping there we go I think that 's actually really really cool and I think one of the things that we should be thinking about further there is there 's already the mapping done by the residential red zone stuff from in the serie days so there 's already an opportunity for people who do want to get involved in that stuff to go onto those Maps I 'm not sure where they are and actually look at all of the full trees that were left behind from people 's backyards and things like and I think it 's really cool to sort of move this forward I also support this from the point of view of mental health I think in society we 're starting to see sugar actually may be more of a problem than smoking and I think the evidence is only just starting to come through and some of the research so when we start further going down the track around sugar and and how food affects mental health I think this start you know the steps that we 're going to take today and moving forward I think as a city we do need to lead because we do have big mental health issues in this country and in the city especially and I think it will start with good food and good communities and I think moving that way we do have long-term resilience so I think you know from that perspective I 'll firmly support this and anything moving forward from it at time um thank you it 's um yeah we keep preaching I think to to the converted in many respects I think this is I so pressure to converted it everybody jumps in because they believe in and that 's right but there are so many areas where we must no keep going to those fast foods or keep going to the bad stuff you go to school fears for instance the staple at a school fear a chips and candy floss and I just wanted it 's a it 's a 360 degree approach from our organization which is wonderful one of the groups that is leading it in one of these areas as their events team where they are leading healthy food and events because if you have an event generally you want the turnover etc so hopefully through that that 's going to start opening the eyes of some of those school fears some of the private operators and supported with our staff that are driving those Celsus they 'll see that this body as a leader in this and they will hopefully follow so I just want to say thank you to the staff that are leading this year 's okay I 'm Erin yeah I was Juvia service to to be about the stick but it 's more about the carrot excuse the pun this is our healthy food policy not our unhealthy food policy and so this is about showing the way and good food leadership within the community and I have an issue being on the health board as well around obesity and in some of the issues that face a huge portion of our population excuse the pun again around their issue and it is because New Zealanders in most of the Western world of food illiterate they don 't understand what they 're eating and they make so many bad choices and if we were as good at our food as we are at our meth we would be a lot healthier as a nation and it needs to go right back to the education system this draft policy as it was before it went to the committee and then it come through the committee and I 've got more course on well this is the second most phone calls I 've had in this tomb behind an intersection and here Wood Road and it food fridge people got excited about that and thought it sounded kind of really cool and weird at the same time until you explain this when you grow food at your own property or in a community garden you always have an excess of certain things at a certain time for javis being the big one and what happens is you can 't_''_801.14 eat all the food you have and to just take it down put it in a box and set it at the local food pantry and then see it disappear when you drive past or bike paths later that day is a really cool thing because it 's just not going to waste and we waste a huge amount of food in this country and to just share a little more around into the concept of kids where I grew up and Wilson and Webster have and their own minds a map of the fruit we could steal and normally it grew over footpaths I 'm just going to say that was in the public domain technically and you would pick it and take it and we it and parks and things encourage kids to come along and just blyton eyes themselves on fresh fruit or vegetables in a pack how cool is that that 's a great thing in a great city to live in so I applaud this and thank you to all those involved NJ I 'm really encouraged by this it brings together a number of conversations that have been going on for some time and certainly work that 's been going on in some communities for some time as well in Littleton we 've had a very successful community garden for many years we 've got the plenty to share table that sits on London Street and little somewhere people do take along the kind of excess that Aaron was just referring to from their own gardens and also from the community garden so I 'm particularly encouraged by the contents of clause and 5.9 actions include increasing the number of community gardens and edible planting on public land this presents an opportunity for education education around healthy food choices and of course there is plenty of education about poor food choices often providers of gratuitous sugar and get you gorgeous fat that lead to poor food choices also community garden leads to education around gardening planting the seasons the way of nature in some ways are back to the future '_''_910.92 approach this is the way that things were done in communities in the past I 'd like to think that it 's the way that things will be done at the local level in the future as well so whether planting on public land ends up with the situation we 've got where we 've got fennel along the footpaths or potatoes at the park or Rockets at the roundabout or beet roots in the berms who knows but it 's certainly a good initiative and I think it 's wander to lead to some good educational and community health outcomes as well so really pleased to see it well in itself and Valle a degree of community engagement because it 's not going to happen without the community I agree entirely with what Aaron said is that it takes a proactive leadership role but it requires engagement to make that note I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carry yes _"

    "text": "very much City Council smoke-free 2025 action plan that 's come from social and Community Development fill clear water so that 's been really successful actually because in terms of the the developments of what you know has been started with smoke-free day and has continued annually but councillors are record that back in 2014 we many of you were we set up or ask for smoke-free conditions in their social housing and really the smoke-free action plan has developed since their and the the most recent work has been the voluntary smoke-free outdoor dining areas and Council of answer might like to comment on that later because that 's been gone especially well in actually the day we we had our meeting was smoke-free day and counsel attorney and council Livingston spoke at this on the key mean it was a good partnership with with the Cancer Society in the smoke-free program so you 'd like to move that on with it I don 't know Lina seconded yep is there any discussion hi Michael is just following on from Phillip it was a good day in terms of overwhelmingly demonstrated a success for business so I think that you know we can say that adding kind of social and environmental bottom lines to business now that 's certainly overcome any initial fear that non-smoking would be banned from a business of it that 's tremendous we talked about data before that 's more data to help in terms of that I think it 's also important to know that crushes City is seen as taking a real lead on this so it 's having a domino effect on other councils around the country but also following suit and we 're all working together towards arriving at the smoke-free 2025 I said or goal which will be here probably before we you know pretty quickly the one thing which I think the action plan notes so it 's about providing a voluntary environment so not a regulatory I think that would definitely be a second option so it 's voluntary in all this we 're not looking at it Bibles so I think that 's part of the power of it that we 've got this buying obviously throughout private sector there 's real momentum gathering over there as well so I encourage you all to support this and add Aaron yeah I just draw people 's attention to 0.5 there where the committee had requested staff to come back with considerations around a campaign to address cigarette butts in public places I don 't know for the rest of you that that certainly gets raised with me from time to time when people see cars stopped at traffic lights especially and people finish smoking and flick the cigarette butt out of window that makes its way into our waterways if you extrapolate out the percentage of people who smoke and the amount they have and they often drop their butts in public places that 's millions of cigarette butts per year going into our waterways and so if we can get a solution to that I think the rest of the world may start to copy us I thought a lot of thanks Singapore might have it really sewn up but that for me would be a big one if we can get towards people just thinking about butts a lot of businesses in the city already are I noticed with a lot of new factories but where they 'll start to smoke outside they have those tin boxes that you stub your thing out and put it in that 's where they put them in any places ourselves that I know of maybe we should and that could be a way forward we used to and Mike and Ian Andrew thanks I 'm just going to follow up a little bit for Aaron sax I totally support this goal I think it 's really actually important but we look at the cigarette butt so I do a lot of regular walking around the city and actually one of the worst places that I see is I 'm around the hospital now obviously the hospital has been smoking on the grounds that everyone is actually going onto the footpath outside the hospital grounds and putting all their cigarettes there and it 's just filling up the gutters and obviously ended a waterway so I think we really need to look at what we 're doing to actually eliminate waterways and Rea reference was made to the event a sign of the Kiwi on the eve of the the meeting of Phil 's committee and it was a pleasure to be there I think it was particularly appropriate that event happened on the eve of smoke-free day and that Phil 's committee had them the discussion that 's led to these resolutions on smoke-free day certainly the partnership between community and Public Health District Health Board and the Cancer Society has been council has been a successful one is something that the ched committee in the last term of council certainly was very proactive around and it 's great to see and Phil 's committee continuing that good work and further progressing and that good work the key message from the event at the sign of the Kiwi was that at the start of the outdoor dining trial and there were certainly some that were claiming that outdoor and smoke-free areas would be bad for business exactly the opposite has turned out to be the case in fact there are some of the businesses that took part in that as a result of those outdoor areas been smoke-free so it 's good to see this work continuing something I 'm supportive of and I expect that this will be well supported today thank you alright I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank _"

    "text": "eight ref right onto the favorite stuff which is mine so this is a very big report the one on parks and maintenance and has some incredible detail especially at the board level so that would be of interest to all board members the the pages I think that are very interesting so if you go to page 91 and 92 what it shows is where the spikes in maintenance requests come from and primarily these are weather-related obviously we deal with weather-related stuff in a whole bunch of different areas but clearly last year we had a lot of rain in spring and it caught the contractors by surprise and then they see the grass all over the city grows like crazy everyone calls up and says what we can 't play cricket here and so your request spike goes up and then there 's a period where the mowers get onto it and get round at most and then if you look at the charts it shows you very very clearly what is going on and so that 's really good information another piece is also the parks Park Rangers has come in so if you go to page 95 it shows you that mowing is really the big big one that 's when people get on the phones parks maintenance is also another issue as well and on page 97 it is a very good graph of the parks maintenance related a customer service request jobs and you can see we 're not we 're not clearing a lot of those and that 's what we 've just doubled in the annual plan in terms of having sort of more ranges that come in five dollars think so so that that really that really is a basic resource issue for us so we 've doubled the amount so hopefully we 'll get better response there again page 99 and one page 98 actually you can see the spike again in October and December in terms of maintenance related complaints so they will come in at the same time of year so basically it tells our team but also tells the contractors that they 've got to resource up for that period another piece of very interesting data system which is very interesting and it really shows how we manage the contracts across the city this is a really really detailed piece of information it shows that in general actually the trends are pretty good these people are doing generally a good job if you take out the spikes because of the rain and are in maintenance issues but it shows how we actually manage this data so the fact that we 're getting the state and our means we can really drill into stuff and really see what 's going on so that 's that 's really you know pretty exciting if you 're a data junkie I tend to think that you know the trends are actually reasonably good if we take out last spring and we take out the fact that we do have to improve our general maintenance which we 're doing with the park rangers so there you go enjoy thank you so you 'd like to move it I 'll move it in situ by Andrew any discussion Vikki and one of the things that came through strongly at the committee was also across all contractors and that comes through year after year after year so it doesn 't really matter how much it rains things grow and spring and what seemed to be the situation was that there was simply not enough staff to be able to deal with it I wonder if it would be sensible if we asked Andrew at some stage just for one page it doesn 't need to be major on what could possibly be done to address that staffing issue yeah it 's a really difficult issue if you look at so we had a lot of rain in spring last year the previous year actually the rain came late so the spike was actually addressed later but you always get this yeah the issue I mean this is just it this is any kind of seasonal issue is how do you get a huge amount of staff in for a particular time of the year to do something now the one I mean here 's a good question the labor force that we do have regularly is the citizens so I mean you know everyone out there with their Mo 's okay which is digital resource up just for say two months a year is quite tricky for the contractors yeah well I suggested because Andrew raised it as an issue not just for us but for contractors in that they lose the brownie point says that we 're in there whatever it is the KPIs and during that time and I wonder if we shouldn 't address actually how we address that now because that deals with the majority of the complaints and I 'm just Andrews made an we notes or assuming is okay with it suppose we have an outcome from Freeport it 's a good discussion because it happens every year yeah so how do you deal with this which I just wondered whether and it 's because of a larger conversation that 's been going on around immigration policies that you 've got the recognized seasonal workers who actually work at a different time of the year and maybe we should start because it can 't just a fit Christchurch it must be the same an Auckland Wellington and don 't think we would be without what to think whether there 's a way of linking into a workforce that is moving around the country at different times a year and whether they literally is an external work force that could come on unassisted and even students or you know retired people mean that there is a way of doing this the difficulties here that 's probably yes but the difficult is what you mentioned before if as the other year it was like two months difference so you 've got work force really though they 're required elsewhere at certain times so you know it 's going to happen or it may happen but you don 't know when it 's going to happen and it 's a real pain I knew that up I knew good word and ten would come up and Glen on various over a cup of wards there would be has a lot of people Burwood there 's a lot of grass so we 've got a lot of spikes over them there you go to shoe the mowing was there there 's would spike over and completed no these are all parts will maintain receive some reporting regarding either yellow grass and obviously associated to the written lens look after the red zone at the moment there 's a lot of different pieces brought that we have to look up it 's quite difficult landing managing there was confident here to be healthy oh sorry sound can 't pick you up Andrew so you want to come up here come to the imitated or over microphone we just put the roving microphone away thank you thanks is in the Viridian in the East as I was saying Lin 's are responsible for the red zone at the moment and there is a lot of grass over there there 's this a whole lot of bits and pieces that we are responsible for and in the contractors response to getting on top of that last spring was was less than optimal it 's getting better but the discussion that there was around how do you manage the resource at the peak time the way we 've actually set the contract up as we demands don 't come on at the same time so that they can release as many people as they can to that high mowing activity I think the reality is that they haven 't planned that well and a lot of the a lot of the complaints that got registered we 're not necessarily because of a whole lotta grass not being managed as you can see the Marling 's being the spike but it 's really been around how they 've managed that resource they were typically not doing the same sites over and over and over again they go back to the start of the schedule and get as far as they could so there was some sort of common sense things that need to improve as well so it 's it 's not just that it 's uncontrollable it 's fair to say that how the the available resource is used needs to improve as well there 's an expectation in our contracts that they will always fail to achieve everything hence we have performance measures set at 90 percent of the agreed program and banding for this spring it 's going to be a West spring it 's going to be a harder spring this year whenever that happens to tune up because we 've already got a lot of moisture in the ground that we didn 't have following three years of near drought so there 's going to be some challenges coming up the spring be picking up ground work or woods crown responsibilities and their image here to the red zone yeah hopefully not okay but not in the short times we 're certainly not funded to deal with the level of service that they 've been delivering in that red zone okay so that 's not behind the spike you know David and Dionne thank you still feeling a bit crazy I think of circles and pots up water close we 'll all be this morning but not go there Andrew I 'm just curious with the performance management of some of our contracts and we actually report the rust committees head you know we often hear a lot of conversation about some of their contractors are losing it Vicki said brownie penalized with the spike situation we 've got or or are our contractors expected to to recognize we have this problem at this time of the year and and be able to cope with it it 's the letter I mean the way the program set up and the frequencies are set up they are set up to deal with the spikes and if in a nature shifts that spike along we always with the contractors to make sure that the frequencies they need to deliver the product are correct look I think they had a bit of a honeymoon in the first first year in the first spring it wasn 't that bad and they got there quite nicely and I think it hit them a little bit by surprise but I think it 's been pointed out that counselor buck might have pointed out this is not new city Kier had the same issues when they were the contractor whenever the spring came I guess what I 'm trying to say it wasn 't so much that it was a complete failure I think they just didn 't didn 't have repeat failures at the same location now that 's a learning that I would like to think that we can work with them to eradicate going forward you go either around punishment we believe that the contract is a really good pain gain contract and that it fairly reflects good performance and that the community on the other side of the coin if you like that if the contract is not performing year after year after year well then someone you should be brought to the table so it 's it 's black and white it 's very clear they won 't get paid for week they haven 't done but in a 17 for them the challenge for them is to be really good at resource management and councillor manji pointed out some contractors do that by holding their staff for the bulk of the year and trying to bring in tempstar for the pigs it 's a very open contract they can employ subcontractors to manage that peak if if they get ready for it so we can legally speak this year that the message growth here and now we talk we 're talking we 've been talking to them for a while that as soon as the rain started and late April in May that they need to be well established to deal with spray goop stay on bin Aaron yeah it 's just quickly around the different you keep talking about product but the change of product that we 've had and has just their impact has there been quite in terms of the education about how do we apply the new product that we 've been using in terms of being better for the environment as have much of an impact I see you 're sorry and respect to the non glyphosate approach and yeah okay so removal of roundup or website if you like and look there 's no evidence that the efficacy of the organic based product is having a major impact at all we increase the frequency that we have to apply it is there 's about three species that it 's not that good at dealing with we 've given the contractors more resource Council recognized that in expenditure in that space Council at the time also gave us some extra capital so we 're out there at the moment re mulching gardens to make sure that it 's a bit more balanced I 'd have to say at this point we 're probably another twelve months away from seeing it being quite successful in the park environment it 's challenging in some other environments and it 's challenging first for some people and parts because it 's a pong frankly it 's quite a quite a nasty smell it goes away pretty quickly but we 've had a few complaints about the smell yeah we haven 't had anyone say they like it but as has that resource I mean I 'm just where I 'm asking is the resource that you had obviously when you changed the product has that been sufficient to be able to to drive there through the organizations that are delivering it so when you say through the organization are you referring to the contractors oh look you know it was a it it was a best guess from them they were takes their people I mean our contracts are simple its bums on seats of a mower or people doing work and they understand that you know better than we do and so they were given an open invitation to put to us the case of shifting away from glyphosate to the new product what is the likely impact to be and they 've still got that opportunity right now we 're reviewing how that 's gone there might be some minor tweaks but there was certainly as I said at the beginning there 's no evidence that that is the major contributor to the customers concerns Aaron Aaron Sexton yeah how my question is around how open we are to allowing certain neighborhoods to manage their own contracts have we looked at that with a resonance of quite a large strong residents association and the world I represent who have a number of parks and pocket parks and public spaces Behrens student potentially running it themselves could are we open to that and saying hey look the square meter it 's rate per year is this you 've got this still interested and can we have those conversations was that recently here typically they 've come to us at over the last while through sports clubs that have an association with a particular part when we explained to them that for example it costs around 1200 per annum to look after a sports field they quickly change their mind and the reason for that is of course is the amortization of all of the equipment and resource across the entire city brings the rate right down so we need to look at the cost on an asset by asset basis it 's quite low and look we 're very open we 're more interested I guess in exploring and expanding volunteer input we did some stuff the last a couple of weeks ago when this report was requested for and we sort of calculate that the luxury value of the voluntary volunteer hours that we get into park seven moment is around 1.4 million per annum so it 's not to be sniffed at and we really want to explore pushing that angle more so rather than saying here you the risk of course associated with health and safety etc etc and access and so forth that we encourage the community to get a bit closer to whomever the workforces and work with them we believe that 's a better mechanism all right that 's a question I just wanted to jump in on Dillon 's question if you go to page 132 there 's an excellent dashboard there and what it looks at is a particular contract in a particular area which is the eastern contract so we tend to get the headline bits mowing and sports field safety and parts but then you can actually drill down into that and see what the particular issues are so if you look at the bottom one which is general parts of maintenance year-to-date trend you know for playground equipment hedges Gardens that 's already good and then it 's the weed control that 's getting the issue so there 's a there is incredible data here to actually work out which areas are causing the issues so you know that 's really useful stuff not Pauline try to follow up proactive and how we address these things rather than reactive and so that 's the way that we 're trending across the board that 's a really good say but isn 't that the theory behind the new park ranger absolutely yeah absolutely I mean this data is available to both the the contractor in Council start and that was pointed out before that it 's quite complex to get good information out of our customer service information at the moment but we can get some and that 's what we want to use to get that proactive management going and it really just has simply been that we 've been too stretched yeah in the past other contractors sitting down with each community board and going through this data with them now when the contract was set up it was a requirement that the contractors present themselves to community boards on a monthly basis different community boards responded differently to that some of them wanted less frequent updates I suspect that it 's sort of dropped away but I 'll follow up to make sure that we had good others said look three monthly or Lisa 's fines so more than willing to give that energy beam yeah I 'd really like the data to inform the discussions you know so I mean they 're Eastern is a really good example of how you can drill down into the data to see what the real problems actually are because it 's very easy to say there 's a there 's a service level you know mustard actually to find out what that is focused on and the timing of it yeah it 's all very relevant to any decision-making that you 'd want to make or resourcing decisions yeah I was just thinking just on that I mean we get updates every month on graffiti and I think this would be quite good just in the board area report to actually have this stuff included it 'll be quite good yeah but to actually sit with the contractor at the board table community board table yeah there you go yep Bucky Lavery sitting there however if you 'd like to just say when the lights are going to happen sorry she wants you to talk a completely irrelevant question I 've had a certain property not 2,000 applies I don 't have that information in front of me at the moment captain Danny thank thanks enjoy and thanks for the information in the report just um just that are you able just to give us a bit of a timeframe for when we 'll get an improved customer service interface in terms of the ability to manage the complaints coming in versus the completion work so are you talking about that the information system yeah number of people like I mean there 's a number of complaints that have come in where people have repeatedly lodged complaints right and things don 't don 't happen so really closing the loop with the customers or I mean I don 't like calling customers but that 's yelling which we use but when people make a complaint having the ability to close that complaint by either saying you know we 've investigated and yeah it should have been done or actually we did the work and you know just being able with a just closing off the the request that 's been made so the people part of it that I mean that 's the driver behind that Ranger increase in resources and face to face works we know face to face works better than technology frankly the technological part of it yes it is it 's a it 's a Colombian clumsy and cumbersome process for staff and to be frank it you often gets forgotten because they have to close it out in two separate systems so I 'm not going to promise a you know a rapid increase in closing out our data what I am going to promise is we 're already thinking and starting about how quickly we can get those ranges out in the field so that our customer interaction improves dramatically yeah I think yeah I think the point you know it 's been an irritant for me to sort of right from the get-go off smart snaps in solve is that why can 't we have a solve snaps in function that returns to the to the customer but I think smart cities thought that the new system is on the way but it 's an IT driven project sorry and I don 't have them yeah that 's come on okay and just you did mention about the three new Rangers yeah what have you got to cut a time frame for when they might start briefly on cheese day no no they just err does it mean sometime next week and they where we 've already started the process of coordinating how they need to be equipped and we were already starting the process of the recruitment and just a final question for me was and I was picking up on the point that was both made at the committee and viki 's made is in terms of the whole labor force relevant to I guess it 's not I mean it 's maintenance but it 's also gardening and and and you know there 's a whole bunch of things I think that you 've raised at the committee that in terms of just the ability to attract people into these different fields have have we got a kind of maybe scholarships to kind of you know and just do a bit of labor force planning around that our intention is to approach the LTP with options for that we think that 's the appropriate way to address it workforce retention is challenging at the moment because of Christchurch 's construction environment it doesn 't mean we can 't improve it and that 's that 's really what we 're going to bring to the LTP for consideration right is it anything in the contracts that we have that requires sort of a number of internships or anything around the labor force or is it well we have quite a lot of requirements in the contract around skill base training development the reality has been for the contractors that with the relatively consistent movement of workforce particularly early on it 's a very difficult thing to achieve yeah thank you is um just thinking about what you were talking about to the volunteers and the enormous benefit that that brings I 'm wondering how we can encourage our young people to sort of partner and get involved with for example like then terms are there a growing it sense of citizenship er I 'm not sure that 's the word we 're using at the moment that in terms of taking some responsibility and how we could how we could develop that yesterday we went to some of the Heritage Sites and ricci more got quite excited about the idea of young people taking some responsibility for heritage buildings and they 're in their community and I just think there 's a kind of a big picture thing that could happen here if we could get some kind of proceeds through community boards some sort of vehicle to engage young people in these things well you can you see that working okay and the three ranges and the urban parks that we have now have had some success they 've only been they 've only existed for just over a year and working particularly with sports clubs they have a lot of children obviously associated to them and having working bees and working days and helping that 's the trying to encourage people to give up in a big chunk challenging encouraging people to get there by incremental contribution is really successful and they 've had great success to date and we we 're going to develop a program where we can recruit for one of a better phrase even if it 's just three times a year like the giant cleanups that the impact of that is is enormous in terms of obviously what you achieve but the engagement that people have with their own spaces and places well I saw it out at South Shore that day with the student volunteer army and other you know service groups coming out they did they did something like three months work and one Warner yes not just because of the sheer numbers the other opportunity we have with young people is through our education team is you know they get great engagement through those education environmental education programs and you know it won 't be hard to explore how we can bolt on a continuing relationship sorry just to finished it just wondering you know you save science pages and things like that kids could earn I wonder if a of thing in become sort of you know Junior Ranger or something like that could be an idea sure I 'll take that up with tasting it 's good right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much Andrew _"

    "text": "and we head clerk on the on the out bike so could I invite our grant Johnson and and clap if you 'd like to come and join us at the table thank you give us turn it on first if you settle down the green like severe thanks for doing that before the meeting officially starter that sort of satisfies every liberal in terms of formality of the council meeting but it has given us a demonstration of what what you 're here to talk about thank you thank you for the opportunity to speak to you saw some grant from guide bike and this is Clark from yuck boy not sure if you 're aware the I fight has been built and designed in Christchurch we 've been around for about seven years and this is coming up into an eighth year now and what we want to do want to demonstrate our new products and this is to introduce you to our company so your parka is a fully electric transport product it is not got pebbles which go round as such it is fully electric it a perfect product to be on to be used for transporting around a busy city it falls down into a very much compact size so you can use it to go on a bus or a train we in the back but if you can or take it on the boat or or health private helicopter or on a plane but it 's only product in New Zealand which Scots owns legal classification that 's called the most of the classification is VI pike in terms of there 's a product with on when many awards will be on Time magazine there 's not many companies in his elder son any which actually can say to be on the front magazine Time magazine once bring the guestbook records we 're currently in the goose books as well as in terms of classification you can see when talk about electric transport is it 's rock the yoke quake in terms of the product itself the clock will demonstrate here the safety features so in terms the light of the bike you can see here that the bike is fully lit up it has a front lights and also has the rear lights and when you 're sitting upright as well you 're very easy to be seen there 's anti skid brakes as ABS braking so when you when you go to break it 's not like a pedal bike that you will lurch forward the pack itself gradually slows down so it 's the gradual slow down into breaking it 's not one which you actually will tip over something to look at in the go you know for brake words above it you will not it will gradually slow down the handlebars have been designed to be on the side and the reasons being designed on the side is number reasons one is safety again you you won 't go hit over the head of bars and hit yourself muscle so when you 're riding the bike you lean on the bike so Ashley glide you don 't use a handlebars to fully steer you 're more lean side to side developed a maneuver that is built-in indicators so it has as you 're lifting right indicators it has from the motor so you can get up and go if you want to a very quick class speed but you can also limit it as well so from a tourism point of view if we want to we can actually limit the speed so that take you slowly because we see this as being that we are designed and built in christchurch we see this could be a wonderful tourism product for christchurch the speed limitation as well as 3 3 h it 's the top speed we deem it as a safe speed any faster than that then you know I mean there is other products out here these electric bikes and is molex which goes between 30 to 35 kilometers we deem that is not safe so when we got the classification done through the government we made sure that it was 23 kilometers per bottle so you need to wear a helmet the noise of the bike which Clark would demonstrate as well there 's no question a number of times why we have a noise the reason here the noise is from a safety point into footpaths and paths and also through inside of the road the last thing you want to do is have something which is totally quiet come out behind you so the sound of the bike itself is a safety factor the bike itself is one of the two as well for branding as you see here from the slide this was how the bike looks like when it 's fully skin so again from the point of view from a tourism point you can have the crusher City Council could have the bike filly 's skin in terms of a product there 's advertising our city and also innovation in the city and also in terms of what we believe towards green technologies well this is the model see this one here is a full carbon product so it 's it 's more the top in product it is slightly different design but in terms from a branding point of view like the one you can see up there on the slide you can brand the full frame and also the wheel the beauty of the wheel as well because 's a mobile billboard this is the model be branded up as you can see the one which clapboard out the model becomes the single and two will as a adapter this some people find it much easier to learn to ride a free-will than a single wheel so the model V comes with both options when we make it and yeah there 's my brief introduction to the outline so what I like to do I 'd like to basically perform a while introduction and also invite to the council and see how we could work with you to develop her using the I Pikes intensity nangi thank you thank you very much well it was a very interesting way to start the meeting but thank you for the presentation and I 'm sure that counselors would would welcome the opportunity to you know have further discussions like life and you can see where we go to a year I think we might we might get the innovation and sustainability committee to to do some more brush of some initial contact and take it from here thank you if forward thank you morning good morning thank you for this opportunity look I just want to focus very quickly on what is the biggest issue already facing our city and how our city will be judged in history as to how its dealt with the trauma of the quakes I 'm referring to the Cathedral there is no other building and in the city that is so important for the identity and character and also the attachment of the citizens of the city and our image around the world in that context right now we are aware of course that we are facing a supposed decision of the Cathedral from being considered I should say that Tim and I both Anglicans as well as strong advocates for restoration but the process is that the senator has been given the opportunity to vote it can 't_''_534.819 be a vote to take away the Cathedral and have it rebuilt it can only be a vote to take the matter to court but that is the wish of Synod and what we would like to don 't you all know if it doesn 't decide to restore yeah there 's only one solution that leads to decision that leads to a solution which I and that 's restoration for the city but in the context of this issue we have just had released in the last three weeks the Cathedral working groups report and unfortunately the media has not helped communicate that to the right of public and every day you see communications in the press Brian laws article letters that show people Christchurch are completely ignorant of that government report put together by a committee of five people tool appointed by the church church property trust they had 40% representation and that report is a central reading for all leaders and decision makers in the city so what I would suggest an edge is it is time for this council to show its hand at six years since the council actually had a vote on anything to do with the cathedral and at that time the council voted 10 votes for a pause on restoration until an engineering assessment had been done pulling flawlessly and voted floor against that motion so I give this matter it 's focused consideration and for counselors as individuals to ensure that they read the cathedral working groups report it 's extremely well written it 's very succinct and clear and it is the only authoritative report on the cathedral situation that we have six years ago you voted the council to pause the motion and two lives where was engineering assessment we now have the complete assessment and it is now the duty of the council to ensure that it is fully informed of the report 's findings and to let the people of Christchurch know what you are elected leaders and representatives positions on this matter is I would also suggest that because of the issue about the wider public understanding it would be burnt if you supported the distribution of this report to all council libraries and conspicuous places that drew attention to it it would also be really helpful if the council actually use the media and the press to get the essential messages from this report objectively out there in the public to me looks sadly they haven 't got there yet opinions about this matter unless they have read this report which will taxpayers have spent well over four hundred thousand dollars and a lot of time being for to have this report and if we get this wrong this will be sort of part of the evidence that will shame our city forever because the report concludes that it 's entirely feasible to restore the Cathedral it would be as safe as any modern building and that the fundraising could be done in three to five years and that 's a recommendation to the experts so it 's essential this council steps up and the public know the people for City know that you have given at your in-depth consideration and have formed a view and a position on it and hopefully a supportive position because previously the council needs to contribute on an annual basis to the Cathedral in the square and recognition of its value to the city as a whole and there 's no reason of course if the cathedral is recovered in a way we can all be proud of that the council isn 't making so to endure I 'll be much briefer than mark if I could Leanne just two quick points equip and I would ask the council consider whether the position of the eyesore of the current Cathedral is acceptable to the city certainly not acceptable to me and that a request to enable various benefactors which we could readily put the council in touch with to actually do a bit of improvement in the immediate eyesore situation of it in the next month or three would be a great move and the other thing is that there is opportunity for counselors or the mere and to attend the Synod pre Senate meetings I 'm planning to go to them and speak at those but it would be great to have some representation from our city leaders at those meetings and again would be happy to and the range and enable that those appointments of people are interested just please be in touch great well look thank you for that and you know well I 'm sorry that 's I mean the the downside of this using this component of the meeting seconds there 's just one other point yeah thank you I would like the council also to consider endorsing endorsing the report what I was going to say was that as you say the report was presented in the public arena only three weeks ago I have taken the responsibility as mere to ask staff to prepare a report on it as a matter of agency and the the reason that I 've done there is that there has been no formal process for for the for the city 's consideration other than that report because of course it is anger can church property and it is ultimately the Anglican church 's decision I was I don 't write using the word but blindsided by the decision to refer it to the Synod I didn 't know that that was going to be coming out as a position and so I have I initiated a meeting with the bishop because I felt that we hadn 't had a meeting since my reelection last year and it is really important for the city to be fully engaged and what is an reinforce the point that you made right at the start if the Synod make the decision not to restore the cathedral we will have uncertainty for years and that is something that I don 't think the city can tolerate so I think there is only one decision that actually takes us forward as a city and there is no other decision that will lead to anything else other than uncertainty and legal wrangles for years so so that 's that 's that 's where I 'm coming from I 've asked staff to report urgently so I 'm hoping that within you know within a very short space of time we will have a report that will give us some sense of direction about what we as a city can promote by way of a contribution in terms of the speaking right set at the Synod or at any of the priests entered meetings will certainly be really happy to explore those opportunities and so thank you very much thank you yes but _"

staff who 've spent the last hour or so crunching numbers to come up with a final rates increase figure taking into account all of the amendments and changes that we 've been working on in the previous part of the meeting so Carol did you want to let us know what you 've come up with um five point four one was a draft sugar and we we 've ended up is at five point four six so thank you for giving us a time to go away and confirm that and the most important thing we 've had to do is work out the decimals against the general rates so the general rates that you had at your PAC have changed and the new figures are up on the screen up here that the team have got SAR under point B so those are all slightly increased figures from what thank you so yeah thank you very much indeed for going away and confirming that for us so that now means that we can move to pass more of these resolutions so the first of which is I put clauses three to seven together the council adopts attachment C to G as amended by the meeting I 'm happy to move that do I have a seconder Tim all yawning in terms of the capital program if it 's possible to have our votes recorded against certain elements that were raised like I 've asked if my vote can be recorded against the additional expenditure vaguely oval so can we please note that Jana yo Hanson 's vote is recorded against the additional expenditure of a taglio go over thank you okay so with that exception with one other process question yep um in the draft capital program we 've got a number of the projects that are listed by water and the wrong wards so I just want to make sure that that will be cleaned up prior to being release so fetch my if any changes or errors fix them so a few packs channel those by idea I 've done that already do you want to go through it myself okay alright so if you can work with staff to make sure those things are tidied up that would be great so noting councilors Johansson and swags votes be recorded against capital expenditure Hadley Hagley over oh it 's fine just one other final process question is um are we going to get a letter from is it any letter from audit New Zealand that we should be aware of and for the UM quite a lot of scrutiny but it New Zealand and they will be providing formal letters I understood that there was some discussion or treatment of the crossing carpark in accounting and how that would be handled that 's totally unrelated to the annual plan that 's a separate piece of work that they 're doing great thank you Glenn thank you I 've just over our rates formulation on over a bit a few years ago which actually audit New Zealand missed but end another agency but you know just double-checking rule a few years we had to have a special piece of legislation to that if that wasn 't a special over here it wasn 't a special form like that that was how we were presenting our rates and we fixed it yeah okay just being no that 's fine yeah great okay so these clauses have been moved by me seconded by Tim all in favor against that 's carried thank you and just noting those and vote against there okay so now if we move to item end item eight the council adopts the 2017-18 annual compose it comprising the draft 2017-18 annual plan the mayor 's recommendations the changes set out in attachment C to G noting the amendment to the general rates decimal charge so I again I 'm happy to move that Davis to a second or in favor against that 's carried and then items nine to twelve I moved together so I 'm happy to move those Pauline Cotter is happy to second all those in favor against that 's carried and then items 13 to 16 that the council resolves set rates to 16 of the staff recommendations so I 'm happy to move seconded by raff all in favor against that 's carried so that brings us to the end of the resolutions and in fact the end of this annual planned process I 'm particularly pleased that we 've managed to get this completed this afternoon I think it 's fair to say that some of there 's been some good debate around a number of issues but I 'd particularly like to echo the comments of the mayor at the beginning of the meeting and thank staff and elected members in fact for all of the work that has been put into this process it is run smoothly there 's been a huge amount of work there have been a large number of meetings informal meetings working through some of the items that were brought to the meeting formal discussion today but I 'd like to acknowledge you have a huge amount of work that 's been done by staff preparing the draft annual plan going through the consultation process in dealing with submissions answering the large number of the information to inform good and sensible debate today and that 's work that 's gone on over a number of weeks and I know people have worked long hours and weekends to make sure that we 've had the information that we needed to get to the good result that we have so and thank you very much a start so we now have an annual plan I 'll declare the meeting closed thank you you _"

mean it was I 'm enjoying being paperless but I haven 't quite got my head around the technology yet okay so the the first item that I 'm proposing that we deal with right as the is the yes so the first recommendation as item 22 resolved not to amend at significance and engagement policy to reinstate City clear limited shares as a strategic asset and as I said I have a foreshadowed motion if there is not agreed to so so I will yeah okay so I will I will deal with that first so if councillors refer to the other document which very closing which is sets out where are we sorry [Applause] the

Government Act 2002 which defines a strategic asset as being an asset that the council needs to retain if it is to maintain its capacity to achieve or promote any outcome that the council determines to be important to the current or future well-being of the community in responding to the question what constitutes a strategic asset then perhaps the first thing elected members should think about is what they consider to be important for the current and future well-being of the community what may initially come to mind is efficient and it is efficient an effective infrastructure that provides services such as storm water waste water and water system these are on the strategic assets list along with the council 's waste management system roading network and all the public transport infrastructure owned and operated by the council next might be the council 's community facilities given the the third point is relevant to the cost of providing that infrastructure and those facilities and I guess my pointers as is and there were very mixed views in terms of the submissions we were that were received is that because this is the organization that provides repairs and maintenance and builds that essential critical strategic asset of our infrastructure does not in itself make the make the organization that does that work a strategic asset so what is it about the ownership of city care that creates a strategic value to the city that would only occur in my view if we were able to favor City care in terms of the contracting arrangements which we have which we can 't do so we can 't can 't_''_278.3 say that we will give all of our water services work to silicate we 're just not allowed to do that under our procurement policy it would not be possible city care has responded to the proposal to sell it last year which we did not proceed with in an incredibly positive way they 've actually reviewed their performance and they actually learned I think quite considerably from the process that they went through and I want to kind of commend them for going down that track but I think part of their what the part of the way that they are kind of reinforcing their place and in the marketplace is by ensuring that they are not just in Christchurch so there they are Feb 1 an exemplary contract an Auckland they 've won a wonderful contract up there but they also contract and Wellington so they 're not they 're not a strategist years are not strategic to christchurch city council ownership so that 's why I 'm proposing that we resolve not to amend our significance and engagement policy by reinstating ascitic here is a strategic asset that does not mean that there that the assets that they look after aren 't strategic as the assets that they look after an Auckland our strategic to water care and their strategic to the Auckland City Council and their strategic in terms of Wellington owned assets to their city so to me I think what 's important that we don and I thought that it was that people were quite thoughtful about this but what I really felt was that people were confused about the strategic asset as to whether that meant you had to consult on the sale or not and so it was the consultation that people were focused on rather than focusing on whether they strategic ACH so the consultation that would have to occur if we were to put city care back on the market and there is absolutely no intention no indication that that is something that this council would consider then I think that it 's important to say that of course there would be public consultation if it were to occur because it is a significant asset that doesn 't make it a strategic asset the strategic asset sparks a special consultative process it 's usually done as part of the LTP but it 's an amendment to the LTP it 's the equivalent to the amendment of an LTP as an amendment to the significance and engagement policy and that 's why I think that 's really important that we don 't certainly would have to be consultation so I would ask councillors to resolve not to amend the significance and engagement policy Jamie Andrew thanks agree with the mere I won 't be supporting resolving to put City care on the strategic asset register pretty simple really it 's not a strategic asset so saying that it is doesn 't actually make it one it is quite literally a contracting company that operates in a competitive marketplace it wins some contracts that loses some contracts in actually most of its margins are made in the North Island so what would its strategic purpose be is it price competition and if it is price competition that 's a bit of a nebulous argument because there are enough local businesses in the marketplace to ensure that that price competition exists certainly in Christchurch for obvious reasons is it dividends is that the income stream given that it doesn 't just service Christchurch would that mean then that we had she is an 0 or rhymin that that 's a strategic AC of course not that would provide us a good income stream but 't be supporting putting that on the strategic asset register not because I intend to sell it we don 't intend to sell it and actually doesn 't stop you selling it anyway but it 's just shows that you don 't really understand the meaning of the word it is simply not a strategic asset it is a contracting company so for that reason I won 't be supporting it ng in my view there are two aspects to the strategic value that City care has to the city the first of which is its profitability and the dividend that it returns and the other of which is the local capacity that it provides and I 'm going to keep what I 'm going to say to the strategic value that I believe City Care has rather than whether we should continue to own the city care or what level of consultation there would be whether it was listed as a strategic asset or not because whether it 's strategic or not is what today 's debate is about so city care returns over six million dollars in profit benefit of the dividend from all of the C CHL companies is that it is that it keeps the rates down and that actually brings about a a social benefit it 's interesting to note that with the exception of red bus City care is the only one of the C CHL companies that isn 't listed as a strategic asset we are very aware that the dividends that come from the CC HL companies yeah do keep the the rates down bring about social benefits allow us to do more than we otherwise would be able to do as a council without the resulting impact on rates we 've also heard recently through the finance and performance committee but capacity and resourcing in maintenance is an issue maintenance of parks and gardens in particular maintenance of roading and footpaths in particular have been big issues to our community are issues of key importance to our community relate to community well-being and we heard a number of submissions through this annual plan process as part of a pattern of submissions we 've heard over a number of years that these the way that our communities feel and the effect that the infrastructure maintenance has on community well-being through our strategic directions conversation we 've discussed that in order for our communities to thrive not only do we need to have infrastructure delivered through our capital program but that infrastructure needs to be maintained so that it 's fit for purpose so that it supports good social economic and environmental outcomes all of which are absolutely key to the strategic objectives that we 've been discussing now whilst accepting that City care is a contracting company another part of the value that City care has to us is that we know while we 've got City care we 've got capacity and in a city where in recent years we 've experienced floods we 've experienced other weather events we 've experienced earthquakes we 've experienced landslip that 's absolutely important to the well-being of our city the recent city care restructure can only add to the commercial ability of city care to return a profit and the dividend which adds to the strategic value that City Care brings us because being removed from the strategic assets list at the time that the last council made that decision and therefore I 'll be opposing the recommendation today clean thank you i similarly oppose the recommendation today we 've been asked to look at three things as per the report on page 76 so what we consider to be important relation to the current or future well-being of the community was also achieve our objectives and thirdly assets on that list we may decide our strategic why don 't you put it to you that you may wish to consider that City cares more strategic than you realize then we all realize if I hold up the four well-beings which is still a part of our local government consideration I can see that there are four bottom lines that actually cascade out of those in relation to City care there is a sense of community ownership in relation to the social well-being which City care delivers on I 'm going to come to that a bit later they are local and they have partner shifts in the community we know about the the rates down but along with those two are the environmental and cultural well-being and in that respect to further bottom lines which are ticked here I want to use one example and that 's in regard to the Aven or Tucker or network they are assisting them at the moment pro bono with the development of a cycle trail on top of the urgent work around the temporary stop banks that 's being undertaken they 're completing the hard infrastructure at the Mahina Kai site and ends of the wooden boardwalks bridges and jetties but most importantly the feedback I have locally is that they are the only contractors with the ecological sensitivity to do a good maintenance job with the plantings now this complements our resolution that we have that we are making today over biodiversity in this annual plan about identifying areas having potentially significant indigenous vegetation and habitat types yes we all know it 's a contracting company but in that procurement policy is a by local section which actually counts a councillor cure and promoted at the time we put forward the policy so when City care would rate very highly in terms of what you would want by way of a local contract so I put it to you these actually a community contract here there is actually a social dividend there are a four bottom lines it 's more than just an economic or financial dividend producing company and for those reasons alone I oppose that amendment and if there 's another foreshadowed one I would support that at that time which would put City care back most firmly as a strategic on the strategic assets list thank you we 've had to speaking and support other than opposition is there anyone else that like to speak in support motion David there are just like to support Jamie 's comments the and Aamir 's comment that we have at the stage have no intention of selling city Kiev that is a contracting company the services that city care provide we can we could get from any one of a number of countries companies around the city and the country so I will be supporting the mayor 's recommendation so if I take Yanni there anyone else that would like to speak in support because we have three speaking on one side so Yanni I 'm just upper with suspended standing orders as well so okay okay okay fine um okay I 'll keep it brief and let repeat that other things that have been said for the arguments about why I believe it 's important to reinstate City care as a strategic asset but the one thing I did want to pick up on is that I get concerned that there 's this thinking that for some reason we can 't directly negotiate with our own ccos in fact the orders of general has released very clear guidelines and I just wanted to quote what it says it says there is no restriction in the act on a local authority awarding contracts to its ccos this is a matter of policy for local authorities the local authorities procurement policy should cover contracting with ccos and how it fits with the local authorities overall policy and strategy in some instances local authorities might have strategic reasons for giving their CCO his work such as think to understand that owning city care is incredibly strategic for us as a city for the reasons that have been made in terms of the dividends that come in also for the things that we can expect non financial returns such as the social and community partnerships and engagements that they may wish to choose and we can set that through things like the statement of intent feedback and the lead of expectations through cchr so in my view it 's absolutely essential that we put city care back on the strategic asset list if there is no desire to further sell it which I don 't have of which I do have sorry I don 't have any desire to further engage in any sales process of it I think the submissions we heard through this process were overwhelming last year and this year about the reason why and one of the comments was made it was to give certainty to City care as an organization about what its future would be and I think today we can do that I think it 's in our best interest asset list and there 's huge strategic advantage to having local ownership of a local company doing local work in our city thank you I 'll take the other two just because ends clarifying whether they have to be sequentially or or not so I 'll take Dion and then Phil all I was going to say is yeah all I was going to say is actually I 'll support the foreshadowed motion so I won 't be supporting the quillion City care while keeping city care off the strategic asset list purely for the simple factor that we haven 't really talked about the people City care have a lot of people and they are strategic and they are an asset to our city and I believe that giving them the certainty as yarny just said is vitally important to the city moving forward and if we 're the city of opportunity I actually want to stabilize and actually give people in our organizations the confidence to actually do things differently and actually if has strategic our procurement policy doesn 't allow us to do what we want to it simple but the people of that organization are strategic and they 're an asset um yo T um but if I take full so you are you speaking for or against yes it does because right then I 'll take Thal and that 'll be the end of the debate thank you oh oh I just saw almost can 't believe that in fact pick counselors would have a perception that City care is not strategic there 's huge institutional knowledge and retained by that by that company we own it can I just say it was a major flood say tomorrow or next week like we had in March 2014 clearly City care would be strategic in terms of fixing our city in terms of looking after air people they have that institutional knowledge they have that detailed historical knowledge around how our waterways work and and that that is invaluable and in that sense its strategic and so I 'll certainly be voting against us and supporting an amendment thank you all right I will put the motion all those in favor say aye no you can three spoken favor three one two three I said that we would put the motion after in terms of the Standing Orders for three speaking on one side so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's lost I will now accept the foreshadowed motion which is the a so oh that all those that that voted for the motion so that some Gulf East Manji queuing Scandrick in mere in mere okay so the foreshadowed motion is moved by Councillor Johansson seconded by Councillor chin and read have you got it there I thought I had these recommendations not you didn 't have the wedding that the council amended strategic asset list in its significance and engagement policy to return by addition note as sees willing to be agreed on the day okay the council means its strategic asset list in its significance and engagement policy or to be took to resolve to amend its significance and engagement policy to reinstate City clear limited shares as a strategic asset is so it 's just the inverse of mine alright so amend that significance and engagement policy to reinstate city care limited shares as a strategic asset it 's a complete inverse of mine yes no no it was the foreshadowed motion which was a complete invasive of the motion but it 's the same motion it 's and that 's the inverse because we 've already dealt with it as a council we were going to deal with us as one but look you know if I 'm a reasonable person but you know we have got a very large amount of work to get through and we agreed that the Standing Orders would apply to the speaking Arrangements we agreed that during the whole process but anyway okay I 'll call you but I hope that you 're the only speaker on it I don 't think it 's going to change anyone 's view of what 's going to happen I just think it 's a democratic right I actually voted to look at the sale of City Kia having gone through that process I am completely sure that we cannot look at the sale of City care the work that City care has done and its restructuring we have to support them in that restructuring and support them as much as we can in terms of what we can do for them I agree that City care is has really major assets in terms of its water capability particularly particularly its water capability but I think having gone through that attempt at Sale which was not successful we now we literally cannot look at selling city care for ten years anyway so it totally may as well be on the strategic asset list but what we need to do is provide the reassurance for those staff there and for the people who are working very hard to make sure that City care actually works City care is in my view a successful social enterprise the profits come back to the community so that 's why my view has changed and that 's why I wanted to explain the difference in my voting thank you right I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so that those that oppose this motion I 'm going to vote for the motion now that that 's been foreshadowed so so who are opposed east Gulf Eastern Gulf thank you so that motion is carried now we move on to the new bright and hot saltwater pools project and my recommendation is that we confirm the further funding of eleven point two million for the whole saltwater pools project noting that 7.3 million is included in the annual plan for the delivery of phase one so this adds to that and we have two amendments one as an amendment councillor Davidson did you have a seconder for your amendment yes here Tim Burton so and that amendment is that the proposed additional funding of eleven point two million as deferred for three years to at our time to assess the impact of the new eight million dollar waterfront playground the rebuilt 36 million dollar qe2 and other associated regeneration projects and the New Brighton area so we 'll deal with that one first so so that 's mood counselor Davidson seconded counselor Templeton so of call Mike Davidson to speak to it thank you I increase to the hot saltwater pools at this point of time in a post disaster environment when we 're constantly seeing rates increases of 5% year after year it is inviting important to rebuild what we have lost and at the same time prioritize what needs to be done I would agree that we have to look at new opportunities to bring on new ideas but we have to ensure that when we do this we do not create a burden to the citizens of Christchurch and what we build actually achieves the desired outcome and I met a heron tyson oxide on a project may sound we correctly prioritize what is needed for both the suburb concerned and the city I 'm not going to touch on the coastal hazards or the fact that there 's five significant aquatic facilities currently proposed to be built in a very short period of time but I want to have a look at what the point of this is this hot saltwater pool was meant to regenerate the suburb of New Brighton but with 80% of the locals spent outside of this leakage the pier currently attracts 10,000 visitors a month and that has not regenerated New Brighton and the hot saltwater pools is not going to reach that straightaway it is a tourist attraction and New Brighton does not need another tourist attraction it is a reason to cross the road to and fix the core that Brighton need DC will have a signal an attempt to look at the core and a working and Abidin doing a lot of great things so why would we build an aquatic tourist attraction without first fixed in the fundamental issue that New Brighton has which is the core I 'm totally supportive of work being done a new Brighton including all the work on it infrastructure the eight million dollar free water playground and the rebuilding of Kiwi and I applaud DCL with their vision but I think we 're making a mistake when we decide to build a hot saltwater pools at this time everything our use yes let 's fix the right it 's let 's fix the core let 's rebuild curly let 's build a flesh free to use to really look hard at what we 're doing a New Brighton there is a lot of capital expenditure going on and you 're buying at the moment and over the next few years this hot saltwater pool is not going to help new bryden 's problems it is the core that is the problem with New Brighton not having a tourist attraction because they already have a tourist attraction it is called the pier if you listen to the community board they tell you all the great things have been embroidered all the events they have a New Brighton that attract thousands and thousands of people they come to you button but they do not shop in your Brighton this is the reason and that 's what we need to focus on not the hot saltwater pools I 'm not against the hot saltwater pools but we should not be doing it this point of time we need to defer for three years that all the infrastructure get fixed let the Corps be fixed build the free water playground and then have a look at the impact of those going to vote against this um remit and I would like to just emphasize that Mike is right in one point that the Corps is a problem for business core is an issue in New Brighton what I think is missing in this discussion is really emphasis that DCL have put into working in New Brighton over a long period now there 's been significant engagement this community has been consulted on a number of things have been consulted to death and as I said in my earlier address successive annual plans and submissions to the annual plan have seen local numbers of submission from the people of the eastern suburbs they have signaled their desire to get on with this project in my mind there are three core activity three calls to the rejuvenation of Christchurch the pier was built and yes it is an asset that hot saltwater pools is the second part of the jigsaw and the rejuvenation of the blood source core is the third you cannot separate the three they are totally integrated I I totally support the work that DCL have done and recognize put into supporting this project we have gone through an annual plan process and confer and signaled our intention to put eleven point two million dollars into this project that is a process that has been thorough it has been robust that has gone through every mechanism you could probably entail and at the last moment now to derail work and near Brighton would be a travesty and I would shudder to think the reaction that would result from the eastern suburbs if this project was to be further delayed the three parts are integral and I just cannot reiterate enough the amount of time consultation work that DCL have put into this project it is all geared to go and the asset in the end and I would dispute councillor Davison some assertion that is just it 's just a tourist attraction for New Brighton has not wanted we do need points of difference in the East and this the research and the DCL have done going strongly to the support of this facility and I just need you to reject this motion and move forward hey Glenn thank East I always have I 've been with them from the word go from 2011 I rode with you dead through the flooded streets of big city after the quake we were giving out hot food from helicopters delivered we were giving out water meeting people at the driveways I 'm not sure that there are many other parts of the city that have been through that experience let 's put the emotion to one side for one minute hmm we 've all been over this subject many times we 've looked at this in terms of this public investment kick-starting private development in New Brighton we know there is no magic silver bullet we 've all acknowledged that but we 've gone with this with we 've examined the business case I know we 're going to be talking about the natural hazards dimension of it later we accept that so that so do the residents in the East I talked about the for well beings before and city care ticking those boxes I think this does for the community as well and I implore you to support you a tick for New Brighton is a tick for the whole city so this just isn 't about one ward this award belongs to all of us it is technically David 's ward which he represents but I stand with him and I encourage you all to stand with him today to support the East this is about the regeneration of this this part of our city I acknowledge the mayor 's part and ensuring that you bright and ended up in the regeneration act for the city because she saw that we had an immense challenge to overcome and this is our job to overcome immense challenges so I encourage you to get behind this these are we are any councillor Templeton in your words those hard-hit by life because that 's how many in you Brighton would describe themselves they 've never had much to go on and it 's well known that natural disasters amplify existing social conditions this is one example so I can 't see why you wouldn 't support this part of the city and I look forward to a good strong vote for our city thank you Andrew then Sara thank you there 's a community expectation that we will deliver on this and that expectation has been raised through a number of plans and a number of consultations councils plans councils consultations and the previous council and this council have certainly raised that expectation raised that anticipation that we will deliver on this project the original resolution led by mayor in the previous term of council was a bold one and this project has been referred to today as a tourist attraction I would prefer to think of it more as a recreational facility it 's part of a joined-up approach in the work that DCL is doing in the new brighton core and we know that an integrated approach is the only approach that will work for New Brighton and we also know that New Brighton and the East desperately need opportunity desperately need intervention we 've heard time and time again from submitters that the East is lacking in facilities to allow that to happen and this is the opportunity we have a regeneration opportunity in New Brighton of which that we 've got a responsibility to deliver against that expectation that we 've raised not least the expectation that New Brighton will once again be a thriving suburb a destination and a place that people love to live so I 'll be opposing this amendment today ok um Sara thank you it is clear from the Mays comment and in the report here that there was clear support through the annual plan process for hot saltwater pools and I can see why if they get built I will probably go and use them but I won 't go and buy a coffee afterwards I will sit in the pools I will enjoy the view but it 's not going to help the core what community wouldn 't support having a facility like this one in the local community but that doesn 't necessarily mean that we 're doing good decision-making here there was overwhelming support in the form of a very long petition for a set of traffic lights that here would Bruns but we were being very clear that it would be poor decision making to base our we 've had for the hot pulse we have raised expectations on many things over the years as a council many many things people have had all sorts of expectations of the rebuild that isn 't necessarily going to lead us to good decision-making and we need to at the fore of everything keep good decision-making at heart here it was clear from the submissions that there was a lack of knowledge in the community about what we 're already doing comments like we 've got nowhere to swim where am I going to have my swimming lessons in and the council has done nothing for New Brighton with the reasons given for supporting the hot salt water pulse there is a lack of knowledge of the rebuild of Kiwi 236 million dollars eight million dollars spent on the waterfront a lack of knowledge of the the the the master plan funding in other works that are planed for the Corps and New Brighton and that doesn 't lead to good decision making it leads to support for a project that will not be needed in the short term I years there will be a lot of work done and Brighton and we will be able to see the impact Brighton is already a very community community the community would have told us it 's a hundred and eighty different groups in the area they already get a lot of visitors these pools aren 't going to deliver the community outcomes needed in that area it will deliver a nice place for people to go in such and look at the sea those who need to soak their aching bones will go to the new hydrotherapy pool at qe2 that the community board have just approved to go into that facility that doesn 't mean that we need hot saltwater pools what I hear outside the annual plan process from people at Brighton is not build us hot pools it 's fix our streets it 's value us it 's fix our more those are the things that people proactively say outside the annual plan process when you get a small group of people going we really want pools let 's get a whole part of proformance together we 've to get signatures for that 's not good decision-making the 11 million dollars should be spent on areas that are the hardest hit by life that don 't really have 36 million dollar pools and 8 million-dollar playgrounds being built thank you yeah thank you look I 've got Yanni fajita man Darren so you know I 'm just saying that I 'm trying to structure this so it were I mean obviously there 'll be less speakers and final debate on the on the actual motion so rather than on the amendment but you know we 'll take it as that people were going to be helpful when moving things along so Yanni cool so I support this amendment and that 's consistent with the view that was taken when we first agreed as the draft annual plan and the idea I just want to support the comments that we made the idea that we 've done nothing in New Brighton does get a little bit tiresome when you look at the number of projects that even before the earthquake council had done the pier the library the mall new writing and it hasn 't had the desired consequences that that people have expected so I think what 's really important for New Brighton is not to do nothing but is to understand what the impact of what we 're doing it is going to be and given that we 've committed a huge amount of money already just recently to doing those things then I think we should wait I just want to read you an Edward de Bono quote in the future instead of striving to be right at a high cost it will be more appropriate to be flexible and plural at a lower cost if you cannot accurately predict the future then you must flexibly be prepared to deal with various possible futures and we just had a city leaders forum last night where actually this whole idea of trialing things understanding things learning from things as we go was thought of as a kind of really good way of doing doing things in fact I was amazed to hear that apparently there was a question around whether the stadium and the Convention Center can 's what I 've read in an email the sodding so you know like we should be open to getting these new ways of understanding by experimenting by trialing and by looking and evaluating what we 've done so that we can get a better outcome I 've personally never supported the business case for the hot saltwater pools that we 've been given from day one I 've always thought it 's a hugely ambitious business case not based on reality but based on hugely aspirational assumptions to justify a project that I don 't believe will have the benefits but I 'm not saying that I 'm against up I 'm supporting the amendment to say let 's just park it and do the first stage and then see where we go from there okay a whole community is expecting them a whole community is excited about them and I think they will make a difference in Brighton I will go and sit on a hot saltwater pool and I will go for a coffee afterwards at over switch info or be a lion or any one of we I don 't agree with David that the whole thing is an integral package that this we have to support the core of Brighton as well I don 't want rate payers money compulsorily invested in retail outlets I think that 's a highly risky business especially given the technological disruption that will happen in retail and I think Brighton probably needs to look at reinventing itself slightly so that it 's not completely reliant on retail and I think it 's needs to do that slightly differently than expecting us to guarantee property purchases or anything of the of the sort in the retail area but in terms of a facility for the city that is about hot pools I think the whole city wants that and I think the logical place for it to be is that Brighton Beach I think it 's an awesome place for it to be and I love the fact that there 's a whole big free hot water playground alongside there and I love the fact that qe2 is being reinstated and I love the fact that Shirley boys is going think it 's great and for I think what we need to remember is that all of us in this city need a sense of belonging that the people in the east need that sense of belonging that sense of excitement that this is a great community and for this for the same reason I won 't support any delay in the pool at Linwood or Hornby because those communities also need that sense that things are happening that there is really cool things happening in their community and that they belong to a great community where they can go to places cheaply or freely and be hugely respected at those places because that 's what part of living in Christchurch is about so I 'm totally in favor of the hot water pools and Brighton and I won 't be to that supporting any delay in them terminal thank you know I 'm going to support the hot water pools I think you know David um Mike was quite right with regards to his comments of the core there 's no question and no argument about there but to something there must be some kind of stimulus to attract them there and I think that because of the situation they 're in it is Council that must lead it and I think that for us to put salt water pools another attraction in there that will hopefully stimulate something further in that core is essential I can 't think more wonderful than sitting in a hot water pole after a surf with that beautiful Vista I mean I mean I am one of those people that goes to the mall and looks at new surfboards and realize I 've got to pray for my children so I just go past the window but I do think it 's really essential that we start looking at what we 're going to invest in there and what the stimulus into that core will be and if we can get a brand like Save Mart or something in there that will be to save it well cut no no hungry people travel to Hornish hey we 're smart sorry I new GPU so I go shopping it 's pretty embarrassing yeah but that the council must invest in that area to get investment in that core and it 's not going to come any other way I do want to make another comment really interesting we keep talking about the easterly in Christchurch nan mentions that in tomorrow I think you 've all being down to Caroline babe and it 's been blowing and I actually think it 's worse and Dunedin interesting enough on the news that said 8 degrees in the halls of residence with my daughter is that had the reality check of what the true temperature was it was then it was minus one so the windchill factor in Dunedin was 9 degrees because our sick of students coming to Dunedin and getting freezing so I think that we 've actually got to change your perception and forget about easterly look at that wonderful kilometres and kilometres are beautiful sand I should go the surf in there because I 'm so bad whatever else goes to some nurse that 's great but I just think we 've got to change a whole attitude and start selling Brighton but start by saying you chin coach daughter to go to prison because it 's a minimum of 17 degrees there and not one might University she could work there probably being you know have a sleepover now I will support Mike 's arm motion here to defer this and I 'll do that for a few reasons if this was a different neighborhood if it wasn 't New Brighton if it was out where I live and he would it wouldn 't even be a debate the people in my neighborhood wouldn 't be asking for this because our neighborhoods not broken and the reason why the people in New Brighton are hanging on to this particular item so much I believes because we still haven 't fix their streets properly the places still you go over that bridge would it 's kind of a bridge it looks like something out of a war movie it 's been wrecked and that then that if the neighborhood have been restored a couple of years ago back to how it was pretty quick we they wouldn 't be asking for all these 've actually been misled a little with the hot pulse there 's other tracks that could go out there that could do really well they 've really got some of the best the pier is a fantastic attraction the ocean itself is probably the best attraction I 've gotten I 've got heaps of that in yet that 's what I believe the attraction that New Brighton should have always been it should have been something that 's educational that looks to the future of how we interact with oceans and something that would attract visitors from around the world and across the city to go and be part of their ocean and to use it in a different way than sitting in some water that 's had salt added to it it 's not the ocean water you 're sitting in it 's fresh water tap water that we 're going to put salts in and then you 'd sit there at a huge cost heating it not like hymnal where the heat comes out of the ground and so I think it 's a little misleading yet the be one of the best in the country certainly it 'll be the best waterfront one in the country that in itself is an attraction the cause not right we know that and us stepping in to save that I don 't know if that will work I think there 's a number of different ways of doing that and we should be looking for more solutions and then just this one and the qe2 site is another great pool facility that 's just down the road from where we 're going to put an aquatic facility to try and attract people across the city to use I 'm at the points that were raised by the mover of the amendment and I think justify it being here in the support of other councils Jimmy aye sir local councillor Holmby area I won 't suffer this one because wider if we back to the February no we consider this one either at Easter area they have a qe2 for 30 million dollars for the new Leisure Centre also the council dedicate for a medium house so poor you know but drop to the the annual plan in the week other feedback majority prefer you know to the these the earth new facility so if a moment if with with support this amendment how do we to face those the majority majority the the resistance this my pet eager concern so timing is the difference another wise we establish the development of the the kind of the limit you know we should dedicate them to rebuild reconstruction of our city otherwise they have no sufficient so see how to make it a shapen is my concern even I 'm in the southwest area this my my mind my point of view so I cannot support these amendments but is the same situation though we might have the lingual the poor we might have the southwest or the poor already you know in a long-term prayer also in the southwest area plane we already know discuss this issue already the the put into the long-term plan a new plane so it 's not a good timing you know this time we reject or refuse those of facility yeah I think um I back to Mike for summing up but you brought in lost its mojo when it lost its monopoly on Saturday trading and it was a very long time ago I mean New Brighton was crowded with people and I 'm afraid that the one hasn 't changed its direction and and all that time it was crowded every Saturday because it was the only place you could go to shop when the earthquakes happened New Brighton looked to its Council and said and and ended she looked at what was happening in the center of the city to with all of the anchor projects and the legacy that was being created for the center and said how about using the earthquakes as an opportunity to create a legacy for us and when we came in as account so we said yeah we think that 's a good idea and more importantly and M perhaps we didn 't capture this right at the time of asking the community what they would like as a legacy project this is a this is what the community said they wanted this has come from good for you bright and reseed we will put five million dollars on budget for a legacy the legacy they chose the hot saltwater pools we couldn 't do for five million dollars that 's why we went out and consulted on the annual plan in the community came back and they said that this was really important but what we hadn 't contemplated was that you Brighton is the destination on the journey from the city to the sea along what will be formally known as the residential red zone and that makes it really important that what is a New Brighton is not only good for the for the area of New Brighton but that it 's actually really an important destination for the whole of the city and that 's why I don 't think that this is actually about bright and that 's why our staff but I think the most fundamentally important question when you take out all the New Brighton submissions all the form submissions was their majority support from the submissions that came in for this and there was so the rest of is an important thing for New Brighton so I can 't support the amendment I 'll be supporting the motion to support this so Mike thank you this is really really interesting I guess because you know with city councillors obviously we have to look at what 's best for the city and as you said this this project started at five million dollars and it 's obviously crept up and up and up and and for some reason once we put an idea in someone 's mind and they say yes we can 't then change it and where does that lead us as a city into the future we 're looking at a and then you 'll player now but next time it 's the long term plan and we 're putting so many projects into sitting them in concrete for this annual plan that when we get to the long term plan we 're going to be stuck and we won 't be able to get these rates down people are actually struggling out there and yeah the hot saltwater pools great idea but let 's get let 's see what else we can do to to help you brighten but eleven million dollars additional to the actual eight million dollars already there we 're looking at twenty million dollars and the reports that I 've seen show that fourteen million dollars to do the hot saltwater part is not enough so they 're going to be coming back again and I 'll come back again soon as has went out into the public domain they hit those coals to put a roof on it so even they are not happy with what we 're saying it 's just going to keep snowballing we really need to have a check on what we 're doing there and by pausing this for three years we 'll get that it 's not saying no to it because I think a hot sort of pool would be good for the city but it 's not the right time thank you all right we 'll I 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no or that 's lost do you want to record the names hands so that 's Templeton Davidson cure and Johansson thank you and the second amendment is moved by Councillor clearwater ii accounts Licata prior to the construction of the hot spot would oppose information on relevant coastal hazards and any hazard mitigation work may be required as provided to counsel counsel satisfaction is it yep Phil so counsels I am supporting the whole hot sort would oppose today however I think windy as a council we need to be prudent and I want to speak briefly about our strategic framework I know that 's in draft form but just to remind you that in fact one of what I 'm one of the our strategic priorities a quote from it is that we be informed and a proactive approaches to natural hazard risks and council that 's part of to be councils focus ready for improvement and I think morally clear that at a strategic level as a council we can 't just react to any natural hazard that may happen including coastal hazards we 'll need to be proactive and plan for the risk to mitigate or manage there would council do to reduce that risk and it 's been said earlier in the debate this is a large investment decision 19 million dollars and F natural hazards are to impact on this project we 'd need to know the costs of that mitigation and because in fact will almost certainly be unable to afford any retrofitting after construction so or it 's I think it would be huge cost I also think that what I 'm proposing is part of really working in partnership with DCL and I also think that you know basically my amendment is really looking at how can we reduce any risks to council into DCL and I think it 's what my amendment does is it really supports good governance as part of the way we work as council so I urge you to vote for this I think this is a sensible way forward right sorry this is this is a jerk is it possible to ask a question about this because to me isn 't this going to just be part of the resource consent process I don 't know exactly in then I don 't even issue with him I think I actually think we 're stepping over the boundary of governance and management and we have the source considered only Mississippi question yeah no no and yeah okay so I 'm just wondering whether I mean I would have thought that this would have been a requirement of the resource consent exactly so you know I mean they can 't get a resource consent without meeting certain requirements but but I have no problem and I 'm sure that DC I 'll have no problem in terms of reporting to counsel you know I mean and it is an issue that their counselors have an interest in sorry I hadn 't even focused my attention on on the amendment because it wasn 't and in my mind it was just asking for information to be provided worries me is that the resource consent process takes into account this type of thing in that type of area what worries me that it provides another opportunity for counselors to kind of dig their toes in above what actually the counsel organizations may have operational impacts that 's all any consenting conditions may have future or picks conditions for counsel but that they 're done through the resource consent process Brendon can you help so just to respect a counselor majors question both the resource consent in the building consenting process will take into account both the current and future hazards Anette location and I think the intent of the Christian is to ensure that this resolution didn 't unduly delay any of the work so maybe if some wood smithing of the resolution because the intent of it is will be taken account of it as part of the resource and building consent processing but I don 't think anyone would is intending that construction is delayed while a parallel process have reported the councillors report no say nothing can happen without a consent and if the consent changes things like budgets will require its counselor Clearwater and Cotter are happy then I 'm happy to add the some words to to my recommendation which is be notes that DCL will will report to Council on the coastal has a slash before that for their consents into gear so it 's a that way they 're reporting to us it 's just providing us advice really so it will be in addition to to the amendment the note there 's no need for the amendment well we can withdraw the amendment well what what I think is we it 's I 'm trying to be helpful I realize that we no amendment with the requirement the of chopped off of requiring two counselor satisfaction does in fact conflate the consenting authority role of staff and granting the resources and building consent if there is the decision Bank versus a council satisfaction that 's all I 'm trying I did not read it that way so and if that 's what 's intended I won 't be supportive I 'm only prepared to change the words and delete the words to counsel satisfaction to make it clear that in fact the information comes to Council there 's no just note that detail will report to Council on the coastal hazard mitigation required for their consent well I think Rudy I think my that the the risk mitigate any risk mitigation required will be very clear to Council and it is part of their strategic priorities if we if we don 't we 're not following yesterday sorry sorry tell me what it is about noting that DCL will report to Council on this on the coastal hazard slash mitigation required for their consents because if they 're if they 're going to come and tell us what they 're putting up as mitigation for their consents how is that not before they start construction and also suggest that we as a council may override the resource consent potentially issued by the council organization we can 't we website that 's the whole point so I don 't_''_3885.45 I don 't know I mean we 're going to get zillions of reports as we go through the whole process detailed design detailed budget the whole caboodle but the resource consent piece and the Coast hazards is part of the organization 's job my note notes that DCL will provide ongoing reports to counsel including on the coastal hazard mitigation required for their consent time that they 're lodging their consent all right so that 's so that now we can now move to the actual motion which is to confirm funding and I 'm not going to speak again because I 've already spoken on the amendment so yeah I 'm just wondering at what point was referes just mentioning you know the whole process then coming back all the time and as part of us as counsel actually signing off on the design or scope or as all of that work going with DCL like the playground ders I just I just not clear at what point it comes back to council looking so I don 't relish Christmas give us a ten years that DCL in the DCO board have the delegation subject to council making this resolution to grant them the money on final sign-off but is part of DC ELLs reporting in really that council owns DCL I 'm sure that they will be keeping gets are well informed of the scope in specification issues throughout so that might be something that you wanted to add into a note to go out including on coastal hazards indoor design including including scope and design yeah end on the coat and including our goalie note that and um one thing is that the DCL in the DCI board will make that final determination this is going to be a council owned SES so I think we need to have something in there about opera operational costs surely this is only part of the business case of DC l have been putting together over months now anyway is there any any building that is in the LTP it is not going to be built before June next year is it no sorry it would be really good to be able to see there is a council decision rather than a community board one they 've done all this work with the community this is about sign L from the budget the detailed design will be done together with the community so no matter what customers are raising is that there are that scope and design will have an impact on topics and and so they 're just asking for some you know then at the appropriate time so I think it 's absolutely essential because I mean pause you know they could design anything that could leave us to a future rate purse with quite a high contribution to make it only not further yeah yeah um any other large project comes me to council sign-off implications as part of the LTP so yes it 's just a bit ruling for debt decision yet yeah all right okay so I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so those opposed Erin Yani Mike and Sarah right thank you so the next item on the agenda is our recreation charges which we also consulted on we have an amendment but the amendment relationship relates to Lynwood Wilston pool so it 's not or actually and we have another amendment in relation to extending the hours so can you move the the second amendment because it 's not it 's an additional it 's an it 's adding it 's adding a recommendation it 's not it 's not required to be dealt with to be dealt with for this to be dealt with but the Galloway chin amendment is which is supporting the staff recommendation sorry free entry to swimming pools for preschoolers but with an amendment that this to be extended to 00 p.m. weekdays and include weekends so the recommendation that 's come through from from the work that I 've done with people is around visiting any swimming pool open between 9 a.m. 3 p.m. on school days to have free entry 1 accompanying adult currently has free entry to be carried out on a trial basis over the financial year ahead and that includes now the green prescription so so we 've got an amendment which would increase the hour so I would actually propose that we just have a single discussion around us but I will call councillor Galloway to speak to the amendment questions oh okay can we can we get a quick cost implication of extending that the hours is also so good there 's two questions two questions one is what is that what are the cost implications of extending it to 00 p.m. weekdays the implications for the polls when the busiest periods of the day you have an influx of additional preschoolers the first question it 's difficult to quantify accurately at this point but I would imagine the the cost would increase by about 50% the to 120,000 dollars per annum that is a educated estimate rather than a fixed cost of more concern to us would be the capacity of the pools our busiest after school the rationale behind this proposal is that preschoolers have the opportunity to swim whilst school is in session the facilities are quieter the health and safety risks are low up and people generally have a better time it also assists in building up numbers in a quiet time if we were to schedule preschoolers and offer them advantage at the same time as our busiest time I think we get quite a customer backlash and we would congest our facilities I probably proceed with caution yeah I 'm Erin did you have a question my is that just on the amount the 80,000 that 's in there is there the amount of tickets we currently 's a an estimated loss of revenue being tickets we wouldn 't click and then the other one is here it says September 2 equal to we need 17 section that read 18 because it 's otherwise it 's been yeah they September 17 to a pronounced ability for that sorry very good well-spotted I don 't even know does it alright a thank you good points John I think the reason I 'd like he has to be extended is because many preschoolers are actually an early childhood education during the day because their mums are working so those families that we are trying to target probably wouldn 't be able to take advantage of this after-school many families come to the pool for swimming lessons they often have preschoolers along with them it would be quite nice to be able to listen the financial burden on the family by just perhaps providing a discount for the preschooler and also the weekend is often the only time when families have time together because of people having to work so for all those reasons I think that it would be azimuth and the sir proposal this is to me I would like to have a comment actually is we is not a decision other we all sell to thought because from the wider community spatial follows the parents of the three school kids under five years or eight year in the southwest area I heard a lots of people told me they the parent culminated you know this for the the preschool the kids in the early stage they have opportunity to learn the swimming this way we will be the crucial for them also the pair and those that keep you up intimated relationship given the list you know the swimming the together ACH so Palace amendment even is a small thing you know from the VPN to the 00 p.m. also in considered a weekend but it 's a bigger the step of a council give the people stronger signal in the council would like to take a more positive way to provide the service to the community to other people so I urge all the the councillors fully support this amendment I 'm sorry but you don speakers on this amendment Yani yeah I strongly support the extension of the amendment I do wonder about the costs and I actually think it would be a great problem to have that more people went to our recreation facilities particularly preschoolers I did wonder whether we needed to just what I guess we 'll we 've got a point B there so I 'll save my comments well sorry I 'll just I 'll just include my comments now rather than debate it later but just to say that I think is part of the LTP you know we really do need to look at what we can do more than this but I appreciate that we 're going to do a lot of work for the LTP has already been discussed so this is a good starting point and I think would be really interesting to see how it goes I was actually came to do it I 'm sooner than September I 'm not quite sure what the rationale was behind September and whether we couldn 't just do it from the 1st of July so I and a seconder had thought about that but yeah I 'm really happy to support the amendment so since I stopped John from entering into the debate I now know why he was frantically waving his arm in the year which was that his calculation didn 't include weekends so be considerably more than the amount that he gave is a calculated but nevertheless estimate so I 'm I 'm not supportive of making this amendment I think that the idea of getting our swimming pools available for use during the times when it is more their down time than their busy time that to me is where we start I 'm in favor of of making sure that this is part of the LTP process I think there 's been there was a lot of public feedback on it and people were very supportive around making these facilities accessible but also I think that learn to swim really touched a chord and it wasn 't just with children either there are adults and I don 't know if people have seen the the television ad which I think 's of adults who actually never have learned to swim and you know thinking about how we as a as a community a wider community might address some of those those issues will be really important so we 're having the debate well I wanted to see me move of the amendment might agree to take the weekends out and have it more likely to go through to five I 'm not no it 's not appropriate I mean I think that I think well anyway Andrew I mean in the situation that we 're in where the advice that was given by staff prior to starting debates has now been rescinded corrected call it what you will I mean I think that is a course for maybe a slightly different approach or if you 'd like to take over the cherry the BT that 's fine yes I know but the thing is is that an amendment to me it makes no difference whether you take the weekends off or not I actually think it 's more important that we make a stick towards a change and then do the in my speech so I think yeah but anyway yeah I don 't_''_4766.989 I don 't know I mean oh yeah you get the last word in it can I just say that I 'm just wondering what the point of this is is that we the two that we want to use the facilities or do we want to encourage people into having time together as a family and enjoying the water I think are two different things if we want to encourage people to be able to have access to water and to enjoy it together as a family then I think we actually do need to look at opening at the weekends because as I said before those are the only times that families have together often alright so I will put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's lost would you like to record who voted for that no it 's all good so now I 'll put the full motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now we had the deferring move that down the agenda because it 's not it wasn 't necessary for the for that motion I won 't want to put that further down do the green prescription one no we do the Green Festival mean yes it 's been included hey the challenge okay the next one that has an amendment as the sorry I 'm just I 'm just I am looking at the at the clock and you know very mindful of some things that I want to do today okay suburban master plans there were there were three amendments there so one is that council bring forward and incorporate and then a whole number of project plan numbers with associated funding and IDs and then a second one around holding off and continuing with the fury road master plan project and then pushing out a budget to 2025 and so there 's two in relation to know ones boost and parking plan intersection Safety Improvement you know I can 't make head nor tail of these so we 'll put these ones down down to the bottom as well we 'll come back maybe maybe we should take half an hour now for lunch and then perhaps I can make some more sense of some of these amendments because I mean I 'm afraid that one 's completely floored me now I thought we would have made a bit more progress this morning but so do you want to take half an hour now half now yeah okay all right well reconvene at 30 so I do need some staff advice and it goes so in simple _"

    "text": "and so now I 'll move on to the annual plan and I 'm I 'm going to sorry these were always going to be complex motions I want to what I 'll do is I 'll move um I 'll move the recommend deck what am i moving in help me out okay okay so I 'm moving that the council receive the report and the attachments and we adopt the recommendation set out an attachment B and pro forma I 'm happy to secondly and the deputy mayor will pro forma second that motion so as I say I 'm just going to make a few comments and then we 'll come back to the individual elements and I 'll invite others to speak as well as I said in my introductory remarks I was determined that the rates increase would not exceed the 5.5 percent that we had established and so doing I realized we were going to have to put money on budget for the Port Hills recovery plan that was something that was not anticipated at the time that the original budgets where were put remain determined that this term we get ourselves on a stable footing as a council so that we become financially resilient to such challenges in the future and my first term in office it was floods and my second term this time fire we have to be better prepared to absorb the impacts of such events we cannot keep increasing rates as I also said in the consultation document part of that whole process will be identifying the true costs of the city 's share of the recovery and rebuild it 's important to remember that the cost sharing agreement was entered into nearly four years ago and it does need to be refreshed so we are clear what we have to build under the LTP and win with the skirt program and we will have an asset management capability well beyond that which existed before the earthquakes how we integrate those assets into our repairs and renewals program will be critical I remain worried that people may have elevated expectations of what the skirt program was funded to deliver and how much we 're actually still remains to be we renew our 30-year infrastructure strategy as part of the 2018 2028 LTP this year 's 2017 18 annual plan is focused on delivering the capital program and the next financial year the council is planning to invest nearly half a billion dollars in the city for the first time in recent years more than half the capital program two hundred and seventy million dollars is already committed to major projects such as the Town Hall the new Central Library the Metro sports facility and many other significant community assets that being said funding for some of the other projects have been adjusted to ensure that we are spending money only when we need to in the projects timeline and this allows us to prioritize more pressing repairs and rebuilds in the communities that need them the most we are committed to maintaining momentum right across the city as I also said in my introductory remarks my recommendations are the result of a collaborative effort and I think counselors and the individual community boards for their dedication to this effort I also think the submitters it 's an important part can 't help believing that we can come up with better ways of engaging more people in the process the LTP is an opportunity and I want to start not with the consultation document which comes out next year but with an information document that sets out what it all means and how people can contribute my staff came up with a working title the earthquake ate my homework it 's not so much the sense of excuse that the earthquake is provided for things not being the way they ought to be but rather we 've forgotten the staff stuff that 's really important I said yesterday that we need to use our experience as an opportunity we need to fully understand what this earthquake has cost us as a city we don 't need repeated the rhetoric of forty billion dollars we need detailed facts and figures and we need to know what that 's going to mean for the city going forward so thank you can I just invite colleagues around the table third like to make an introductory comment Bucky yeni thank you well just following I would say that our community board began the first of an early conversation with the community about the LTP and a community board plan and although it was quite hard for people to understand why we were having a discussion about the LTP before it even done this year 's draft annual plan I actually explained to to the community that actually this was since I think the original LTP the first time that council has gone up early to understand what the issues are from the community although there was a list of projects up on the board it was also the opportunity for communities to raise with us anything that they wanted in terms of what we should be doing both at an operational level and obviously at a capital spend level so I do want to echo the sentiments that the mayor has made that I really look forward to us as a council engaging on the LTP in a way that we 've never done before which is through that early engagement with communities identifying what the priorities are because that is the time and at everything we do and to look at how we can improve in terms of responding to what the community thinks is important thank you I 'm following on from that we 've agreed that we 're just it 's just a quick all right is it okay what can I just conclude them by saying um I think one of the features of this draft annual plan has to be around the desire to get back to doing some of the basics well including things like addressing the maintenance but also actually giving a commitment to the community on the community facilities and I think some of the projects around school safety and community enhancement around some of our suburban Masterson master-planned centers so I look forward to having that debate as we go through today thank you Tim I 'll sort of sacrifice my column then I 'll try and cover three points twenty seconds each in one minute the first is today I look forward very much having been with the Eastern communities from the word go to this point I 'd like to think that we our decision-making takes us today that will see that what is good for the East is good for the city quickly moving on next point I admire our responsiveness over things we haven 't planned for the Port Hills fire so I admire the the kind of the people resource directed towards that along with our financial adaptability I think that 's been obviously a really a real key thirdly something I said in during our swearing-in time that if you meet people 's needs you 'll be successful so going back to mezzos hierarchy of needs if we can provide for our people with their housing fix their roads then I think when it comes to those bigger projects over a multi-purpose arena etc we 'll have that support and by thank you thank you and Phil I 'm agree with Jana Henson that in fact involving the community boards early on it 's been a first and it 's Ben 's signal ik of a really a really good consultation process I 'm certainly am understand Amir 's point about the Port Hills recovery and how that really and I 'll be I think it 's a it 's it 's a precent ready for there are other projects for example when it comes to hot hot sort would oppose today so in the other person meet things I think that we 're gonna be discussing today the accessibility for kids swimming that that 's major for me but also what 's important to when we come to the discussion of City care as a strategic asset how important that was to question people and I guess in a way today is a market in terms of our whole recovery and regeneration we 've made a lot of progress certainly since I 've been on council but clearly we have still a long way to go but today we 'll also I 'm sure will achieve further progress yeah I thank you for the opportunity and going out with all the communities in the Central Ward to to deliver this draft annual plan I realized quickly that it wasn 't my plan and there was a lot of things that I couldn 't actually do because it was then I 'm actually really excited to get through this and actually start looking at that long-term plan because that 's where I can actually start having a bit more of my flavor into some of the conversations that we 've been having and looking after the Central City and and the communities around it because I think from the conversations that I have had is a lot of them haven 't felt like they 've been involved so some of the stuff that has a flavor and this annual planned stuff that I 'm really been focusing on is the homeless issue the CBD stuff the transport areas suburbs and really really proud that we 're going to hopefully get some action on Linwood village and actually start giving that community some of the well needed attention that it deserves Pauline thank you look if some rates increase of less than five point five would be preferable but we 've got huge challenges with our continued repairs even though we 're in recovery and regeneration we 've still got a lot of work to do as the mayor 's infrastructure and now course the Port Hills fire throne and they had a huge cost so that we 've got the land grayness recovery program which is still one of our major projects and essential to restore the flood levels to pre quake levels at least and at that sort of massive financial cost so along with these essential capital works we 're also we 're and we agree that our community facilities are essential to restoring our strong communities I really support enabling proactive community groups with viable initiatives and encouraged trusts to own and manage we 're appropriate because this encourages youth that means the facilities are valued and protected by the community and they 're fit for purpose they 're what people want and counsel will walk alongside to assist and enable for better outcomes so I want to thank everybody for engaging this year is there done and also to acknowledge the staff the incredible level of work they 've put into this is my Sarah thank you and we are as we heard last night at the city leaders forum a city of tag lines and Youth Green visa to equate city and now a city of opportunity a city of opportunity for all but these are just middle-class pipe dreams if we don 't bring everyone with us as we repair and rebuild and regenerate our city we need to make sure that we haven 't forgot those who had nothing to start with those who had by the quakes need to rebuild their homes and we need to rebuild their facilities but let 's not forget those who had nothing to start with those have been hard hit by life this is our opportunity to make sure that those people are not forgotten we know that a more equal city as a happier city and more prosperous City and so business as usual is still not enough I 'm looking forward to the senior plan I 'm looking forward to the long term plan but let 's make sure that we don 't forget those who never had anything Jamie know things will win said yeah thank you I 'd like to endorse what Sierra 's just said and this is my first see the way that the community has engaged bringing submissions to the council and particularly for those young people who have taken the time in the energy to come in and often requiring quite a bit of courage I 'd like to see us a reward that because one of our strategic part of our strategic framework is to have strong communities with active participation and civic life so I 'm very hopeful that through our annual plan we can actually see that being developed our communities so look forward to seeing those initiatives that will strengthen our communities and encourage civic participation thank you David I think you just like to endorse the mayor 's comments earlier on about the level of rate rise and there are absolute determination to keep it below 5.5 and going forward to drive that down even further and years to come I 'd like to ignore the large amount of work that has been done on the annual plan this year both from a staff point of view and collectively around the table and coming to what I believe is a very good have engaged this year with the annual plan has been a lot better than in previous years and we have seen significant involvement with our community boards in the community in preparing this annual plan for me it 's been particularly satisfying that once again my word has produced in the by far and away the most number of submissions to the annual plan and I think today is a landmark day for the eastern suburbs with items that do to pass through this annual plan today thank you Jimmy yes this year annual plan is the third year of long term plan 2015 to 2025 particulars third year long term per in 2017 and 18 below more-- the annual planning order a new in a annual basis we just reviewed whether there 's any the bigger difference between the a new plan in the long term plan that they kind of party see a little bit of difference because why like a mayor you mention earlier because we had kind of poll here 's the recovery you know this urgent needs nature disaster so that 's reasonable we need one is unhappy you know the land renergie facility and also the cycleway facility still a continued ongoing actually there 's a positive or transform order give people more choice you know Laden and just rely on traditional the park is a true you know another one is a they don 't we probably still need to discard this issue that we got into the schools the speed limiters or whether we increase from three to six or three to nine I think this properties urgent needs when you consider because it 's holiness there 's a safety issue we have to take this issue more highest priority most serious these my my view but this year is also regeneration thank you that 's it okay about one thank you Ray yeah he 'll be very quick I 'm just really pleased to see that we finally got the hot saltwater pools I 'm ready for approval the people of New Brighton have been waiting a very long time since the earthquake for their Legacy Project and I 'm really thrilled that finally we 've done the work and that really thrilling and a thank you I 'm pleased to see recommendations in front of us today that reflect the submissions that we 've heard from the community and that also reflects quality engagements as an early stage at the community board level as well I certainly was part of some very good quality conversations very early in the piece of developing the the final version of this annual plan I 'm pleased to see rates increases kept within the five point five percent and certainly came to signal that we would hope to see rates increases decrease over the period of the long-term plan of course we continue to have a large capital program as the city is in recovery and regeneration particularly pleased though to see as part of this annual plan continued investment in community facilities suburban aquatic facilities parks and reserves and in particular to see the biodiversity fund that we 're going to be talking about very shortly and recognising the works of the reserve management committees on the peninsula which are a great example of Community Partnership right so probably the easiest thing for the first motion which is that the report and the attachments be received so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they no that 's carried I think I also have to move a motion to suspend Standing Orders would I do that now I 'll do the biodiversity fund okay so I 'll move that we suspend Standing Orders 18.1 18.8 and 18.9 divert seconder Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now just sorry to get you to vacate the chair because I hadn 't talked about doing it in this order but I just wanted to sort of kind of lay the groundwork for the annual plan the biodiversity fund is going to be considered as part of the annual plan it was referred to from a tea to the to the council but we 've brought it forward to today so it can be included as we sit so the staff who are advising on the _"

    "text": "just by presenting an overview for the day 's proceedings first of all we 've got an item referred from as each this meeting so that we can include it in the annual plan and that 's the proposed Christchurch City biodiversity fund and but after confirming the minutes I 'm going to proceed to the annual plan because I just want to give a quick overview or give an opportunity to councillors to give an overview of the annual plan and I will invite colleagues to speak but people don 't have to speak I 've just took a quick snapshot around the table of where people said I think it 's quite good to ground the annual plan process and in terms of that I 'll then come back and move to the recommendation on the Christchurch by biodiversity fund and then I 'll deal with the three issues we specifically asked for feedback on which are City care hot saltwater pools and swimming fees and Chargers recreation fees and I 'm proposing that we not place city care on our strategic asset list but we have a hot saltwater pools which has also attracted a couple of amendments to my proposal to confirm the funding recreation swimming fees and charges my recommendation is to give parents and toddlers free access to swimming pools during school hours and that will also extend people who have a green prescription and I think we all understand what a green prescription is and that that would apply during school hours but there are a couple of amendments from councillors which we 'll deal with at the same time and I just want to make the point that my recommendations have been derived from a series of workshops which have enabled councillors to consider the submissions in detail and to take advice from staff and it 's been an overarching priority for me to keep the rates increase capped at five point five percent there are a number of amendments that councillors have noted notified that we will also address today some of them relate to elements of my proposals we 'll link them together so that we 're considering the amendments at the same time as we 're considering considering my come back and vote on the overarching motion which adopts the plan can I at this very early stage of the process think all the staff have worked very hard to consider all of the issues and respond to the questions can I acknowledge my own office staff and the chief executives office for helping to coordinate the myriad of issues that will be debated today so I 'll move on to confirmation of the previous minutes would somebody like to move that the minutes of those meetings be confirmed Andrew seconded David East I 'll put those that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

move to apologies and I have an apology from the mayor I have an apology from councilor Johansson those apologies for absence I have an apology from councilor swigs for an early departure and I have an apology from council a mangie for a late arrival so I 'm happy to move those apologies do I have a seconder Aaron all those in favor against that 's carried declarations of interest and that item serves as a reminder Glen so Glen Livingstone declaring an interest on item 6 thank you and so declarations of interest then moving to public participation and we do have one presentation in the public forum this morning can I invite Mary tingey from the veggie garden project to the table good morning Mary thank you very much indeed for coming along all right now you have five minutes this morning and you can leave time for questions within 're looking forward to hearing from you thank you um we 're here in response to healthy food action plan as you 're aware the purpose of the action plan is to make healthy food choices easy which is in line with the purpose of our veggie garden project the veggie garden clergy is response to the call for rediscovering the simple joy of delicious food which beverage certainly is mouth-watering candygram is developed for soil fertility grow strong Ganic plants and under this process that then forms a true attraction for people so I 'm here a teeny and I 'm a dear person the Canterbury community gardens Association I coordinate the orchards and school program for the Canterbury horticultural society currently I work as a community garden at Delta community gardens Peck Street community gardens I have 40 years teaching experience plus 8 years in the community garden sector and good morning and my name is Jacqueline abound I am the secretary of the Canterbury community gardens Association and presently the coordinator of the Littleton community garden and a member of project Littleton over the last 11 years here in and in Australia and have developed support networks school gardens working with the garden to table project in New Zealand and the Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden program in Australia as well as developing developing a community hub here in the harbor Basin area now our vision is for luxuriant gardens across Christchurch full of seasonal organic vegetables herbs fruits and flowers we 've done the photo well done the photo is an example here is example of the Delta community garden in springtime these gardens would be places where people can come to learn the skills needed to grow harvest and cook their own delicious fresh food they will learn to teach these skills to others while working in schools and communities the garden is a setting where people learn respect for the natural world whilst building friendships and lifelong relationships so this is the photograph from the era known primary school where we had growing delicious fish food and little garden and the children were about to make themselves cultural sandwiches and this boys and his interaction with a cabbage says it all now our project itself foundation gardens workshops apprenticeships program and community can actions foundation Gardens these guns will be thriving models where people come to learn to teach and to enjoy food these will be the energy drivers for the project as lush green violence bring people together now workshops and we 're looking to organize workshops that will respond to the interests of the wider community that will stimulate others to participate in the veggie garden project and also to initiate their own organic projects in the communities as you see here people had grown garlic there now got together to clap the garlic and the garlic would then be stored in the community kitchen for them to cook and one of the the main things with the veggie garden projects is community connections Gardens bring people together and strengthen community connections and the veggie garden project plans to widen these connections through workshops visits and newsletters we need schools and community gardens and the community all working together apprenticeships there 's a well-known intervene generational gap in the skills required to to grow and sustain and drive local food projects this I four year olds did not how to know how to grow they rely on an eight-year-old to teach them apprenticeships will pass on growing harvesting and cooking skills as well as teaching and community skills and a positive enthusiastic and appreciative environment after their training the producers will work as garden coordinators and new gardens that 's establishing a strong supportive network of gardens throughout Christchurch and that photo and photo working with very small children it is a skill that needs to be taught how people can teach and gardens and finally one of the big hurdles community initiatives is the school of people to drive the projects who are growing fresh fruit at a community level for the past two months we have been designing the veggie garden project our foundational documents currently with our graphic designer the outcome of the veggie garden project will be more people skilled to grow harvest and cook in their own homes schools and community gardens this is a grass roots community-based project we are visiting that this is a five-year project that we are seeking funding for next 12 months to indeed for the presentation that brings us to the end of the five minutes we haven 't got time for any questions unfortunately but

their community board report we 've got very young variant decisions under delegations which was some that 's all know about issues there no just out to comment on the the establishment of a working party to consider the issues proposed around the the wickedness passenger lounge in Division Street and just left side that we had a young first meeting of that working party last week kid well boy I am Ginny Huey and we 've got a list of action perch from that word that will be taken forward so that 's quite positive we also heard yeah we 're progressing the the holes will for the history library unsatisfactory for for community use so we 're leadership day was some very very well attended unfortunately I couldn 't be there because of other engagements but really looking forward to receiving the positive feedback from that and the walls and and looking forward to having another one of those sessions next year so this is this will be the third Adair community board and will have done so that 's that 's quite positive and yes I already commented on the and the antisocial behavior and record in in but yes that 's the looking forward to progressing here run air community board plane so yep that 's them mr. mayor and capsules thank you so are there any questions for Mike on the community board report at this stage and then we 'll move to the party 's okay so no questions on the

exchange just ask you the working group also considering enhancement Division Street is that an enhancement of that being included now it 's not included in that working party but it will be but there 's a separate working party that 's working on that councillor Clearwater so hopefully those two Westen parties will come together yep any further questions on the report Glen thank you I noticed Mike that with the houses with the written race supports development with 300 mil for 600 homes 500,000 each is that being promoted in the local community or two scenes here it 's not up to us to promote done whether it 's affordable housing or not don 't_''_3174.73 I know counselor but it 's that 's something that our border well aware of will be kept in the loop okay and there was some report coming to our community board and on the development at RIT and Racecourse yeah we have different measures of affordability so but you know that between well aware that yes so yeah well aware that thank you piaces thanks Mike thank you so this item item five to receive the holds well home be recoupment community in favor against that 's carried so now let 's move to item 6 which is the first of the parties from that community board they are what a basin land exchange Mike did you have any comment that you wanted to make on this by waving very very pleased to be able to run to move from the staff report and protocol on that phone without change so and what more than comfortable with it great ok that 's some that 's great are there any questions on this report Jimmy is happy to move seconded by and all in favor aye against that 's carried okay and then we have an updated recommendation on the next part I which is simply that the council refers the report back to the community board for further consideration once that 's happened obviously then depending what the community board considers it will come back to Council in due course so I 'm happy to move that the council refer the report back to the community board for further consideration do I have a seconder that parent that 's crazy Jimmy yep based on the staff original the information particular machinist are organized the meeting with the users group couple of month ago and their particulars express that desire now before the are immolation they would like to work with counsel preserver memorial plaque and work to work toward an alternative community facility most suit for the fit in their needs so I just don 't know whether the updated status has been changed so we need to lie on the table I guess this is it here some trails were tuned in following a meeting and that I had with visitors from last Tuesday and more information came to light on the history of that facility and sort of clouds over the the ownership the fact that it was some gift to blade and it is quite a lot of issues that have since come to light and some a lot of the community were expecting another round of consultation before this final decision was made as well so and just to make sure that everybody 's reasonably comfortable with the whole picture and what we 've asked there is lay after more consultation with the with the parties and listen to their concerns as a board rather than me meeting with three or four of them the other day that that 's the best way through would yeah so we 're referring it back to the community board to do whatever work they want to do with it to consider it further and we 're expecting there would be a further either the same or updated recommendations to Council and after that after later could Alan yeah might I 'd be quite interested because this is right on the boundary and so the ward that I have the privilege to represent is across the road from the school so I 'd quite like to be part of those discussions as well as possible be more than happy councils between the user group meets and I think there 's a number of options available to decide good yep great so Mike you 're happy with that absolutely great thank you okay so I have moved Jimmy will second no further discussion all in favor against as carried thank you very much work that they 're doing thank you thank you very much much appreciated Hagen lip so next one anywhere just yet next I would call um Carolyn Potter and Melanie cocoa come to the table as well I assume from the sprayed and Kashmir community board Carolyn and Melanie good morning and welcome you have 10 minutes to present your board reports and we look forward to hearing from you here or tatto and we will be guided by our pictures of the beginning Thermo be function and word of the pictures are there eh room here we go oh we 've got a title right right so we 're just going to roll through the images we got here so in this slide we 've got an initiative by our recreation advisor Emma baby who decide it be a good idea to do a go get set go workshop with the youth who were hit approach the board about having basketball lights and hang a park because she wanted to get beaten up skill to be able to run their own event so she did that over an initiative herself you can see in there in the middle and um what the kids see at the end she said what have you learned today and sheep then they said to here we 've learnt that you do a whole lot more work than what we do so it was really cool um that she 'd done that and we 're really appreciative of it and um ya know it 's building the community basically a good community development looks like youth who runs us ah and these pictures are probably adding ten times which I helped deliver and delivered over the weekend and as a wonderful local news leader and this is the opening of the little river links cycleway which I 've already mentioned where I received notice of of the opening 24 hours before it happened it poured was rain but there was a fantastic turnout and apparently the food provided by the contractor was terrific and so those know that some of the local people here and and local dignitaries as well and we mustn 't confuse the two and therefore the opening but it 's been a good thing for Eddington and one of the things that did was because there was a cycle way coming off Brahm from Collins Street we closed traffic into Eddington from from bran which meant that the RET run through to town which used to occur with people going round our old and beautiful Mary 's Church it 's 70 and 80 Kay 's and running into bollards and reeking the local neighborhood they 've been stopped from coming off and doing that rat run and but the psycho way has been acknowledged by the locals I know it 's such a shame it 's been acknowledged by the locals as well as cyclists as being a great benefit to the neighborhood of me very pleased to have it um here 's some pictures of some plants native plants oh and when Zach reason which runs but no there 's a there 's a walkway between when Zach resident in Littleton Street at enough you know where we spray em skull was and there was a community group an informal group that had come to the board before I a community garden and apparently at the time the report came it was a little bit tricky because of the sort of legalese around the leaned and the trickiness of it but finally what they 've been able to do is rather than putting in an eatable kind of garden they 're putting in native plants so you can see in the slide the bit where they 've sprayed off the grafts on either side a little parenting it 's like right next to a pedestrian crossing so they 'll wait there for their kids to cross the road and take them home so they had a big plant out about two weekends ago putting lots of plants and which we should have got some photos of them but they 're on Facebook if you her hands on there so um that 's pretty cool and this is Martin 's bowling club came to see us there was so strategic fantastic they came to see us a month ago just to talk about the Sint Maartens bowling club and looked absolutely wide-eyed when we asked if they wanted anything and local school pupils around the corner from the bowling club it is it is a venue which is being in the middle of Sint Maartens and has people going there to speak for instance I 've spoken there at a progress club meeting and so it 's available to the community and lo and behold we got a request last week for funding for two heat pumps which we were delighted to approve [Music] and this is part of the board 's bust and tour and this is we 're looking at the reservoir which is in the postmodern photograph on at the bottom it looks as though it could be something out of the film Chinatown and the reservoir is a great space there 's already been a wedding held dear you can 't see what it looks like but to walk into it and there 's walls on either side and concrete up the front shut up Michael and there 's a long there and it 's a great space for movies or readings or any kind of function we want to hire out something which looks quite this reservoir space will have great public use in this between the two reservoirs we hope that this space will provide a function at a great function space for the people who live on hence B Hill who because lots of people living on the hills don 't have access to green and we are hoping that this will be able to provide a resource for the local people as well as a wider community including the summertime 's crowd because we just did a bus trip quite recently as you know him a couple of only councilors came along and the other thing that was probably one of the highlights was going to old stone house and having Richie and the contractor talk about there appears that they 're doing which are quite intricate but what was quite cool as when you go the others I could little boardwalk and you can just climb onto it and all of a sudden you 're on the roof and you can see what they 're doing underneath all is plastic wrapping so we 're really excited windlass you know I 've wait till it 's open and we can go in there and have a function or something like that so I am and the bloke who talked to us he loved he was from the UK and he lived right next door to the stone that we are getting to help rebuild the building the clay in the UK that with a coming from there and he was of course a stonemason it was really fantastic to talk to him and his prayer the prior building that he had done just prior to the old stone house was The Adventure Park which has just hidden award for architecture so we 've gone from this really modern recycled timber building and the adventure part to the old stone house and he was such an interesting person to talk to our concern with this building in the future will be that the volunteers are getting older and we are will be looking for a rejuvenated community committee structure to handle the building and I think the council here is going to have some problems in the future facing volunteerism this is the I think we 're going to have to think up innovative ideas to manage those issues in the future and the floodplain management this is 2014 round the loop at Beckenham and the next one that in those and the next one is last week with the rains on the flood plain on Sparks Road and these basins on Sparks road and Hendersons road and Sutherlands Road and in other areas up in the Southwest around the new developments a design by the drainage guys to prevent flooding further downstream in the hiss Co and we are thrilled to see them and to help them and as these basins get developed in the trees start to grow they 'll also become a walking facility for the local neighborhood and thanks to carlene 's intervention we 've got signs up behind these round these basins in Puna way and all around to explain to the community that it doesn 't get another housing development about to come in but a flood Basin to help prevent flooding in Christchurch because I don 't think the council does enough to communicate with its and why we are doing it and I think we should be putting more signs up around projects to say what 's happening and where the rate payers dollars are going because it 's really good to tell the community you may think this is a problem right now but what 's going to happen in the future will be great for all of us just does this and then we and don 't do the bus 's fees and so another thing that 's happening is next week we 're going to have the community come along to talk about um bus routes and we all know with the changes with he cans bus routes over the last few years to sort of become more difficult for people and people are wanting routes and certain places like up the hill and through some of the autumn things so we 're going to get ekn council to come along and talk to them and find out about what they 're wanting and to get their information together so it 's next Monday yep we 've got and we 've got 's facilities in Christchurch and the smell from the laundry has been a bane for local neighbors for five years or more and continues to be a bane and we would like greater involvement from you can in on these issues about air quality and we 've had a meeting between Bupa and us and again which was a good meeting and the co-operative meeting but we 'd like to see some big decisions being made about air quality in Christchurch and we 're at the moment we 're doing consultations on the community plan and we 're having such fun with it and we 've been into several supermarkets and last night Melanie and I and staff members were at the rally shops and we were interviewing young people mostly young people a in the community at the rally shops about their response to the community plan and it was just so interesting their understanding their interpretation for instance of culture which involved the first languages which were Tong and Salman Narayan and and their interest in pursuing their languages and having the ability to retain near languages where have been talking about the cathedral so it 's just interesting to talk about the culture and the heritage and what they want in their community and whether they want all building two new buildings and public transport and things until it was great fun and the other one is Vista place we 've been a real problem up there with people in cars smoking excused absences and playing dad but music at the top of there at the top of the annoys and call it their local residents calling the police most nights actually last night before last they were there until 00 a.m. and we really wish that we could resolve that issue we 're trying to get a meeting between traffic engineers police and us going it 's very difficult to get the police to come to meetings picked up great thank you very much so there is time for a couple of questions the hunt spree reserve reservoir it just seems a really logical thing that this is a whole suburb lots of kids up beer that 's the only flirty area up there and I and his team for being open-minded and opening that to the community because it took some time to kind of get that across and if I had gone up there with my son and F we had gone to the gates which are bigger than Fort Knox 's a feat of Engineering and if we had decided to have a competition to jump them I might have got over at nine point six seconds which bit my son who was over at E and F we had actually done there so great thank you fill mine isn 't a question but a quick comment to run think the board for a very full report but to just the comments in relation to the little of a cycle way and I think the board are aware that in fact that the opening of that was run by NZTA so but what I do want to say is what counsel are really grateful for the huge support that the Community Board gave well look at the whole cycleway project really and the local residence it was a very good example in my supporting you

questions one from Dion one from Ann and then we move on Dion now this is more a I don 't know how to ask this it 's more response of what was said about that what how why com 'st can we get some sort of report to the innovation and sustainable development committee about a common strategy around that sort of stuff because the that committee is in charge of the council 's brand and communication strategies sorry I 'm getting a cold and I 'd actually like to soon from what was just said actually moved that on further what you were asking for around communications around it did so I think that it 's just something we get on and do you know in terms of posle is that um as we 're starting to develop things there people that you know this is a council project as opposed to something else so we can just do it from the committee all right sounds good just doing it sounds good just do it okay great all right great thanks Dale and finally an yeah just a fantastic work engaging with the

their own community plan this is facilitated by robin arnold at meaning of the 29th may the board talked about the proliferation of digital billboards that appear in throughout the community board area area the board notes that the council has a policy relating to advertising on bus shelters and is asking the council to develop a policy on digital billboards and outdoor advertising and rather than moving it just up to the rm8 one of this community resilience partnership funding criteria the board discussed this and as asking the council to engage and discuss with tangibles on the criteria for the community resilience partnership opponent Christchurch Botanic Garden spatial plan now note that this has been out for consultation and we 're asking that the council have a representative from our community board when they decide on the membership of the heron 's panel for this plan community board communications strategy and the board would actually to communicate to the public better on what the Alton Winterbourne of doing is is doing and the good things that we 're doing in that area community boards significant levels of interest Lynwood village and the board requested a meeting with regenerate Christchurch to specifically discuss about regeneration of Linwood village area and weaving a lot of negative press about this area and we want to have a revitalization plan that reflects the community aspirations and want to work with local community organizations on how we can do this in vote and we she organized the meeting with Environment Canterbury just with our board to discuss air quality public transport and some other issues at an outboard area it 's happening with that happening next week next week yeah the Board discussed the composition of the proposed council coastal futures group and we 'd like to ensure that a process developed aligns with our communities would like to have this very important conversation I think this has moved on since this part was nothing so we 've actually had a meeting already on that and Park Rangers the board the paint Park Rangers do and how they work with volunteers around the city and in that were contributing to keeping down the costs of maintaining green spaces the world is supportive increasing the number of Park Rangers in other City as noted in a staff report to the financially in performance committee and lastly I just like percent Jake McLellan who 's not here today my Deputy Chair who stood infront several occasions recently was way especially for the annual plan hearings so thank you very much Jake and thank you everyone for listening great thank you very much indeed Sally we 've got time for a couple of questions so I 'm Pauline thank you report I 'm just highlighting the 7.1 the Linwood village you mentioned that you 're you 're planning on having some meetings with region and you 're going to work with the community where is that air as it progressed at all because we 're getting a little bit of consolation if you like with the cycleway program going through there and the Linwood village just being kind of brought up as part to the believer holiday special hire but what we 're talking about here is more like the problems we 've got was people hanging around drinking all day and taking drugs whatever they 're doing and we want to try and do regeneration forward and revitalization for that I think the issue you 're talking about in terms of course that petition it came to the attic committee and there 's a different issue that I 'm going to pass it to apply to there 's a different issue but they 're mixing them up so what I 'm trying to say what your hair you 're progressing with the Lynwood village revitalization plan okay so the Tafari ruamata has been leading the pre-engagement on revitalization of the Lynwood village area and what they 've done is they 've spoken to the community about what issues they celebrate about the local community what the concerns are and one of the concerns that did come up is around the shopping center and how there are a lot of businesses that have moved out there 's generally a sense that if nothing Village that whole area will continue to be quite depressed both people and place the issue that 's come to the attic committee is something that was discussed even during the consultation process from the major cyclone hoods and it raised appeared again as businesses realized that unless in their opinion that intersection remains open to traffic both ways there isn 't going to be enough there isn 't going to be enough business generated because they say what cyclists would want to drive down or cycle down Wooster Street when there 's actually nothing to stop therefore there isn 't a beautiful coffee shop there isn 't anything that would attract people to that Center so it is something that needs to be worked on at the same time the discussions of to regenerate Christchurch around up I think are going to be around how does regenerate work with the local community so that they can support a community lead process that doesn 't just look at what the master plan aspirations were what the aspirations are on Community Development are and what the housing aspirations are about something to address the different issues so there will be a second step with different stakeholders who may be involved in the regeneration like housing New Zealand Christchurch City Council whoever else is identified through the pre-engagement can come together and start to have a discussion on working though that 's really a origin because I I agree we need to do something there and so have you had the meeting with reaching around Christchurch here that 's on Monday I think fantastic thank you that 's good thank you all right do I have a mover for the report Sara seconded Pauline of Dion yep great okay so moved Sara seconded Dion all those in favor against Beth Kerry thank you very much indeed for the report in the update today thank you okay so our next item is item 10 the report of the pepper Nui Innes community board to council Ali Jones is here this morning Ali great to have you with us if you 'd like to come forward to the table thank you thanks Andrew hi everyone people to see anything if I run our trip 's in part thank you ego right already we did try I wanted to put some little rugby people in those seats to acknowledge the tool that we have on at the moment we 'll do that perhaps next time because it doesn 't look good with empty seats there okay we 'll just let that roll over no parties and the Pavano units reports today sort of significant projects in the ward at the moment the main one really is the the thermal burns community center which is being hugely it was hugely anticipated by the by the community a part of that community center new build involves the relocation of the señal burns Lions building to McFarlane Park which I know I 've raised with you before we have a working party in place which is meeting regularly talking to sports groups the lines themselves City Council community staff currently at the moment the staff and the working party are working through planning issues resource consent because the land is reserved lands so there are just some mati is really well hopefully they 're just formalities we need of moving and fishing it out and so forth that 's an ongoing conversation at the moment and we 'll have to tie in very closely with the build date for the community the new community center I 'm also looking for somewhere that community groups can go to while the community center is being built McFarland Park will be filling a major need for that particular part of our world so we still need space for community groups and we are looking at a number of places around the ward for that we 've been doing a lot of work with the Stix area and the community groups out towards the sticks it was a meeting held in June 2015 and there have been a large number of meetings held since then the community is concerned about the health of the sticks this in fact you 'll see up there now there are some slides relating to a source-to-sea bus trip that we held recently and was very well attended by members of all of the community boards one of the issues is maintaining not only the environmental health related to that but flooding and lowland levels are a concern and issue around this area as well but great communication and fantastic support from the staff and working with the community groups on that and it 's hoped that representatives from the local community will find time to commit to working on the sticks working party which as I said is being put together at the moment we 're getting an increasing number which is really fantastic of young people coming to the Broad not only to request funding and we have no budgets for that as all the community boards do but then coming back and reporting on what they 've achieved and we are using those as an opportunity to promote through our local media and Facebook page and in social media those positive outcomes and some of them are quite phenomenal we had a group from both our school the prefix and house captains came to our 9th of May board meeting to report and their involvement in a leadership camp and we 've also heard from case Brook intermediate on that as well and it to speak he stood up and he said I think I 'm probably going to be really terrible at this those were his first words but by the time he got through what he was actually saying to the board man he was just humming and was really confident and then listen to his classmates say some other things and we 've heard from teachers with whom we meet regularly every quarter at Pavano ENS they come in there 's one a week on Friday and they are siting major positive changes and not only the house captains and prefix that are attending these leadership courses but other students that work with these house captains and prefix as well so it 's a hugely important and effective part of what our youth development organizations do in our ward we 're having youth principals meeting a week on Friday Kathleen Liberty will attend that you may know the name Kathleen has undertaken some psychosocial research relating primarily to how the earthquakes affected children in Christchurch and also as you may have heard children who were not even born at the time to deal with and other community groups are having to deal with so she 's presenting to the world principals a week on Friday just yesterday we had a meeting one of the major issues that I 've raised it before when I 've talked to to you all is the ongoing stress and problems we are seeing in the eastern part of our world I mentioned again around Shirley and Richmond and you will have been well aware of the outcome of the well-being survey that was released yesterday and how a number of people in New Brighton and further east were quoted and spoken to about that I reiterate again we are seeing exactly the same issues and stresses in our Ward so I 'm not saying that it 's not happening in the east clearly it is but it is happening in our world as well in the east of our Ward around Richmond and Shirley and this is the area that is short of community facilities and again I remind you of our annual plan submission related to the Shirley Community Center yesterday we met at road safety issues outside the school it is a very congested part of Shirley being exacerbated by roadworks for a very long time the issue there is red light runners the meeting we had yesterday was which was pulled together by our community board staff governance staff very cool reasonably quickly included police the school parents christchurch city council parking enforcement penny gray our engineer and a number of our community board staff we came out of that meeting with seven action points one of those is to look at doing a full safety audit of that 's called a corridor audit so not just around the immediate external part of the school but from Hills Road right down to just before the palms that 's what affects the safety there so we it was suggested that a forty case school zone light might help and they 're expensive and we have to take a lot of NZTA boxes related to getting that we then discussed looking at getting a warning sign which basically just says children so if drivers are aware that there are children in the area because a big office building that 's very new along there if you 've been along there if drivers are aware of children in the area they will slow down so to be a combined effort the sign police enforcing City Council enforcing and also someone suggested the children holding flags as they cross the road as they do it 's in orbits and Albans primary great suggestion very simple to do so it was a very positive meeting and we 're looking at having something in four weeks basically to be able to act on there so just example of engaging with the community face-to-face and getting some positive outcomes I think that 's all great thank you very much clearly there 's some a lot going on right time for a couple of questions Vikki just on their area would be sensible just to lower the speed limit permanently we discussed this yesterday it was interesting because some people said that there is something in law already that dictates you must go travel at 40 KS an hour outside of school some said that 's true some said it on this very subject right and learned quite a lot from it and that 's the issue it 's not speed because traffic congestion is so great outside the school the traffic scrawling anyway so that 's why the other sign was of more use potentially yeah against visibility yeah yeah yeah for the questions so we have a recommendation to receive the community board report do I have a mover Mike seconded Pauline all those in favor again gasps Carrie thanks very much indeed a link boards update thank you now the pendulum why Mari Harewood community board item 11 and we have David Carter to the table place thank you Lyle oh thank you very much for you to one today yes all right I 'll take the reporters read probably two items to draw your attention to one which is as if she knows here 's around the bishop Dale library just note for your Diaries 30 on the 22nd of July is the opening if we go to see as many of you here as you possibly can and second thing here community projects I asked within our area this is a great example of a partnership between not only government departments but the local community and sports organized sports groups after the earthquake there 's a bowling green which was written off and they dumped a whole of truckloads of sand onto it turned it into a big play an adventure area beach volleyball or max and other things it 's also a drop-in center for after-school children it 's a great meeting space for a number of elderly in the community they are looking to put in a new Sports Hub into that area which will be what would reportedly world-leading in the way of some of the cricket services that they will provide indoor cricket and training and so it 's a great project they 're further they can get some funding for it and move it off the ground happy to answer any questions great thank you very much pulling Christian I just have a comment about that what volleyball the bowling dream being turned into a volleyball court because I think and you 've retained one Bowling Green these you 've in the same place and I just think that is just fantastic so well done now I 'm sure they 'd be happy to give anybody to it yeah right thank you noting the section in your report where you talk about a spike in local burglaries yes the border always have been working with the police on that issue yes and you found the police collaborative and you 've been able to work together with the police I noticed that an arrest had been made and that seemed as though it had resulted in dropping a totally offender who has been detained great and of course that would have been an opportunity for the board to strengthen its relationship with the police around other issues it obviously we 've got second largest social housing in the city and a point which is often forgotten and but the place exceeding got their hands full and with me hard to resolve those issues all right thank you any further questions for David all right so we have once again a recommendation to receive the community board report moved by Ref seconded you very much indeed great of all thank you okay so then we move to the banks peninsula community board Christine good morning welcome and looking forward to hearing what 's happening on the peninsula this morning thank you thank you Andrew good morning everyone so and we have three things to highlight this morning and [Music] what good so the first being pedaling select community center the opening of each and and then we 've got air reserve management Keynes discovery a bit of an update of me and then we have a plea from the Steve viewers Association so to start off what is the facility that 's just about ready to be opened and the residents and all the community buildings fleet absolutely thrilled about this new facility it 's been a long time coming and it 's been hard fought for and the name of others too to matter happily in it 's going to be open on the 23rd of June and the successful both of us as a combination of strong community and Christchurch City Council collaborative process and the build itself has been of a local builder so the facility itself will be council owned but community managed so it 's a real team effort I think really looking at it needs to be congratulated for such for any third the council contributor 180,000 but the little rodent sorry literature the little revert will read a community trust then took out the bayesian and fundraise the 200 clear them that was needed on top of late so it was a great if at all so the only going cost to the council were minimal as it 's going to be community rounds so I think these lots to celebrate that and you 're all invited it was a reminder that you 're invited to attend the opening it 'd be great if you come along support the beer and sleep community so I 'm sure that you would have so need invitation come through your doors or something lovely good well the next is a reserved planning on the bank 's financial reserves planning so we have muster peaks in Tioga in our mayor so the misty Peaks is a bit ground to as portable receiver for hauling the Littleton Township so just go through those Rumble around so mr. pegs receive and it contains no blocks of old growth in Reid beech forest on the outer base the high tops are mostly played with snow tussock in regeneration indigenous montane forest here 's a higher potential for native vegetation regeneration so and what for will these receives and we are going out to community consultation just to see exactly what they 'd like seasoned seen done with them in muster peaks in Tioga currently do not heave management clarity 's so that 's just a process that needs to be route through the ta keo receive was about seven heat to use of old-growth or put a cap forest which has remnant of the original pre European forests that once dominated vents peninsula so least among 15 Trivette remains out is a considerable amount of total regeneration with trays straight 5 meters high skated through both the tumble down stream in the Tioga base stream valleys so young there 's a bit of work to be done there Romero XIV and so and it is a receive that does important week so we have a quite a bit idea that looks after Amir and they concentrate on the plant species in using locally sourced plants and fully receive in this particular reserve as highly are used by walkers and mountain bikers so the cleaners to Spain updated at the moment and it 's timers of urgency fear center and so at the meeting on the 22nd of May there was a deputation to the board so what and the Sophia is are looking for as an input will support from implementation of Port levy this is basically to help support the running of the signature and that is quite vital to the they going and mean that coming to the port so they basically are supplied with an era where they can go in make contact with seafood moves their computers if they need to exchange money they can do all of the here 's a photo of some of the mean little trims always provided a fear center but after the earthquakes we lost the one that was there so we the winter trying to eat or boy so fortunately we near hit this facility but is not on a permanent property so that 's another part of the problem so in also as well done on voluntary you know use what start by volunteers who can 't always baby so what it means that we 've got this lovely facility but it 's not always open because it 's a shortage of volunteers sport and so the saviours are really looking to say here they can beat support for a levy so they can look at maybe putting a miniature and so this all comes in line with their obligations to and support maritime labour convention which was just adopted and matched of this year so and we don 't have a responsibility to these mean aimed at sports we say a lot of them Kevin hunch a little turn as we 've done over the years in all I guys that play ball on to someone with Adam go and connect them to the theme likes you know I can make time in so that 's what it 's believe it was really you know it 's feast court thought it was a lot of consumed about what 's hit me near so except really great thank you very much indeed Christine and the board actually asked for some further work to be done the report back on the Littleton seafarers center issue and so that 'll be an ongoing conversation but yeah quality of welcome for those visiting seafarers to Littleton certainly was something board were concerned about so when I moved questions Tim and then Dion think you would regard to the seafarers area could the LPC not clock the ticket with regards to the the birthing costs and put a bit on top so depth in funds the the center because I mean we have a responsibility but I would suggest that the employers have illogic responsibilities and soon as they into New Zealand waters it would be it should be leveraged it will say we have a finite amount of money we 're having trouble housing rowing people and it just keeps going a go so I mean just thinking outside the box for hips it that they 're asking for that would be the idea what that could happen but I think they just would like yeah I bought support but as a council how do we move that forward it 's exactly the information that 's coming back to the board and certainly what was proposed by the Seafarer Center was a levy on visiting ships exactly Tim as you 're proposing rather than that council should fund this articular facility the moment it 's on land is owned by an independent fisheries that 's an arrangement which is is great for the moment but may not be able to continue long term but there are two issues that one that the lanes are separate issue if we can get leverage off to a little port company on the birthing yet of ships and it solves the funding problem indeed and the other problem as a lander ship which as technically I suppose for one of a bidder as the board 's or else yeah and that might be an area where council can assist but certainly on the levy what the board that could be achieved and the thinking would be exactly as you suggest it would be a levy on visiting ships thank you great thank you Tim yeah is there an internet cafe and little no just the library just the library because that could be self-sufficient make you know these things you know they always require money but we 've got to think about ways to make them self-sufficient I mean when I was on ships that was the first thing we did go and look for that internet cafe I have a glass a or a beer or something like that and and get on the internet so is it an option that 's been looked at the libraries I think before and the seafarers Center was developed this was a resident they were gone to the library and after as I was certainly at so I just pick up on the Wi-Fi so it wasn 't_''_6474.71 at the time it was happening but he 's at the moment we only have the library is the other alternative so you know the volunteers that they have got only know obviously it 's hard to eat you know eggs and Myint to have it opened 7 so yeah I mean I got hip training mmm but these are certainly one of the things that most and safe heroes want to do like you say I want to be sure and you know make contact with the theme leaves and that 's really important we do have a duty of care and that 's the first time I 've ever and now and well before this facility was developed that little turn didn 't hear us see fear as seen her so this is what created the problem with them certainly outside in the cold sorry thank you Dave and then Phil thank you more of a comment than a question council Scandrick talked of imposing a levy on shipping coming into the port for to have system the provision of this facility conversations are aware of the times is that a number of of shipping organizations particularly some of their fishing operations actually go to Timaru because the the cost of birthing at Littleton is getting increasingly higher so can 't just sort of simply say well the ships coming into port we can impose Olivia on them we have to be mindful of shipping movements around the South Island and the perception that at times the Bertha charges at Littleton are quite high and a number of shipping firms actually choose to go to Timaru because of that so we don 't really want to further exacerbate shipping companies not choosing to go to Littleton as a consequence yep so it 's I mean Dave that 's a fair comment and I mean this is exactly the kind of information the Board expects to get back rather than just making a decision to do something or to advocate something straight away we felt there was a need for further information to be brought back so thank you very much for that comment and then finally coming up Ellen thanks Christine in like you referred to the Tioga and musty pigs management which is part of parks because this won 't ask you about other areas which are owned by private lien owners because yesterday at a tea committee fund for I guess to a part of it took Katie to enhance the environment some of the gullies fencing off planting a nickel in a thing so just without on the way you the board your board won 't have a chance to discuss this we 're just wondering if you think that your board might support such a such a fund I can 't see why not and yeah and I think that well I can 't speak for everybody but um I think it 's something that they would be open-toe yeah he 's think we could have freed the discussion to think cool great thank you very much so um I 'm now happy that some we receive the community board report so I 'll move that and do I have a seconder Pauline all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much and thanks Christine for the report good to have you with us okay and then we move last but not least to the Coastal burlwood Community Board Kim welcome to the table all right so Kim and Tim good to have ten minutes to present your report okay don 't want to thank you Andrew morning councillors start for Communities um just as we introduced Tim as our Deputy Chair and Joe is out on board Governance Manager so thank you well it 's lovely to be here we have no part is to report back from our meetings on a 1st of May and 15th of May under the community board decisions and the delegation just like to highlight one thing the board approved the repairs of the earthquake damage Southie right and boardwalk which you can see up there the bridge a short attention in the concept design of the carpark and this has been achieved within the allocated budgets and the community feedback has been brilliant they are so excited that they 're going to get this lovely special asset back and a few enhancements along the way and a really big thank you out to staff because they listened to the community board and a community 's desires and consequently and provided a win-win situation and so this is a really good outcome for us for initiatives we have gotten here up there slide 18 thank you Joe and this is going along really really well it was fantastic to know that they that contract has made a way that the pier could actually stay open while they were repairing it the only time they closed it as when they 've got some big trucks coming in going but majority of Tom 's open up we completed in February 18 and if you 're really interested in that sort of stuff go and have a lot because it is quite fascinating slide 9 Thank You South Brighton gt-r appear great progress has been made on this and this will be completed about July August to this or the links on the South Brighton has got really good movement going on there and again it 's something that you can take kids in and watch on the weekends significant community issues we 've got here with history edge has really predominant for our area with South Brighton here we 've got we 've got three separate issues on the eastern edge there and South Brighton and South as I 've mentioned previously is that the South Shore residents and community came up with their own report on a way to provide protection reinstatement protection that they had before from the earthquakes and they provided this to us at the community board which was done by ocl consultants so they have asked us as a community board to help assist them with that so the progress on that is at the community board have had a briefing meeting with regenerate Christchurch because those particular stretchers in the red zone and we have had that first briefing and then next week we 're hoping to have a follow-up meeting to discuss a way forward real concerns here there as you can see at the top left that sorry top left that as part of the protection gabion baskets is that correct in the insert Britain and South bright in there that 's gabion baskets the wire and the rocks so generally they work but being earthquake damage and the lens slumping it 's proven to be a challenge they 're moving on to the South New Brighton issues there four five and six or still yeah okay sure so we 're just talking about the urgent action required there at South New Brighton part of that was the the land that has been we 've got the slides up there just showing the land yep some of those that 's good the history each there as you can see in the last storm we 've had quite a bit of erosion there which is a real worry for the camping ground at South you Brighton because the history each protection that is there has sunk we 're just finding that 's being eroded quite quickly we were down there on the 1st of May to hand the keys over to the new leases of the South your broken camping ground and they 're really concerned about this because the protection hasn 't been reinstated so we 're discussing this with staff and we 'll bring regenerate Christchurch into that but this is a really urgent issue at the moment cuz we as you can see we 're going to be losing some trees any day now so now I issue which we 've brought up from time to time the community we met with them with me but the effect of residents twice in the last month the meeting we had last night was with the whole community board and to hear their concerns but at the peak at the worst which you can see top left is windows in doors and they 're attracted to light and literally they 're just covered the black this is a real concern and it 's worst it 's like a biblical plague you might say yeah so we 're gonna do something about this and them so then we have Madrid 's okay Maji so these residents and the peak of it they can 't actually go outside are told to shut their windows and doors it 's just just you know quite disturbing so the out of last night 's meeting we the outcome of that was to our staff to provide an options report and the options report will include something from this short-term action and also looking at long term action here because to be quite real everyone is all around the UM email let 's say coupons the sewage treatment ponds and so as a citywide issue we hope to make some progress on this because they shouldn 't be living with it okay so now we go to community boards significant messes of interest we have got the community services award coming up next week and it 's always really exciting to reward acknowledge those who strengthen community spirit and acknowledge the commitment to their making a neighborhood and city a great place to live so we 've got that coming up next week which is amazing also people have mentioned the sticks river

announcement to make before we started our bus tour and Dionne piped up I said you 're pregnant so we _''_7198.06 go budding comedian but the very important announcement that I was going to say was actually there was no East Lee I just needed to make sure that everybody that was on that bus trip actually knew that there was not easily at that point don 't say I think Sarah did come up at 10 past 00 yeah I know I caught me was good wasn 't it yes so these next slides we 've got here as you described xre the right top right that there happens to be the qe2 starting there coming up out of the

consultation at the moment about the little wee footbridge so we 're just waiting for the down beautiful photo that 's where we started off no really fantastic day and DCL rob hall took us through what was happening there oh this is amazing the information imagination station is something new coming to New Brighton opening on the 16th of June it 's a new pop-up is going to be here for ten weeks and this has been made possible by a grant by DC L to the Imagination Station from there creating momentum regeneration fund and so that 's witty thing get on down there with your kids and check that out if you haven 't done the town one you can check this one out as well so it 's not only just a play you also can have school groups can go there after school during school you can also have birthday parties and after school classes so that 's fantastic and there 's a picture down there on the bottom right and that 's the particular Center that we were talking about over some plans there in the last slide finishing up here is the is the what the perfect morning and look at that I just think about as a new morning and it 's and a new start for New Brighton so yeah thank you very much great thank you very much are there any questions on this report glad wonder how your family yeah I 've got a comment out this is how you found that South New Brighton GT and because you 're a new board member cam although our chair but both the jetty and the boardwalk boxes and arriving at that how I find the process yeah getting to that point I thought it was um fantastic for the community to be involved in that I thought it wasn 't amazing how we were as a board were able to revisit a report and how the staff took that on board and went away worked really hard to achieve the results that we were asking for and it was even better than we expected because of the results that we had and was able to come under budget allowing the other things that were needing to be done through earthquake to be done as well so the reason I asked that set up question Oscar Alpers was here before he said he was at only an elected members semmen I took part a few years ago he said always question stuff reports you know what do respect to our staff but that and the asbestos for mediation good examples of when you push hard question things can 't_''_7425.11 be done you know an option may present that it 's just it kinda that 'd be great outcome yeah absolutely fantastic okay thank you [Music] Brizzy churches I consider how we can improve the lot of these people but they 're living in conditions where they can 't actually entertain outdoors they can 't open their doors at night for infiltration of just thousands of midges and when their house has lit up at night they given to the bathroom for example and it 's just a the the window is just a black mess the midges are attracted to the light the sides of their building one neighbor I wonder one person spoke to us last night had erected a new fence an iron fence the just black with midges so I 'm very keen to see some some progress on this issue and it does extend to looking at different sort of chemical applications that we might be able to bowl these midges over right through to the ultimate and quite expensive option of installing a UV plant and our oxidation Osorio sewage treatment plant which would obviate the problem altogether but it comes at some cost and I 'm led to believe something like about two or three thousand dollars a day and power churches to operate it so we have a quote quite a make a problem of some magnitude that we 've got a saw earlier and I just like to respond to say that staff do understand the issue and have taken it seriously so they 've been working on the sir some considerable it 's a very difficult issue to address it 's a huge issue yes so an options paper also took up what 's been done in the past as well so anyway that 's great that we 're we 're acknowledging that we have a huge problem residents some relief and and the next summer months to come yeah clearly there 's some work underway around the shops and just put options paper clearly there 's work that 's been done in the past as well and the hope would be of course that we 're able to put in place any any changes or anything as a result of the options paper prior to the summer months and we 're hearing that loud and clear final question from Pauline I was just going to reiterate that it was on our three waters and waste report yesterday at the et committee so we 'll be following that through and there 's already been significant money spent on this issue so obviously snow we near resolved it as challenging but we 'll be following it through as well and it 's more of a comment really I just want to congratulate this board because you guys are going from strength to strength and the passion that you have for everything you 've got out there and you 're very very lucky to have everything you hear be out I think that your board is leading the regeneration of New Brighton and I just want to congratulate you thanks for you thank you thank you so item 13 the recommendation is to receive the community board report move by Glen seconded by Dave all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much indeed so now we move on to item 14 the mayor 's monthly report gather any questions on this report and I 'm not sure who the questions would be fielded to even if there were any whether I find myself in the position of answering questions on a report that I didn 't write maybe there are no questions Tim moves Jamie seconds all those in favor against that 's carried and then we move to the chief executives report there any questions for the chief executive on this report yeah I 'm taking a question from Phil first and then I 'll come to you Jimmy and then deal and then Glenn right okay but questions first if you 've got comments we 'll take those after the questions okay so Phil our page 78 of the report I think it 's page also page three under corporate services and sexual and housing I just want to clarify I really like the comp the comments like I certainly understand Carlene that worth changing up from our social housing to to come under the Housing Trust that in fact we 've been reducing resources in that area I understand dia but I just really want to ask about the issue of emergency housing in the city where clearly again though the council role is to work with other agencies not to do it all I 'm aware of that but it 's really just can we be assured that we 'll have sufficient resources at council here with social housing expertise to help address this matter thank you it 's a good question as you 're aware we did transfer a number of staff over to the Housing Trust mainly in terms of those people that deliver the services in terms of social housing and the transfer of this work is around them minor maintenance so council stool has is positioned to provide term maintenance issues as well so we 'll still have sufficient expertise to assist and responding to emergency housing matters but as you quite rightly said it 's an issue that we deal with with a number of agencies and the direct delivery of emergency housing tenancy management services sits with other agencies so our role is in terms of it advocacy in support in policy leadership okay thanks Kelly thank you now Jimmy was yours a question or was it a comment okay so I 'll come to that at the end we 'll take questions first okay so Glen I rather the VINs Carlene it says 28% have been tagged of those 2,000 removed from circulation just wonder why and what will happen to those well we replace where they need to be replace some of that 's due to damage some of it 's due to lost funds so it 's about having those cycle of burns that are useful yeah okay unusable usable so yeah okay I 'll come back later with up mm-hmm all right deal mine 's just around the operational results and you you just elaborate a little bit of where that 's come from not specifically but that will be around where our streets are being reopened and car parks reopened around there as well so with this some additional revenue are we looking at potential ways because I mean the central city is still very challenging to get into so with this additional or even you are we 're going to be going to be looking at ways where we can use that to encourage people to come back into the Central City and make it easier for people at the time counseling is Ravens hassling flexures are now is free parking and that sort of thing as that 's important to us to do a bit of an analysis of it about the impact of it the other issues in terms of free car parking with and car parking buildings is really what we can do within our own car park buildings as opposed to those private ones that have been people have invested to put up around the city so there 's a quite a bit of work that we 've also budgeted for your pain for example I would I would personally like to see that money reinvested into the Central City for the for the for the period time anyway justice because is it challenging so suppose there 's a continuation arms yes there 's another question I 've got there is around the personnel costs I mean we 're still we 're still tracking quite a you know 2.7 million dollars at the moment years a day can you elaborate a little bit on that we that 's coming in so a number of things that happened over the year so one of those will be a new facilities that have opened that require to be staffed up but also we 've had a program of reducing our number of contractors and we 're we have them over a long period of time we 're likely to require that source converting them into ETA which is actually a cheaper option for us so roughly at our peak we had something like um that 's around 207 long-term contractors we 're down to 147 and it saves just on the debt servicing as well as their I don 't see any explanation on the the extra that it 's cost on the debt servicing for the year to date is there anyone that can talk about that I think it might be around the capital expenditure now see if I just walked in the door but one of the issues you also see is that while stable with delivery and might be behind capital expenditure as ahead and that 's because of the way we budget to keep it all so it 's been the tradition to budget for slightly lower level than our targets and we 're actually ahead of our targets okay financially which means the debts come in on earlier okay thank you thank you pulling our youth minds also about the favorable revenue to date and one of the reasons being the unplanned crown contribution for three waters an asset management of 4.7 million so that 's the kind of a good news story but how can you explain with it 's it 's come about so we 've been reporting at most some scope projects do you want to speak to that day there will be a contract around service in the red zone in the additional infrastructure that spins around the infrastructure but in that area and so that will be coming to a close unfortunately and so when you say was unplanned was unexpected or you just you expect didn 't deliver with when the original estimates we expected actually the red zone to be empty and you know when it wasn 't in deep we got into an agreement of how we would fund those services in there amongst other things news so when you say it 's coming to an end so you what witnesses and what are we going to do we are run talking about with the crown the crown put a deadline on when that service in that 's got to now integrated viewers that you 'll be aware court cases over our legal obligation to provide those services to it so it 's all wrapped up in there what we are doing is we are looking at ways that we can service those properties done in the past is we 've kept the traditional systems running so you may have a very very long remedy main with only one one house on it which we need to flush every couple of weeks and so what we try to do is look at ways of putting them them pump sewer systems and the end so we 're doing a little bit to make those operational cost broth so you 'll get a drop in cost but you 'll also get a drop of income you get an increase and capital expenditure to put those in and can you tell us what the total cost is per in the moment to service those I 'm sorry I don 't have better at my fingertips but there 's a considerable amount isn 't it I think we have reported at Council I 'm sorry I just don 't have it off the problem be quite good if we could get that a bit quite interesting yeah if we could get that information have a circulation would be good good yep go out to supplement to that could originally it was a crown decision to reap so we provide the services but the crown made the call over rezoning the lane so could we have a please a I 'm not a report but an indication of where the cost lies for extra services over and above such as the fertilizer pump we can probably get a quick answers of where the extra cost lies I imagine there 's no cost but the young along with the outlaws so you know something rather Court case basically said that counsel has an obligation to provide full services to those properties because they 're within our district and they had services and so they have to have those services maintained they don 't actually have to look exactly the same but they have to give the same level of service so that 's what we 're doing we 're modifying those to give a similar levels in its I 'm sorry I wasn 't involved with a court case but it was shrimp through the court quite significant and so the obligation to provide those services sits with Council right going to incur extra cost well um relates back you will call some previous papers around which parts of our infrastructure we could close off and which parts we had to keep available to service those people who are still there so that we 'll have that information pets will dig that one out then included roading to it isn 't it because it do we get the same input and the cost sharing with the roading maintenance was it just the three waters around rewarded some rating is still covered by between ourselves on the crown around maintenance if we are using that and we 've got an agreement with the crown about which we 'd set up which you approved um so I 'll look that report up which would have been probably 18 months ago would imagine and I will have indicative costs in there mr. chinnough yeah great thank you if that can be circulated that we help from sorry it 's bit was coming to an end I just missed it but though you see something is coming to me basically the shared agreement okay costs and we are looking at like I say putting in some capital investment that will give us a return making I think a lot cheaper to do it and principally around cirrage scheme which is the most expensive part of it and do you have a figure on the amount of capital investment we 're going to require and again I think we 've reported that I 'm sorry I don 't have that off the top of me here but we have reported that back to you so I can dig that report up again as well as cheer me that would be helpful thank you thank you very much so questions okay great now Jimmy I 'm aware that you 've got some commentary which we will come to in a minute but I 'll get a mover and a seconder for this report first I 'm happy to move it Sarah 's

report don 't want to thank you Andrew wanting counselors staffing communities just as we introduced Tim about it with each year and Joe is out and board Governance Manager so thank you well it 's lovely to be here we have no part is to report back from our meetings on a 1st of May and 15th of May under the community board decisions and the delegation just like to highlight one thing the board approved the repairs of the earthquake damage South you Brighton boardwalk which you can see up there the bridge is a short section in the concept design of the carpark and this has been achieved within the allocated budgets and the community feedback has been brilliant they are so excited that they 're going to get this lovely special asset back and a few enhancements along the way and a really big thank you out to staff 's desires and consequently and provided a win-win situation and so this is a really good outcome for us for these earthquake repair so thank you significant projects and initiatives we have gotten here up there slide 8 thank you Joe and this is going along really really well it was fantastic to know that they the contract has made a way that the pier could actually stay open while though we 're repairing it the only time they close it is when they 've got some big trucks coming in going but the majority of times open up be completed in February 18 and if you 're really interested in that sort of stuff go and have a lot further is quite fascinating slide 9 Thank You South Brighton G here appear great progress has been made on this and this will be completed about July August at its all the links on the South Brighton has got really good movement going on there and again it 's something that you can take your kids in and watch in the weakest significant community issues we 've got here of South Brighton here we 've got we 've got three separate issues on the eastern edge there and South Brighton and South Shore but that all related so the first one as I 've mentioned previously is that the South Shore residents and community came up with their own report on a way to provide protection reinstatement protection that they had before from the earthquakes and they provided this to us at the community board which was done by ocl consultants so they have asked us as a community board to help assist them with that so the progress on that is that the community board have had a briefing meeting with regenerate Christchurch because those particular stretchers in the red zone and we have had that first briefing and then next week we 're hoping to have a follow-up meeting to discuss a way forward real concerns here there as you can see at the top left that sorry top left that as part of the protection gabion baskets is that correct him there in South Brooklyn and South Brighton the other it 's gabion baskets the wire and and the lens slumping it 's proven to be a challenge they 're moving on to the South New Brighton issues there which is that land area of Southwest rope slide three four five and six we 're still via yeah okay sure so we 're just talking about the urgent action required there at South New Brighton part of that was the the land that has been we 've got the slides up there just showing the land yep some of those yep that 's good the history each there as you can see in the last storm we 've had quite a bit of erosion there which is a real worry for the camping ground at South you Brighton because the history each protection that is there has sunk we 're just finding that 's been eroded quite quickly we were down there on the 1st of May to hand the keys over to the new leases of the south you 're broken camping ground and they 're really concerned about this because the protection hasn 't been reinstated so we 're discussing this with staff and we really urgent issue at the moment cuz we as you can see we 're going to be losing some trees any day now so never on so coming up here this is the mergers issue which we 've brought up from time to time the community we met with them with me but the effect of residents twice in the last month the meeting we had last night was with the whole community board and to hear their concerns but at the peak at the worst which you can see top left is windows and doors and they 're attracted to light and literally they 're just covered the black this is a real concern and it 's worst it 's like a biblical plague you might say it 's moving yeah so we 're going to do something about this and them so then we have Majid okay Maji so these residents and the peak of it they can 't actually go outside they 're told to shut their windows and doors it 's just just um you know quite disturbing so the out of last night 's meeting provide options report and the options report will include something from this short term action and also looking at long term action here because to be quite real everyone in this room actually contributes to this problem because this is all around the UM email let 's say coupons the sewage treatment ponds and so as a citywide issue we hope to make some progress on this because they shouldn 't be living with that okay so now we go to community board significant messes of interest we have got the community services award coming up next week and that 's always really exciting to reward acknowledge those who strengthen community spirit and ignited the commitment to their making our neighborhood and city a great place to live so we 've got that coming up next week which is amazing also people have mentioned the steps River source-to-sea bus fantastic host thank you very much really enjoyed that and now yeah that was amazing food was really great as well and we 're part of that now as we 've adopted the Spencer vol in Brooklyn 's and to our 'll put a link and this is a really great story about two community groups patrons Bowling Club and the Parkins Rugby Football Club coming together pulling resources and being really innovative and creative with their the outcomes that they 've achieved and they 've managed to secure buildings or buildings from the freeboard primary school to make this come about they 're going to be building it and stages but you have to go to the link to just chicken to that so don 't have a picture oh I do we do later the national becoming ebook conference which some of us attended there that was a fantastic conference we provided you with the link and can i strongly encourage counselors and staff to have a professional development day or two with the same guest speakers that we had because they were really fantastic about setting really encouraging unspecial so that was fantastically part of it the coastal bird community board bus well thank you to everybody that came we had a lot of fun all the pictures that we 're seeing up here I think we can you Dion I have a really important announcement to make before we started our bus tour and Dion popped up I said you 're pregnant so we haven 't_''_504.699 we haven 't got a budding photographer also go budding comedian and but the very important announcement that I was going to say was actually there was no Eastley um I just needed to make sure that everybody that was on that bus trip actually knew that there was not easily at that point don 't say thank Sarah did come up at 10 past 00 he oh no I caught me was good wasn 't it yes so these next slides we 've got here as you respect sorry the right top right that there happens to be the qe2 starting there coming up out of the ground now the sporting recreation absolutely fantastic went there and saw that fantastic down below the Spencer will surf lifesaving new clubrooms awesome facility it 's going to be it won 't be able to open until we get them potable water so hence our annual plan request or 50,000 there for them the top left we have the Horseshoe Lake reserve route and consultation at the moment about the lolly footbridge so we 're just waiting for the results of that at the bottom there is they going down beautiful photo that 's where we started off no really fantastic day and DCL rob hall took us through what was happening there oh this is amazing the information imagination station is something new coming to New Brighton opening on the 16th of June it 's a new pop-up it 's going to be here for ten weeks and this has been made possible by a grant by DCL to the Imagination Station from there creating momentum regeneration fund and so that 's really think it on down there with your kids and check it out if you haven 't done the town line you can check this one out as well so it 's not only just to play you also can have school groups can go there after school during school you can also have birthday parties and after school classes so that 's fantastic and there 's a picture down Center that we were talking about were some plans there in the last slide finishing up here as the as the what the perfect morning and New Brighton that 's absolutely amazing picture and when I look at that I just think about it 's a new morning and it 's an a new start for New Brighton and so yeah thank you very much great thank you very much are there any questions on this report glad wonder how you found the I 've got a comment after that 's how you found the South New Brighton GT and because you 're a new board member campbellot our chair but but the jetty and the boardwalk props is arriving at that how I find the process yeah getting to that point I thought it was um fantastic for the community to be involved in that I thought it wasn 't amazing how we were as a board were able to revisit a report and how the staff took that on board and went away we really had to achieve the results that we were asking for and it was we had and was able to come under budget allowing the other things that were needing to be done through earthquake to be done as well so that was absolutely the process I thought was really encouraging the reason I asked that set up question Oscar Elpis was here before he said he was at only an elective Emma 's Semin I took part a few years ago we see always question stuff reports you know what do respect to our staff but there and the asbestos remediation good examples of when you push hard a question things can be done you know an option they present that it suggests it kind that 'd be great outcome yeah it 's what you 're fantastic okay thank you [Music] with not to us consider how we can improve the lot of these people but they 're living in conditions where they can 't actually entertain outdoors they can 't open their doors at night for infiltration of just thousands of midges and when their houses lift up at night they govern to the bathroom for example and it 's just a are attracted to the light the sides of their building one neighbor I wonder one person spoke to us last night had erected a new fence an iron fence the fence got warm in the summer months and it was just black with midges so I 'm very keen to see some some progress on this issue and it does extend to looking at a different sort of chemical applications that we might be able to bowl these images over right through to the ultimate and quite expensive option of installing a UV plant and our oxidation Osorio sewage treatment plant which would obviate the problem altogether but it comes at some cost and I 'm led to believe something like about two or three thousand dollars a day and power charges to operate it so we have quite a big enough problem of some magnitude that we 've got I saw earlier and I just like to respond to say that staff do understand the issue and have taken it seriously so they 've been working on this first I 'm considerable it 's a very difficult issue to paper also took up what 's been done in the past as well so anyway that 's great that we 're we 're acknowledging that we have a huge problem and I hope that we 're able to give these residents some relief in the next summer months to come yeah clearly there 's some work underway around this options put options paper clearly there 's work that 's been done in the past as well and the would be a course that we 're able to put in place any any changes or anything as a result of the options paper prior to the summer months and we 're hearing that loud and clear final question from Pauline I was just going to reiterate that it was on our three borders and waist report yesterday at the et Committee so we 'll be following that through and there 's already been significant money spent on this the shoe so obviously snow we near resolved it as challenging but will be following it through as well and it 's more of a comment really I just want to congratulate this and the passion that you have for everything you 've got out there and you 're very very lucky to have everything you have out there in the environment it 's a real gym and I think that your board is leading the regeneration of new blocky mall and I just want to congratulate you Thanks thank you thank you so item 13 the recommendation is to receive the committee board report moved by Glenn seconded by Dave all those in favor against that 's carried thank you very much indeed _"

    "text": "okay so then we move to the Banks Peninsula Community Board Christine good morning welcome and looking forward to hearing what 's happening on the peninsula this morning thank you thank you Andrew good morning everyone so and we have three things to highlight this morning good so the first being Bering Strait community center the opening of each and and then we 've got air reserve management cleen 's discovery a bit of an update or me and then we have a plea from the seafarers association so to start off what is the facility that 's just about ready to be opened and the residents and all the community buildings fleet absolutely thrilled about this new facility it 's been a long time coming and it 's been hard fought for and the name of that is Tim to matter happily in it 's going to be open on the 23rd of June and the successful bill for this as a combination of strong community and Christchurch City Council collaborative process and the build itself has been completely project managed by the community and with the support of wine but community managed so it 's a real team effort I think really look even if it needs to be congratulated for such for any search the council contributor 180,000 but the little couldn 't sorry the literature the little revert worried a community trust then took out the bayesian and fund raise the two hundred thousand that was laid it on top of eight so it was great if it also the only goin costs or the counselor minimal as it 's going to be community runs so I think there 's lots to celebrate this and your own voyage it was a reminder that you 're invited to attend the opening at the greater you come along support the beer and sleep community so I 'm sure that you would have seen need invitation come three diaries or something Emily good well the next is a receive planing on the bench financial reserves planing so and we have muster peaks in Tioga in our mayor the Misty Peaks is a bit ground to uproar in Tioga as close to the river in area as portable receiver for around so we mister pegs receive and it contains no blocks of old growth in Reid beech forest and their outer base the high tops at mostly played with snow tussock in regeneration indigenous montane forest here 's a higher potential for native vegetation regeneration so and with all of these receives and we are going out to do community consultation just to see exactly what they 'd like season seen done with them in mustard Peaks in Tioga currently do not have management committees so that 's just a process that needs to be route through the ta keo receive was a bit even heat D use of old-growth or put a cap forest which has remnant of the original pre European forests that once dominated bents Peninsula so least among percent of it remains that is a considerable amount of total regeneration with tray you strayed five meters high scattered through both the tumble down stream in the Tioga base stream valleys so young there 's a bit of work to be done there or a bear reserve and so this just shows the tenure of which comprised so we have a quite a bit cadet idea that looks after our Amir and they concentrate on the plant species in using locally sourced plants and for that receive in this particular receiveth Holly are used by walkers and mountain bikers so the clean has just been updated at the moment and it 's item as of urgency fear center and so at the meeting on the 22nd of May there was dictation to the board so what and the Sophia is are looking for as an input will support for an implementation of port levy this is basically to help support the running of the signature and that is quite volatile to the sea going and mean that coming to the port so they 're basically are supplied with a Nia where they can go in make contact with you field moves they have computers if they need to exchange mummy they can do with a here 's a photo of some of the mean little chance always provided a safe your signature but after the earthquakes we lost the one that was these so we here the to try and keep boy so fortunately we near hit this facility but it 's not on a permanent property so that 's another part of the problem so in also as well done on voluntary you know you what start by volunteers who can 't always baby so what it means that we 've got this lovely facility but it 's not always open because it 's a shortage of volunteers school and so the Savior 's are really looking to say here they can get support for a levy so they can look at my putting a miniature and so this all comes in line with their obligations to and support maritime labour convention which was just adopted and March of this year so we don 't have a responsibility to these mean and it 's quite we see a lot of them have another little ton as we 've done over the years and although basically born to someone who doesn 't go and connect until the three makes you know connect time and so that 's what it 's about so I was a way for spaced port well it was a lot of consumed about what 's happening there so it 's a really great thank you very much indeed Christine and the board actually asked for some further work to be done the report back on the Littleton seafarers Center issue and so that 'll be an ongoing conversation but yeah quality of welcome for those visiting seafarers to Littleton certainly was something model concerned about so when I moved questions Tim and then Dion think you would regard to the seafarers and area could the LPC not clock the ticket with regards to the the berthing costs and put a bit on top so depth in funds the the center because I mean we have a responsibility but I would suggest that the employers have allergic responsibility in soon as they into New Zealand waters it would be it should be leveraged because they we have a finite amount of money we 're having trouble housing rowing people and it just keeps going a go so I mean just thinking outside the box for hips and going back to the source there does ideal with it could happen but I think I just would like you know board support but as a council how do we move that forward it 's exactly the information that 's coming back to the board and certainly what was proposed by the seafarers center was a lever on visiting ships exactly Tim as you 're proposing rather than that council should fund this articular facility the moment it 's on land is owned by an independent fisheries that 's an arrangement which is is great for the moment but may not be able to continue long term but there are two issues that one that the lanes are separate issue if we can get leverage off to a little port company on the birthing yet of ships and it solves the funding problem indeed and the other problem as a lander should watch as technically I suppose for one of the bidder as the boards or else yeah and that might be an area where council can assist but certainly on the levy what the board has asked for is information to come back on how that you suggest that it would be a levy on visiting ships thank you great thank you deal is there an internet cafe in Littleton no just a library just the library because that could mix self-sufficient make you know these things you know they always require money but we 've got to think about ways to make him self-sufficient and I mean when I was on ships that was the first thing we did go and look cause that internet cafe I have a glass a or a beer or something like that and and get on the internet so even his is it an option that 's been looked at the library sprayed I think before and the fear of center was developed this was a resident they were gone to the library and after as I was certainly out so I just pick up on the Wi-Fi so it wasn 't a secret sudden it was happening but he 's at the moment we only have the library as the other alternative so you know the volunteers that they have got only a very god but I mean keep you know eggs and meant to have it opened 7 so I mean I got hip training mmm but these are certainly one of the things that most and say heroes want to do like you say I want to be sure and just you know make contact with the theme leaves and so it 's really important we do have a duty of care and that 's the first time I 've ever and now on well before this facility was developed that little didn 't hear both seafarers sent us so this is what created the problem of them sitting outside in the cold so thank you Dave and then Phil thank you more of a comment than a question council Scandrick talked of imposing a levy on shipping coming into the port for to perhaps assist in the provision of this facility compensations I 'm aware of the times is that a number of of shipping organizations particularly some of their fishing operations actually go to Timaru because the the cost of berthing at Littleton is getting increasingly higher so we need to be mindful of say well the ships coming into port we can impose a levy on them we have to be mindful of shipping movements around the South Island and the perception that at times the Bertha charges at Littleton are quite high and a number of shipping firms actually choose to go to to Marui because of that so we don 't really want to further exacerbate shipping companies not choosing to go to Littleton as a consequence yep so it 's I mean Dave that 's a fair comment and I mean this is exactly the kind of information the Board expects to get back rather than just making a decision to do something or to advocate something straight away we felt there was a need for further information to be brought back so thank you very much for that comment and then finally coming up thanks Christine in like you referred to the Tioga and musty pigs management which is part of parks this won 't ask you about other areas which are owned by private landowners because used today a tea committee we recommended actually sitting up over it part of it took Katie to enhance the environment some of the gullies fencing off planting the kind of thing so I just without on the way you board your board won 't have a chance to discuss this we 're just wondering if you think that your board might support such a such a fund Oh can 't see why not yeah and I think that well I can 't speak for everybody but um I think it 's something that they would be open-toe yeah yes I think we could have further discussion to think oh great thank you very much so um I 'm now happy that some we received the community board report so I 'll move that and do I have a seconder Pauline the lives in favor against that 's carried thank you very much and thanks Christine for the report good to have you with us okay and then _"

    "text": "q okay so our next item is item 10 the report of the pepper nui Ennis community board to council alley Jones you see this morning alley great to have you with us if you 'd like to come forward to the table thank you thanks Andrew hi everyone people seeking anything on our trip oh well we should be able to do there it 's in part thank you he go right already we did try I wanted to put some little rugby people in those seats to acknowledge the tour that we have on at the moment we 'll do that perhaps next time because it doesn 't look good with empty seats there okay we 'll just let that roll over no parties and the Pavano units reports today some of the significant projects in the ward at the moment the main one really is the the thermal burns community center which is being hugely it was hugely anticipated by the by the community a part of that community center new builds involves the relocation of the señal burns Lyons building to McFarlane Park which I know party in place which is meeting regularly talking to sports groups the lines themselves City Council community staff currently at the moment the staff and the working party are working through planning issues resource consent because the land is reserve lands so there are just some formalities really well hopefully they 're just formalities we need to go through to get the boxes to their costs of moving and fitting it out and so forth that 's an ongoing conversation at the moment and we 'll have to tie in very closely with the build date for the community the new community center I 'm also looking for somewhere that community groups can go to while the community center as being built McFarland Park will be filling a major need for that particular part of our world so we still need space for community groups and we are looking at a number of places around the world for that we 've been doing a lot of work with the Stix area and the community groups out towards the sticks it was a meeting held in June 2015 and there have community is concerned about the health of the Stix this in fact you 'll see up there now there are some slides relating to a source-to-sea bus trip that we held recently and was very well attended by members of all of the community boards one of the issues is maintaining not only the environmental health of the sticks and all of the flora and fauna related to that but flooding and lowland levels are a concern and issue around this area as well but great communication and fantastic support from the staff and working with the community groups on that and it 's hoped that representatives from the local community will find time to commit to working on the sticks working party which as I said is being put together at the moment we 're getting an increasing number which is really fantastic of young people coming to the board not only to request funding and we have no budgets for that as all the community boards do but then coming back and reporting on what they 've achieved and we are using those as an opportunity to promote media those positive outcomes and some of them are quite phenomenal we had a group from Belfast school the prefix and house captains came to our 9th of May board meeting to report and their involvement in a leadership camp and we 've also heard from case Brook intermediate on that as well and it 's really funny I remember one boy the first boy to speak he stood up and he said I think I 'm probably going to be really terrible at this those were his first words but by the time he got through what he was actually saying to the board man he was just humming and was really confident and then listened to his classmates say similar things and we 've heard from teachers with whom we meet regularly every quarter at Pappa Nui honest they come in there 's one a week on Friday and they are sizing major positive changes and not only the house captains and prefix that are attending these leadership courses but other students that work with these house captains and prefix as well so it 's a hugely important our ward are we having youth principals meeting a week on Friday Kathleen Liberty will attend that you may know the name Kathleen has undertaken some psychosocial research relating primarily to how the earthquakes affected children in Christchurch and also as you may have heard children who were not even born at the time of the quakes and the problems that schools are having to deal with and other community groups are having to deal with so she 's presenting to the world principals a week on Friday just yesterday we had a meeting one of the major issues and I 've raised it before when I 've talked to to you all is the ongoing stress and problems we are seeing in the eastern part of our world oh I mention again around Shirley and Richmond and you would have been well aware of the outcome of the well-being survey that was released yesterday and how a number of people in New Brighton and further East were quoted and spoken to about that I reiterate again we are seeing exactly the same issues and stresses in our Ward so the East clearly it is but it is happening in our world as well in the east of our Ward around Richmond and Shirley and this is the area that is short of community facilities and again I remind you of our annual plan submission related to the Shirley Community Center yesterday we met at the center at the Shirley primary school there are ongoing road safety issues outside the school it is a very congested part of Shirley have been exacerbated by roadworks for a very long time the issue there is red light runners the meeting we had yes which was pulled together by our community board staff governance staff very cool reasonably quickly included police the school parents christchurch city council parking enforcement penny gray our engineer and a number of our community board staff we came out of that meeting with seven action points one of those is to look at doing a full safety audit of that 's called a corridor audit so not just around the immediate external part of the school but from Hills Road right down to just before the palms that suggested that a 40 case school zone light might help and they 're expensive and we have to take a lot of NZTA boxes related to getting that we 've then discussed looking at getting a warning sign which basically just says children so if drivers are aware that there are children in the area because the school is not that obvious it actually looks like a big office building that 's very new along there if you 've been along there if drivers are aware of children in the area they will slow down so it 'll be a combined effort the sign police and forcing city council enforcing and also someone suggested the children holding flags as they cross the road as they do it 's in orbits and Albans primary great suggestion very simple to do so it was a very positive meeting and we 're looking at having something in four weeks basically to be able to act on there so just a good example of engaging with the community face to face and getting some positive outcomes I think that 's all great thank you right time for a couple of questions Vicki just on your area would be sensible just to lower the speed limit permanently we discussed this yesterday it was interesting because some people said that there is something in law already that dictates you must guess the travel at forty caves in our outside of school some said that 's true some said it wasn 't an interesting reputation at the Ettie committee on on this very subject right learn quite a lot from it and that 's the issue it 's not speed because traffic congestion is so great outside the school the traffic 's crawling anyway so that 's why the other sign was of more use potentially here against visibility yeah yeah yeah the questions so we have a recommendation to receive the community board report do I have a mover mic seconded Pauline all those in favor again yes Carrie thanks very much indeed a link towards update thank you _"

arnold at linking of the 29th may the board talked about the proliferation of digital billboards that appearing throughout community board area area the board notes that the council has a policy relating to develop a policy on digital billboards and outdoor advertising and rather than moving it just up to the rm8 1 of this community resilience partnership fund criteria the board discussed this and is asking the council to engage and discuss with tangibles on the criteria for the community resilience partnership opponent Christchurch Botanic Garden spatial plan now note that this has been out for consultation and we 're asking that the council have a representative from our community board when they decide on the membership of the heron 's panel for this plan community board communications strategy and the board would actually like a discussion on how the council can support us to communicate to the public built on what the alimentive wanted Green is is doing and the good things that we 're doing in our area community boards significant levels of interest Lynwood village and the board requested a meeting with regenerate Christchurch to specifically discuss about regeneration of Lynwood Village area and leaving a lot of negative press about this area and we want to have a revitalization plan that reflects the community aspirations and in can do this in vote and we she organized the meeting with Environment Canada we just with our board to discuss air quality public transport and some other issues at an outboard area it 's happening when 's that happening next week or next week yeah the Board discussed the composition of the proposed council coastal futures group and we 'd like to ensure that any process developed aligns with our communities would like to have this very important conversation I think this has moved on since this part was nothing so we 've actually had a meeting already on that and Park Rangers the board agrees with community feedback on the high standard work the paint Park Rangers do and how they work with volunteers around the city and the network contributing to keeping down the costs of maintaining green spaces the world is supportive increasing the number of Park Rangers in our city as noted in a staff report to the finance in performance committee and lastly I just like percent Jack McClelland who 's not here today my Deputy Chair who stood infront several occasions recently was very much Jake and thank you everyone for listening great thank you very much indeed Sally we 've got time for a couple of questions so I 'm pulling thank you report but I 'm just highlighting the 7.1 the Linwood village and you mentioned that your you 're planning on having some meetings with region and you 're going to work with the community where is that air as it progressed at all because we 're getting a little bit of compilation if you like with the cycleway program going through there and the Linwood village has being kind of brought up as part of that so IOT committee is actually we 're going to back to the beholders whistle hi but what we 're talking about here is more like the problems we 've got was people hanging around drinking all day taking drugs whatever they 're doing and we want to try and do regeneration forward and revitalization for that I think the issue you 're talking about in terms of course there petitioner came to the acuity and there 's a different issue that I 'm different issue but they 're mixing them up so what I 'm trying to say what your hair you 're progressing with the Linwood village revitalization plan okay so the Tafari rumata have been leading the pre-engagement on revitalization of the Linwood village area and what they 've done is they 've spoken to the community about what issues they celebrate about the local community what the concerns are and one of the concerns that did come up is around the shopping center and how there are a lot of businesses that have moved out there 's generally a sense that if nothing is done to change how things are currently in Linwood Village that whole area will continue to be quite depressed both people and place the issue that come to the ethic committee is something that was discussed even during the consultation process from the major cycling routes and it raised it here again as businesses realized that unless in their opinion that intersection remains open to traffic both ways there isn 't going to be enough there isn 't going to be enough business generated because they down Wooster Street when there 's actually nothing to stop therefore there isn 't a beautiful coffee shop there isn 't anything that would attract people to them winter so it is something that need to be worked on at the same time the discussions of to regenerate Christchurch around out I think are going to be around how does regenerate work with the local community so that they can support a community lead process that doesn 't just look at what the master plan aspirations were what the aspirations are on Community Development are and what the housing aspirations are but something that looks holistically at that whole area and tries to address the different issues so there will be a second step with different stakeholders who may be involved in the regeneration like housing New Zealand Christchurch City Council whoever else is identified through the pre-engagement can come together and start to have a discussion on working though that 's really here origin because I agree we need to do something there and so have you had the meeting with region or a Christchurch here that 's on alright do I have a mover for the report Sara seconded for link Odeon yep great okay so moved Sara seconded Dion all those in favor against as carried thank you very much indeed for the report in the update today thank you _"

    "text": "thank you very much indeed Mike and thanks to your on board for the work that they 're doing thank you thank you very much much appreciated hanging lip so Nexon anywhere just yet next I would call Carolyn Potter and Melanie cocoa comes the table as well I assume from the Sprague and Kashmir community board Carolyn and Melanie good morning and welcome you have 10 minutes to present your board reports and we look forward to hearing from people here or tatto and we will be guided by our pictures at the beginning form over function and wherever the pictures are there coming don 't worry every day is rude here we go we 've got a title right right so we 're just going to roll through the images we got here so in this slide we 've got an initiative by our recreation advisor Emma baby who decided be a good idea to do a go get set go workshop with the youth who were hit approach the board about having basketball lights and hang a park because she wanted to get VM cups killed to that over an initiative and gotten more to come along and ran that workshop herself you can see there in the middle and um what the kids said at the end she said what have you learned today and sheet then they said to here we believe that you do a whole lot more work than what we do so it was really cool um that she 'd done that and we 're really appreciative of it and um ya know it 's building the community basically a good Community Development looks like youth who runs us ah and these pictures are probably adding 10 times which I helped deliver and delivered over the weekend and as a wonderful local news leader and this is the opening of the Little River link cycle way which I 've already mentioned I received notice of of the opening 24 hours before it happened it poured with rain but those are fantastic turnout and apparently the food provided and by the contract it was terrific and so those know that some of the local people here and and local dignitaries as well and but it 's a very good thing for Eddington and it always has been a good thing for Eddington and one of the things that did was because there was a cycle way coming off Brahm from Collins Street we closed traffic into Eddington from from Brahm which meant that the RET run through to town which used to occur with people going round our old and beautiful Mary 's Church at 70 and 80 Kay 's and running into bollards and wrecking the local neighborhood they 'd been stopped from coming off and doing that wreck run in but the cycleway has been acknowledged by the locals I know it 's such a shame it 's been acknowledged by the locals as well as cyclists as being of great benefit to the neighborhood have made very pleased to have it here 's some pictures of some plants native plants so and when Zach recent much runs but there 's a there 's a walkway between when Zach resident in Littleton street I don 't know if you know where we sprang scholars and there was a community group an was on at about five years ago wanting to put an a community garden and apparently at the time the report came it was a little bit tricky because of the sort of legalese around the leaned and the trickiness of it but finally what they 've been able to do is rather than putting in an eatable kind of garden they 're putting in native plants so you can see in the slide the bit where they 've sprayed off the graphs on either side a little parents wait here it 's like right next to a pedestrian crossing so they 'll wait there for their kids to cross the road and take them home so they had a big plant out about two weekends ago putting lots of plants and which we should have got some photos over but they 're on Facebook if you look around on the so that 's pretty cool and this is Martin 's bowling club came to see us there was so strategic fantastic they came to see a month ago just to talk about the Sid Martins bowling club and looked said absolutely not and here they are providing coaching to local school pupils around the corner from the bowling club it is it is a venue which is being in the middle of Sint Maartens and has people going there to speak for instance I 've spoken there at a previous Club meeting and so it 's available to the community and lo and behold we got a request last week for funding for two heat pumps which we were delighted to approve and this is part of the board 's bus tour and this is we 're looking at the reservoir which is in the postmodern photograph on at the bottom it looks as though it could be something out of the film Chinatown and the reservoir is a great space there 's already been a wedding held dear you can 't see what it looks like but to walk into it and there 's walls on either side and concrete up the front shut up Michael and and there 's a long there and it 's a great space for movies or weddings or any kind of function but is very functional and we 're hoping that this reservoir space will have great public use in this between the two reservoirs we hope that this space will provide a function of a great function space for the people who live on Hunt 's B Hill who because lots of people living on the hills don 't have access to green and we are hoping that this will be able to provide a resource for the local people as well as a wider community including the summertime 's crowd because we just did a bus trip quite recently as you know I 'm a couple of only councilors came along and the other thing that was probably one of the highlights was going to old stone house and having Ritchie and the contrary to talk about there appears that they 're doing which are quite intricate but what was quite cause when you go there there 's like a little boardwalk and you can just climb onto it and all of a sudden you on the roof and you can see what they 're doing underneath all is plastic 've never been in the building myself so I can 't wait till it 's open and we can go in there and hit a function or something like that so I am and the bloke who talked to us he loved he was from the UK and he lived right next door to the stone that we are getting to help rebuild the building the clay in the UK that were the coming from there and he was of course a stonemason it was really fantastic to talk to him and his prior the prior building that he had done just prior to the old stone house was The Adventure Park which has just had an award for architecture so we 've gone from this really modern recycled timber building and the adventure part to the old stone house and he was such an interesting person to talk to our concern with this building in the future will be that the volunteers are getting older and we are will be looking for a rejuvenated community committee structure to handle the building and I think the council here is going is the facilities in our community and the running of them and I think we 're going to have to think up innovative ideas to manage those issues in the future and the floodplain management this is 2014 round the loop at Beckenham and the next one that in those and the next one is last week with the reins on the floodplain on sparks Road and these basins on Sparks road and Hendersons road and Sutherlands Road and in other areas up in the southwest around the new developments a design by the drainage guys to prevent flooding further downstream in the hiss Kerr and we are thrilled to see them and to help them and as these basements get developed and the trees start to grow they 'll also become a walking facility for the local neighbourhood and thanks to carlene 's intervention we 've got signs up behind these around these basins in Puna why and all around to explain to the community that it isn 't yet another housing development about to come in but a flood basin to help prevent flooding in Christchurch because I its people what we are doing how we are doing it and why we are doing it and I think we should be putting more signs up around projects so what 's happening and where the rate payers dollars are going because it 's really good to tell the community you may think this is a problem right now but what 's going to happen in the future will be great for all of us just as this is and then we and do the buses fees and so another thing that 's happening is next week we 're going to have the community come along to talk about um bus routes and we all know with the changes worth II cans bus routes over the last few years I sort of become more difficult for people and people are wanting routes and certain places like up the hill and through some of the old and things so we 're going to get ekn council to come along and talk to them and find out about what they wanting and to get their information together so it 's nice moment Kashmir view on Hospital provides laundry for all of Bupers facilities in Christchurch and the smell from the laundry has been a bane for local neighbors for five years or more and continues to be a bane and we would like greater involvement from you can in on these issues about air quality and we 've had a meeting between Bupa and us and again which was a good meeting and the co-operative meeting but we 'd like to see some big decisions being made about air quality in Christchurch and we 're at the moment we 're doing consultations on the community plan and we 're having such fun with it and we 've been into several supermarkets and last night Melanie and I and staff members were at the rally shops and we were interviewing young people mostly young people a in the community at the rally shops about their response to the community plan and it was just so interesting their understanding their interpretation for instance of culture which involved their first languages which were tonk and Salman Narayan and and their interest in pursuing their their against and me in the smart and supermarket they would have been talking about the Cathedral so it 's just interesting to talk about the culture and their heritage and what they want in the community and whether they want all building two new buildings and public transporting things and so it was great fun and the other one is Vista place we 've been a real problem up there with people in cars smoking excuse substances and playing God but music at the top of their the top of the annoys and call it their local residents calling the police most nights actually last night before last they were there until 00 a.m. and we really wish that we could resolve their issue we 're trying to get a meeting between traffic engineers police and us going it 's very difficult to get the police to come to meetings picked up great thank you very much so there is time for a couple of questions the hannspree reserve um reservoir it just seems a really logical thing that this is a whole suburb lots of kids up beer it to think and we want to thank Tim Drennen and his team for being open-minded and opening it to the community because it took some time to kind of get that across and if I had gone up there with my son and F we had gone to the gates which are bigger than Fort Knox 's a feat of engineering and if we had decided to have a competition to jump them I might have got over at nine point six seconds which bit my son who was over ten if we had actually done there so great thank you fill mine isn 't a question but a quick comment to run think the board for a very full report but to just the comments in relation to the little of a cycle way and I think the aware that in fact that the opening of that was run by NZTA so but what I do want to say is what counsel are really grateful for the huge support that the community board gave well look at the whole cycleway project really and the local residence it was a really proactive and and and supporting you know what will be a as a neat project so thank you for their great and it was happy to move or sick of the report to be on time yep all right so film moves ten seconds I 'll take a couple of other questions one from Dion one from Ann and then we 'll move on beyond now this is more a I don 't know how to ask this it 's more response of what was said about that what how why com 'st can we get some sort of report to the innovation and sustainable development committee about common strategy around that sort of stuff because the that committee is in charge of the council 's brand and communication strategies sorry I 'm getting a cold and I 'd actually like to soon from what was just said actually moved that on further not sure what you were asking for around communications around it did so I think that it 's just something we get on and do you know in terms of your proposal is that um as about what 's going on and showing people that you know this is a council project as opposed to something else so we can just do it from the committee all right sounds good just doing it sounds gross just do it okay great all right great thanks don 't and finally an yeah just a fantastic work engaging with the community particularly young people people earth and secondly and winners your II can bus routes meeting because it would be Greenwich I think it 's on Monday night would it be okay if you know I can I attended with it I 'm not sure they got a part it 's just a bit similar issues or checking rockets at the door okay I 'll take the disease thank you great thank you very much indeed for the update night certainly echo the comments made by um Phil Clearwater around the opening of the little of a link cycle way I attended that with a number of other counselors and Carolyn yes indeed the food was particularly good but the event was particularly good and it 's so important this case the way that that particular cycleway was well supported by the local community so it was was great to see so many people there that I know and if I had needed a red fridge arriving at that time yeah and we certainly take that point and Phyllis certainly addressed that in his comments as well but thank you so when we now move to receive your community board report do I have a mover feel seconded by Tim all in favor against that 's carried

    "text": "to patient and we do have one presentation in the public forum this morning can I invite Mary tingey from the veggie garden project to the table good morning Mary thank you very much indeed for coming along all right now you have five minutes this morning and you can leave time for questions within that five minutes if you wish so welcome and we 're looking forward to hearing from you thank you well um we 're here in response to a healthy food action plan as you 're aware the purpose of the action plan is to make healthy food choices easy which is in line with the purpose of our veggie garden project the veggie garden clergy is response to the call for rediscovering the simple joy of delicious food which cabbage certainly is mouth-watering Cardigans developed for soil fertility grow strong Ganic plants and under this process that then forms a true attraction for people so I 'm Lee hae and I am the chairperson the colibri community gardens association i coordinate the orchards and school program for the Canterbury horticultural society and currently I work community gardens I have 40 years teaching experience plus eight years in the community garden sector and good morning and my name is Jacqueline abound and I am the secretary of the Canterbury community gardens association and presently the coordinator of the Littleton community garden and a member of project Littleton over the last 11 years I have taught cooking and garden in primary schools both here and in Australia and have developed support networks school gardens working with the garden to table project in New Zealand and the Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden program in Australia as well as developing developing a community hub here in the harbor Basin area now our vision is for luxuriant gardens across Christchurch full of seasonal organic vegetables herbs fruits and flowers we 've done the photo well done the photo is an example here is example of the Delta community garden in springtime these gardens would be places where people can come to learn the skills needed to grow harvest and cook their own delicious fresh food they will learn to teach these skills to others while working in schools and communities the world whilst building friendships and lifelong relationships so this is the photograph from the era known primary school where we had grown delicious fresh food and little garden and the children were about to make themselves cultural sandwiches and this boys and his interaction with a cabbage says it all now our project itself has four aspects to it which tie together we have foundation gardens workshops apprenticeships program and community connections foundation gardens these guns will be thriving models where people come to learn to teach and to enjoy food these will be the energy drivers for the project as lush green violets bring people together now workshops and we 're looking to organize workshops that will respond to the interests of the wider community that will stimulate others to participate in the veggie garden project and also to initiate their own organic projects in the communities as you see here people had grown garlic there now got together to clap the garlic and the garlic would then be stored in the community kitchen for them to cook and one of the the main things with the veggie garden community connections and the veggie garden project plans to widen these connections through workshops visits and newsletters we need schools and community gardens and the community all working together apprenticeships there 's a well-known into doing generational gap and the skills required to to grow and sustain and drive local food projects with I was just talking to someone the other day and the four year olds did not have to know how to grow they rely on an eight-year-old to teach them apprenticeships will pass on growing harvesting and cooking skills as well as teaching and community skills and a positive enthusiastic and appreciative environment after their training the producers will work as garden coordinators and new Gardens that 's establishing a strong supportive network of gardens throughout Christchurch and that photo and photo working with very small children it is a skill that needs to be taught how people can teach and gardens and finally among the big hurdles community initiatives is the school people to drive the projects while growing fresh fruit at a community level for the past two months we have been designing the veggie the outcome of the veggie garden project will be more people skilled to grow harvest and cook in their own homes schools and community gardens this is a grass roots community based project we are researching that this is a five-year project that we are seeking funding for next twelve months to get the project underway thank you thank you very much indeed for the presentation that brings us to the end of the five minutes we haven 't got time for any questions unfortunately but thank you very much indeed for taking the time to present to us this morning thank you um there isn 't time for questions I 'm sorry great thank you so now moving on to

    "text": "and let 's move on to the item at hand we have some staff recommendations and do we have any the option one okay doesn 't seconder second attempt okay any questions we have stashed at the table Andrea I 'm my understood I 've got three questions one of them risk process and the other two relate to new brighton issues that we just heard in the deputation in fact my understanding was that given the two options there was going to be some further advice on those options from staff once we had heard from the submitters and had a an opportunity to consider everything that we 'd read and heard so what was intended was that staff would make a recommendation either on one or two that we 're being exempt on that so you 've got the motion in front of you now and but for what I would agree with there wasn 't anything that I heard there that would say I did we need to change option one and that would recommended option one there so staff would have recommended option one regardless of and there 's been nothing nothing that specifically they were heard from the eight deputations would have changed any of those recommendations right thank you now two questions relating to new brighton and there may be questions that you can answer or they may be questions that need to be answered by and representatives of detail one of the issues raised in what we 've just heard was the the car parking issue in barrister on the Berenstain street lambda3 car parks course 6.13 in the report refers to the fact that DCL will engage with businesses and obviously he 's actively considering what the the right quantum and location of car parking in the New Brighton area looks like as part of its overall regeneration flannel redevelopment plan for New Brighton I 'm just keen to know and maybe to give a level of comfort to the submitter that that engagement would include the Union Street Health Center working income the backpack and the grace vineyard church as has been referred to in written and verbal submissions and I 'm guessing would incorporate other potentially affected businesses as well businesses that might be affected will have an opportunity on behalf of those businesses and obviously on behalf of their customers you would imagine as much as they would have an interest in their customers and been able to easily access their businesses and they will be well consulted with throughout any engagement process that DCL run yeah we 're having a wider car parking study undertaken at the moment we 've already had some preliminary discussion particularly worth dr. John cook at the Medical Center who has a particular interest in parking there is proposals for be referred straight for the road reconfiguration to add additional parking and they 're also yes so given the parking is on your radar that leads to another question presumably and I went through the report to have a look I don 't see anything good answers this question if I missed something I apologize presumably these three carp are given the underlying zoning of the land but they 're on what was always anticipated to be a temporary basis anyway yes that 's right thank you Phillip and thanks for your report retreat in New Brighton do we know what the current flooding risk is of the in terms of future development Beresford Street area yes that area is the lows of 19.3 meet cannibal ordinance datum hi tested out rock level district plane so he need development they would need to add respect things and my other Christian really is just in relation to the information that the submitters on pit from Peterborough village have just given us in terms of their discussions worth ECL and that they 've referred really to that permeability is eight they called it that the preferred height of development in the Peterborough area the three or four stories so it 's wonder if you would comment on what they submitted today please a number of groups you have a view on on what height should be there the large lead and directed by a financial feasibility study by the developer and that 's been works where the moment so should it only be financial should not even design also be taken to account Rob as I most certainly should be taken into account that this get a builder to build so out of urban design presume you to would include that concept of permeability yes in terms of the report in front of you today counselors you really have got I supposed to options on those matters one as it was written it is assuming that all those matters I left to the regulatory process the resource consent process to resolve but you do have the option because you are the landowner now that you may choose to look at a some controls in your response that addresses those so you have got those those options and can certainly consider that a different approach thanks Bruce Vicki and just to you Bruce and turns out there and this is the first time we 've had any public input on the use of the Peterborough and and I thought the the presentation from David and I was fantastic in terms of opening up that land creating a space but they were talking about a permitted height of three to four a desirable height opened that up of about three to four stories can you tell me did leave it to the resource consumers and people what would be allowed and next place yep what I might do is call on Sean Ward to one of our urban planners to come in I 'm threat much more detailed than I am yeah permitted height on it so I 've been a zone which is essentially mixed uses seventeen meters so who that fall in was probable that poor little yes and beyond any visuals could seem to go higher right so it would be reasonable given that that 's the permitted height for us to limit it to that sort of height I 'm sorry could you ask me so the permitted height in the in the plane it 's about four levels which is what they were seeking okay this ring and permeability and the feel of it as it 's a mixed juice mixed use science so and they 're anticipate a wide range of different activity types okay great and the other question in terms of us transferring this for the purposes of having it developed is through a mechanism if it wasn 't transfer it back yeah so those those mechanisms can be developed and put into some Purchase Agreements we need to say and draw your attention that that would impact on details ability to go to the market with those it may act as a deterrent for potential purchasers it may have impacts on their lending as well but certainly the mechanism the possibility of using that mechanism does does exist sure so can I just be clear our rationale for transferring this ever Council to DC l is so that we get positive social environmental and community outcome rather than DC l has positive financial outcomes I believe that the reasons that counsel and fit out DC l and to achieve those that quadruple bottom line use and it is in the statement of intent we just approved yesterday you know the questions yeah I 'm thinks it isn 't to understand a little bit more about the next step of the process if the land is transferred and just picking up on the concerns that Vicky 's raised around how we get good urban design so you 've said I think some of us will be quite concerned with we 've had experience of that I mean east gate is a really good example where you know it 's very hard to the community outcomes to actually over way or come up with a higher waiting then economic arguments developers football and so we often see quite you know um not as as good result with the land that we own as a city obviously we 've got a unique situation where we can get that higher level of of urban design so if the chanter is approved today and I just want to do the technical area each of each of them so Peter Burke order what 's the next step in terms of signing off on that what 's going to go there and what the opportunity for us as elected members pertaining to have any other say on that so subjective there being no additional changes or you don 't change the recommendation as the recommendation has written I the next step would be to undertake a preliminary site investigation or Beresford Street or all three we would anticipate that for two of the three sites that would then allow us to formulate a recommendations executive to establish a price and that person would be negotiated and a salmon purchase agreement put in place would be a bit more difficult with the Norden Street site we fully anticipate I 've cleaned up a couple of deposits and been peripherally involved in another couple that will take a little longer knowing Depot sites so those would be the key things but I suppose the cracks already equation is the second part in terms of the decision before you we have I suppose made the recommendation on the basis that we understand that council has set up DCL to undertake these activities on its behalf and at arm 's length and do have the option as hitting cancel our order before putting some further controls on that through changes to the recommendation that is your right and your responsibility if you believe that that 's needed but if we work while considering that that goes against their objective of really trying to set up DCL to run this the council will need to consider in its deliberations today so what I 'm trying to like if you take Peterborough for example my understanding is that a development agreement is going to be prepared and come back to Council for sign off if you approve this today it wouldn 't come back to Council for sign-off right which is different than what 's in the statement of intent yeah I 'm not sure if your sentence very well thanks years planning betting capital the stated intent appears next financial year is not specific so which one are we working on what one is approved at the moment the other ones not yet approved I mean it 's kind of irrelevant whether it 's in the snow I mean the current statement of intent and the proposed one that hasn 't been signed off it it 's almost irrelevant in terms of the question which are marking which is is the development agreement going to come back to us with Council sign up before it 's signed and is that the opportunity that we get to deal with the concerns in terms of things like height and amenity its danger of getting into back to debate territory what I suppose suggests a consideration or is changing that question do you want that to come back and then right it 's been changed no no it 's been changed in the new one for 2017-18 that there is no requirement for her to come back to us and so I just think it would be really good to get that clear about what was happening but it 's really it is coming back right and so is that the time we addressed the amenity concerns or do we put them in here is what I 'm trying to understand yeah okay this is new territory in the way we operate there and I call it a meeting or the light last year when we updated you know we 've already entered an agreement with approval of council with a preferred developer who 's expending significant money on developing plans that we have briefed you on today to go down a certain track and then fundamentally change both will be commercially challenging back when you showed us Rob cleanse that you had all sons of a draught that you had come up with so would you say that we are incredibly dissimilar to what the gentleman just showed us before yes three dissimilar I recall they hit some laneway type things and yeah they have no my daughter 's proposed it 's another concept yeah yep okay thanks today points give another report it talks about an increase to rates of 0.18 but then in the resolution is a talk about a phase it 's going to be a low impact on race could just confirm that edge is correct and there will be no certainty so the ruling in the resolution refers to council giving guidance to officers that if that 's what you want to achieve then we need to find a way of dealing with their open act 100.1 8% increase and so we 're trying to get the principles and you get your guidance up front and then once we understand that then work out and negotiate how we can achieve that so that impact will be for don 't want the 0.18 they have to look at cutting other things and the current budget the examiner suggestions in the report on how we can do that it 's whether we 're constantly looking for savings it 's whether some of those savings they used and it 's a pushes more pressure on us so remember jointly with UCL to look at how we can reduce the impacts there are a number of different options what we are asking for and seeking your guidance what do you want to achieve and then we 'll go on and achieve it so once you resolve that that 's we have to do straighten devote to as the proposal originally went out come to the council not busier so the protocol doesn 't say that it does indicate that there is a rights impact but certainly the easiest way of achieving no impact on rights is for the rental to stay with Council and not going to DCF the rent stayed with the council on that Milton Street decide in the point one eight percent doesn 't happen so that 's financing costs as well which is point zero four percent they don 't hear that because of surrounding between the point one five and point zero okay any other questions okay so I have a motion I have to remember the first is that so that we are totally clear that 's the rent on the Milton Street Depot remain with the council and [Music] the impact otherwise as I understand it because this is not budgeted into the annual plan would be rates rise of not five point five but of five point six five yes and which has not been consulted on and I 'm not going to take it back anywhere near about five point five so what is the actual amendment that you 're living that the rent on the Milton Street Depot site remain with the campus for the I think it 's two years that it nurturing for the duration or nineteen we okay I have some other ones that they would like to see the burn doesn 't affect any capital transfer just to fix the operational rent on the site which is the notice of the other one or do you want them after we 've dealt with this on so this I just get a new one risk and I also signal that and I also have a an amendment around the Milton Street site was a seminar discussed with staff I 'd like to go to please when going after that Peter very fun if I may through the chair just drew attention counsel about the rent covers the revenue but there are some costs as well we pay rates on that site insurance on that site as written I 'm interpreting that that those would go to DC l and the revenue stay through so maybe it would be useful to talk about the net rental rather than just rentals so that we can address that just aware there than two point three to see CL proposes that this income remains with the capital was that rather neat Wintel yes the net rent okay why are you not just proposing to not transfer what their land I think if you want to move it by whether anyone but we proposal the rental attend to the council winter this is a changed proposal yes and this directly impacts on everybody 's rate and with you I 've been divided perhaps counsel about if you were happy to use revenue rather than rent that 's strictly more accurate tozi fine this is putting comments on this land I mean that well Foreman I 'm reading from two point three on page 207 CCL proposes that this income remains of the people see it 's dreams we need to come you know I read correctly the one entry in the Bering Strait ha ha cheers so 50,000 second week of music other little calculator than a government agency they wrote an exception we are using maletto paired up with a plan design [Music] kinetically clean as it could be with you know what I mean take a five-minute break we 'll come back right when everyone 's recommend Andy and you let 's check over the legal covenant affect the and prepare my case very specifically in just identify the chemical balance what 's also interesting what you well okay we 're we 'll highlight the one I like I think everyone we everyone put their remember them we 'll take them one by one so one of that I haven 't got your they 're calling reading them out as you go through because the hardest thing and just to clarify given that there are matters in these amendments that we hadn 't previously considered can we put any question on the amendments as we go through each one so you 'll put them so we 'll deal with each one individually questions and then we 'll go through that process with each lost amendment moved by Mike is that the net revenue on the Milton Street site remain would council the duration of the lease do we have a seconder for that so get there okay you 've already seconded the same way okay fantastic right any questions on that Andrea does this amendment not just confirm what 's already in the report in section 2.3 it referring current rental income and in resolution point one age which we can 't do anything that impacts on right so the two leaving even a as a people further the main color report and you 'll be able point in transition they 're different the position that was put to council the first report said since then that easier that come back to council advise and advise that they require that three books to Poland and two thousand cloth of on land like life is talked about those development talks and what we can actively that only there in Berlin at a latitude addresses directly to the question and what was is in the original recommendation is just about doing the principal 's offices and in the offices of work to achieve those principles it wasn 't intended there that it means specifically although there 's one solution and if this amendment carries today if this is passed then obviously there 's no effect on rates through this transaction if this amendment is not carried today what 's the impact on rates in next year 's annual plan and if you give us the guidance that you don 't want any impact we will need to find a way of making sure be possible we need to look at savings and we need to be looking at working with DCL to achieve this in different ways but it 's a challenge that we would be prepared to accept so when you say look at savings you mean look at savings in other project to provide Headroom for this yes of course across but admire and put potentially across the whole of the corporate services here so as the general manager and myself have looked at they are there some options that we can find there so we would essentially cut something else or savings will cost savings and because we 're constantly looking for those okay a question for Rob if I can if this passes this afternoon and noting that Bruce is indicated you 'll probably make some comments on this anyway what would be the impact on the project and what other sources of funds would DCL look to to to cover any gaps that is left for you yeah thank you for that question and so this is going to make about the capitalization of the Urban Development Authority and equally around the regeneration without city the the impact to us to hold the wound load the lane that we would ultimately own if you were to pass it as is we need to ensure we can cover costs for rates for insurance security management and master planning of the site to take to market so although there may be an impact as discussed around rates for the next financial year the longer-term position could be a positive while if there is an upturn on the development so potentially we 're looking at and you start looking at net costs we 're talking about a fairly small amount only the greatest scheme of of the entirety of the annual playing over the long term but there are other options and the other options to DCL are borrowing so that 's about the line of credit paper through the holding company and but that relies on us having tradable security so there are implications around the amount of land its valuation what encumbrances that may or may not have so you know that there are restrictions that our board through line of bowling but again ultimately we are owned by you so we would be borrowing money to fund development or we will simply ended up in a situation where we won 't be able to afford to progress the development to take to market okay two questions when it talks of the duration of the lease am I correct in thinking that the rental period effectively a periodic so city could leave literally next month in have I read that the intention doesn 't mean that final easily renders being TL a property manager with European Commission so the ends of the first is yes Arizona senator currently a month-to-month place however the I think the the broad intend the grid intent is that we put in place arrangements that allow city here to stay there on the site until at least 2019 and it 's just an aside perhaps useful for the proposed amendment to detail the city Kia lease just for the sake of complete accuracy in the second statement I think that 's correct you know are you happy with that microfiber pretty careless Julie I okay it will mean the council today we approve a minimum one based on your the option one recommendation each paragraph this is part of the ages of paragraph or this additional if we approve this one then also we adopt the option one this presumption whether the ways will be the addition of reduction oh just you know up to the five point of high percentage compliant with annual pay is my question so if this amendment is approved it effectively replaces I to nature remove H from it and again if this is approved there 's no impact on the right it stays that way the amount that councils going to decide on the the annual plan so there 'll be no impact on right so if you approve amendment one we are not a fool I use fear committee or semi we approve option one if it was earlier insure a PCA to the lease is not over the 5.05 yeah so it 's effectively a few options mimic one is lost and H stays in price it puts the challenge and responsibility banking offices to make without an impact on rights okay thanks deal what how long 's we ring on Peterborough Street for that 's not what we talk about the rate that comes from 3m and the existing building there and how long has it secured well mr. slash the rental in the attention thing and attachments with so term so this information is in the Tetra a and to the report so the ground floor for three M years for at least to commence from the first of February 2017 but one year within six months termination clause and a my rather than that 's giving me something else into you actually one thousand and we 'll let have any impact on right so that 's been incorporated into the figure to come up with the point one five percent that one 's almost cost neutral in terms of cost and even yet it 's pretty simple in the cost of their on them what does it cost associated with it and don 't have those I think you know it was a figure of about 65,000 this is a seventy five thousand other questions okay Yannick I mean that in terms of the Milton Street site and the duration of the lease right you know currently we 're looking at how we can make City care perform better that 's what we said publicly so I 'm just trying to understand whether or not why we would whether we have anything related to the lease around that given that we haven 't had that information back yet and until we get information back how do we know what we want to do in terms of those leases liaised with that particular come to me and they I came to to move off the site that we haven 't_''_3583.93 as a council we haven 't we haven 't been briefed we don 't know what you know we 're obviously waiting for that work to conclude the only that 's not relevant to the question which is simply whether the revenue stays with council or not know what I was services for the duration of the city Kelly 's so in terms of the timing of the lease I just trying to understand whatever they can move whenever they want on a periodic least okay okay any more questions right we have the amendment and I 'll put that amendment all in favor say I don 't know what the right it 's just for the amendment okay this is on the revenue I think it 's important and I don 't like the idea of giving staff the direction to go away and the budget having spent the last few months going through knowing everything that we need I think it 's important that we know what we 're doing and what we 're not doing we 've put a cap on rates of 5.5% I don 't want to go above that cap we 've gone out to the public on that basis this puts rates at five point six five or a change and something else that we 've advertised as a level of service we haven 't consulted the public on this possibility at all because the attachment that went out the proposal that went out rent was coming to us so we paid ECL three million a year a range of other things we 're now looking at the transfer of about seventeen million dollars worth of land which catalyzes the balance sheet and a line of credit through cchr I think this operational income which was a way to propose to stay with the council could and should say with accountant okay can I just make one coin yeah I mean I I agree with that the amendment you know if you think about it we spent hours and hours and hours just discussing spending 500,000 with our community boards across the city on community projects this was more than that and we 've had you know very little conversation about what misses are and what and what the consequence is so you know I think we should support this amendment and I do think you know that we 've heard that there 's other ways in which that this funding could be realized by GCL so yeah I 'm very supportive I also think that you know the duration of the city key release is an issue but I appreciate you said it you don 't just think in terms of working out the future of what 's happening then it is actually relevant and until we do that we shouldn 't be giving away the rental Andrew thank you yeah I do agree with this amendment I am I 'm concerned that H would see as essentially subsidizing this loss of income by taking from a different project maybe the timings unfortunate given that the level of rates rise that we 're going to be deciding on in a couple of weeks is top of the mind but yeah we 've heard that there are other ways that this project can be made to work without the rental income and I think that 's the the way that it needs to go so yeah did this amendment I will be supporting on the basis that the effect on rate particularly at this time is something that we wouldn 't want to sing so Jamie yeah okay that 's pretty quick then I 'm committed to the five point five percent rates as well I think that 's very important but this isn 't even make-or-break it I think what what is also paramount is that DCL are able to do what they 've set them up to do and I think this is all part of a bigger picture about EPS undermining whether or not in my view in other people may not share this view but whether or not we back them and I do and I don 't want to continually we put up hurdles for them and I actually think there 's no guarantees around the site anyway we 've heard that it 's on a periodic rental so they could quite literally up and go that Heenan 's with an within the next month literally and finally to that DCL is much more in my view than a property manager and at least property managers get paid so having having them as a charitable property manager for 0% Commission I just think it 's an onsen so I won 't support us and I 'm committed to 5.5 percent right Thank You Siri because I suppose one main reasons I asked us part you know if we are not that Madison together with this year to issue this one the property to keep the staff the more kind of ratio I think about we keep this one a risk an Easter stop you know the pressure to have a discussion with that this year try to issue these rates not increase in over a five point five percentage e so this main reason I suppose everyone okay I will put motion all in favor say aye aye again now that 's carried your lives to be recorded put your hands up we have Aaron Dion Jamie and and David thank you so everyone else gets life and even that 's what okay so we have the next amendment moved by Vicki that the council in regard to the Peterborough Street site in order to achieve positive social community environmental share Lane becomes is clear in its transfer that the development agreements stipulate that the height of the buildings not exceed what is permitted in the district plan for the site that the development provide high amenity value good scale and permeability do I have a seconder for that seconded calling no anybody else okay well I don 't have a seconder so Hampton could I just let you know what you 've just allowed no no no no hold on you can 't no website so I 'm then correct here [Music] platon yes I need a second a second doesn 't group so I 'm having a second go yeah move moved an amendment you can 't take me well is that a lot yeah okay so I 'll select the second er I 'll move on to the next amendment town okay is hooking it up yeah we 'll come we 'll come back to it they 'll move on to the next amendment okay this is new by Phil request development Christchurch limited working with counts and staff and other relevant stakeholders to consider including social housing sites on barnard Avenue and the relocation of the part from Milton Street which is the small park at the corner of Milton and Johnson streets not Sydenham Park in the design of the future housing development on the Milton Street property with the aim of improving social how the outcomes the neighborhood and wider community noting that should they be benefits than the decision on whether or not the social housing sites and parks should be included will be able to serve back to Council to make the amendment has been seconded by and I just spread it up okay has been seconded by it so any questions another question Robert how to speak to it really my question so the questions look just to put this in context and I 'm hoping that earlier amendment actually can be worked the one that vicki has moved it 's taking that right so look and I will speak to I 'm sure that sudden them actually is it 's really got great potential to benefit from from the DCL development there 's no question are there and just how we do it in this so that we have a different parts joined up so just to the south of the light the mill story of the line on the met you 've got band is in the wrong vanity of some of the oldest housing social housing inner city and it development will include it alongside the other development it doesn 't mean that an they would they would say separate sites but it seems to me this great potentially in terms of economies of scale and how in fact developments are done that we can decide alongside hopefully affordable housing but we also really develop a social housing in that area and and I think it 's in a report that in fact there 's there 's a great thing being in a part is that the various sports clubs are used they also want to see the whole development really they want the area looking nice and it 's a great opportunity to actually have an inclusive really energized community so that 's why I drew this Thank You Phil imagine ya given the work that DCL are proposing in this area and given that there is a benefit for greater at least social outcomes and possibly other outcomes from the potential inclusion of these additional areas it seems crazy that we wouldn 't include at least consideration of that which is exactly what this this amendment is proposing it I 'm in favor okay Tim thank you a lot of mentioned that before I mean pseudonyms been kind of treated quite hard and a lot of ways if you look at the brown street development among who have put social housing on a four-lane highway we did here at the close a local school which is very important to and clearly strong and community well the government did and but we now have a chance to put some really good value into this community to have a connection to Sydenham park which we are doing at the moment but be thinking on I know some presenters before mentioned unchristian the value of affordable homes but I think if you get a combination of what details proposing or looking at here with regards to social housing affordable housing and more upmarket housing that 's absolutely fantastic in their cross-section and such a valuable site and what makes it valuable is that connection to Sydenham Park I can 't see how anyone could kind of question there at all to have young families and affordable housing social housing connected to outstanding I hope you 'll support us thinking okay I think so whilst I support this admirable notion we are here today to consider proposed property transfers and the the capitalized effectively the capitalization of DCL we seem to be digressing into management issues micro and there seems to be a continual attempt to try and micromanage everything that DCL does we 're here to do dual what property transfers and whilst this is great that can be brought to DC ELLs attention but I don 't really see it as absolutely necessary to be tagged on to a motion where we are considering property transfers to capitalize DC l we 're getting into detail with will micromanaging the idea roughly is great but I don 't think it 's part of the bigger scheme of what we 're trying to achieve today I think we 're just going off on horrible tangents all the time this Kalama lot approved the capitalisation property trances let DC l get on with what what we 've agreed to set them up to do we seem to be wanting to hang on to do Thank You anyone else okay well I 'll put that motion all in favor say aye well I should because look honestly we 're just considering this or asking them to come over and it is it isn 't nuts-and-bolts there 's a how strategic and policy area here that 's away isn 't well they just want the most in all in favor say aye aye against that 's carried thank you right so should we go back to the number two Thor what 's the story in on that and that okay so somebody 's going to do it okay right so we do have a seconder councillor kata any questions on this Andrew um from a legal viewpoint can we do this in Ghana help how we dealt with it with her ref dealt with it at the beginning I understood he he just moved on without saying that the amendment had lips lips no I 'm not meaning from a they 're not I don 't leave from a council procedural viewpoint can we deal with that I mean from a legal property transaction legality absolutely the council has the right there are two aspects to this the council a landowner and the councillors regulator both King both both are separate and independent processes of each other the councillors Manor now has a contract or inability to require the purchaser contractually to agree to whatever so this is perfectly acceptable of course the the the purchaser water or the landowner would also need to comply with the city plan requirements so there 's no legal impediment to this I must say the only way we could deliver this though is by registering an encumbrance against the title to the property and I suspect that it would be appropriate if you asked ECL whether that would impact on their proposals and plans for the property so that was a perfect leading to my next question yeah even that we now know who this would require an encumbrance on the land what would the likely effect be on the developer and does it in fact risk the whole project if we would have placed this encumbrance on the land by way of passing this resolution this afternoon question is a planning question around what the lighting notification requirements would be in a resource consenting environment when a consent needed to be applied for to go to above the district plan height limit so the first question I 'm getting for Rob is what the effect on the developer the developments would be and whether this actually constitutes a risk to the whole concept it absolutely would consist a risk to the project within to the good-faith memorandum of understanding with the developer after a public process that was gone through their planning you 're aware of and has been dealt with and piak sessions so this was most definitely a risk to the project and and I suspect the the current arrangement would would fall through as a result and then there would be issues what 's the market to go and forward a suspect so just to clarify people voting in favor of this amendment this afternoon need to be aware that that may mean the whole Peterborough quarter development may not proceed as planned absolutely and without the private developers for a good-faith agreement who around DC eligibility or councils ability to deal in good faith with other developers moving forward correct and I also think it would be at odds to the work we 've been doing in this really strategy to improve confidence in the city that quite each to the city that people wish to do business and thank you and then just the planning question I can so your question was about notification and what a while the outcome might be yeah if the if the proposal were to go higher than the height limit allowed by the district plan is what the likely notification status of any resource consent application would be I mean there may be different levels of reach of those plan requirements that would lead to different outcomes there and maybe if you could comment on that well yep sure the first one is if it were only height there was a breach of the plan standards within an application for that couldn 't be notified except possibly under special circumstances so their height is a reach of height is a restricted discretionary activity in that zone or public no and miss miss the decision were made into a special circumstances requiring this notification Jamie then was a good segue from Andrews first with jamia going back to the fundamental basics of this if this were to pass this amendment would we be market ibly eroding the tangible value of the sign the moment this resolution was passed yes there 'll be pretty smart minae Mike I just want to check from I get to Andrews where Andrew is going right it 's very start which this amendment the fact that we fail to get a second to write the very start will it actually stand up if we do pass this now because I think I did I just want to make sure before we put this well we didn 't actually give a thing to write the very start we just want to make sure that if we do put this through that it will stand up yeah you finished the height restriction can I just be very clear so beyond four storeys if somebody wants to go up to 1812 the fact that it be notified yes so maybe other provisions to get breached I open the dustbin increase in height the local neighborhood associations all of them no person who was concerned about the shading of the Town Hall nobody could have an input unless we actually provide for some means of limiting the height at this stage you yeah we couldn 't lose no limited notification which means individual parties and no public notification of that high bridge but that 's there any site under the city plan rules sorry about that would apply to any site not any site in their zone yes yeah okay and does it have to go through the urban design panel doesn 't have to that we would certainly you know we 've seen the advise and it has been and we 'll go again any proposal we 've a site of that scale would be advising to take it to its panel yes right sorry I might have demoted but didn 't hear the answer to I wish mmm was going to answer that question we would treat this as a full shadowed amendment and is put now and passes does that mean stay on that title even if this current development doesn 't go through or does that only apply to these developers most would stay on the building and apply until the council removed it okay so any other developer coming in and do we know then how much that changes the potential value of the land by I don 't know if we can use numbers but we can use percentages yeah yeah no we can 't provide that advice on what dollars or percentage on that so we don 't know any encumbrance we have an impact young in my understanding from the submission that we heard on this is that this information around the scale the height was provided to PCL and June last year is that correct it was a meeting around the community outcome and I was just trying to understand the table but just to clarify the discussion because I heard that element at a live stream I was somewhat surprised to hear that I 'd invited the group to actually make a submission on what the called with the Peterborough village through the Lucas who say all your information is interested parties we have a preferred purchaser of the site and that the process will go through looks like this we did say we 're interested in your views I was in subsequently called to a meeting where David 's plan was presented and well it has some merits it was was never requested right I 'm just trying to understand in terms of the stuff that we 've seen today that was that was presented into the process and how has that been incorporated has it been as any of it been incorporated into what works being done or is it just the kind of first David in the team presented live use in some cases elements that had already been thought of ie relationship to the Town Hall permeability through the block Rory considered but at no stage did we ask them to design the site and in any case the issue there I would suggest respectfully is that whoever 's going to pay for it will actually have the greatest say in development to the city or not okay Glenn and then Jim Bob sorry can I just and given that the development agreement for the pier recorder is coming to Council for approval are we able to make changes when it 's presented to us given that that 's a democratic process we have in place so I 'm not a closer to this as others but I would believe that if it coming to Council for approval you 're going to have that ability to make comment on it and make changes to it the process after that on how it goes back to DCL etc I 'm not okay with looking across the room at those it might be closer but yeah I need to say that I 'm notice I 'm sorry and I understand whether it would be more appropriate like the concerns around height if we adjust those through the development agreement that 's it going to come to us or through the resolute the amendments that have been put today yeah so if you wish to address address that matter because the first question is do which one 's the best I can 't advise you that it really comes down to a matter of we feel most comfortable that you have the most control over both of them are effectively Council is and landowner in this case and as the ultimate owner rbcl and the second case using its ability to control that that process you 've got this one before you probably wish to release consider it once before you in regards to turn tearing the land now for the Peter record oh why why do we need to transfer it now ahead of the development agreement why wouldn 't we wait until the development agreement is agreed before we transfer it so the essential question that the series of reports that we 've done to you it 's been about it 's been about capitalizing DCL by a way of a transfer of land so the timing is to follow the consideration of GCL anthology that council has done and also the various reports on how to get that this capitalization set up of council so it 's in those terms you can leaves uncertainty and that uncertainty may affect some of the projects that DCL are delivering particularly around the DP New Brighton area so council needs to balance up we 're making a decision now and providing some certainty or delaying a decision and leaving uncertainty which you prefer in that circumstance Caitlin I think you just curious over what the moment is telling and so the height limits and stories are separate and the CBD if you get any information on that Stevenson C so with others how I have people prepared to go or the reality of for successful development for the private security in this the money into a trust they look at a couple of things ones they look at the financial feasibility of the project and that is ultimately determined by the demand I can they actually fill the project so the claim you 're not going to build something that they can 't Tina or will sell that said the cost of the land is a significant important to the cost of development and you 've got to actually have sufficient create a nice boy typically in a hotel for example most hotels new build hotels won 't work if the height of what we 've talked about here 70 meters so it really depends on the financial feasibility with you audio in the land what the input price was for the land so if you already owned it and the cost of acquisition of what feasibility might work but ultimately this is a this is an issue of a couple of things it 's an issue of confidence it 's an issue of the ability to make the financial feasibility work and the but if I can just use hotel as an example I can give you a list of proposed hotels being built in the city I can show they 're only two at the moment that are being constructed so there 's a difference between intent and delivery because the particular made mention earlier if we hope for this amendment to is high risk for the future that the environment and also is still possible in order for the future to Burma well give to the urban design panel for review those to handle of repair while the open design pain aware consider so for you mister you can design hell only provides advice it 's an advisory and body and it provides advice to their consent process in the final decision would either be made by the cleaner or a commissioner and probably in this case of Commissioner so it 's only advice into the process yeah and just about where that is a principle I just mean she leads us to principle the urban design thing aware consider having an open wheel except we never preach me to the panel yep you 're welcome Peter they would concern you okay thank you until my questions to to mr. Clark about the the conversations going about height and I just want to know quite clearly what the bulletins are going up high means to the actual ground level and what that will give through the communities around that area and also during the Town Hall I mean if we if we consider the district play and as of right parameters which we 've discussed we 've discussed the height parameter what district play and the ends of light so not that makes them as a right height limit at 17 meters the years of right site coverage is a hundred percent so if you actually applied there you would have a site where there was no permeabilities for the block and you would have had on the street you 'd have to size the trade-off I guess in terms of the height is to say the ground for either you give up by not covering the whole site and you take with height you put you create laneways courtyards etc in the development which give public immunity but also the ability through the block one of their challenges and their blocks and one of adopted a laneway strategy in other parts of the city is that standard block size and question as 200 meters long and your tentative going through it was to walk all the way around it which means that but the lines that you would actually transmit people through corridors that they would normally walk through they just wanted so ground ground more ground floor activation because if so public immunity creon deactivation just very quickly so under the current what you guys are proposing that is what sorry that is what you 're proposing for the site preferred purchaser whose initial designs which have counselors have seen in which they have been designed and I 've seen on their colleagues and the in the Council of scene proposes that in rough water about 50 to 55 percent site coverage instead of a hundred percent very quick Christian to Bruce it in the sheer an idea the feedback from Christchurch residents was loud and clear that they wanted a low-rise city what level would you put there is not really an appropriate question its council and your role as the representatives that would sit those those things no there was no indication of the number of storeys and the sheen I didn 't plan that we 've developed sorry me Phil so basically just clarifies riah previous question I think before in the answer to a question you see that the options for us that we wanted to achieve clarity around the permeability part in limited height was development agreement to counsel so if I got you right being I 'm this wondering could I understand there is also an amendment that yani is proposed on development agreements coming here and I just would like us to give a slight bit is the is the other way of achieving this before we actually vote on this riff do you like I 'd like the yamen the the amendment that I 'm counselor you 're handsome has put forward it is a secret on now so everyone 's pretty much focus on any other so just then I know it was a gem of a question that German of the questioning so with the process here if you do it today you end up with an encumbrance on the title which affects the value if you go through seeking the approval from the development plan when they 're brought back you don 't have that encumbrance at this stage and so therefore it doesn 't affect the value at this stage but there is still that possibility that you may choose to decide once you saw the development plan their limp it but we can 't prejudge what you might say once you get those development plans in the later stage speaking and Andrew I 'm assuming the plenty questions and we 're going to today are we finished questions okay debate okay I understand the concerns around height shade shadow sunlight and walk probably appointed time to be having this debate as we come into the six darkest weeks of the winter however this isn 't the opportunity to relitigate the RMA and it isn 't the opportunity to relitigate our district plan this isn 't the opportunity of which the planning legislation and requirements were actually different than what they are but this is our opportunity and I think particularly on this amendment this is our opportunity to show support to DCL and to show confidence in them and in what they 've been set up to do there 's nothing different about this land than any other land in the same zone and there 's nothing different about this developer than any other developer that would be developing this site or any of the neighboring sites and what those planning regulations would allow and what developer click don 't however there 's a big difference between this development proposal the amount of work has been done the public realm outcomes site coverage public amenity and it 's a site that we 've heard that would allow for a hundred percent site coverage here we 've got permeability we 've got public realm that isn 't guaranteed by any other development or any other developer on this site that might be proposed and that 's not to mention economic outcomes the relationship with the Town Hall confidence in DCL confidence in council its decision-makers I believe that surpassed this today would totally erode that confidence not only in relation to this development but so other potential dealings that third parties might have with DCL or with council it would see this development dead in the water I think there 's a chance that this could actually see DCL dead in the water for all today so we need to show confidence in the proposal we need to show confidence in DCL I 'm not willing to squander the reputation and all of the positive development outcomes over something that 's essentially a planning matter over which we have no influence on any other piece of land why we would want to encumber our own land to make it a less favourable development proposition than any other neighboring land and at the same time as we 've heard kill a perfectly good development opportunity with good public outcomes in a key strategic central city location is totally beyond me and I definitely won 't be supporting them I 'd like to completely endorse everything that Andrew just seed somewhere I 've read I 'm not sure whose it is but it sees them one thing making it hippin with antiquity and patient and then was it 's what this is about we are one team we you know I just feel a bit sick actually it we 're putting these poor by through again we have given them permission to do this work and we have to communicate cooperatives and them and I don 't believe that this is fear what there it shows integrity so I am think it 's fantastic for the city and I think it 's very fortunate to have them and I would like to support them in any way I can thank you that 's refreshing to hear and Vicki I appreciate that this won 't go through but let me tell you what the difference in this chunk of lenders across from any other chunk of land set is in the city we own the flames the public of Christchurch owned this land for us to say we don 't care whether there is 18 through 12 story 14 story building on this land is completely wrong and that 's effectively what we 're doing unless we create something in our transfer of land to DCL and that that we are saying you can go as high as you like you just heard from the Planning people that the height restriction of hidden stories for stories can be gone way beyond and there is no notification so nobody not there but clearly neighborhood association with icon not the Peterborough people not Maura known as the public of Christchurch will have a something and I don 't mind what it is in terms of limiting the height of this development at this stage what we want to achieve this has got nothing to do with who 's doing the development this has got to do with the transfer of public land and normally when we transfer public land we are very clear about the outcome that we want from it I don 't want and I 'm very clear that I don 't want a very high building right opposite the Town Hall that puts the Town Hall into shade and cold because that 's not the sort of city I want for the central city of Christchurch over the place that feels great for people to live in I really liked the development there concept plans that David Shepherd came up with I that sort of permeability the scale and the the four or five maybe six story buildings absolutely fine but what we are doing is giving carte blanche to go as high as you like and Steve just mentioned that the trade-off for the public space on the ground how high because we haven 't been told so I don 't like giving anybody cap launched with public land therefore I would like some encumbrance I appreciate this isn 't going to go through believe me there is no way that if we don 't put some encumbrance on this that we have any restriction whatsoever on the creation of a very high building directly opposite the living room of the Christ Church of Christ Church so I think we are silly not to pass this but if it 's the will of the council Soviet Jay look most of the support for DCL in not supporting the community has been seen the only things I 'll add to that is that well I just want to refute what Vicky said there about Simon 's attention sending a signal that we don 't care you know I beat up with that I think with that we have DCL our own Development Agency working hand in glove with a developer that 's going to be adding tremendous value to the development and regeneration fabric of the city speaks volumes that 's why we are doing this with them and if you didn 't know this anyway and I suspect you already did but if not it 's been confirmed by our own staff supporting this amendment Russ this positive development falling over on the hole at Russ DCL forming over on the hole and you certainly take millions of dollars away from from our own ratepayers because it arose the value of this so those are three very good reasons why I think you don 't support this amendment and just to reiterate that we do care that 's why DCL exists and why DCL is working so closely with this developer to create something that 's quite special for the city Thank You Jimmy I 'm not supported amendment as reason is based on spark in PCR is response oh these are criterion under the discipline under the I am a the urban design general they were considered is only part of them we have solar kind of comprehensive rejected at the teacher plane in the IMA so this easily we amended actually you know it 's a risk always we have because we have a kind of earthquake huge earthquake so give us opportunity but if we another grasp these opportunity this opportunity we become so we need to consider this one another one I go with the enter particular confidence in the trust we need because this suave shooter has a skills and the knowledge you know the hidden can continue with all kind of the situation but as a carbon so we give them proper direction regarding to the regulation regarding to activists but there the business not outer the business so the as on this kind of situation are difficult to support this amendment manages reappointed prices or point of order but I think that it 's good that DCL are here to answer the questions I think when we come to here 's a debate in Brookes particular voting that there should we expect from a table so to speak on this asking what happen and physical process thanks pointing that out Yanni I 'm thinking um it 's interesting I think to reflect on how he got to this point and there was the idea of a development agency being established and one of the key principles that we agreed to on the basis that we would establish it was transparency so that our community could actually understand what was going on and unfortunately we don 't have that but we had this discussion when we had this whole land strategy and these requests to go out for these sites and you 'll recall the debate some of us wanted the actual proposals to be part of that so that the community who were making submissions could see what was being proposed I think it 's incredibly difficult for a community to make submissions on something without actually knowing what the proposed outcome is and that at the heart of really what I think this amendment is trying to address is that this is the only time we 've heard from our community over what they want on that site and if we don 't agree to this amendment then how else do we ever do that as locally elected representatives we don 't get any other chance as I see it other that as part of the development agreement at the end what we do it now I think the issue of height does need to be considered based on the submissions we 've had you could ask how many changes have been made as a result of the submissions that we 've heard on these proposals almost none that I can see so it does seem to me that we do need to think better about how these processes can work so the community can be informed so we get transparency around what 's proposed and we can weigh out what the final outcome will be based on the merits of that for our cities so I think that you know that this and this amendment is good in terms of it responds to the community concerns I would much rather respond to those community concerns now and raise it rather than at the end when the development agreement comes back to Council because I think that would do even more damage if the proposal is for you know a 50-meter high-rise and and then we go off sorry no we it now based on the feedback that we 've had I can say as a council who 's represented that area and doesn 't anymore but did for a very long time that one of the major issues facing the inner city resident groups have been the height limit in the central city they have spent huge amounts of energy and resource going to the Environment Court over councils permissive planning in the past to protect height limits in the central city and the Environment Court actually found in their favor previously so I think height limits are a very important issue I 'd rather in good faith to the work that DCL are doing actually signal that now is part of an amendment rather than wait until the development agreement and that 's what I 'll be supporting it okay thank you I 'm one team with integrity we could face at Sutra on our hip total speak for DCL we 've got to move forward on this we 've seen the scoping pains we want to call them I think it began to allow true development we 've if we don 't we have it stick to the height level we give a four-story block no vision no passion no amenities has just the horrid so I think we 've got to give these guys a chance no question we 'd agree for them to go forward we just keep cutting them off at the pass that 's ridiculous we 're micromanaging why don 't we let them go for us so thank you Glen and Mike thank you I hope it 's not lost it on any of us what a district plan rules actually do commit and I 'm sure we 're all stated at some of the things we see in our neighborhoods and we showed around was also computerized and we say how to get better Beckett there actually it meets the rules and often they do we may not want them there I can think of a few things in my neighborhood talent is know they met the rules I can think of a situation where the local MP and I were called into moving houses into a subdivision was actually about a days that the notification rules are relaxed not by us by the government have been increasingly related over time there 's a lot that 's out of our control really is this a big deal it depends I respect cookie and yannis few others but I don 't think they 're fun to give the big picture we should get the whole thing going I support it Mike thank you I think of everything we 've discussed today and moved this would probably be the easiest decision to make and I will not be supporting it quite frankly I think this is crazy to do this and actually a four-story block would probably be the best outcome you could get I would say but nothing would happen there and it would just be an empty lot for a long long time we really need to make some development happen in Christchurch and this is a really good start using some of the land that we do do have so I will not be supporting this amendment okay I will put the motion all in favor say aye against oh okay bit quicker so Yanni Vicky and Phil and Pauline and the rest were against okay next a minute right do we have a mover for this one yeah my movement Venice to another amendment it was cool so I might become a mover in of invited Jimmy to become the second Oh buddy I don 't know whether he 's taken up the invitation yet cause the face on sparklin he feels hopeful well tempo you went you know I do this okay so Glen is moving this is anyone 's seconding it does anybody want to second the motion exactly yeah okay so you have to draw that no tag in it okay okay but I would say I mean it means the feedback is quite clear people want to talk about that okay amendment five moved by Yanni is there a seconder for that okay so there 's no seconder for that your honor you have to withdraw that from lack of a seconder but Adam can I just deal tomato still with this amendment is there a seconder for this amendment no so it 's left to to the second okay thank you right even though we 've done that are we now ready to go to the Denton we what 's up we 're in public session that was in px oh that 's a question of her not what we discuss just that I come through the church given that you 're proved in one then close high to the recommendation probably is no longer required okay okay are we ready that okay so we 're back to the original resolution which was moved by Dave seconded by Tim no more question we 're in debate and does anybody wish to debate this anyone got anything left to say can I make a point of order looked at and can I make a point of order please look I think if a meme that asks for explanation or clarification that he should be in here she should be entitled to do so so I 'm really questioning that counsel is here not be able to ask a question we 're in debate that 's okay even further than your piece because the tyranny Amendment right all right so it 's very sore tool is important so with that in mind because that question was asked I 'm also going to repeat my request for counsel swags to be able to ask this question please fine after it okay now I 'm just concerned about the rights for these properties so taken away rule of the income from DCL they 're going to be now paying and we 're transferring this land they 're going to be paying rights to us this so there 's an edit income but what about the other two pieces of land so I 'm just I just wanna know what they didn 't think that 's going to here for DTL and tourism yeah so we talked a bit about the Peter Burke order so and there is a minimal impact I think the the Nate was around five thousand dollars and appreciate members and there 's history it 's a very very minor amount so the current rate spot a kind of recorder that all the sides success looks like yep that 's why there was a small saving street business rate has a rate cost of eleven thousand that present we charge yourself throat we sell the property we get the right to question about this as you want aids to stay Bruce after the hearing that so mister should we keep H in there I think given the point another mistake so they just thought yeah taking for the night because there 's yeah so we still have to find a way okay right a healthy fresh equal to the data okay you may can you just put the if you scroll back up to the top it 's a possible to land parcels separate so let 's may wish to vote for some and not father 's I can 't_''_7068.51 defeat the object is effectively a lot of it copy the sound because in terms of the consultation okay here we 've consulted on the package yep so we 've consulted on the package so we 're going to put it all together resent my right to speak okay are you ready you 'd like to go first yummy yes Johnny okay well I mean a just to say that I would have supported various to the street but obviously I 've been advised that it 's a package so I 'll go through my reasons for not supporting the Peterborough one I think we 're getting the development agreement coming to Council anyway so I can 't see any sense in transferring the LED now until we get that development agreement and to me it doesn 't it doesn 't make sense to do it until we know what the outcome is and I 've made that point in the previous debate around the amendment the Milton Street one again we 're going through a process with City here at the moment and that 's all that 's concluded I just think it 's it 's short-sighted to be transferring that land when you think about it we 've actually lost a huge amount of public land close and close proximity to the Central City so depending on what we get to with our section 17a reviews and where we get to in terms of the future of how we do maintenance and how we it is premature to dispose of this land and transfer it across to DC l it may be in future when there is no need for it then that 's become a time to have that conversation but I also take on board the point that was made and and it 's a shame that the mayor 's not here because I 'd like to extort of paraphrase one of her quotes which I totally agree with and that is that the the greenest building is the building it 's still standing and what we heard from submitters to this process was that we 've got plenty of counsel when that 's sitting there empty vacant nothing happening on and that should be a focus rather than an existing site where we 've currently got activity so Brown Street but you know even think about the exemplars and and and what 's not happening with those and so I think let 's sort those those men lend out first before we embark on this new process for a piece of land that currently has a use and has so much of how we deliver services um so I won 't support that one it is a considerable piece of land and I think it is you know it is a major part of this packet on um in terms of number three I think it 's good that we 've heard that there 's an acknowledgement that there 's more work to be done with the community that was in terms of bearer for the street um so I mean obviously I 'm not supporting the whole thing but if it was when I would support it would have been that because I do think one of the things we asked ECL to do it was around that whole issue of New Brighton and that has something that come through their submissions to deal with the car parking but also see what those outcomes are and I guess in conclusion I 'd say that when we agreed to set up CCL that 's what we wanted we wanted some small projects to be done and then to see how they worked and to look at the learnings from that and we got into this big idea of doing big massive developments and in some ways I feel like let 's get those quick wins those early ideas adopted and done first before we get into the bigger more grand scheme of things it 's costing us a huge amount of money and time going through these processes unfortunately for me I I just don 't support this because we haven 't had their proposal the outcome as it 's being said that shows clearly what 's proposed on these sites we have a huge amount of uncertainty and for our community I think these are public assets public land until we get that certainty an outcome I don 't think we can have a fair honest transparent conversation with a candidate so I won 't be supporting it I will be supporting the the opportunity that we have presented to us today and I think we 've got to remember that this is just about the transfer of land to capitalize development Christchurch but it 's in their name development Christchurch and I think we 're at a point in and actually giving confidence to turn to the markets outside of musial outside of Christchurch and outside of musical and potentially to say hey look we 're ready to go we 're ready to rock and roll we 've done a bit of rock and rolling but we 're actually about now you know sitting down and actually getting on with this rebuild it 's a bit of a shame that we didn 't in my opinion our debate and talk about the city of opportunity realizing our potential the Christchurch you can put development strategy to that because that actually sums up perfectly what we 're doing and that documents is we need to show leadership in our economy to move our city forward and we want to be a diverse economy that actually provides opportunities for everybody we 'll be looking at these opportunities and one of the key elements of that strategy is a city that takes risk we can 't sit here and not take risk and actually expect the city to recover so I think we need to take risk calculated risk but actually we and give them a trust so that they can get on and do the job otherwise we 're just going to sit there and have empty carpark what 's that look like ugly things for the rest of our sort of recovery and that 's not going to stimulate the mental health of our city the growth about some of the jobs that we want and facilitate the extra seemingly 2,000 jobs that were that have been what I 'm looking for that of being identified that will come into our local economy in 15 years time so this is the future proof in our city and this is why it 's important it 's about thinking bigger picture and this is the first leap of actually giving on that DNA yep council vision is for Christ you to the city of opportunity open to new ideas new people in new ways of doing things a city where anything is possible so we want a prosperous economy we want a livable city and we want strong communities and I think that DCO is leading the way with this Thank You the number of issues that have been raised of lastly been debated as we have gone through the amendments and I appreciate it 's been a long and at times talk to us debate but I think it 's been worthwhile there are aspects of this conversation I think that have needed to be had for some time quite possibly not least at the time that DCL was established quite possibly at times when we 've had discussions around various statements of intent that have been approved and noting that we 've got a statement of intent which is currently in process and the development agreement matter is one that quite possibly can land in that statement of intent conversation but the the Peterborough quarter was with certainly an interesting debate around the the planning restrictions and planning abilities and so on but that some of that can land I think in the SOI approval process around the the approvals and so on in New Brighton and we 've got the opportunity for a joined up development we 've got a recovery opportunity regeneration opportunity the council we 're considering process and we 've also had significant discussion about needing a joined up process that allows for development of the New Brighton core at the same time as we look at investment into the hot saltwater pools and so on so the transfer that we 've considered this afternoon that we consider in this afternoon allows for the sort of interventions that need to happen to make a New Brighton work a number of studies have been done on New Brighton we 've heard from submitters this afternoon that what we need is more people living there we need more people that live there using local businesses been able to use local businesses concerns have been raised around parking I 've got every confidence that the parking issue will be dealt with by way of the other work that DCL is doing and by robust community engagement I 've got every confidence that DCL will do that and the the Mill Street Depot the Milton Street site where City Care operate from is actually a matter for City care and we 've heard their response to this particular issue there look at a comprehensive development that 's got the ability to regenerate and revitalize that whole area quite possibly and we 'll have achieved that by way of the or we may possibly achieve that by way of the amendment that was passed this afternoon looking beyond the confines of this particular proposal and this particular site to take in other opportunities for good social outcomes as well so it 's been a good and I think it 's great that people have had the opportunity to put out exactly what their concerns might be with these various projects with the land transfer with details way of working in fact at times but I 'd like to think the decision we 're about to make now is one that shows our confidence in DCL ones that one that shows our confidence in the way that DCL have been set up and the work that they 're doing and as I 've been said earlier in debate or maybe informally that allows DCL to to be capitalized and to get on with the work that we set them up to do we enter into the final stage of the ascribe we carry as a regeneration of the crotchet so the timing I think is very important and also the council established DCAL you know we wrote before that this year 's more functioning and to creepily serve kind of stronger mechanism can contribute to this original regime that 's very important another one you will review that is here the kind of terror the swimmer may intend a chilly day of the support of council in the CHEO division and also contributed to the councillor outcome maker and n summation earlier socio-economic for wellbeing sexual basis so we need to give them more kind of resources in order to in a more functional contributor to this regeneration and also based on today 's will discussion it is we under control the weight because any open with petty Commission always keep the not up to the fact from the fiber presently not overlaid so based on today that is where the kind of recommendation we can achieve disco no any and either carbon and also like I mentioned earlier because opportunity and not quite opportunity and this opportunity loss and also that today we just keep you know the based on the other kind of function i got a sprained wrist resource management acted they have their function and also we trust that the start in peace year they have the skilled in the knowledge they have capacity they can do to make the debate by the way just you know to trust the name i think a little more mostly important so Jenna speak and I supported Israel recommendation thank you and I am in favor of us and I 'd like to bring one small new thing to the table I did vote against Peter Barrett amendment even though I do hear consumed about their particular development into community input into it and but I didn 't think it was for us to put an encumbrance on or to restrict the site development itself and I do have concerns about community input and I 'm I couldn 't put a further amendment cover Tory seconded that 's at least one but I would like to thank that um any development feel about community important developments and our neighborhoods in unto our city might proactively notify any developments which they 're able to do you don 't have to wait for someone else to decide whether you have to notify or not you can actually proactive I proactively decide to notify and I would like to thank these and development companies moving on over half would like to eat good lessee community input in that way thank you Glenn thank you Andrew stole one of my weeds before its intervention absolutely fine with it in my view this is at the time to be a you so if you 're a needs of Christchurch that the question is one of the counts are going to do or crisis they 're looking for leadership you might have questions over whether or not the business and landowners acted it sooner or later someone has to intervene and I think someone has to intervene in the whole city it 's not time for BAU which and you 're going to you might never go at me for this I think the government has done let the market take care of it well it did people need houses the community needs intervention they need leadership from us I 'm happy to go with this the four parts of the statement of intent are aligned with the four well-beings of the LGA this passes the procurement policy which I promoted which does permit an exclusive offer there is sufficient brits for that and the policy I 'm happy with us I hope you will support it as I said it 's not time to be a you actually have to show leadership this must feel like being at the bottom of a rock every time I detail come along so I 'm sorry about it hopefully it will listen but you 're our company we 've set you up and we actually actually let them fly so I hope you 'll support thank you that 's warning copy quick look I don 't believe in apologizing for good debate and I agree with Andrew there 's been good debate this afternoon we are coming from I 'm disappointed in the Peterborough quarter proposal because you know that we did want to low-rise city and we do have our town hall that has being restored and I think that will be put at risk of being cast into shadow however this is a package I want to see us go forward like the exhibition has been stated agree on the table today so I will support this Tim thank you I just want to mention you know like so I mentioned before about Brown Street you know be giving lots of counsel ain 't available for let 'slet look at the brown Street for instance and literally just a few meters away from the four-lane highway there a cold and winter hot and summer they late and there are full of wonderful people with huge value what is it mr. C need to pivot Christchurch I really look forward to Milton Street being developed by D and KC I think the potential beer and its site linking at Sydenham Park was absolutely priceless and I 'm Charlie supportive of it with regards to Peterborough you know we 've got to just go for a we 've seen you know they are fully aware of what what their aspirations are what their values are thatís a very these guys here you know we are one team really giver for the betterment of our city so I 'm totally in support of this it 's why I see you do it and I will seeking it again and again and again thank you thank you anyone else okay okay well you can go last then all right yeah viously support this I support the the bold developments that have been brought to the table in the way about game that we 're going about it too often do we hear that the council sits on its hands and doesn 't do enough in this field and some will criticize it so be it I don 't believe unlike councillor chin I don 't believe we 're in the final stage of recovery I biked around the city at lunchtime today it was many an empty block so that 's the final stage boy it 's a big final work big final we got coming um and I didn 't Street because of my fears around that may increase the cost one of our goals of that site to have some affordable housing and in some social housing place than there because there was some small amount of working capital attached to it which they will now loan that money to do the development and then that will get passed on to the Hindus us so you 're kind of you might save with one hand but you take it away with the other so that is my point there I do agree Fiona on one point and that is that they should probably be more properties than this he said list a few of them and so we should be putting together another less than an amount of time that will hopefully go to DCL as well for some other bold developments which brings me to my final one the presentation we saw of the Peterborough quarter if that comes off with those rain waves and the size of in the scale of those smaller shops at the ground level they were talking about I 'll be really really is I think then some say before you could walk through she thinks if you can carry on okay oh I don 't know much storytelling might be good but it 's not painting that got a picture I 'm sure most my colleagues report already that it will be a great development I went as I biked around the city today I noticed the number of large footprint retail sites in the inner city I 'm not going to name them all which streets were incredibly boring but they do exist narrow main ones so go and have a look the footprints are massive the most in the banks or selling cell phones I 've already got a bank and I 've really got a cell phone so I don 't need an inner city at the moment because there 's nothing there for me the other shots all those little cool ones haven 't arrived yet and hopefully I 'd like to see the list I 'll give you a small post-it note cool thank you okay anyone else to pop them do hope you can finish them propose this motion and I think back when DCL was proposing set up at seven point ago I can 't actually remember when it was but since that time we 've debated a whole lot of issues but the memory going back there we set up PCL as a place for investors to land their ideas on on the city an operation that could operate at arm 's length from the council avoiding many of the delays in bureaucracy that 's encountered within Council and effectively to be able to operate in the private sector the proposal that we have before us today is to approve property transfers to capitalized ECL allowing them to implement the various development plans across the city and what we 've seen so far for the Peterborough court are Milton Street and New Brighton and I 'm sure in the future there will be many more we need to have confidence in DCL and not micromanage all their proposals and really I think that if we have concerns about the way that DCL may operate they should be addressed and a review of the statement a lot is just finish um today earlier today we had a number of deputations and we had one personal from the New Brighton area and and we had one from dr. John crook who is the local medical practitioner for New Brighton who has practiced some seas I would say the vast majority of people that live in that area and I just like to read the last and sorry to sperm to Leverett way through we had some we 've had some concerns expressed today about car parking in New Brighton and the car park in fact across the road from his practice so I 'd just like to read quickly the last three paragraphs of the letter that he submitted us to us today I understand that DTM needs to have a capital base for it to operate effectively as a suburban stimulating entity on this basis the transfers of those property D properties detailed for the capital base for DC L to effectively operate is to be encouraged and acted upon as an individual with limited understanding of local government and financing I can only see and then the medium look to long term this will increase the rate take from New Brighton and I 'll take the liberty of adding and the city and give the council further ability to enhance the environment for the betterment of its citizens so that for me sort of calculates the the thoughts of a leader in the New Brighton community and I think reflects what I believe is the attitude that we should be prevailing in terms of capitalizing DC l and I have great pleasure and promoting it and urge other members to support this Rima thank you Dave okay well I will put the commotion do we have to put the two separate bits okay so I 'm going to put date the a2i I 'll put that motion all in favor say aye aye against that 's carried no Jonnie and then I 'll put items J K which don 't include the CHL directors will stand back I 'll put items J and K all in favor say aye all right against that 's carried yes okay thanks everyone that 's been a long quote meeting see thank you _"

    "text": "first up Steven Hammond Mary Horton from keep at it gentlemen you know your way if a time user September 28 2009 Lucario thought okay hey go for it who Athena the protocol protocol also Tajin to narcotic you know until Ricardo you know okay homie I 'm to counseling everybody hello we hope that we 're here today to support your work of Megan student Christchurch today once more we don 't forget core as I 've said before which is a group of this but he 's most importantly we 're interested in their collective assets of the people especially democracy these are moving pretty quickly more quickly than most citizens realized and this is what the neoliberal proponents such as DD Shipley used to encourage we see in the preset or tough at all had funds without regular care only on the bean paste of psycho business leaders extrordinary considering the board of that undemocratic organization is mainly business people just this week we also see that there are proposals to sell the bus exchange without which would be more difficult for the council to meet Leanne council until such time that the council in the group of Christchurch can little back control of work and assets that are rightfully the round of the council we will be suffering from a democratic vieja the authority of Manawa Nui be brave be strong to be good have it the turkey in the me he expresses the need for leaders to be out the world to give a different groups of interest the reason for using this one is that the cause these the council was under pressure from various quarters to lead only for the commercial sector rather than becoming leaders of all as it was required if we are to keep our most significant asset our local democracy almost funny DCL is a commercial enterprise visiting CHR L which is listed on the council that 's more degrees of separation than it 's useful in separating such commercial enterprises from direct council control there is strong movement away from and I quote aligning activities with a vision and strategy of the council in quote this of course it 's a strategy and vision of the council that lying that their zombie neoliberal hallucinations retaining ethic that the heart of democratic socialism what we 're helpful because the N again in the category Cathedral made a point of claiming a labor perspective and the third Lane Labour Party 's Constitution makes the claim to democratic socialism it 's becoming a fashionable word democratic socialism the third major justification for transferring these assets to this commercial body appears to be in to encourage developers to get on with the job there are two arguments to this way of thinking the first is there 's no good reason for that role to be not to be a council role we 've seen claims that the private sector we 're more efficient fail so many times the most for years that it makes takes a special type of mind to cling to the some zombie ideology it is possible and desirable for councils to lead development the written objection is that there 's no shortage of spear land for development in the center central or near central city it was far more effective to simply charge brilliant may be lazy land care encourages the council confirming a punitive rate on undeveloped land in the central city this applies to all three sites but coming now to our most concern our most deeply concerns interest concern is the transfer of Milton Street site our preferences that City care should be immediately restored to a strategic asset list the time definite and preferably return to the council as which department we 're gonna tension with central city site as its base city care has more potential to satisfy the needs of the people prestige we 've heard some vague hints that they Cynthia is considered morning but there is a series of questions about that how the council and council is driving this move this discussion is it another empire building dream of the directors does it align with the council objectives vision and strategy is it possible possibly a possibility being considered because of this proposed transfer we urge the council to be very cautious about any action that we can City care as any fit of the council we 're also curious as to which other sites a council has in landholders could be what given the need for development of community facilities such as that on the Aquatic Center a clear vision transparently communicated these people rather than piecemeal transfers would both be bitter and more democratic it 's possible to envision the et Brown Street property for instance being used as an example what a council lead public housing could be thank you for listening Kekaha your acumen when we thank Stephen just like to make one point that I better once they see their concern primarily is the city clear sight of the three years the one on P to restrict alarm Beresford Street but I wasn 't reading when I read submission here to learn that in fact a development cross use limited had put public money into the cross uses veto pack and if the council reflecting on that because that is public money there than their case has literally gone up in smoke apparently two million bucks with and so this will please do not build the devil by suggestions that they might be sort of commercial with kids or something like that and we of land because there 's an example of a commercial investment that is literally gone up in smoke up on the hills so and detail remains a shareholder the council through DCO remains a shareholder in that Canadian owned cross saluted me to pack so our concern is that having rid the document on the Milton Street Sciences City carriers express an intention to move that 's extremely vague statement win where who 'll buy whatever they 've got an existing side we 're concerned that once it 's gone the depot is gone it 'll be that much harder for them to sort of achieve what we would like to see which would be come back as across City Council Works Department and also it 's possible that that would make it easier to privatize with a site gone which we certainly oppose if they don 't have their own ghetto I think that would be about it thanks very gesture and correct something you said there about the Adventure Park first of all the Adventure Park was very well insured secondly it 's probably one of the most deal of the year recently in New Zealand for the way the deal was put together and that deal would not have happened without the council 's intervention through GCL so actually it 's been a very successful development which is still going and actually will be back on its feet probably by the end of the year anyway any questions Tim um you actually spoken to the management of city Kia about why they and did principle and the strategy but what they were proposing why they 're moving no we had any direct contact was the management of city gear I think this I mean if you look at sudden I mean if you want to get explained welcome and Eddington I 've given up quite a lot as a greater good across which at Brown Street coming right through its effective those three communities which are working-class had kind of communities which I know very well and we thought this in council that 's amazing vision for Brown Street Village right next to it and you know get a question here we 've got a block of the ownership and all the arguments that you 've just put forward without talking to City q and then you 've got this block of land that 's being looked at affordable housing and social health and right next to Sydenham park which beats inning tonight beats and brown street lease right and center and so if you can imagine a vision of a community in there with the same ways that suture closes and utilizing subcompact wouldn 't it be a really good way to go forward for that community because keep in mind that the government close to them school which was a fantastic move because it 's just what we need isn 't another car park answered them you 're right and that there needs to be more development but there 's not a shortage of it d 'Alene is a Brown Street site that used to be council public as in the Sydenham school as you just pointed out and as for them to City care City care is owned by you guys of by the city and you 're the guys that should be directing responsibility when you 're Marcus Lee also allows you to go and talk to them directly oh it does but we 've choose to talk to you because the back ends up in this room fine if you don 't at this time we 're talking to the Meister one more great Williams okay yeah fundamentally I agree with your position on keeping assets I 've always felt that way I 'm not big on keeping liabilities that certainly assets I like to give you a good return in some of the in the tomb empire building dream that that some directors have they are the ones those directors over time are the ones that have built charities like the airport and the port companies on it which are available that you 're trying to protect you say you don 't want to encourage those people to build us more ethics as a city so I 'm a little confused on that point if you could clarify know whether the empire building that we don 't wave a flag for a relation city care for example is in expanding outside what ten days ago we did the budget that 's right so we don 't care I mean them having picking up contracts around Hamilton and all that sort of stuff we don 't sort of wave a flag for that and conversely you get the rights of Delta this is sort of working in the city I realize it 's a government imposed contracting model and all that sort of stuff but this is not a question of not encouraging this is hanging on to an AC it does anybody here know for example we said he care plans to go if they moving their Depot take the opportunity to ask the question does anyone know what the planners know yes the Commission just my question on that on there is it one is I thought the KOAT group was about keeping our rates down by getting a return from arias it 's the value we 're not so suddenly Commission the big asset that were interested in is democracy which means that you guys elected by the people are the ones that do the leading and make the don 't even know that 's one that 's one that 's the sort of icing on the cake primarily those days is needles and perform the very important social function and I mean where the profession of housing that you raised yeah I mean if it was proposed social housing council housing for example is opposed to what I read in the store costs are affordable housing they 're two different things they 're two different things the council install three hundred and fifty seven houses down housing units down or what was that the September 2010 an earthquake so let 's talk about getting that up so if we 're all saying affordable housing and lamentable stuff there 's a lot of affordable so-called affordable housing going on across each at the moment I walk around the street of Ellington I think a lot of signs saying to rent to release for sale now because we know that an oversupply live to the magnet okay thank you very much in point all right thank you come here I 'd like to call mark Gibson from the New Brighton questions Kirra territory and sheer breadth and as accountants and thank you for supper charity too and speak with you to a solution and I 'm speaking specifically about the Beresford straight care packs the proposed transfer of those three cap acts and I really want to address it from the human scale the small community local neighborhood legal which Austin and Gavin 's it overlooked and for those of you who don 't know know some of you do and I only brought Union futures being regenerated itself at the moment and we 're halfway through the rebuild and the whole concept of air air site is that it 's a village within a village and it involves a village neighborhood here in the existing hall which has gone to his authorities upgraded and you know a small iconic chapel and and we really pride ourselves in take seriously in our location and a particular neighborhood to the south of Brighton move and so the three characters in question geographically very close to us and put a opportunity shop which is a very popular one and a number of so we only brought in very well between a union street it goes across here is food Street and to the east end of the list of nearest substrate here to the capex we 're talking about the middle Care Act the one to the east of Beresford Street is used extensively by patients at the Medical Center that is mixed to us so the block we are m and Union Street largely involves the metal center in the actual site and within researching and observing what 's been going on the last fortnight and in the block here are sixteen on street car parks during the week when the medical field is open most of those care packs are taken at any time the medical centers open that 's nearly at capacity so a lot of patients use the middle care pack it 's almost directly opposite the medical center and they walk across the street it is 45 meters from the theaters car park to the rent going into the Medical Center if you yeah nearly everyone who uses off-street care packing for the Medical Center or for with an addition through their own Street care packing that 's available at within that block here are at any given time during the week kind of thing care packs required off street so coming back to the big question air consumers if the capex train feared could be CEO and then they go into a some sort of consultation process from really big decisions already been made they 're not going to be care parks and this way we think the process is somehow not right that there needs to be more consultation if a local level and we 're only talking about the middle care pair or in either a very strong issues and needs around the care packs to the west and the east of the central one for example the most least and one which is the one in the best condition and there 's half fold most of the time and there are people who work in the area mostly and it 's totally full on Sundays because of grace and we 're Church and they hadn 't got off street parking and they are when you record it there among the ground community level human scale that you know I think needs to be considered before the big macro and decisions are made about yes we 'll simply train clear these care packs because it does little imp it and we see the number of people struggling across the street from a car park near to get into the miracle singer we would actually argue that packing should only be on one side of Union Street it 's a very narrow street when you 're a cares packed on both sides you can it does an extra operates two lanes because tears can 't cast each other in the street and so the off-street care parking was absolutely essential and we should actually do a pedestrian crossing from the across to the miracle center this is pretty much the scope of what we wanted to convey today and there any questions I 'm happy to answer them yes thanks very much mark just a clarification do you feel that the intention to perhaps incur loss of both Carfax was not conveyed and consultation do feel that the people who would not allusion to the fact that those car packs might be lost in the transfer but they would they would not be do anymore do you I know I 've talked to and I 've made an absolute point funda people the last two weeks most people could never close Maris Aylward but they can take a pebble powerful openness I ask people when you go when you draft of the mythical single reader you pack and most of them pack and the earth sweet pepper and so here 's implications are standing on the street and I think okay those care packs calendar erm in yes bright needs regeneration will totally support that principle it needs more people living in central garden we support it but when you take away those Fairfax we 're the alternative areas it 's reasonable for someone who 's unwell and we 're on a walking frame to get to the Medical Center yep it 's not easily left in secondly to people currently pay for in you get parking or is it all three no it seriously and I know that it 's being difficult without through the extra information available but we all wear that DCL announced earlier this week data at a community meeting about what they were planning for this more area into the Beresford Street car parks so they 're actually when you talk they 're more people and front page of the thickest post here 's I 'm talking about the and the potential for those to be residential there 's more people living closer your service and the doctor community it will notice you didn 't idea yeah if identity it but it also with a wider redevelopment there also be looking at cat parking and we did convey very important and then some lonely motorists so the scientists race to break our packs but the people in our community do and particularly reality and those who run walk yeah Oakland good Oh Matt hey Matt possible view on all this I know you 've only come here money about car parks but it 's got any no sorry not philosophical ideological you know over there what 's been said from he I support public business I 'm not speaking for my parish we haven 't actually discussed it in relation to this issue but what I do know is that really totally is a parish and committed to the regeneration cranly Burton which I know the council is fully informed on and you had a huge stream of new brought and people through here in know what new verse and the reality is and revert and so regeneration is essential but and I think they 're people would want it to be good consultation about the possibility of needing public versus and I 'm a strong supporter the let more people living them central Brighton we have left quite a few hundred paper as a result of the earthquakes and personally burns going to Hammond the future it needs it needs and local people will be actively supporting the local community and good numbers okay thanks very much not okay and could I call Carol London and David Shepherd [Music] I 'll make a start and afternoon were from the Peterborough village incorporated society which represents the businesses and residents river Barbados Street and Salisbury Street in January this year Steve Clark came to one of our meetings and asked us to consider ideas for the block between Kilmer and peterborough streets which is just opposite the Town Hall he wanted ideas that would enhance the Town Hall in terms of development we called together a meeting of architects and landscape architects and other designers who live and work in the area to put together a proposal which ordered Shepherd coordinated and presented which would answer that request for ideas that will enhance the Town Hall that also enhanced our community David 's going to present it to you thanks Karen I 'll be as brief as I can these are really notes on the potential hopefully the old Convention Center site office of the Town Hall Town Hall is making really great progress our contrived very concerned part from improvements to the rubric over the future of the land around and in the vicinity of the town hall Tom who is a magnificent sitting visually with Victoria Park and the river but then it was opened again we 're away and using the locals the street will go straight for access to the Town Hall we feel that the town Hajus ever particularly the entrance to it deserve a greater presence Finnegan 's of contribution by the buildings and properties opposite we believe that the old convention center land will give us this opportunity and we have heard rumors of a Australian development company possibly having the option on the land to provide the eventually develop quite a lot of office development one we think that that is probably unnecessary very developments going present time we 're reaching a good level of office accommodation but we think that the development of this old land perhaps with contributions cost sharing and so on by claimed it 's more to a compatible a really attractive City where the childhood could be seen better you have access Peugeot bility to front at North arrow straight at the on the north end of Lee that the Convention Center land for parking and for eventually for uses but are compatible and complementary to the town hall so just very quickly at the time I to DCL who we hope we believe are it 's supportive of these ideas but we would like to feel aggressive the trench vehicle lanes three DCL but perhaps for some conditions set by the Council and some objective set with the nature of the development of this site so just beer with the other special items the land in Christian is the Astros asterisk area prescient abundantly the slide at long the bottom of the slide is the town hall making good progress at the most the danger that the entrance to the town hall will open only on to Hoover Street and have nothing reflecting it on the opposite side it 's just a spirit Erin Murray has been really fellow since the convention center was demolished was very successful very interesting Mary garden development occurring off Peterborough Street on the north side gracefully underused great food but there 's a lot been a lot of interest in in the use of this land by groups such as gap-filler life and vacant spaces and so on but it 's we don 't recognize that this was going to has mentioned we had meetings are members of the printable community and we came up with particular objectives of scale permeability low-rise three-story pedestrian spaces open space good planting good lighting and good activities at street level and the ownership mode could be in a small fine texture we also looked at the possibilities of studio spaces spare activities that are complimentary to the town hall like music shops with their shops cafes and so on which are present if you remember the life of the town hall if you wanted to have a build you skated long Colombo Street to pass the of small cafeterias and better was just starting to develop a character whether it certainly was affected by the earthquakes so the Landers I went to draw on sizes and things but that 's the land approximately rectangle starting at Lake Como Street frontage extended right through to the birth to Peterborough Street what we 've done is to as you can see in the shape we we found that the figure of the land is directly opposite an on axis with the entrance to the iconic and firms in the development just very purposely sketch forms that we 're not pursuant to much and we 're not making a building proposal so much as a conceptual and use proposal here a Gratzer extending of different dimensions north to south circuits excellent light with three and four-story buildings potentially along both sides and that links particularly at the half block through to the activity along Colombo Street which is on the right-hand side of the diagram you can see the snow texture of the buildings the light sun coming from the north and buildings including residential mixed use buildings residential and shops not mostly on the same building you could have shocks in rug block and residential and the other for the derivative the difficulties of mysterious land ownership that 's just a further issue and I do every space that 's looking from the Town Hall across and looking up the Avenue that 's the weren 't developed Roy l-3 looking for the town whole double run looking through to the north to keep the space on the bottom left-hand corner we 've just included in could take place you can see small-scale interesting places lose the next few photographs are to give you some idea of the nature of the land use the protected emerge we 've lost sadly a lot of the old lanes in the city our own practice has done baked goods in center recently where we 've reintroduced the lanes and we get a great support a great for the idea of the spirit extra support for the land ownership this is a true version of it could it could go that way Hitler planted it could be about urban space like that through in four stories it could be a mix of residential outdoor spaces the very the places overseas with similar scale interesting buildings pavilions residential coming onto that block good country as we say looking through and that would be also a further means a direction route for a parking which could be alone kübra Street as well you walk for present block change the Town Hall at the end these are just again learn with examples of places like this which would be very easy to develop that this is an opportunity and really almost essential thing if we want to be reduced suburb of a complementary scale to the town hall thank you very much thank you very much I don 't even got time for questions but thanks very much and anything meditation we have two copies of the report but the notes the view of leaders here thank you very much and we have a long Christian in the audience right okay I 've done some fish and now the Pharisees don 't continue to receive it all I 'm really missing handle directed yeah if everyone had the statement from John Cooke with email true region yep we just need to know okay fantastic okay so that 's all these invitations _"

    "text": "it so following your easy recommendation again item 9 the some little sun corridor acquisition of residential red zone properties that 's right and once again the committee supported this unanimously the primary reason is for the purposes of mitigating natural hazards and protecting the network infrastructure and the infrastructure is actually council owned and it 's primarily our roading network so it does make sense that council owns this land and the council has completed the mitigation works right Sheldon if it was council did it but primarily the bonding to protect the road corridor in some properties so there is with council ownership there will be the responsibility for council to maintain the area inside the buns and the fences that could be challenging in itself I think we would need to believe it was mainly weed control and things like that and we press little unclear about the optics but we 'll need to believe that there 's probably not anticipated to be majorly high I just like to draw the committee 's attention to five point point point number five point eight that the there has of the report has been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties so either the committee is supportive of this for a dollar and would like to move this forward great thank you so I 'm questions yawning can we be advised what the proposed terms and conditions are and certainly you can keep you informed of those but though we feel standard conditions related to transfer of land so all normally in the thing we use the Auckland Law Society form of contract and there 'll be those and but I 'm happy to share those with interested councillors if you want so is that see under 5.8 is there anything in there that 's unique about the ongoing liability that we 're inheriting from the core this land sohow under 10 5.10 how are we planning on dealing with the risk of exposure from a financial point of view around those future liabilities and costs and management and maintenance the whole structure has been designed by our geotechnical people in partnership with with limbs geotechnical people and let 's have a big concrete sorry the big stone barriers fenced off this area but we 've also fenced off the whole pile of other areas because the geotechnical people have said they are areas that will be need to keep the public out in case we have another earthquake but we the run out from the rock doesn 't go as far as the road so we didn 't need to build that the rock barriers in Lass 's we think is the transfer of the land on which we have built infrastructure so you 'll see it isn 't pictures and bits and it 's not one coherent and there 's a couple of bits I mean that are still subject to rock film but they are not being transferred around so basically really I suppose our responsibility is to one protect our infrastructure obviously that 's ear but secondly somehow we will have to restrict access to the land and behind so but what I don 't what I don 't understand is like if we do nothing and the crown continues to own these properties and maybe they get caught into the dock estate or whatever report is that if you have land that 's you know that 's causing a risk to someone else then you have a liability so why why are we taking the liability off the ground in terms of future has an integration I think it 's important to realize that the reason why we 're involved is not because of the liability of the land is because we have put in place assets to protect at all the community 's infrastructure mainly the roading Network and their safety so we need that access to make sure that and and the management and the control to make sure that those assets remain protecting community safety and ensure those networks are operable so that 's the main reason for doing this it is not to take on any other liabilities but we do by those sections that were requiring what the hills and the rocks and the cliff class that 's all coming across to us you 'll see in here the size of sections we are taking over the sections that are just on which we have infrastructure on and that the long term that you could do some other things on but they are not part of it so only the ones that we 're taking over is where we need in the long term to ensure that our asset is maintained in the long term to protect the rogue users it 's purely from a road barrier perspective okay just a final question is when when are we getting a report on the other portholes red zone land that 's adjacent to reserves for transfer so we 've spoken to limbs and they 've indicated that there are more properties to come and we have commenced that conversation with them I don 't have a specific timeframe at this point but I 'll let counselors know as soon as I can on what that timeframe will be for reports to Council Thank You Alan yeah mine 's just some concerns all around the financial implications like it 's cheap land dollars good deal but it is then ongoing maintenance and under financial implication seed funding source none although there is potential to fund future maintenance of the properties through of worked out how much that might be because I had a whip throat seems like it 's about 23 nearly 24,000 square meters of land which is quite a lot nearly 20 we will chew and there will be one obviously we 're going to have to maintain whether we own it or not we 're going to have to maintain our infrastructure we 're going to have to if you have a look there 's the fence 11 the front of it that 's probably going to be our biggest cost then behind we will have to meet the requirements of the regional plan around pest control around plants would be the biggest thing and basically somehow we will have to mean like ISO maintained that no access to it one of the real problems is health and safety well I don 't think I will be putting staff necessarily in or we will be putting stuff in there to do that however because it 's sitting and it 's protecting transport assets it will also be in partnership with NZTA you will appreciate these these things bunk part of the 83 percent corridor money that we did get so we believe the biggest expense will be ongoing weed control which we actually don 't think is if you have a look at the quality of the soil you have a look at what 's growing in some of those other places that have been shut off actually we don 't think will be that expensive the issue will be how do we do it and depending on what council 's philosophy is on and use of various sprays and things like that there may we may need to come back to you and see what 's cost effective might be the solution so look it would be the methodology that we 've still got to work through the other thing is is that the buns while they 're just currently grasped they are being planted at it in the near future and they get so everything 's actually been designed to be low maintenance as much as possible so that 's all things all through we just don 't have a dollar figure to put on it weed control when that 's all ends have been doing in there up to this point it would be kind of nice to know that because if we 've got I seen a little remote control robots or whatever to do the work I mean like we should never ask people to do what we wouldn 't do ourselves so maybe the counselors could you could nominate a few hey is that going to be added to the resolution mr. chairman okay so we 're still in questions at the moment and I 'll go to that I think you look I 'm very supportive of the proposal here before us today but I just really wanted to pursue the acquisition of current red residential red zone land and you 're telling us that you know you you 're requiring this to protect the assets that we 've provided for community safety taking that to the extreme and looking at other issues around the city acquisition of red zone land and protection of people 's property and whatever what is the process for a fact that you wade through to process to the South Shore split for example and say we need to provide an asset along there to protect residential property and I 'm not okay with the South South Shore spit issue it may well be but I need to do some research on that before I can give you the authority answers in terms of the broader process for this one and we have been reactive to Lynn 's raising the issue with us but as a result of this we 've been is working to be proactive to consider the future properties and start making those contacts with them about what are their plans what are they a time frame so that we can inform counselors early about that so that 's advanced that a counselor you 're handsome before we 've started that process with them with gathering information and we 'll come back to you as soon as possible with further information on that it just sends us another possibility or another approach to some solving some other solutions to issues around the ten it is a very peculiar assets because they are single for example or we build a stop band gets multi-use you could let people access it where these ones well I can 't think of any other assets that we 've got in this kind of place where they 've got to be locked away to risk sorry to mitigate a risk on a very important transport corridor and I 've got to be locked away that that 's about that very unique connect and in there all right thank you very much now um Sarah has indicated that she 's happy to move this yet so moved by Sarah seconded by Pauline is there any debate yawning yeah thanks um I think this raises a whole number of concerns and the one that I do support was 26 Nayland Street so I 'd like my vote recorded in favor of that but you know the frustration it 's a bit like the last report like with the skirt not doing the proper repairs and so we end up with patchwork and we don 't do the renewal at the same time this one we 've got a piece of community board wanted to incorporate into the Sumner library the new community facility and we were unable to get any traction any progress and now that 's almost that building 's opening soon and the design couldn 't incorporate the land across the street was just seen such a waste of opportunity so it 's really frustrating like again this is sort of you know at the end of things when actually with the opportunities to save a lot of money and do things in a more join up fashion just don 't seem to exist with central government and it 's interesting that we can get these reports that transfer a huge amount of risk and liability and even in the report itself it says we just have no no specific provision and budgets for future management and maintenance of these properties goes on to talk about we don 't know what the risks are and that there is concern I think in the report over the certainty and that the possible potential liability of the land so what it says also under legal obligations that landowners have the adjoining property owners also have this right therefore it 's the landowners responsibility to ensure that any activity or potential source to interfere with other land owners rights is managed so you know I think that basically this is letting the crown off the hook for what I think it could be a very huge liability we don 't have the financial information about how much is going to cost ongoing and and how it 's going to be maintained and therefore I don 't believe and as of today we 're in a position to be able to acquire these properties I think do so is incredibly risky and we need to be very cautious about this the whole reason that as I understood it that counsel originally when we went through the cost share was to say that we would accept the land adjacent to the reserves but we didn 't want to accept all the land because we were concerned that that would transfer the liability to us and this seems to be what 's happening here so I won 't support it the one that I to me that 's the one that you know it is adjacent to that community facility it does make sense but the other ones I will not support so we 're probably going to need some staff advice at this point about how we deal with that because your honor you 're indicating that you support the resolutions in respect of 26 Nayland Street but not in respect of the other properties that 's that 's yep okay so can we do this just by way of noting that counsel in your Handsome 's approval is only in respect agreement is only in respect to the property at 26 Nayland let 's do that okay great is there any further debate pulling so that yeah I think those points are valid I personally don 't think the risk is as high as council Johansson is stating and the benefit to the council that primarily is to protect our roadway for our people to use it so I think in light of that that outweighs everything else I think I have confidence and the staff report that they have investigated everything that they convinced the optics point be enormous and we will find a way around that so that way I 'm supporting us great thank you so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried and just noting that Yanni 's approval of terms so Yanni is in favor of 26 Nayland Street only and is voting no against the resolution as it relates to the other properties great thank you _"

    "text": "so now that Pauline 's back in the room we will come back to items 8 9 so item 8 Randall Street Street renewal project palling can you um make some introductory remarks about this guys um yeah well actually this is an opportunity through the land drainage recovery program to actually do exactly what we 've been striving to do at Council and that 's to to bring efficiencies by aligning the works that we do and also reducing disruptions for people so the Rendell Street project is bringing the intended works forward by about five years it was due for a renewal to align with land drainage works there which is actually happening now and this is the the Dudley bypass which they 've nine meter wide culverts going right down the middle of the street the balance of the work after the streets being replaced we 'll be doing replacing the addition channel with the appropriate booms and some renewals and the fundings coming from savings made and Midway Street so it seems very logical and the right thing to do we approved it at the committee the works being done it would be silly not to actually complete the street and there 's one thing that residents do not like seeing is when we finish a job and then we come back a few years later and to get up so this will also make this area which has been very very hard by the earthquakes as well announced yet to suffer this whole upheaval with the land drainage recovery program going in there with the bypass that will be done dusted and finished so the committee supported this great thank you very much so we 'll now move to questions and my first question is what would be the implication of as not approving this today what would happen if we didn 't approve this today basically if you didn 't improve it today we would just patch over as part of the land drainage program and we just have a part of a broken tree so we 'd have to come back and do it in three or four years time so the long term that would cost you more obviously in the Dudley it 's not quite down the middle and that point so one side would be replaced with new dish deep dish we didn 't think that was too much the other side so it would go back in all right now the other part of us with us to understand is the peace between Isis and the peace between Petrie and Crystal Street has been replaced and stand flat Cuban channel is part of scutes work so that land drainage program are delivering it 's part of on behalf of scoot and this is the peace between crystal in North Parade so it 's with it connects the street to is it consistent okay thank you um so Glen and then Yanni Glen thank you thank you me and David I thought the engagement over Midway Street was excellent and this strikes me it 's quite similar given that the overall carriageway of cetera and what we 're proposing to do but because of that and because Richmond 's been a hard-hit area wonder 16.4 whether we could and I am going to push it to be honest just go know I 'm sure the residents will welcome it but I think it would still be great to take him on board just to know that they heard is that you don 't see that as a big biggie not great it 's got two options there but I think I 'd like us just to land on your would pooling is it yeah just to land on the consult rather than inform I think it would be it can be done we can go and engage with the community whether it 's a consult or and engagement we can we can do something and engaged community and what 's going on in here yeah I 've just it is already happening yeah I I think there 's more of an expectation that it 's happening in the community because that other piece of um Randall is being done yeah but we can we can definitely engage with the community that 's not I think an or reality though if you went to the community and said do you want your Street finished to this point and we come back I mean it 's not rocket science to think what the answer will be so I think that that you 're right thing they 're doing really really good engage Limpy you know so yeah I 've taken comfort if we can take in format or your beer yep yep or if we can have confidence that there will be an appropriate level of the world later of engagement it will community like they were yeah that 's fine so yeah me and then deal thanks um so I just want to be clear in terms of the condition of Randall it 's not it 's not scheduled until five to ten years so you said I think three years it would be done but in terms of our strengthen your program this isn 't a priority at all is that correct yeah five years on the project scheduled four five five five team okay so do do we have any other streets that are greater priority that uh the issue is that she Joe was done without the pot having gone through I think the real issue is the one side of the card we 're going to put back an old one which would be I don 't think would be a good way to go and then we 'd come and to get back up in five to ten years time so it 's actually that coordination of efficiency and effectiveness scared still in the section right next door it just gets us right out of that street so yeah it just why would you do why would you for the stuff that 's being replaced why would you put the old deep dish back because you can 't have half and half we 've got all right although it gets like half and half be so it doesn 't the community doesn 't understand having half-and-half well no we 've got we 've got quarter quarter quarter oh and so we could do it like that 's your decision yes well we brought it here so what 's proposed to be done under the proposal that we 've got here under the proposal is to put complete flat Cuban channel and the section of of a to Christa will be all flat yep so maybe the better question is why would we do that and why would we not I mean yes it may well be our decision to put half-and-half course one-quarter eight and eight or whatever but what 's the rationale for doing it all and doing it well at the same time no that 's not the question the question is if we don 't if we don 't process today what what goes bad and why would we get the old deep this channel you would put back a cable channel on the old Street alignment basically and so when we came up to do the other half of the street we would then have to come up back down maybe the curb we may be able to put the curb and I don 't know I 'm sorry the detail the levels of the streets whether they curve that we would have to put into green the street honors current geometry would be in the right place or not I don 't know so this enables us to do the proper of all those problems there I could put in the flat curb or I could put in a ditch curb I don 't actually know the geometry of the street and whether I could put it in there so it would still function without doing that holster okay just like the other two questions I have was is this going to include the footpaths being renewed at the same time yes cool and so just in light of that I 'd be really keen to see some sort of engagement but we did engage just Sibley yes so I think that 's really important so that we 'll be able to be done and people can feed on you know what sort of trees are being planted or landscaping driveways all that stuff that we normally get so that can happen um and then I think um in terms of the cost of doing the Slater versus the cost of doing it now so how much money do you think doing it now saves [Music] probably serve the 300,000 had imagined from foregoing block to block plus obviously you know on the site it 's be a not highly cost effective because there 's a small piece of work relative term you know the cost of establishment and the equipment and things yeah look I 'm sorry that 's right off the top of my head it 's not a yeah and I mean there are costs in ways other than financial cost as well in terms of the expectation logic around any other the amenity of people that live in the neighborhood and getting in ones doing the work and getting out again so on okay moving on Dion and then Dave help what 's the length of the bitter street 80 meters eighty eighty okay cool and um that 's up Dave I think you look I completely support this notion of doing the work now I just wanted to clarify you are proposing that when you do the street renewal you will be doing flat channel and entire Park what I don 't want to see is a mixed match of deep-dish and flat channel like happened and bear out so we 're going to have to me what you 're proposing makes complete sense and I just want to clarify that it was flat channel here will do all the drainage in the work there as part of the Dudley Creek so we can actually get the grades all right for flat great thank you very much so someone happy to move this Pauline seconded by Mike yep so when L move into debates or Pauline as I said I 'm I 'm very supportive of this for many reasons it 's the cost efficiencies but also it 's the benefit to the residents they of not having to go through this strength being done at dug up again and there could be potential damage to the new road surface that we 're putting down now if we come back but you 've got to remember that people in this area that they 've put up with a lot with this massive massive job of the Dudley bypass and that 's actually not going to benefit the a particular area it and I think that for them to have their Street dug out for this work have them end up with a street renewal looking really beautiful and nice after all this time as what they will really appreciate so there 's the cost efficiencies and there 's the the logical rationale for doing this right now is one thing but the benefits the residents for me is I think really really important so I 'll be supporting this again thank you one of the key parts of our procurement policy is whole of life cost savings which were identified here I think on those grounds alone it makes perfect sense to do that as good as better venue for rate payer money but also want to stress that this was a very hard hit part of the city post-quake was part of Bill woodpeckers ward now transferred to central that the the Richmond area particularly was very badly hit and in in Pauline 's ward there are some shocking streets so I think we need to support this what I want to really stress though is that part of the option option a it talks about slash and form a really must stress we 've know I know you will you made a great job than it over Midway getting that underway so I would like to think that this is extended these are very wide streets 13 meters I stupidly measured one in the dark the tape measure it 's not a good idea but 9 meters out of the whole thing leaves you you know to either side so it makes sense to do the whole width with our modifications with the footpath urban channel and cetera so I do hope you support this thank you from a health and safety viewpoint you maybe need a reflective tape measure yeah okay so yawning yeah I mean it 's been no secret that this is what I 've wanted us to do as we 've been doing the scope works and it hasn 't happened which has been a real lost opportunity so I actually do think this is a much more sensible approach that the reason I raised the questions is because there 's other parts of the city that also were badly hurt that as David 's alluded to that have had and channel and you know don 't drain I have all sorts of issues and we never got any report to actually do the renewal at the same time which I think was a real shame so I think this makes sense in terms of it saves money which and hopefully then be put into those other streets that do need that work to be done I think the other thing and you know hopefully at some stage I don 't know where it 's at we 're going to have a workshop on undergrounding as well but in some of these streets there are quite large mature trees and we do need to think about we 're failing levels of service on electricity and tree clearance and maybe in some of these more established areas we do need to think about I think under grounding at the same time but yeah I mean sensibly this is about doing things together getting the synergy between the lender a nudge the skirt and the council and if we can save money on this then I hope that that money can be we have actually already signed off to go ahead but has been delayed to support midway so hopefully this gives us a bit of flexibility but yeah I do think it 's a sensible thing to do yeah I certainly appreciate the frustration in some other parts of town where there are you know outcomes that clearly we need to go back and look at this may not have been a priority but clearly now logically it is a priority given that we 've gone through and done the works with the the pipe going through there are practicalities to doing this efficiencies effectiveness cost benefits as we 've heard amenity benefits for the residents in going in there once doing the work is logical is sensible and I expect that some this will be supported so I 'll put the motion all those in favor against as carried great _"

    "text": "to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee items item eight Randall Street Street renewal projects and I was going to invite Pauline to introduce this but she seems to have disappeared as exactly the wrong moment so will maybe come back to eight and nine once Pauline 's back in the room next net let 's now then move to item ten the review of the marine and river facilities bylaw and we have some additions to this resolution which are highlighted in yellow I 'm going to get Dave to introduce this item and Dave I understand that you 've got some background to these items that are in yellow as well that you 'll be able to explain to us yeah thank you Andrew essentially here today we 're conducting a review of the marine and facilities file or of 2008 and proposing to replace it with the Marine River and lakes facilities pile or 2017 so staff have conducted a section 155 analysis as required under the Local Government Act and essentially today we are being asked to adopt a replacement bylaw for public consolidation essentially there they generally loosely fit around commercial commercial use of facilities vehicles on walls time limits for mooring vessels and some other less significant effects such as scientist refueling storage of facilities fishing of some of these things most of these provisions relate to press three or four of our principal wharves in the area notably Akua wolf Daley 's warfare Corral and the diamond Harbor Wharf are the ones that sort of principally aligned to there was a bit of consideration and in our regulatory performance committee meeting the other day about the definitions of some of the facilities particularly in the inner city where we were looking at council structures along long waterways in the in the central city and staff of provided an update on some of those in section 5 of the recommendation so I think it 's pretty straightforward the EPS staff will ask some more detailed questions if need be but the principal thing is today we 're not actually adopting the bylaw we 're actually adopting it for public consultation and depending on what responses come back from public consultation a final draft would of these yellow changes is to include sea walls auto exit is to exclude sea walls to it to include sea walls socially will stays there sorry she knows but it 's just um when we were looking at the boardwalks in viewing platforms it wasn 't clear of places that we were intending to be covered by this such as the Oxford steps in the boardwalk at water mark next to enter your boat sheds they don 't specifically provide access to the water wouldn 't necessarily be going into them we 're still cleaning out his eels in the area that kind of thing we still came to have those covered by the bylaw so that 's why they said the addition of the phrase of a long sidle partially in the river or lake with included to make sure that those particular structures would be included in the Bible yeah no that 's absolutely fine great okay so thank you very much indeed a for the introduction are there any questions of staff on this says Mike sir I do have a quick question because I understand for those and then off that list but why not Seawolves because why don 't we if we 're creating a vial or actually make sure it works or any future issues in terms of potential nuisance from our people fishing off these silk sea walls wrong but the likes of our Beach full row the new fishing lures that is proposed in the bylaw only relates to the Central City River area so it 's not related to all the different areas but are you referring to the nuisance issues credit by fishing generally well potentially so if we create a bottle obviously we want to make sure it is future proofed what potentially happen and we see what happens on the pier and obviously that 's outside of the districts we can 't put this fire water but who knows what might happen to those sea walls if a lot of people start fishing often so that creates a nuisance and potentially if we exclude sea wolves then we just miss that opportunity to UM capture there no I mean it was really a policy decision about the the Parks unit say and we 'd probably need to go back and sheep with him on the sea wolves point there hasn 't been any identified problems at the moment as far as I 'm aware about sea walls which is what we 're supposed to do with the bylaw is identify the perceived problems and then address them through a Bible clause so no one had actually raised any problems with the sea walls and the PAC 's unit as I understand it had said don 't include them so if there were a proposal is mike suggesting to include sea walls in order for them to be included we would need to have an issue which a bylaw was reasonably expected to deal with we don 't have such an issue therefore that would be the argument against it all that will be the advise against including them yeah that will that 's the position now yeah that we as far as I 'm aware we didn 't II yeah and when Delaware have any issues occurring at the moment thank you Thank You Phil all right 'll happy to move this and Jamie 's happy to second is there any debate all those in favor against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "you families so in your club though right the abide you want it add to your you know your observe act tell us your observations about actual use by children this wonder if you might tell us what what you see at times until numbers Dave yeah it 's pretty hard to to describe the numbers sometimes that there might be a few people walking past and using it with young children they sort of might go down from further up very kinda street shopping at the mall and walking back other people might stop with cars and children do get out and say and probably we 've opened up our Bowling Green to have a large wife netting fence along the front of it to the playground now and it 's opened up the club but you see a lot more happening in the playground area now and it certainly doesn 't that times get a lot of use at all and other times as there are people there but the the main thing every time you look at is that safety risk of you know children because there of the adult American Street and to me it 's it 's a major safety risk you so don 't comparing this little playground with the the fold Barrington Park playground it was actually not really not many kids at all no you certainly see a lot more down the other end by the by the mall yes yeah there 's no doubt that 's the main playground and that 's why we said at the start we don 't take me opposed to money being challenged into that area it 's just that we would like our proposal to be taken into consideration thank you thank you no further questions Karen yeah just over the number of people that may not be able to walk far to go to the club or it may even have some form of disability do you have numbers around that that need car parking more than others well it 's probably we haven 't but it would be a community car park as such it would help any park users and also it would get some cars off the street and then the canvass certainly signed up because it would it would free up some packing on Barrington Street for their visitors but certainly our bowling population that there 's probably more retired people or what there are not retired people and trying to get across a busy Barrington street when you 're packed on the other side of the road or just around the corner does those pose a risk any more questions thank you very much indeed for coming along to allow us to hear your submission this morning and will certainly be taking that into account as we consider the annual plan thank you thank you very much thank you thanks very much I 'd now like to call Marc Girard representing the Historic Places Trust Canterbury mark good morning thank you for joining us is it red light for the green green is on green as all green for go thank you and just before we start the clock I just like to acknowledge the passing of Ian Clark one client was passionate about crisis environment heritage and its urban design he was why Mary County City Councilor museum Trust for ten years as well as ten years on the board and 20 years on the cauchy Charities trust and I think it 's proper read knowledge is passing for us contribution to the city thank you thank you first of our submissions concerning the work on councils work on the heritage buildings we 'd ask the council request that the hpc that they pass on has dark places Kennedy 's appreciation of which in morals efforts think he 's doing a great job is very busy he was out of his wife talked to the community groups and he 's a great example of a council official doing a really good job and he 's really really busy as I know trying to get Dutch with them as well as the output and then making himself available PowerPoint presentations and he 's actively going at asking for and we 'd wipe his work to be appreciated by the council for them I 'm passing it on in addition we think the council 's doing great work is unusually on a plan submission but we 're done great work go for okay we some of them have been delayed we 've noticed financial constraints as extra benefit the council 's promoting at this their work enough but I 've said this last year at last year 's thing and melon really picked it up I did have widget I came about this I must have met you looked slightly surprised but this though I don 't think you 're selling the story of what you 're doing enough on this great stories these are treasures if you truly believe their treasures they 've got great stories you go and tell them I mean like my email box is full of people from here to New Zealand joy here selling stuff regularly I get nothing from the council every time you open a building I go and dive into their here statement of significance and get the Heritage and try and put it on the HP website with a page and put it out there so people know about its heritage so in other words councils I 'm really basically requesting more height on heritage height I did say it for it but I think you can 't over seller I think you 've done a fantastic job and it 's wrong it 's really good now moving on the nurses memorial chapel HPC requests the funding be reinstalled the mall is previous indicated that if funding cancer is reinstalled and continued as was planned it may be really full and repaired by Armistice Day and I think this is great I think a delay outside arms the stay you 'll delay the effectiveness of those opening but if you 've got open arms they you have a very good chance of grabbing national headlines this is a unique building both nationally and internationally and I think it 's a great opportunity I welcome the council for considered PR campaign to coordinate with us as well and I and I do point out it actually as a physical statement the regeneration Christchurch is occurring and it 's nice to hear about it 's hard to brag about a glass box and a cycle cycle lane but people will acknowledge are you doing this and it is also unique the news 's one I think if I recall quickly that 's something equivalent so theoretically every losses organization our Union etc throughout the world should be receive information on the nurses Memorial Chapel and then you years later it 's not difficult and pushed it right up and I suspect you will also grab some attention nationally for this one and this is a problem sir you can 't ask for it 's a great opportunity in addition we noticed there is some funny we 've supported funding applique on various trusts in the films for interpretation etc and that 's predicated on the building be opened roundabout arm estate and as you know with voluntary organization that 's very hard but so would ask that the council release funding to get this little gem repaired thank you very much next up we 've got the provincial council buildings HPC endorses doctor along keeps detailed submission so inquest that firms borough is to start to start with restoration on this international gem as is our understand has been an insurance payout Ministry of Culture and here it 's funding and the that the land funding is really false the cost of the building will go up repair will go out it does it seems to regularly and the Ruby deterioration a lot of its Timbers will turret because it 's idle in the past the building has had leaks so you will cost you more money to do the full restoration I make a note that it was a temptation and council and you see a lot of requests and documentation with money that 's it 's thinner gone through many council annual plans and assembly we see the number as just as a figure that 's sitting there but this building is internationally significant it 's it is up there with the Art Center and instead of seeing it as a course we should actually see it for what it really is there 's an answer National gem which we can take credit for restoration the equivalent of the Art Center and I think it 's very important that we start this and in addition we have a corresponding PR campaign that 's going in to make sure to say more that 's asking you to step up and say this is important this is why we 've got customers building and we know it 's important because it 's a treasure and we 're going to tell Ward mister why it 's important and what we 're doing about it this is an ongoing one for the entire restoration you can be mounted tours and doing what the Art Center does with interpretation all the way through so it 's a chance to market strata now you might think a year so what well outside when we 're doing a sort of gathering outside the old normal school I had that same year old from Newcastle berating me as to why we 're losing our heritage and Justin firmly that they 've just restored the Newcastle cathedra after 20 years which was broke now he 's selling his heritage from the castle to me now we should be our Christchurch wizards when they 're traveling to position to do something similar so it 's an opportunity of the council to go for and tell people inductively here in market provide as a national context it 's just to tell the world that this is what we 're doing and to be honest I 'd say by doing so it sounds over-the-top it 's actually demonstrated McRoy shares the ambition the talent the determination and the regeneration are real I know you wouldn 't have expected from here it is love organization but I think it 's important just to finally thank you very much for the dip today those late deputation early understand mistakes made and I 've found the Department for accounts to be we were really good and their follow up and all the way through was exemplary as I said on the phone so thank you very much into the submission for coming on speak to it this morning certainly great to hear from you and particularly thanks for your kind words at the beginning of your presentation this morning thank you mr. questions Phil thanks mark can I just ask you like with your concern about the provincial chain buildings and because like they were as provincial council chambers buildings they were like a Regional in fact it 's a nation it 's important to the whole of whole country historically and that some application pressured made to be made to government to fund this important building I would it 's my understanding looking it I can 't sit here to zones policy but the government is right on buildings on the canopy region I mean I notice they 've got its importance Cathedral won 't in the wouldn 't agree so that a number of the buildings which they 're funding and I don 't think it 's unreasonable to come to an arrangement with the government my understand that the land is vested in dark and the council 's miss other lands God 's got the land and the buildings are vested with the council so I would I think a partnership is not unreasonable it is it internationally it 's a June it 's an internationally significant building so I wouldn 't think it 's unreasonable making approach to government yonni um thank you did you have any comment on our levels of service and stopping doing any work on new heritage because we 've got independent Hearing Panel it 's just finally finished at the process of buildings working its way through and since 1996 I can 't recall any there were these two calls for lists for buildings were nominated for listing and it didn 't happen just to eventuate so we 've got quite a bit of ketchup but having said that I acknowledge the heritage team is flat-out dealing with the thing with the hip district plan review which has just been completed at end going with heritage bowling owners now from a day-to-day basis and they go through their workloads phenomenal right so in terms of the budget you-you-you think we shouldn 't put resource into doing I think we should I think we 're doing catch-up mode yeah but we 're cognizant the fact of council 's under financial strain you know there 's a lot you 've got an ambitious program going through for what is a petite City and a big event by international standards but yes of course would welcome rules are more protection because there are there are buildings that do not 's varietals I can 't name some but there are out there and I think it 's important so I would yes I would can mean that but I 'm realistic because I 've got the provincial council building other buildings which are real and and need to be read to be repeated and restored any further questions mark thank you once again for joining us thank you for you submission thank you so we now move to a presentation 3.1.3 a presentation from Lynn Myers from the packaging forum this is in response to a resolution passed by Council on the 6th of April now we 've set aside a maximum of half an hour for this presentation and then if you 're able to leave some time for questions that possibly would be useful as well so thank you very much indeed for joining us and we 're um yep looking forward to the presentation thank you I get up now to went to present I 'm just so relieved that the the screen doesn 't have my body weight and age on it I started Olympic weightlifting world masters Games and it 's frightening when you stand up they 're expecting a year of birth and your body weight there 's two things as a woman that you don 't tell anybody and so thank you anyway I 'm deputy mayor and councillors to seeing me today and I met with the mayor at the zone five and six Local Government New Zealand meeting and she asked me to present to the council how the packaging form and what it is is working to support councils and communities and Industry around waste management let 's hope I 'm going the right way with this I don 't hang on there we go so the packaging form was established in 2004 to tackle a problem caused because too much glass was collected with load enough uses for it so the forum now operates to volunteer public stewardship schemes which have received accreditation under the waste act one for glass and one for public place recycling and a third scheme for soft plastic packaging and we plan to submit for credit ation this year with 200 members who pay 'll use to fund council and community projects so in 2016 we allocated just short of 1 million dollars on infrastructure and programs to increase recycling in communities our role is quite simple we seek cost-effective end-of-life uses their solutions for packaging and I 'll briefly outline some of our activities so in 2015 we introduced a drop off recycling system for soft plastic packaging this means these materials can now be recycled as I mentioned we 're established to find a temporary solution to support glass recycling and the roll is just as important today this year in fact this month were about to launch a national litter campaign and from a very general to the very specific will be releasing next week a guide for where coffee cups can be composted and we 're working on an industry agreed logo to identify compostable cups since we launched in Auckland in November 2015 around 50 million plastic bags and wrappers have been dropped off at 300 stores in Auckland Canterbury Waikato Wellington in Queenstown now this was initiated with a 700,000 waste fund grant but it wouldn 't have it so if you 're having no industry funding to start off with to collect soft plastics will match funded the government 's contribution in year one and will be a hundred percent funding the program by the end of 2018 we launched the programme encounter be in tune to that last year and at 51 stores in the region since then we 've collected 15 tons of materials which is around three point seven five million bags units the best performing store in Christchurch is New World Sint Maartens whose customers have dropped off 1.3 tonnes of soft plastics so there on the screen you can see the stores where we 're operating and the chart there is the is the monthly bag collection it sort of varies because you 've got four week months and five week months around 1.5 billion bags are used nationally every year this is across the whole range of soft plastic packaging so it 's undeniably a lot of bags but manufacturers choose soft plastic to that toilet well biscuits confectionery bread etcetera because it 's lightweight Cybil and it protects and preserves it 's not adding weight last year we made a small start to recycle them 1.7 percent in our first year this year will recycle around 300 tons based on our current performance but I continue to be amazed by how well consumers are responding so it may not be more than that conservatively our suggests will reach 11 percent recycling rate by 2020 this is a snapshot of soft plastic recycling current numbers are 190 tons collected so far but how do we make a real step change we 'll need to create a market for the products produced than the materials what we 'd like from local government is to support the procurement of products made from recycled materials so that we have a market for the Ballards benches and decking they produce that 'll create a circular economy here in New Zealand without as needing to ship the bales to to Melbourne the glass packaging forum was established to help increase scratch to cover e by identifying alternative uses for collected glass our role today is to support the cover of quality glass suitable to be made well as to support local glass recycling uses last year 73% of glass was recycled our internal target is to help get the recycling rate to 78 percent by 2020 and 82 percent by 2020 for how does 73 percent stack up internationally well as you can see from this slide we are shown in black of course and we 're right in the middle there and our glass recycling rate is consistent with the EU average it 's the same as the EU average in fact you can see the Australian rate in yellow right down at the bottom and it 's particular and of particular interest South Australia where there 's been a container deposit system for 30 years it 's at 79% 60% ahead of us but within our sites we know that here in South Island of a particular problems to address with regards to glass collection the main market for glass is a tower in Auckland and this clearly presents logistical challenges we operate a glass fund which assists communities with infrastructure where particular came to support projects which allow ratepayers to separate their glass glass is of high quality and can be processed into new glass containers which is the optimum recycling outcome but why this isn 't feasible we support developing specifications and systems for alternative uses for the glass such as filtration concrete sand for golf bunkers insulation systems and a new DB beer bottle sand initiative we 've recently invested in a hub in Christchurch to allow glass to be collected for shipment to Auckland and work is underway to identify an economic solution for the South Island in terms of logistics poster kaikoura earthquake this may be another hub for groups of communities over the past decade the the glass packaging forum has invested 1 million in cellphone and infrastructure projects to increase and improve glass recovery that 's just over half of the glass forms total capital expenditure investment the regions in blue are where funding has been received and around the quarter of a million has been spent in Christchurch this finding excludes half a million allocated to help fund glass recycling at events and investment in education and consumer awareness last year local government New Zealand supported systems from an industry perspective and bhavati also include the major recyclers a container deposit system would create a problem rather than solve it it would have 7 to 10 million dollars a year to the cost of recycling by creating a separate drop-off system on top of the existing curbside collection and you might say that industry would bear the cost or the consumer but if all beverage containers were removed from curbside collections because consumers took them back to bottle drop-off points councils would still need to provide curbside collections for the two-thirds of recyclables which aren 't drinks containers and the recyclers tell us it will impact their business because they 'll lose good recycling revenue from the cans and glass supporters of container deposits also say it will reduce litter but drinks bottles make up 11% of total litter nationally and yes it will increase recycling but over 69 percent of all beverage containers are recycled now compared to 76% in South Australia where there 's been a container deposit system since 1975 so container deposit systems aren 't going to provide the Silver Bullet and to pay a bottle charge and if they 're charged with 10 cents plus a handling fee of the--of 3.5 cents only 10% are prepared to pay this this is of course a contentious issue but I 've asked you to take a read of kurvix economic impact assessment which outlines the costs and where they fall we commissioned the first national litter survey in over a decade in 2015 it was a massive undertaking almost 19,000 items the visible litter were counted in an earlier equivalent to the size of 2000 sections the development of the methodology in the survey were carried out by specialist waste consultancy waste not the methodology based on surveys from around the world there were four elements to the surveys the litter field count involved the counting and classifying of loose litter at 300 tons acts in 8 urban areas representing 52% of the population including to Christchurch a small it account of smaller items smelled in the bottle cap thirdly a subjective assessment of the amount of litter on our streets and finally an audit of collected litter by brand which I found and I 've also included there for your information the Christchurch results an average of 32 items of litter were found per thousand square meters surveyed nationally industrial areas and arterial roads contain the highest number of little items whereas car parks and waterside walkways contain the fewest in Christchurch however 21.6 items of litter were found per thousand square meters with packaging litter representing 54 percent of visible litter looking at the top 10 little items found in christchurch paper is at the top so this category includes receipts of this paper mail photographs and building paper unclassified packaging is next and this includes paper bags not used for food or drink packaging plastic bags not use for shopping foam packaging and packaging tape then there 's snack food packaging which is obvious and disposable cups are the largest categories of packaging litter so national snapshot of litter nationally eighty-seven percent of streets and public places were virtually or mostly free of visible litter so whilst this is a great result it merely indicates that councils and communities are providing effective clean up working with councils we 've identified places around 500 grams of packaging litter per thousand square metres is picked up annually at a cost of 14 million dollars on top of this it costs thirty two million dollars to empty public place recycling and litter bins so looking at Christchurch as a snapshot in Christchurch the litter snapshot has a different profile as I 've said to the national average 22 items of litter per thousand square meters and 54 percent of litter is packaging related in a qualitative assessment of the transics assessed 49 percent of sites were graded a for cleanliness with most litter found on arterial and rural roads a game less likely indicates that rather than Christchurch residents not littering councils doing a great job of cleaning up there 's no point in counting litter at a large cost if you don 't do something about it waste not counted 808 named brands in the branded litter survey the top 100 brands make up 70% of packaging litter the good news is that thanks to conducting this litter survey we now have 71% of those litter brands as our members 70% of been so whilst we can 't have bins every 10 metres we can invest in better bins which have smart technology and our compact systems to reduce the cost of servicing this is particularly important in rural and high tourist areas so we 're going to be running trials in regions Bing Bing Bing for structure together with behavioural change and marketing campaigns we 've just selected an advertising agency to develop consumer awareness campaign which will link the gov slub new zealand recycling brand with a revitalized viet ID kiwi and which can also support the keep New Zealand beautiful brand so we can all get behind one campaign and the campaign will be delivered through national and local media using the marketing power of our members and we hope as well councils we 're also wet the New Zealand Transport who sit on our working group and we 're looking at how we might partner with key loads so that the cost of cleanup could be borne by industry you can tell how long it takes to eat a Big Mac by where the box is thrown out afraid to tackle more specific issues for example coffee cups 295 million disposable coffee and cold cups consumed in New Zealand every year these are split between traditional paper and plastic lined and compostable paper and PLA lined cups so last year we set up a project working group with 90 percent of the industry engaged in it to identify compost facilities which take PLA cups determine if there 's an overseas market for the paper and plastic cups and to a time agreeing identification logo for cups with manufacturers and brand owners so this work is going to be published this month we 're growing rapidly we 're adding 2 to 3 new members of the packaging form every month research is critical to provide evidence-based solutions which are cost effective whether it be about litter the availability of composting facilities or the costs of container deposits recycling rates are going up 73 percent of glass bottles of recycled and over 69% of all drinks containers a new PT wash plant opening in the hut later this year will close the loop in New Zealand for PT plastics through number of recycling bins so they 'll match up to the rubbish bins providing people with the opportunity to do the right thing we 've introduced soft plastic recycling which means that now around 70% of all packaging can be recycled research shows people don 't want to pay more for the food and groceries people pull them for 10 cents on the drinks container I 've also asking for 10 cents on coffee cups and an all plastic packaging and putting a charge on drinks containers won 't solve litter and it will damage the recycling industry so in conclusion we want to partner with you to help fund projects which increase recycling and help reduce litter so happy to take some questions great thank you very much so Pauline and then our statistic thinks that presentation you could and I personally find rubbish fascinating and as I 'm sure you do to click pictures of bins every word really so this is my question to you that I mean council had a rationale to reduce films to reduce our cost of taking responsibility for other people 's rubbish claiming that it 's inconvenient and it 's also contributing to more litter around the streets and as you just said people are reluctant to walk more than 10 meters to a bun so do you think that it would be better for council to put in more buns create perhaps not every reader preps and parks and public realm places what we 're going to be running through this this project that we 're just about to get going is piloting some smart technology bins so these are bins which will actually tell you when they need empty we 've got one yeah and there are also some compactor bins as well which do work in some places and not in others but we wanted to actually trial also things like packing pack out where you don 't have bins and we know in the department the conservation lands typically not bins there we find that if you if you can if people have to access an egress through one route you don 't need to put a bin there because you can you can actually ask people to if for example a long ass way the beach or road where people have got multiple ways of getting in then they 'll just drop the litter and they they haven 't got the that they need the messaging so what we 're planning on doing is is running more tiles and then producing guidelines the other piece around it is what we call bin for structure which are they know the type of bins were putting in and typically we 've had an I think you 've probably had it yourself every council does you you know the bins have been selected on how they look which is great but if they not necessarily beam the bins and most pragmatical practical for use so we also want to trial your different styles of bins but also the signage on the bins to see if we can you know we cannot actually get people to use them correctly so I think it is there 's a mix of areas where we would take bins out where we don 't think we need them where we think we can train people people just frankly we will will drop litter or or you know won 't recycle that on our surveys what we found is nationally there is one recycling bin to every six litter bins so what we 'd like to do is marry those up so that there 's you know there might be three three litter bins and three recycling bins right thank you Thank You Allen you thank you for that it was a notice of motion that failed about five years ago put through by myself but thanks for the support and would you support Christchurch being the world 's first straw free City I 've got four questions they 're quite quite stuffy yeah classics drawers gone just use paper recycle interesting because that came out I think of an American survey where they actually identified that in doing the litter studies they actually collected the litter and they found I think it 's a Taco Bell that the two things that they found were stores and the sachets and in actually removing them they did address litter so I think there is it there is why we want to work with our members because here we 've got this to say we 've got 71% of the top 100 litter Burns 's are members and we 're working with them because we actually believe they 're the ones that can help us promote to them to their consumers their customers and also actually activate change yeah because a lot of them eventually make it to the ocean then my next one would be on your thousand square meter counts in the I noticed there was no cigarette butts on there were they not count it because I couldn 't find the thousand square meters without one and they were counted a small litter so we actually did a separate small litter survey and the top three items I 've got a litter I can plus you one of these which actually does give the detail the smaller to count the highest was actually glass fragments because that 's when a bottle breaks it goes into smithereens and unless it 's cleaned it will stay there forever because it 's inert the next one was cigarette those everywhere we counted those in two sites because we wanted I mean up there huge so that the litter that you saw was actually the the visible litter okay being my other one is around the container deposit scheme and shouldn 't there be a levy on all packaging that pays for the recycling recovery disposal of that packaging or the damage that that packaging does for the environment so it becomes cost neutral to councils or governments because it 's just factored in if you pick it to shoot in your effort it 's got fifteen cents or whatever the cost is and some may be hive it should that not be attached I think it 's that balance between what does it cost to do that and what the cost to the the consumer world consumers as well as ratepayers so if we actually ended up paying that fifteen cents on every single item that we bought I think we 'd start complaining about our shopping and I 've just come back from the UK and I can 't believe how much we pay for shopping here that balance I mean typically where they 've had container deposits it it 's been around drinks containers but I you 're right in saying that you know in observing the fact that drinks containers used to be all that we recycle because that was all we did we actually knew you know if you ask people what they can recycle I think numbers ninety-seven percent of people know they can recycle the drinks bottle and they know they can recycle a glass bottle and an aluminium can they 're not so sure about other stuff but now but actually as say about 70% of packaging is now recyclable and so when you look at your your recycling bin at home it contains up you know you contains boxes and you know cans and packaging and and so if you took the junks containers out you 've still got two-thirds of recycling that needs to be collected so I think the drinks container having it having a attacks or bottle tax on the drinks container doesn 't solve the issue now having a tax on all containers I think would rubbish maybe like literally I mean there isn 't we buying rubbish and their final one is the glass recycling and that comparison between South Australia who have the bottle deposit so they wash their bottles and then reuse them I 'm assuming no so they don 't need a smashing art no no in South Australia they yeah they bring them back then that they 're not be used so it 's not a reusable scene it 's it 's a it 's it 's a you take your bottle back and you get your 0.10 back but that bottle is still the cycled it doesn 't it 's not reused right okay because when I was a child last century will you talk back beer bottles coke bottles and we saw the factory tour and they clean them all why do we not do that now as a society it 's because I mean of consumerism effectively because if you think about the way I mean I as I said I 'm just back from from the UK and my mum that 's opposite of dirty and she very annoying actually it is when you live there that they they get reused but that 's a single area and it 's they all go back to the same point if you think about how we buy things now you might buy a a wine bottle here and it goes you know it might be made in might be produced in Marber and it 'll be drank in Auckland to get that you know to move that bottle back to the same producer and every bottle is different every can is different because brands have actually used that as part of their their marketing so any look at a wine bottle of all different and look at the billable they 're all different so our society has moved on so you 'd actually if you would be using them you 'd have to have some sort of system where they will be passivated with their owners and whilst that might be might be ideal that we do that it 's just you know life 's moved on and it 's not practical anymore thank you so I 've now we 've got time for let 's see how we go so Glen okay thank you Thank You Lynn Ross is just behind us solid waste manager so he could you can have a chat yes you don 't it just a couple of questions on plastic have you done a lot of work on plastic and waterways you want your nut as you know it 's we have a an annual we call it a mother of all cleanups of our two big rivers and we find plastic as a big feature it since it 's terrible and it 's getting into there the food chain so Lynn Weaver we do work with and we know we will be partnering through this little program with sustainable coastlines who obviously do a lot in that space we 've our focus actually is around you know sort of trying to get the plastic packaging back less around the plastic shopping bag I mean I never use them myself I always have a reusable bag so I do understand that plastic bags in particular will flirt up and you know sort of shouldn 't however the packaging that I 've been focused on around the plastic packaging has been the things that people really have to use bread bags frozen food bags if you think about the don 't go into a supermarket with a bucket and collect you know our bread and our frozen food and and you know all the other stuff we actually comes packaging it packaged and so that has been put my focus with the soft plastic program and that 's really about I 'd say about 5 but about 50% of what we collect through that program is branded packaging and we do trace that back so we are preparing we 're just preparing an audit now which will be on the past six months of what 's been collected so it probably doesn 't answer your question around in how do we stop that getting into the into the waterways hopefully our litter program and the work we 're doing around that we 'll start addressing that but it what my focus has been on finding an end-of-life use of something that was just going question on the plastic apparently there is a plant or plants in Australia that can fit play stick into molded children 's playground equipment do you think the New Zealand market would be big enough to that 's what we hear that 's the one we 're using there 's the one you use so yeah so at the moment we are shipping all of our plastic to Melbourne the reason we 're doing it and we did investigate whether whether they were markets here for it but because what we collect is we 're making the message very simple for the consumer basically our messages if you can scrunch it up in a ball you can put it in our bin which means it will take the LDPE the HDPE the polypropylene an unloving it 's so it 'll take chip packets and ice cream wrappers and all the stuff what we found here was that our recyclers wanted it by stream and I don 't think that the consumer understands what one piece of plastic from another and so we 've made the message very simple so there ship it over there and that 's the message that I 'd like to say that these products they actually cost no more than any other product so you can buy bollards you can buy the traffic silences for the road you know sleeping policeman type things um we 've got park benches a whole range of stuff decking and you know if we can start creating that demand for that product here rather than buying the virgin products then we can get that plant here in New Zealand cuz they don 't cost much to have here they just need to have a demand that says our market will sustain it so we 'd really appreciated if council can give some yes some support to that and that 's all the reasons we 're working with a transport people as well because they buy a lot of bollards alright thank you sir thank you she just following on from it with a soft plastics recycling I was really pleased to see it initially and I think I 've boosted some atoms and it 's we take ours in this there yes so for example countdown fury made had to carry your play stick bags all the way around with you to the en past the checkout and then put them in a little thing that 's not really labeled hmm are you going to be rolling at those those big bins that you put your stuff into all of the supermarkets and things countdown have come on board now and they should have the big bins because we actually design those big bins so the transparent huge yeah beginning when you first walk in yes and they should some stores do put them in different places our aim is to get them so that they are obvious when you walk in so you 're not tripping around with all you all your plastic packaging but they 're now in all countdown all new world or PAK 'nSAVE all the warehouse in in the regions that were in we 're launching and Dunedin in a couple of weeks time so they 'll have them there then and then we 've also got other stores like a little lemon and Kathmandu house at the back of the store so they 're not providing them to their shoppers but they 're using them because all less stuff comes in in poly bags so they 're using the program as well and all of these all of these stores and all of the brands that you know will not all other brands but we 're working on all the bans button but you know the major brands are funding it so I go to them and I say I want money off you basically so my role is to go to industry you 'd love me doing this I go to industry and I tap them up for money and that 's what we use to run these programs yeah really good for those especially you know you get your frozen peas you bread bag that kind of stuff but with the plastic bags I mean if a new survey which shows that sort of 3 of New Zealanders are actually came for a BB on plastic bags are your support of a bit we to be perfectly honest that 's something for our supermarkets are fairly agnostic about adavi tell us now I think they have all gone through this it 's been years yeah in in discussion they can 't in a knob themselves do it on their own because where they have done this in the most recent is an example and I don 't think you have Pharaoh fresh here in Christchurch but Pharaoh fresh in Auckland introduced a charge last year the year before and they 've got four stores and they 're actually high-end market you know shopping markets you think people that pay for them they had to stop because people were walking out of the store they wouldn 't pay so the supermarket level playing field it has to all happen at once although the new service is only 8% of people would move somewhere else if they supermarket well charging but if you 've got a level playing field the little a built yeah yeah yeah thank you and then finally Viki well two questions boosts the one about the plastics which was really interesting about getting it here how many councils would you price in order to make it happen and how public don 't really know the answer to that but I don 't think it would be a lot I don 't think it would be that many because I think we all buy a lot or you know people buy a lot of things like bollards and traffic cones and probably not so much benches but you know that sort of traffic stuff people are buying all the time so if you make traffic cones out of it so they can make get all those to the stuff so I try to do some work on that on the number so I can get back to Vicki if that 's okay that would be yes and the second one the coffee cats we know you 're expecting to have done the work that you 've outlined here and does the the PLA and the coffee cups require a much higher heat forward decomposition right the the the research that we 've been doing and it 's a company called beyond the bin that have done it I 've done it that the next couple of weeks so that says where the various facilities are country and what they will and won 't take some we 're happy to be named some didn 't want to be named but we 've got that research and the the the different types of compost facilities determine what they can and can 't take there is some real research going on now with some of the coffee cup manufacturers around the lids and whether they can change because the lids or see PLA which is a different type of PLA and that seems to be the problem not the PLA so there 's some work going on there to try and improve that the other piece of it is we 've been working with the recyclers because recyclers used to be able to tell some of them used to be able to take the plastic and peel at the plastic and paper cups but then particular this was in Auckland but then with the range of compostable cups and nobody knew what cup they had so it contaminated the whole thing and I could we 're now at is determining whether if we can clearly label one cup from another and commercially compostable on one cup and not on the other whether or not we that would create new markets we don 't know the answer to that yet great thank thank you very much indeed for the presentation it was great with your latest type of questions can I ask that you send a copy of the presentation the visual presentations through to staff and then because I think there 's there 's a lot more conversation in consideration we could have here yeah and I 'm quite keen that we refer this to the appropriate committee so that further work can be done yes so a better presentation I think if you 're able to send that through that 's great yeah thank you thank you Jonnie probably also just um maybe just note to get a briefing when that coffee cup takeaway cut information comes back because I think it may be quite good for us to look at what we can do all right so if we 're referring this sorry if the issue committee last meeting we actually move that the staff bring a report on the coffee cup thing in Italy the standardized potential for standardised labeling so it sounds like lens doing a lot of that work for us so beauty 's kind of over there I was still on or thinking like a procurement like when we 're doing what leases and cafes and stuff like we could actually a lot of stay over so we crystal early so we can have some confidence that when he considers that when it comes back you 'll take into account matters that Yanni 's raising and obviously there 's this resolution we 've got in front of us now that if this carries it 'll join up with that work as well I would say so um thank you very much indeed Ernest some great to have you with us this morning so we 've got a resolution here that essentially refers and the message raised in the presentation to the appropriate committee which is likely to be eating and thanks the packaging forum for their presentations on Pauline or in favor against let 's carry that 's great _"

    "text": "the only other item is item number 16 central city regeneration tech link various sites and I 'm going to vacate the chair and leave I 'm going on it I 'm going on a road trip to work ok ok so now that we 've had the change of shift at the this table we will kick on so um staff welcomes the table was there any commentary that you wanted to make on this report before we move into questions relate to the pin can you hear me yep sorry was I maybe I was covering that up is is that the reports are identifies a framework and a pathway for resolution that staff have pulled together staff from across the organization who pull together and that the the report identifies that we will work on a case-by-case basis with landowners building owners focusing initially on the Central City but noting in the report that are in overtime and we may look at other parts of the city but that framework that resolution pathway in the case-by-case approach is how staff intends to work so that probably for points and the report great thank you very much so when I move into questions Dion um from the deputation this morning in a couple of conversations that I 've had with some of the the people that are on day and I don 't want to focus on the list which is why I want to talk about it to start with because it 's not about it shouldn 't be about that list it should be about the process but is it possible because obviously we have to have unless the so we are can understand is it possible to have potentially two separate lists of some sort so one is about those hours in those buildings people whatever that we know of that a probably local that we 're working with closely we they have a resolution and mine they 're actually getting on and doing the work and then the other one which is around the that the the more harder ones that we actually can 't work with or haven 't actually got an understanding of where they 're going next and so people I for consideration today are up on the screen there so I just draw your teaching too and the lists that you didn 't want to meet you in counselor and doesn 't part of the resolution that we 're seeking today so and as Caroline said what we 're proposing to you in for your decision is a framework for how the cancer organization can approach can approach and the revitalization of the central city so and the central city has a number of buildings within it and that we all know and are been Tina 's various sites but out of the context of many thousands of buildings so staff needs some guidance on how to prioritize in manage within our workload where we 're going to focus the initial attention so we intentionally haven 't provided the list as part of the paper and the reasons why I articulated in the paper a city like this list will be a living document so it 's different to her it was and today then how it was yesterday and it will be different today so if your light reflects and the decisions being sought from Council are about the framework not about the less per se and I think that 's good advice and timely advice at this stage as we get into this item the decision this afternoon as Brendon has said is about the framework and not about the content of any list of buildings yes I know the framework is the decision that we 're making this afternoon and Glen thank you have you just under 5.5 h1 a5 and it I 've never seen a report with the word tackling in it so it 's quite best name but 5.5 it talks about insurance do you know approximately what percentage are unresolved insurance claims that approximately just a rough round figure around around a quarter of the sites I caught up yeah Yani thank you um just I guess wanted to get a bit more context there 's been comments that we 're declaring war and I just wanted to get a bit more context from you in terms of how you saw this approach if you see it as being that intimidating that sort terms of the approach will be more collaborative and engaged but point of order mr. Chi I don 't think it 's appropriate for a counselor to question a comment that a counselor made at an our staff to justify that I was asking about the approach you 're asking you 're asking the comments that I made yeah Zane is happy to answer the question but Brendon in doing so obviously answer those parts of the question that you feel irrelevant if there 's anything that you feel isn 't appropriate then feel free not to answer that part of the question sure so we 've been guided by the development forum in the street capability committee who were both briefed as we develop at this approach in both of those two council subcommittees have been very clear that what they wanted to see was an approach that both and supported in its in devised those developers and but also sought to fearly apply the existing regulatory framework and then thirdly sought to make sure that council had the full range of existing tools available in for those and would step through that three-step approach so as the diagram on page hundred and eighty six illustrates and the the staff recommendation is a three-step approach dialogue support incentivizes the first secondly add pressure food enforcement and regulation so I think this first aside at the staff recommendation is that we use that framework and I 'm aware that people have commented on it but those those in kind of types of comments and part of the staffer voice and we 've played a pretty Strait bed about and what the framework is getting just the second question in terms of my reading of the report is that we 've actually got the existing tools so I just wondering why we haven 't used those tools up until now or what the difference will be in terms of applying those tools in this framework so I think that up until the the changes in the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act and the and I guess the kind of view of the city moving from recovery to regeneration meaning of these sites were under the management of of Sarah and so it the information to kind of develop that the framework and toolbox and understand the situation and bring this to you now in to some degree prompted by why the calls from the development forum to perhaps give this a little bit more of a focus is the city moves more positively into that regeneration phase right so in just a final question from me was um there had also been requests previously around dealing with vacant derelict sections and the suburbs and and also I guess possibly some as as where as properties that have been subject to quite severe vandalism what what process do you see that the community would have in terms of raising those sorts of concerns around how to get action on those buildings that have set you know all those sections that have set you know and quite a what might be considered quite a dangerous stay well I am I 'm we don 't have colleagues from the the building control part of the organization here with us today but I they have particular toolboxes in processes that they would go through so they so people could use those that already exist to make those sites known to the organization and then they can be triaged through those processes to understand those situations sorry just so I 'm clear so the process is we raise it through community board and through staff and then you put it into the framework well just caution that your example of gravel car parks and of course a permitted activity under at tipper accommodation order and counsel that exists currently through to 2021 so and ability to take a regulatory action is within the legal framework so we 're not seeking and have not up to now sort and changes to and prevent things that are currently legally able to do even though people might view a gravel car park as offensive will poor use of leaned and it 's not you know I 'm committed but we 've got a vacant half that 's been vandalized for five years you know got all the windows smashed is boarded up but full of graffiti houses are being burnt you know in some and some suburbs people are really manager so I think those are excellent examples end and there are a variety of existing legislative approaches that we can take fit and sanitary type and homes or and buildings and from your description that would probably be spent under unsanitary and buildings Thank You Phil thank you and listen clearly this is around the framework which we 've got and it 's clear an attachment one for us but this morning you might recall we had deputation in effect which said look they the people felt or the owners felt they were doing it their best by the city and that they would have liked that kind of knowledge but also I guess the list of the receiver weren 't happy with so clearly in the framework there 's a case management approach can can we get ever surance and in fact that 's what 's going to be followed from now on absolutely that [Music] ignore that it 's absolutely that that 's what would will be followed and in fact has been applied to sites up till now and I 'd also note that that there the framework and the case management approach where in the past councils already provided support through Heritage incentive grants and I 'd note true that the hoardings rebate in the and the rates rebate fourteen pre activation is also available for landowners to take advantage of in this process Mike thank you um so I guess before these buildings is quite a wide range of of buildings and potentially local owners and overseas owners owners are actually trying to get stuff done and and sumit are there any owners that were actually we can 't contact that we 're aware of those who are doing that from tech tip you know one or two which we 've been calling it hold on but in terms of overseas owners there 's actually one on the list so there are largely all locally owned or that the new zealand owned so when we look at this framework with the approach of going carat to this stick obviously if we can get hold of some of these owners these we 've got the tools and here to go straight to this step and it so is noted in that in the resolutions um we would we would report but because they 've met they 're clearly using a stick is a is it 's the it 's the last step and the process so we 're noting beer that we would bring a report back to council where that was proposed because there and they could be financial and other implications for council and and clearly you would want to know that before staff in end proves or agree to bit before staff chop their action and I very much endorse this actually because I think um we are often negatively impacted by what we see in the central city and I think a lot of the community have been feeling really disempowered by the state of things and I think action like this is very positive and I think it really would build a sense of hope in many cases so I 'm very much in favor of your work with us okay noting that we 're still in questions are there any further are there any further questions for staff on was a question the question is how do you think the state of that Central City gonna sit me in to help me to help me you got a good save well done I hadn 't quite finished so I 'm actually interesting that you ask that question I 've just seen a report from the United Kingdom there actually is indicating bit fear there that the city has a big impact on people 's mental health I suspect this is a new area and in that in that line of study so I 'm watching with interest what 's what what research is coming out from other cities okay great thank you very much now Jamie you 're happy to move this do we have a seconder deal great so now moving into debate Pauline I 'll really quickly look like I support this entirely because I know that it 's a it 's full of carrots I know they 're it 's really a Council 's trying to really be no no front footing this and I I agree with in I think that has a huge impact think it 's a way of actually honoring and respecting what has been done in the Central City and the challenges that the developers who are building and going ahead and getting these things open have faced and overcome and that 's being brought down by what 's surrounding them so we just want to lift the whole thing that 's the idea and to go into the city is just incredible it 's getting better every day so this will actually add oops to that so I 'm very thank you for getting us together it 's wonderful great Thank You Glenn thank you having been on the regulatory performance committees beginning I fully support the Veda proach so that 's that kind of spectrum moving from characterstic I think it actually gives some owners the chance to save face and say hypothetically the cathedral was on the list then that gives them a chance to find a way out before they really have to face up to their pastoral responsibilities and show some leadership another thing that I note is that if insurance of which which comprises 25% a council in terms of promoting an insurance tribunal concept have been applied to commercial insurance that could have helped resolution way back then and we wouldn 't be in this place so that that is a pretty anyway I support this I think it 's good that the kind of agendas out there now it 's declared so we 'll start off softly but if you don 't start fronting up the Weisse is going to be wound up and yeah I support them yonni thank you um I just wanted to move an amendment um based on the deputation that we had which requested that we remove 25 Peterborough and 91 Victoria Street off the list and we 've also had an email around that 's another one and it 's not about the list it 's about the framework we 've had it disregarded later deputation from people so do we just not respond like what 's the program this is a living less than sort like how do you want me to respond to the deputation because I 'm really keen to listen and respond to response to that would be that the new addition or recommendations recommendation for and recommendation five actually address a number of issues that we heard in the deputation this morning and also some of the commentary that we 're aware that some taken place on the letter since they were sent out we are very aware that there are building owners who received those letters who are taking every best endeavor to repair their buildings some of those buildings are actively under repair and they 've got finished dates which are later in the year this year there are other buildings where the building owners are actively working with their insurers and and there are all sorts of frustrating situations around insurance heritage finances you know all sorts of intractable issues that building that owners are working on to get to a point where there 's a final outcome for that building whether it 's repair or whether it 's otherwise we need to do everything we possibly can to support those building owners and the acknowledgments in paragraph four and five I think do that along with acknowledging a that we heard this morning and have been raised informally by other building owners since the letters were sent out so my own belief is that paragraphs four and five resolutions four and five actually address quite possibly the issues that you 're seeking to raise without the need to move into a discussion about the list because actually that 's not what this afternoon 's decision-making in discussions about right okay so in terms of the direction from this report in terms of the 30 we 're still saying to staff get on and address those thirty so I mean we 're not reducing that to 26 or 27 and saying actually the ones we know people are doing work on okay but actually the 27 that no one 's doing work on the other ones that were going to focus on so what we 're saying is I understand it is that there are 30 buildings on this list this is a living list and it 's subject to change the list may well be different tomorrow than it is today and we 're acknowledging that there are resolved and haven 't_''_1254.789 been resolved and there are other buildings where there are issues like for example encroachment of barriers onto pavements where those barriers of for a very good and necessary reason and need to be there to assist the building owner in completing the works on their building I 'd like to think RS four and five give us a strong steer to staff that any conversation working with building owners or subsequent action will be appropriate to the building concerned and the situation that the building owners in and I think the discussion that we just had now makes that clear but I think the resolutions four and five also make that very clear as well okay so I 'll speak and support I think it 's really positive that we 're doing getting a framework I think you know it certainly has not just been requested around the central city and I just want to stress that you know even last term council pull-on style and myself were very um very assertive over the need to try and do something with some of the suburban where as buildings or places that are quite quite vandalized in derelict that do need attention we have existing powers so I think it 's a case of using those powers wisely but also understanding what people are going through I know in the past when I 've followed up with staff on specific buildings that the community have raised concern about one of the responses has been that those these people are stuck with dealing with insurance matters and I in no way want to add further stress on people that are dealing with a very stressful situation of dealing with the insurance companies and in the way in which people have been treated in our city and I think my colleague made reference to that earlier that you know I do think issues around insurance advocacy are one of the biggest gaps and possibly one of the best solutions so I hope as we move through this framework we can be mindful of if we do need additional resources and support going in there then we should be looking at that or maybe advocating to central government to that this is seen as a cooperative approach with the building owners not not a punitive one unless all else has failed so you know I am concerned about some of the perception of what this will do and I just think we should be incredibly grateful to those who are trying to restore their buildings particularly the heritage buildings I think that 's really positive and we should be working constructively with them I also think that this sends a letter to ourselves I think counsel received letters and we also need to look and reflect on our own buildings that are still sitting there damaged cordoned off fenced off in the Central City and let 's get on and start fixing those buildings because I think it 's pretty ironic that would be asking others to do the same but we wouldn 't be doing that ourselves and the final point I 'll make is that I understand that this won 't be able to be part of this framework but I do think we should think about a framework for construction companies particularly ones that are doing because one of the other issues I think has been that huge delays in some of the roading infrastructure repairs that has created all sorts of problems and issues and would be really good at some stage to think about a framework for people that are doing public works around reasonableness of timeframes and expectations of how long or short some of those projects should be taking compared to what they are because those projects also have had a huge disruption on people and it has you know being very stressful for people in the community to deal with the consequence of those but I appreciate that now it 's not the time to do that thank you Phil thank you and look I think it 's understandable that some people have got the leaders were upset and basically though no one it well there was no favoritism we as council are responsible for fixing our buildings too and I think it 's absolutely clear that in terms of the framework we are starting with the support and incentives and that needs to be understood the and get away before people don 't come to the city because of the awfully unkempt state of these derelict sites and that 's precisely what we asked the staff to do in terms of establishing this framework to a staff of a reminder that in fact there have been a lot of incentives for people of central city already and the hood it the rebates on the cost of the hoardings and rates rebates they 're very clear we often don 't hear back about that but they are incentives which in fact this council have put into place so it 's important that we are very clear and I think we are that phase one is all really around support and incentives so that these changes are made which the public have asked for us to make sure we put into a feed deal I 'll just want to speak in support of us especially from my perspective this is another piece to the puzzle actually firstly I just like to think Carolyn for the work that you have done and your team it 's not being easy I can appreciate that to say thank you publicly to that and um but the big picture here is actually about the the city as a whole recovering from the earthquake and in moving forward in a way that respects the investment that we as a city of putting in that the private developers are putting in the crown that are putting in and actually getting back a sense of actually having a city that we do want to attend and do want to be part of you know this is another part of the link to having the city back that you can come and visit and enjoy you know without the barriers or the emotional dragging down of what we 've seen in the past and you know we 're putting transport infrastructure we 're putting back up parking buildings and you know getting the roads sort of a little bit faster with you know speed up some of the work that will target overdoing and all things like that this is all coming together to get this city back and running and I 'm really looking forward to at the end back in the Central City I actually think it 's going to be a quite a nice place to be will address a lot of the issues around the public realm which is what are why I like the the way that this framework has been pointed because it talks about the public realm the derelict buildings partial uncompleted building sites unkept vacant sites and regrettable car parks all differently and separately so we can address those and each one 's different everybody has a different situation than this recovery and everybody 's situation needs to be identified and worked together and I do want to make sure that the people that are working hard who are investing a lot of money into this aren 't going to be lumped into a into a into being seen as holding down the recovery because some of them do have those problems and will rule to look at that when we do sort of release these what what buildings are which is going to happen eventually we need to make sure that we don 't stigmatize some of those people that are make sure that that doesn 't happen and I 'm sure that we work together to make that happen but again I really am looking at the bigger picture here for the central city it 's a place where we want to work we want to invest and we want people to come and live back and I think that 's going to be a fantastic place and finding Mike oh and Jamie all the movers who will yeah that 's all right so Mike and then Jamie yeah I 'm in support of this I was going to talk but there 's actually been enough councillors talking in support of it and for quite a long time so I went to that one yeah thanks mark all right a lot of it has been said but you know I would like to just touch on what bill said about the the the combination of the sticks and carrots and it 's true we have got incentives there well actually got quite a lot of incentives but there 's a time and a place to bring out the disincentives and that we 're we 're probably at that point and some would argue that we possibly should have hauled out those sticks a little bit earlier this is this is a better framework it 's not about the list that the list has been widely publicized but it 's most certainly living list and I think that that 's a really key point that we need to stress that it 's evolving you know there are a handful of property owners on their list that I 'm going to be pursued you know I think we just need to be really clear that common sense will be applied there are genuine cases of people going through some pretty traumatic insurance wrangles there are people there that are doing the absolute best to do everything they can to make Christchurch a better place and there 's plenty of hurdles there and they are not the people the target of of this this framework so common sense will most certainly be applied and I really do want to stress that but we 've got we 've got a city to rebuild and of some of these absentee landowners were just sitting there and was costing them a bit of money and it was only affecting them but it 's not it 's wider than that it has a detrimental effect everyone else that 's actually trying their utmost to make a go of this it 's really hard to try and sell a beautiful new inner-city apartment to a family when you 've got squatters living next door or you 're looking next door wondering if that derelict sites going to burn down really hard to lease a property as well inside the Central City when you 've got a building that 's um that 's falling down around it so I think I think everything you know that needs to be said has been said and I won 't continues go on about it other than just finally wrap up and say that I support this new framework I genuinely really commend the staff for being so proactive in a space a couple of leaders have gone out to people that they might that they might not have they shouldn 't fine because it means we 're trying stuff we 're actually putting ourselves out there and if you 're not getting something wrong every now and again you 're probably not putting yourself out there or trying so it 's I would far prefer to issue an apology and retract one or two then actually not cast that net as wide and miss a whole host of people that are really taking the mickey out of the city and some of those people arcing on the hands that have been paid out a sizable insurance payout and I 'm over it they 've been holding the city to ransom so let 's let 's be quite open about that and if there 's a bit of stigma associated with with that great so go go for it stuff thank you very much so I think just to sum up we we need to be aware that there are different buildings out there with different issues there are different building owners out there with different issues and there number of buildings that are currently under repair or that are planned to been some difficulties there are other buildings out there where there are building owners that haven 't_''_1925.6 been so proactive and that 's certainly where there is some frustration with the slowness of progress and here we 've got a framework that allows us to support those building owners they 're doing what exactly we and the people of the city would want them to do and it 's also a framework that allows us to do what we need to do to get some movement on those other sites that have been causing frustration so I I welcome this and I 'm now happy to put the motion all those in favor against as carried thank you so we 'll note that that was unanimous thank you okay _"

  },
  {
    "text": "set up the meeting again and you might notice that I 've invited Jake McClaren to join us as the chair of the world Deputy Chair of the of the community board and if you would like to speak to the the paper microphone green button yeah okay good afternoon thank you for inviting me along and this I 'm not going to talk too long on this this was a fun item to cheer a board reached a decision that we are in favor of council going out and consulting on this item of course it wasn 't a unanimous view but it was was the view of the board I wanted to talk mainly about the hearings panel and would there were some discussion and our meeting about their strong community presence on the hearings panel and there was talk of a at least one community board representative on our hearings panel of three and two community board representatives on up hearings panel of five and and it was the preference of the board that there be hearings panel of not it was the it was the majority five with two community board representatives and and we would like to see some representation from non counsel from all new community board members as well so that 's really all I had to say how would you feel about having an under pendant chair you know so that she here that 's got some independence I think that 's the custom and practice with hearings panel I think so of course we would or I personally would support that that I mentioned the board word as well I feel every salvation when you 're trying to announce yes as well and um I mean but I mean obviously we can look around the table for an under pendant chair not from the community board area not looking at anyone different ship dipped in you but the casual but they quit the question as that would it be better to have somebody who 's independent of council together or would it be okay to go to you know is it acceptable that we go down the track of having one of our members who 's not involved in the community the board I can 't answer on behalf of but I I think yeah I don 't know I think it 's just important that there be and then appear somewhat under peanut voice at the chair for to give yeah all right so um so that there are two elements I guess well three one is to resolve to commence the public consultation obligations under the Act the second is to approve the consultation process that set out in the document the theatres to determine the consul composition of an appointed hearings panel and then finally to request staff to provide a further report to the council to accompany the hearings panel report following completion of the consultation process so that the other elements of it the element of of a hearings panel we could leave that till next week of people would prefer that but I certainly would like us to to commence the process in terms of the hearings panel we 've heard from the chair that there 's there 's two two options that they considered and their preference by majority was for a panel of the broker er but in both instances with an independent chair career summary do summary yeah all right so do we have do we have any of the community board or do we want the staff okay yep I 'm we 've talked about it and the pendant chair would you think a commissioner and our Commissioner would help with in curve Basel or tag Idol and it not something we discussed at the board I just don 't know what what what value that would add I 'm not sure than yeah I can answer I got this with the things yeah I think that yeah this is some slightly slightly different from a number of other ones because of the the powers that the Ministry of Education has in relation to the bill it 's true they 're just type of an independent chair it 's really important to get it yep and sorry just to clarify independent being a commissioner or just independent of the ward yeah yeah yeah yeah um well look I mean two people have a strong view of as to whether we need board today on the hearings I 'm sorry I 'm put a color challenger stationary board hey so please no changes to the kid promise I promise I don 't have the power to be there yeah Andrew oh good when I 'm not really sure who I 'm directing this question to it might be to appropriate staff could we today potentially appoint a chair and two councillors and then leave it to the community board to appoint two community board members yes I think you could do that so our decision today could be we appoint such and such a person as the chair or an independent chair we appoint counsel of this and counsel of that and to community board members to be appointed by the community to be recommended by the community board it is appointed nominated by the community yep okay okay it 's fine so can I just check that possibility with Jake what do you think the board could come to a decision around her who the board would like to wear would love 's make a decision have you liked it yep up you 'd like to be on this panel of you I bit yeah so you see more when you 're having a chair so Andrew Turner chair Sara Templeton and who either additional traditional yeah they 're if they 're additional so and who else doing job tom I hope do else would go on a good job David annoy and yannis have had experience with the ministry and qe2 and and local I don 't know mo e so you 're putting your hand up if I can just put it in the time table you okay so Andrews chair Sarah Templeton Glynn Lovingston with the Community Board to nominate the two additional members to the hearings panel that sounds really good but all right so would someone like to move the entire proposition any time frames in it because they 're art I refer and the resolution so I I don 't think that they need to be in the resolution the time frames are relatively tight yeah yeah look okay yet Thomas can dropped seconded by Vicki bat yep right is there any discussion Jonnie yeah Jake do you want to move to one side and we 'll have the staff come to the table far away cool just um just in terms of the consultation document has that been prepared because we don 't the the information that we 've got on the council report compared to the information that was offered by the ministry doesn 't attached anywhere so things like the building locations the initial traffic planning I guess is there is there an overlay of that on what 's going to go up to the community so this is standard council consultation documentation being produced in terms of being able to reference the documents and ministry is making available a link to that website is being put in the council 's consultation information on our website as well so that there 's no confusion around who owns which documentation and to also create an environment for ease of access so so I 've gone on the ministry 's website and trying to find which plan is being referred to is almost impossible it would take someone that knows our closer page the be in place when the consultation starts the ministry are going to establish a location on their on their site where all the documents referred to today will be available for the public to inform metacentric can you just explain in simple terms to us as the decision maker to go out for consultation where the location of the school is going to be and what environmental impacts are foreseen well not the is the ministry city windows deputation earlier the design of the school and the environmental impacts are issues that they will need to work through subsequently they are not issues to be dealt with through this consultation which is solely focused on the land transactions the ministry however are providing that information that they discuss this morning will pray to lunch link will be provided to in our in the council 's documentation or consultation documentation giving the people the public directs intermediate access to that information but those issues are for later and are full before the regeneration next planning process to follow so the second question I have was around the traffic so in the traffic and associated discussions with City Council without intersection improvements etc there 's also reference to some changes I think to the coastal pathway so what discussions that we had around that and how is that I see in the report that we 've been told that there 's no financial implications but actually I would have thought some of those things will have quite significant financial occasion once again those I was like enough even once again those are issues for the regeneration egg process the planning process those are issues that will be dealt with the public would have an opportunity to comment on the council will have an opportunity to comment on later but what we are now consulting on is the lean transit and so those are issues for later so how how do the public how can the public make submissions around the disposal of the reserve if they don 't know what the financial cost is going to be to council you know if we 're gonna have to spend five million dollars an intersection traffic rights roading changes how can they make an get the opportunity to ask those questions when public consultation for the substantive development should council decide to swap effectively the land it 's really important I think that I guess the information that the ministry have provided was really based on the feedback that 's come from the qe2 process and questions from yourself counselor around providing more information they 're not legally required to provide that information that they 've kind of come to the party and understand that people want to see more to help support their their submission should they wish to make one but the questions you 're asking staff are questions for the ministry we 're the ones that are approving this plan to go out for consultation and we don 't have that information that the elected members we 're asking we 're going out to consultation to to consult on our proposal to transfer and swap some land the planning process the design the traffic all those environmental impacts and impacts matters that will be considered and dealt with through the planning process undertaken by the ministry later and simple terms this Kim can that process impose a cost on the council that we don 't agree with no no yes that there no what I was going to say is the report that 's in front of you considers that all of the costs associated to picking the park up from here and putting it over there questions around future costs or risks associated to then building a school over there is is something that the proponent the applicant has to provide the information off so that 's the part that comes later is that I guess that what he 's asking is can the Ministry of Education impose a cost on Christchurch City Council as a result of deciding to rebuild a school there because they don 't pay development movies like other developers so it 's not an unreasonable question to ask us okay um I would expect that if through the planning process there were expenses or do there was money was required to be expended on traffic adjustments or routing adjustments in some way that the ministry would make proposals about how they were to be dealt the is their proposal develops so I 'm at this stage listening to the ministries deputation earlier I mean they haven 't designed the school they only have some very generic high level concepts about how it might work and so the detail will come out through the process yeah of it then it 's it 's feasible that the net result there 's no different tool to the existing school site we just don 't know because okay yeah okay um clean is and I think that 's the thing I mean based on the qe2 experience seems to be it 's just a quick sequential so you proceed what those as kind of property matters but you just don 't know yeah it 's okay it 's right let 's move to where let 's move to debate to motion Jonnie I presume you 're going to say yeah yeah cool so first up additional at the point that I 'm very supportive of Red Cliff school remaining in the Red Cliffs community so you know my concern over this isn 't_''_962.109 whether the school goes here or faced with a lack of detail around what 's actually going to be the implication for the community and if you look at the board pegasus board reporting qe2 they had a lot clearer lines around what land was being proposed to be sold off and what it might be formed now that wasn 't perfect but it but accepting that that one wasn 't sufficient we 've got even less information today I was really heartened to hear the ministry say they will provide that information but I think as elected members we should actually be able to see clearly what the implications are of the proposed disposal of a reserve we should know what the impact is going to be on the traffic this area is very constrained in terms of space without huge issues in terms of the footpath on the other side of the road through Main Road we 've just been a fortune on the coastal pathway and a huge community process around engagement over the design which now could be changed completely because of the proposal of the school we don 't have the clearly cause and submissions around whether they support this or they oppose it because they don 't have the level of detail about what the landscaping is going to be what trees are going if every tree on the front of Main Road all the amenities agitation and trees are clear fouled then maybe the community will be pretty unhappy with that if they see that some of the green area is retained and there 's a nice green entranceway maybe they 'll actually be supportive but that detail just does not exist I don 't believe that the financial obligations that will fall on us will be addressed through the consenting process in fact most developments that we see we 've just had a whole day of hearings into our annual our developers coming and saying bring forward the funding so we can build our developments and not asking us to pay rate payers money to enable their developments to go ahead and you know I can 't see any reason why that won 't be the case for this and it 's not to say that we shouldn 're going to make a decision around disposing of this land what the financial implications are and I do not believe that they will be no so at the moment I 'm happy to support option 3 which is the hearings panel but I do believe that there is insufficient information for us to make a good decision about what the implications are of this proposal given the lack of planet plans that we 've seen from the Ministry of Education and I urge anyone of you to go on the ministry 's website and try and find out what the proposal was in terms of the school it 's incredibly difficult to see that there 's lots of information there but it 's actually very unclear around what 's been proposed specifically and until we get that specific information I don 't think we should be going out for consultation I don 't believe it 's fair to the community Sarah thank you this is bits of what yani says that I agree with and I think that a really fully informed discussion with the community is as essential able to get on with this process is also really really important I 've been waiting a really really long time to go through this process and we need to make sure that we hear everyone 's voice as part of it if we choose not to go for consultation we could either delay it or we could do this without consultation and my preference would be to do it with consultation with a hearings panel to make sure that all of those voices are heard we 'll also need to not confuse the issue and there has been confusion about the difference between the original decision of the minister which was to move the school the current process which is a decision on whether or not to go out to consultation in the form of that and then the next process which is the planning process for the site now the community getting into the currently proposed one for us and also into the ministries planning process and that is clear and the ministry will be consulting the community on the form of that but actually that 's not the ministry are giving more than they have before which is really good I 'm happy to see this through today you know I 'm also happy to see this through I know that we got a letter from the board of the Red Cliff school and they they said to us it would really help the result if we could actually get combined the consultation so that we weren 't just talking about relieving ourselves of the obligations under reserves heck further for the new school site or the proposed school site but also that we would be getting a part back for the people of Red Cliff so that they could see the whole picture are not just part of the picture so I 'm very pleased that people have worked hard to make this happen and I think we 've got a good result on the hearings panel which is engaging for the community board which I also support so I 'll put the motion yes yeah okay well all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried except for so if you three it supports three hearings panel four right okay _"

    "text": "on the agenda is 15 sorry Oh God treble and support of international relations I was hoping to be gone by now banking would you like to just do a quick introduction to this paper peps by referring to what the existing policy is and how this is different from the existing policy I think you made me yes good afternoon everyone the report that has been presented fuel consideration and the preferred lot from there is to for the mayor and the appropriate counselor who will be on the sister city committee the relevant sister city committee to visit specified sister cities over the next three years in the international relations policy that was adopted in October 2013 after public consultation that policy stated that the mayor should travel to every sister city every three years now in the case of of our mayor today they the policy the mayor visited sister cities in China and also our sister city in the United Kingdom when the mayor was in the UK at a conference so those cities have been visited what I am proposing for your consideration is that this three-year term which either coincide with existing external commitments such as the visit to song or coincide with significant anniversaries yep move item 62 five Jame yes Jimmy Thank You mayor yes because this issue when the stub I presented to the international relations working group meeting on 1st of May you know you are aware this working group consisted two councillors and also six external members but all those external members a Chili 's sector providers from this year from the sister city committee chair from hydrous educated from MFA from the CCT as well as the from the CCC etc then we are the adopt a proof is absolutely white action wines like the thinkin he mentioned earlier because the based on the current of the international relations the ala policy no the mayor in the may be a popular council are eligible based on these policy during the tenders three years eligible to kind of basica our sister cities try to strengthen and deepen the relationship however because consider the the party is the limited though so we agree with the staff recommendation option what but the cities in last and have not yet the visitor from the meal this consist Australia a delayed Japan 's a classic us SSC Otto and the Korean is a some part is more kind of coaster are effective and also the during the meeting a one of the external in other members a particular emphasizing or male leader delegation to our sister cities there all those the sitter cities the officers business tactic immunity highly regards to Lisa the kinda of the visitor and also if we recall in the last three years actually is the kind of is a benefit to our city in a tangible one we consider in the business in economic in the tourism in the inter nation international education as well as culture the risk under benefit but but even the intangible one we can see actually uplift the profile of our church and create a good image of the Chi Chi so this way very high more cost-effective so I urge our fellow councillors we fully support option 1 no we should have the Vista our sister city to strengthen this kind of you and Phil look I want to really support option 1 on the recommendations there and I just think this is just so with this part of what we do as a city is it so important and generally referred to many of those those aspects but we 're the largest city in the South Island it 's really important that in fact we as a city play our place and you know what is a shrinking global world into the world being like a village and it 's having those relationships having ensuring that in fact they are mutual that they 're two-way people from these other countries dignitaries come and visit our city and in its it needs to be mutual we need to return there and like a lot of things it goes back to the quality of relationships which we have with these other cities and other countries so like if we ever if the if we ever need to be sort of supported and strengthened and particularly the countries who we have those relationships worth in terms of having a more peaceful world as now good recommendations thank you Andrew yeah I 'm strongly supportive of option 1 the benefit of the sister cities relationships became very obvious in the media aftermath of the earthquakes I believe that these relationships are valuable to Christchurch and to the region in fact unlike any relationships to be meaningful they need to be nurtured they need to be worked time and energy needs to put to be put into them so that we can get the best from them from the city and the region the policy would have allowed for a lot more travel as per option two I think option one is is a sensible approach and I think focusing on key milestones is a good way to to measure that and I 'd also draw attention to six point six point two the visit to Korea is only costing 500 and I 'm also aware of a sister city visit in the last term of counsel to our sister city of Christchurch in the United Kingdom where the cost of travel was a train fare and I know that the benefits of that visit were support what Andrew said and I want to commend the mayor for looking for always to economize on these trips I know you 've paid for your own if he 's an accommodation in the past and also in 6.9 where we 're looking at anywhere to leverage the attendance at other non council funded overseas activities which can help to offset the costs so we are very aware of the costs and we are being as prudent as we can about it but the benefits are huge and these sister city relations so I 'm supportive thank you it 's always challenging for these sort of papers because of course because it 's tribal and supportive international relations but specifically in relation to travel by the mayor I 'm the one that 's on the receiving end of the of the framing of it you know and I don 't actually think that it is helpful to describe the workload that goes with these visits is globe-trotting I 'd like to have it overseas holiday it would be quite nice but they don 't come with sister city visits of the city who devote their time for nothing and return to maintain the sister city committees that support all of these sister city relationships and I kind of want to honor them because when when I can 't travel so I wasn 't able to travel to songpa-gu which is the sister city in Korea I wasn 't able to travel there for our anniversary and so one of the counselors went in my place and did an outstanding job absolutely outstanding but it is recognized that the mayor didn 't come you know so it 's the position it 's not me personally that travels it 's the position that travels and people have referred to what what is the benefit well I mean I 'm not personally responsible for us getting a direct flight from Guangzhou to Christchurch but I know that when the mayor turns up the position turns up then you get to see higher ranked officials within the airline within the airport company within the Guangzhou and the Guangdong government that 's what the difference is that 's the it 's the nature of off in the long run but look what I 'm prepared to do again as I have done always is that I get invited to a number of overseas conferences I 've been invited to speak to a conference in Korea which is where I 'm going to make up for not tuning up for our anniversary and I will have an opportunity if you also sign a paper on Busan metropolitan city hall the measures I 'll sign a memo you down and Busan as well and that will be the one element of the cost that will be met by the council by the city of Christchurch which is 500 for accommodation and what what that will what that will enable us to do is to is to build on a relationship but I will continue to try and look for those opportunities where my costs can be offset by others contributing and me personally contributing I don 't mind paying for it and I 'll probably pay that nights accommodation as well just so that there 's a zero by that one you know in it it letterbox at home telling me about how predators that I represent the city in the way that I do that 's just the price that I have to pay for holding this position but when you give them headlines like that to play with and that 's what they 're going to thank so I will put the motion all those in favor say button would nobody moved it in a second Oh we 'll just move on in yeah tum tum Scandrick and Jimmy chin I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place I know that 's carried and we 'll move on to the proposed Memorandum of Understanding between Busan _"

    "text": "thank you no I didn 't and I 'm just going back to pcs for appointing an independent member because I completely slipped by it because I didn 't have my hard copy in front of me as I cross them off as I go and so I just skipped over it so probably because it 's only two pages long so this is a a process for appointing an independent member of the finance and performance committee and this some further advice was asked for at the committee and that 's attachment C and so I don 't know you 'd like to move that moving so moving seven and eight is enough the question that we want to start routing change somebody suggesting and wording change in this is out of your reporter C Kinnick see it 's really just taking the opportunity to amend the terms of reference to provide a future for um any independent member to be appointed through this appointments process just to write bring it up today and that 's going up there as we speak okay it 's ISM amines the membership me immunity membership or the membership section of the finance and performance terms of reference annual chicken there Oh God a couple of questions I may well be have it seconded depending where it lands so we 've got the question to answer today as to whether that independent member has voting rights or not haven 't_''_105.479 we yeah that 's the Appendix C yeah so with that 'll need to be resolved upon as well so we 'll need to do something with this resolution that 's no we don 't because the resolution the resolution says they have unless we say they here right so there are two things I 'd like to do then four I 'd be happy to second list the first of which would be to say that they make it explicit that they have not voting rights and the second of which would be to amend the quorum of to either to be a quorum of three or to be a quorum of two including the chair and deputy chair so there are two to four they that okay so well you 'd non-voting position so that would have to be one amendment and the other amendment what are you saying that just a quorum of I think it 's important that the chair and deputy chair involved in that or otherwise that there 's a quorum of three just so that it 's more representative well yeah just say a quorum up 4 of a three word silver unless unless you want to make it that it 's the chair the deep-sea chair and one our back years that probably my preference is fair to say there all right okay but I think of this but but I haven 't got a seconder for it because at the moment you 're moving an amendment or so see you no no your second you you want his amendment though the non-voting well I don 't_''_214.989 so and here in the way it is at the moment is not on voting I mean as Bo technology so to move amendment I need them I need of second the motion then as it stands but I 'm happy as as I 'm sure you are quorum of three right so so now you 'd like to move an amendment that says that the position is non-voting and your second vet calling right well I mean that 's a debatable measure that 's it 's down to so so we might as well open it up for debate so I 'll call on Rev yeah I mean this is something we talked about last term in terms of getting independent expertise onto various committees we did it with the new auditor risk committee where we had an independent chair plus two externals obviously with full voting rights which has been a very successful model has been so successful the Auckland has borrowed it and in fact augment of hired our independent chair to chair their new audit and Risk Committee and I think we have it with the health and safety committees you 're bringing professionals onto these committees so to kind of you know not given voting rights is pretty silly the whole point with the Finance one is you know we 're managing a billion dollar a year budget and you know we need get and to have a little bit of expertise around the table it has to be the right person and it doesn 't mean that we will hire somebody because if we don 't find the right person then it 's not something that we have to have it 's something that we choose to have and I think it will help us going forward as we continue to scrutinize the spending and financial performance of the council so I think it 's actually a very positive thing yep down um apologies for not being here before to start with but I just want to echo what Raph is saying initially when this came to the financial performance committee I wasn 't actually in favor of having an external member on the committee purely because of the dilutions of elected members in their whole democracy argument that you could have but after sort of weighing up the the report and actually listening to my fellow councillors I was quite can to sort of actually have that expertise on the council to actually have that independent look at especially around the and in sorry I 'll say it again we have some very complicated financial matters at this council at the moment and I 'm really keen to sort of make sure that going into the future we get it right so that we actually don 't sort of boot and ratepayers into future on on potential capital explosion that we have going on now so I 'll support that we have a independent loader and I actually want to support that we actually have that member as a voting person as well because there 's no point in having somebody on the finance and performance committee and go and rule around the cello this process of having someone come on and actually not giving them the full voting rights because it just kind of dilutes the kind of mother as I think I heard before and actually you might not get the right person at the table because they might not come on because they don 't feel fully part of that team so I would actually um you know want people to think about having this person as a of happens at the finance of performance committee has to come through Council anyway so that 's all I 'll say about their matter um term then yani thank you know SC before YRF you know like we 've got independence on the audit and risk we 've got under pendants and health and safety which worked really well they have full voting rights if you 're going to look at a SWOT analysis of your organisation I would suggest that your finances would be pretty well up there too and as we 've also said it 's not a hefty as if the right person is there and they are the right person for the job then it would make sense to have them on there and to give them full voting rights because what voting rights comes ownership and responsibility so if we don 't hear voting rights and there 's no point doing it so I 'm totally in support of this Thank You Annie then Andrew I won 't support someone going on here with full voting rights I do support the amendment for the non you need to look at what Finance Performance Committee does and then ask yourself based on what happened last term whether you 'd want someone having an additional voting right on there that 's not elected because one of the things for the finance and performance committee is to look at the preparation and adoption of the draft and final annual plan and long-term plan so I think when you look at some of the more contentious issues that we 've had in the past where we 've been split maybe eight six or six apes having an additional voting person on that committee to influence that who 's not elected doesn 't have any political mandate to be around the council table and doesn 't represent a community I think is incredibly concerning so I think you can get the advice and I welcome the idea that you would cop someone on to provide that specialist advice that you saw as important but that there 's no reason that I can see why that person should be able to make to vote and to take what effectively could be city now you know who knows what those issues will be in the future historically in the last term the issue of asset sales was one such issue it may be that the issue of the living wage becomes an issue I don 't know but I wouldn 't like to give away the right for us as elected members to our community who are elected on a mandate and a platform back to the citizens of the city to have non elected people being able to vote on what I think could be potentially controversial and sensitive issues so I that 's why I 'm really supportive of the amendment and Roybal point of order I didn 't want to interrupt your knee and break stride there but is yonni we 're not is yani talking about council no no I go to no committees cartellis us off topic I know but it doesn 't matter I mean that draft annual plan that we don 't we don 't consider that I 'm a signatory I don 't overturn by council we 're talking about a committee we 're to put a an independent person on Council that the council positions are all elected positions we are perfectly entitled to put an appointed person onto our committees that 's what we 're debating not the council decision making Andrew and then Mike I agree with the proposal to put an independent member on the financial performance committee I believe that that person if we get the right person if we 're able to get the right some wilded bring a degree of expertise and scrutiny which will be useful and could well fill some some gaps that we have in terms of the issue of whether that person should be a voting member or not the financial performance committee like the audit and Risk Committee in the Health and Safety Committee does deal with a number of compliance issues the technical aspects of our finances I guess there 's an advisory nature and some of the work that it does as well where things are debated in depth and considered in depth at that committee as they are audit and risk and Health and Safety and then brought to have confidence that the work that 's been done that led to that recommendation is robust and generally we do which is great I don 't believe that having an independent member voting will add anything to the strength of that recommendation I think the input that the independent member will have to the committee arriving at that recommendation is is key but the the other thing that the finance and Performance Committee does is deal with some substantive and sometimes as Jana has pointed out politically-charged issues around finances and I wouldn 't want to get to a situation where there was any member of council that had any reason to question a recommendation of the Finance Committee and who voted for what whether as an elected member or an independent member particularly in those close votes like the you know the six eight and so on that yani talked about albeit a council rather than the committing I believe that you know in situations of these major financial decisions council needs to have confidence in the recommendations of its and Finance Committee and it 's the elected members big substantive financial issues which obviously have an element of politics built into them from time to time Mike thank you I think Jamie said pretty much what I was going to say when he did a bit of a point of order after the fact but um I actually wasn 't erring on the side of an on vote in one but really this committee actually makes recommendations to full council where we all get to vote on it we need to get the best person on there and perhaps like taken away that option for them to vote we may not get that right person it 's really important there the committee level we get the best people on there now obviously we 're elected to be there but if we can have a couple of additional people there one person there can add value and I think we should go for it we 've got many committees they actually have a external appointments on them they have voting rights I don 't know why would something go to this committee and say no to it um so he 'll our council spend their money and the recommendations is extremely important and I think I would expect that people who could and clearly we support this that we have an independent people but they 're not here voting rights clearly if people put their names forward they 'll have the interests of the city at heart and they they won 't necessarily need to have a vote in terms of in order to some political persuasion at that committee meeting I think this is really important for democracy we 're all elected the financial part is a key part of what we do and I think if we start if we change the committee structure so that in fact the political part is altered that is not really what the committee in effect becomes unrepresentative so I 'm going to vote against having the person being a voting member err I will support the person being a voting member and I bring some experience in this through the DHB all of our committees have appointed members there 's obviously government appointees to the DHB itself but each of health quality finance audit and Risk Committee and we often have senior partner members from some of the best accounting firms in the city come and sit as part of those committees and in the community and public health one I made a recommendation ironically following on from this morning not then but from when I had worked with the prostitutes collective and a former staff member of theirs sits on a committee and they bring a lot of knowledge to the various committees that they sit on and is very valuable at the HP level and I would certainly not have it any other way than them voting no I don 't support the amendment I is that we never had this debate over audit and Rusk it was just assumed that you put on people in a equal position to sit alongside in order to monitor and report on the the audit function and the in the risks that we face but at the end of the day all of the recommendations from audit and Rusk come to this body this is where the buck stops and I it 's really important actually that we don 't tell people that we want a sort of a second-tier I mean we might as well just hire an advisor and we have advisors it 's management 's function they would be hired by management to support the committee if we put somebody on the actual committee itself then they become a part of the decision-making process which is valuable diversity and decision making as a no-brainer and I 'm afraid that sometimes even when we look around the table we don 't look as diverse as maybe one day our city our city will decide to be it yeah choosing it yeah anyway so um so now I really do think that from the health and safety point of view you wouldn 't put on non-voting members you wouldn 't have a non-voting chair of an independent audit and risk function finance and performance has become much more focused on Finance and performance the strategy sides being shifted out of there and it 's really focused on Finance and performance and as with heard from the chair we 're now to be far less opaque and far more transparent and I think that 's a good reason to have additional support on the committee if it 's decided by the committee to go down that track so I 'll put the amendment all those in favor of the amendment this is the amendment to make it a non-voting member so all those in favor of the amendment say aye those opposed say no this I think carries but lets those in favor one two three four five six seven eight nine so that 's carry um well can I have my vote against recorded please what yeah well we can we will just write down all that means well can you just do a poll so that we 've just got the names of who and this the system is working is it do you call out yes yes castle of lemons time yes cancel 20 water yes yes councillor swigs just say no careful the chain yes that would be a no from me yes no they 've got all the bits and pieces here but it 's carried in favor say aye as opposed say no no oh okay no no no hands up those who are opposed now to the whole motion what sort of makes a bit irrelevant so so I get Jamie and plan buzzer Jamie Tim Erin and Dion know [Music] they may not appoint so that 's fine they may not be anyone who 's interested now let 's get someone that you like Bryce the next item on the _"

    "text": "right could I invite her name David hoping to come forward from the Ministry of Education has just got my understanding is that you want to provide some assurance around the geotag and due diligence issues for our consideration of the report yep yep thank you good afternoon um my name is David Haven I am the program manager for capital works in the most of Education and South Island with my colleagues here detailer project manager and Susan Schneider man education manager um just a little bit of background very quickly November 2016 the Ministry of Minister of Education announced that reakless school is to be relocated to an alternative site and reckless Park during that time there was a substantial amount of submissions and reports made and submitted to the ministry and all these reports have been available on the ministry websites since that announcement more recently in April this year the ministry wrote to the council for me requesting that it transfers under Section 50 of the Public Works Act land at Red Cliffs Park for education purposes it also requested that the council agrees to be as recreation reserve under section 28 of the reserves Act for a new park to assist in this process engagement process the ministry will make available copies of the following reports will be providing and these will be available for public access the geotech report the rightful analysis reports the contamination report the coastal hazard assessment report the integrated transportation assessment and a general location for the new primary school all these reports are on red cliffs Park the mystery will are also better provide a location plan for the new proposed primary school on the park and this is proposed to be on the elevated section on the main road part of the park so if you 'll know the part this is kind of allowed us on the elevated section and is also very important to note that we have got a transportation report but we will be doing a far more detailed transportation report once the council decision is known on the part we also have to go through a process full of a designation and if the council decides to sell the land the minister intends for the minister supporting Greater Christchurch to exercise her power to amend the district plan for planning permission to designate reckless part of education purposes and change the underlying zone on the former school site to an open space part we are required to seek public engagement and written comments from the public on that designation process our proximate timeline is Jean all June to August to have the proposal drafted September October proposals finalized in October November to go to the community and then December to February the minister makes decision to me in the district plan we have also been targeting and we believe we 're still on track everything going well to the school operational or eclipse Park like beginning of term 3 2019 we as part of the documentation we can provide we can provide the location plan for the new school we can 't provide any detailed plan of the school because we haven 't done it yet we 've got to work with the school so we have got no more detail just a location just like thank you for that and open to being able to make informed submissions are at the disposal of the reserve and regular spark I was just trying to understand at what level you can provide details around what the impacts will be on things like the loss of trees possible landscaping and intersection upgrades enhancements improvements okay because we haven 't done the detailed design the school it 's very hard to know what the impact particularly for trees will be at the moment we would be proposing that all the facilities on the park current buildings on the park will be demolished the traffic with the intersections we 've got a high level traffic report but once we do the more detailed one then we 'll know exactly what may have to be done at the intersections and we 'll know exactly where potentially drop-off and car parking might be on the park as well so to ask the question we don 't have that information yet the details especially how can the Chris not really trying to understand is how can the community make submissions around the disposal of this reserve if they don 't terms of what 's going to go there so for I mean you mentioned trees and like I said I can 't tell which trees I think we can we can show where we 're proposing to put the buildings we know what facilities will be provided with the buildings we will have had a plan where we think there may be car parking and maybe drop-off I 'm not sure what else we can provide for it like just I 'm just trying to avoid the qet situation where we went through a hearing came up with an agreed response and then had a further request for further changes that you know around the trees and and if you think about this particular site I mean obviously the traffic is a major issue and not understanding what the mitigation is around that is quite I find it quite hard light you know who 's paying for if traffic lights are going in for example we don 't we haven 't had any discussion at a local board around what those things may be and get to a point where million dollars for a new intersection I mean I don 't know if that would be the case but I 'm just trying to understand if there 's a way in which that more detailed information can be put to the community as part of this process so that they can see the entire proposal and not sort of have you know three separate proposals going on I mean the the traffic one there is the traffic report the high-level traffic report and it does comment on intersections and I it doesn 't say at the moment that there 's going to be any need for significant upgrades and but we can do some more work on it and we will be doing more work on that I mean we think we 've provided a significant for a significant amount of information for your public consult consultation now it doesn 't seem to have the same number of trees as the qe2 site so I think that council staff would certainly I think the arborist be more than happy to work with you to identify the trees on the site I think the public do like to know about trees it 's um not not an unreasonable thing to be included but it really that when as a site I 'm just looking at it online it doesn 't look as signal that there were significant trees attached the qe2 part so I don 't know as far as we know there are no memorial or significant trees yeah on on the park and the fleshy areas of the red club 's Park has very few here that 's what I 'm making yet because it has been used si Saket yeah that 's right um aquitian yep so look like any report there 's reference to risks and hazards and and basically what it 's saying is there 's no more risk and on this redwood parks the park site then ricklefs then other areas I presume that means other areas in the location around Red Cliffs yes so we also make you might make sure you take into account for example on tsunami that knee were up preparing a report very soon and also there there 's the it by the end of this month yep potatoes become and we have included a and coastal hazards port and in the document so it 's will release as well okay thank you very good all right well thank you very much that 's much appreciated appreciate you making the time so counselors a you do you want to come back to this will come come back here at say a quarter to two to start this again and rather than wait till two o 'clock is that is that all right people it would take half an hour for lunch all right it 's the king alright so our June till quarter to two thanks very much most of us meeting oh no you video _"

    "text": "[Music] Zero 's okay sorry to keep you waiting but I can never quite judge how long these things are going to take so we could try to work you into a time frame excuse me because I just have a little bit of quiet enough and the place thank you so we 've got the chairs of the relevant zone committees with us and if I just hand over to each of you just to comment on the work of each of each of your committees and then we can have a general discussion questions who would like to start Paul Paul oh you 've been nominated to start looks like it Lorena as you will know and I 've got with me Pam who 's a deputy of excellence its own committee and so do we want to introduce ourselves I mean here at the last icon the tissues booster yeah okay so I 'll just talk about the zone another the section about taste mostly which shows on your page section four of the region and your tuner is counselor on the expectation missing no so we here that that our problem child cut off to a wider one and we 've talked in the last three months this is a three three monthly report about the leg and since its inception you 'll see that the results are showing that it 's not an illegal State and at our last me a single last meeting we had quite an interesting discussion because yeah and Cranwell who 's Annie cane counselor and also a spokesperson for the runic Oh Eduardo ah he he he 's been on TV saying that he would like to get government funding to reach the lake because of the legacy sediment and near which is part of the problem and contributes to the health and so the conversation ranged around will who makes decisions about what action should happen in the lake and there are so many agencies and organizations involved in in in that Lake and they 're not necessarily talking to each other like this there 's the bruno car there 's truant to happen RT Vicki there 's the Department of Conservation which owns the beat of the lake communities and there 's own committee there 's all these people but when it comes time to actually start making decisions about how that lake should be managed and what could be done to fix that there 's actually no conversation going on between all these agencies and we kind of reach the point where we 're we 're it we 've written lives own committee and our minutes is recommended that maybe some kind of organization needs to be set up I don 't know whether it 's a government organization or a senior management or both I don 't know but our understanding is that these conversations are not going on and everybody 's working in their own separate area on their own separate issue so that was one of the things I was asked to highlight the other thing is the issue of community water supplies all makes not sure there 's a whole lot of these informal little supplies which have just evolved over a number of centuries and the one that 's referred to in our report which is OK in spay committee water supply information of you 've got questions about that but the question has arisen whether what our long-term objective is or what is our strategic objective with these community water supplies so we 've we 're being asked to formalize them but is that the best way to go forward should we be I mean other good reasons for making individual property owners responsible for their own water supply or should we be supporting them to have community co-operative supplies and what is the role of council and less who supplies who manages some some of these community supplies but not others some of them are private suppliers and there 's a bit of a policy get there about what we 're trying to achieve in a in a in a zone where there 's you know what climate change is likely to be less rainfall and more storms and more problems with those community suppliers that 's all I want to say thanks those two things so could I just add a little bit about what 's happened in Akane 's Bay this weekend this last week not with the not a septic tank a septic sucking truck out and what you call it but a truck rolled and ended up in the waterway and I just like to highlight the quick action that took place regarding that that the operator and obviously notified the the Health Protection officers that are needed to be notified and very quickly everybody swung into action we as a community swung into action to notify that community that fortunately it wasn 't_''_372.019 in the community water supply and there was no leakage of cirrage into the into the community into the the Akane 's Bay Bay River area but it was just a good example of how a community that 's all connected and one that we 've actually been working with we know the people and and we could address the issue straight away so it 's just another little quick highlight of what 's happened in Akane 's this week so do we just leave it there and if there are any questions there are a lot of things we could actually talk about with you as in there Paula yep well a lot of trucks during the earthquake so Phil and Arthur Keith can I just ask probably you pour about the reporting part I would have assumed that in fact this the state of where we were that in fact that would be the zone committee would report to Environment Canterbury in the be some decisions making there and then presumably some discussion with council to severe role but is there anything else we need to do well the cause of the problem if not a sect of it if not a significant factor is land-use so he can with their plan change sects have taken some action in provide making in a fencing of the flecked rural land a requirement but its land use in the whole catchment contributing to the settlement and puts to the lake that is the cause of the problem and that has evolved over several generations successive territorial authorities said as councils like you actually are the agency that has the most influence over land use through your district plan so it 's not just you cans problem it 's actually your problem too the front page with slimy photos on the thing you should not be thinking thank goodness that 's not our problem because actually it is a short problem as much as it is Ekans is that the answer to your question you say maybe not the one you wanted but not but we have a role yeah I understand it yeah um Vikki just the issue of dredging like where we were what it was the issue of dredging the lake did that actually solve a of the problem this is the discussion that has not been had the ecology of Toronto Ottawa is really complicated and the more we find out the more complicated it becomes it 's part of the issue is the legacy of 100 years of sediment in the lake which keeps getting tuned phosphorus tuning up in and there 's all these conflicts interactions which happen in the lake and it might be that removing that that legacy sediment could be the the key but it 's got to be a response that that is on top of it you 've got to stop it zone committees been told very clearly our role is to just address the inputs into the lake so we 're not we 're not involved in this proposal to dredge the lake so what was the question again so if you actually dredged the lake you don 't know what the impact of that would be because being told that your only mission and life is to stop the stuff coming into the lake seems a wee bit counterproductive if you don 't know what the impact of dredging it would actually be well we don 't know what it is and it would require I mean presumably it would require a consent and there be a whole lot of processes and stuff like that weather would be environmental impacts and the scientists would provide advice on that on that that I just say them that the idea of a working group or something that brings everybody all together that looks at the science available and moves forward with with how we might how they might address that issue that 's a way we need some kind of an or issue to talk to each other and try and work out what listen what the management solutions should be and is that happening they know there 's a total vacuum right so thank you right and your commentary on the alkanes bay community water supply noting the support of the provision in the proposed annual plan to investigate options to improve and safeguard the water supply is it the view of the zone committee that the outcome of that piece of work if it ends up in the final annual plan would inform areas other than just okay is Bay and would the committee appreciate having the results of that work when available shared with the committee I don 't know what 's brief will be for that work I understand it 's a feasibility study and I would expect that it would what would present a range of options and the implications of that and therefore if that 's the case it will inform decisions for other communities and those in these communities all over banks to ensure that are asking these questions and that and the reason they the regional plan that make that you have to have a big area fenced around your community source so it 's become an issue for the owners of the land taking that out of production so so this is going to become this is going to come up more and more often and yes report a feasibility study that addresses that whether this is an approach which should be supported or not in the pros and cons of that I think would be really useful very good so are we going to now move into which so on why horror or crush it with Melton moment what what are you actually seeking from us in relation to that we are just trying to let you know that we 've identified that there is an issue in that nobody is is when it comes to making decisions to improve the health of the lake the key agency is probably federal NUCCA that the local II we in whose Rowi but everybody who 's involved in managing that Lake is going to it needs to be involved in the conversation when if is it phone committee organize a joint meeting or something wouldn 't that do the way for record you know so the only you mean China it 's actually the role of the runic up to it well we 've just signed an MoU but that says you 've identified as in relation to the opening and kovin ago yes and that 's another factor and how the lakes managed so all of that stuff has to be understood so is there any is there any is there any resolution that 's arriving arising out of this that we would like to you know sort of facilitate some further action or if the problem at all that 's why I 've loved a sort of specific suggestion of of the best but it 's not that it 's not something I know huge amounts about but it does seem to me just atrocious to leave any waterway as polluted as that one giver the eminence in terms of y hora which we 're going onto that they have a whole a joint governance approach with he can and the council I understand that so the question is is that given the zone committee 's concerns would that be something where zone committee like to consider whether it actually needs to have something of that substance to support the management of the late well it 's it 's co governed with Marty it 's with anyway it 's not it 's not something that one can do on their own it has to involved in the collaboration of all parties maybe maybe if they come back to us next year with what they actually I think I think can we leave it with you to come back with a theme with the rest of the committee you should advise because our advice so that 's because it what happens in the lake is not necess is not something we should be concerning ourselves with ya know we do utilize our focus should be on the on the flat land that you have it 's your debt and come back first town it would be useful to come back with a recommendation as to how we might progress the governance issues that okay thanks alright and so who 's oh thank you yeah the my name is Ellen I chair to sell and walras own committee so this is our report for the year 2016 and you 've probably got most of what what I was going to save you know but I 'll go through the key points early last year we introduced the cell wall or plan change that would quite farmers to kind of limit now they 're leaching for dairy farmers by as much as 30 percent down to a two percent for joylynn farmers now they then implementation TG took a wee while to our it was supposed to take about three months since I 've taken nearly a year also last year I guess we spent about seventy thousand dollars on in mediate steps funding on various projects most of us probably spent on fatigue thing and lakes and spring heads and plantings and things like that the challenge wasn 't really in so much in other work that we 're doing there 's been a fair bit of stuff in the media that we 've heard about coach Ford helping dry in the summer so it 's about for us you know it 's about bringing the community along explaining you know why it happened and and what 's been done about it and the probably doesn 't help that you know they 're the priests especially kind of putting in some misinformation out there you know off notice probably a factor that appeared in the priests not so long ago showing a photo from the year 2000 when in fact you know the photo wasn 't even about that particular stream so things like that that we have to kind of deal with yeah so to address all that we are putting on a seminar series to be held at a Lincoln University basically outlying everything that we 've actually kind of done so far and things like what and how not you know what have we done and how we got here we 're going to juice issues about order quantity water quality about the lake as well and what 's happening down there farming within limits and we are too from here it unless you got any yes positions to do and just in relation to the water in the lakes a couple of questions and one as I understand that the South Island 's heading to a potentially dry dry situation I don 't know if it 's all lakes whether it 's just the electricity generation ones will this likely happen again soon and secondly there 's been three reports lately from vivid oacd and the parliamentary Commissioner for the environment I think each of them has referred to the land use that 's happening in New Zealand and the need to radically change it and the need for fewer animals on the land is that being addressed anywhere by the water committee well yes so what we are doing is we just tell me families of what they can and can 't leach you know how they achieved at this up to them because I guess you know and we think that we 're not the experts in farming so what we have done is set the limit to say look this is how much you can leach and and we leave it up to them how they do it and the limits that have been set how long will they take before we see any improvement and these sort of wood ways have to say there 's probably a long time so I mean you 've got a reason because it 's only step one of the whole process so there 'll be other planned changes to come so the current limits will make no change in the quality of the water for 30 years right cares we don 't know it could be that kind of timeframe so we know it 's going to and the the nitrate that is going into the leg will probably get higher before it starts their ticket Louis and it 'll get worse before they get better will you let us know when you 're hosting that seminar at Lincoln 's yes so the first first one is on a move we 'll share this because weekly one interested in advertising water so that first one is on a June 22nd yeah and so we were doing the same seminar twice and then they run fortnightly from them in the seven in total seven times fortnightly you 'll send that information through to us because I think that 's very valuable to reach out in terms of the public 's ability to understand what 's going on on the challenges that are faced Obrecht absolutely so you know I guess what other things too is that there 's been a group of people who have come on to the process a bit late haven 't really heard about yeah what we 've been up to you on what we 're doing in the reasons for it so and that 's caused a bit of friction yeah yeah it 's often often the way all right yeah thanks just a general question on irrigation and consents do you have any input into new irrigation you can sense around daring does that fit into the overall yeah there 's basically no new consents given out as far as I know it 's about managing the consents that are there now okay it 's a little the having new new during consents so fishy design curry doesn 't have a role in the same ways that this council doesn 't have a role in specific consent applications what design committee has had a large role is shaping I guess the rules and the limits in terms of what they can then apply it 's it 's now the current plan prohibits new water takes so what we 're seeing in terms of dairy conversions at the moment is the consequences of consents that were applied for as part of CPW in 2002 with finally granted than 2012 and are now being developed through stage one and then stage two a central plains water that 's the dairy conversions that you 're seeing at the moment if anyone wanted to convert from other land use to dairying now and clearly wouldn 't need to come in for a consume and they could not increase their nitrogen losses okay so that 's really the question so it doesn 't depend on how much water has been consented it 's actually on the output side so you can control the output side and yep yep okay so housing yeah okay concedes for the CPW for the Canterbury Plains irrigation is that way more than what people were anticipating like would they have now been granted so so so the plan that they were considered under was clearly what was in place in 2012 which ain 't going hm and by that time the was still operating under the natural resources regional plan and a is not as yet operative land water regional plan so what that current so and why were a plan change had to take into account that central plains plains water had been granted but as I explained now through the development of that nature would not be permitted under the current plan change so if I applied for the central plains water scheme now the irrigation would it get through no yeah interesting however it was applied for in 2002 and the alien after a whole series of hearings environmental hearings High Court appeals was granted in 2012 amazing you listen I have to just interrupt here so that we can resolve and I shall move to suspend standing order 4.2 relating to three hours without a break I 'm sorry to do this but it 's a legal requirement and we 'll hear the Christchurch whis molten zone committee will resolve this matter and then we 'll hear the deputation from the Ministry of Education on the ricklefs school but we won 't deal with that we 'll take a break then have lunch and come back and restart the meeting after that so I 'll move the suspension of standing order seconded by Andrew I 'll put that money right no we can 't that 's going to take more than more than five minutes to deal with so sorry he wouldn 't take another look at the other item it wouldn 't wasn 't been issued but anyway I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried yes so um Jonnie um thank you only the water just I was interested to know and I presume it 's from someone were horrible also from the West Milton zone committee well we haven 't heared from Kauai noise I 'll say I um it may be an issue that you 've considered and that is the whole issue of the way in which consents have been granted and then an a company comes in to take that water so the whole issue of bottling bottling water in terms of consenting and impact or and water supplies so that 's a that 's got ready to do a Squealer we suggest you deal with that in Christchurch with melon all right you guys don 't include us but let 's move on to Christchurch with Melton 's and so a perfect Reuben fear Christchurch was felt and apologizes so I 'll take our report or Christchurch release Milton 's report it 's read and take questions and I 'll maybe address the question around the water consent bottling and what it consents like building consent go with the property not not the use so that particular consent and was granted in 1997 it was grant 35 years so as the property as has changed so the consent changes and it 's only in terms of environmental effects that consent that water tape was don 't understand is like if someone you know like we 've got an area that 's industrial and commercial property is going in there they have to go through a resource consent process for that change of use what is it is there no consenting requirements around change of use and these with what the water can be used for it does is that a gap that you 've identified or doesn 't make a difference what the waters use for use we 're talking quantity no terms of the Resource Management Act is around environmental effects of the take of the tape yeah so it 's about quantity not what you use it for right and there 's no opportunity like to look at existing years what does it take to get a bottle of milk release yeah I 'm just saying right um anyway back Pauline thank you but the biggest issue with the water box is the plastic bottles movers anyway on page 179 the committee received a report the information from the Selwyn District Council about the season the report the future of stop water probably the retirement of the stock water racers and Saudis the I requested dates for the consultation I mean we got those you because that 's out for consultation it 's quite a significant impact on the on the area if they retire all their stock races so a lot of confusion around the consultation process and if the Solon District Council wishes to retire a section of the water ace then it goes through a consultation process so if there is any section of the pepra water race that the district council wishes to retire then it has a specific consultation process there is that kicks it so there 's no date set for that because at the moment I understand there 's no proposals at the moment for any part of the pepra water race network to be retired but certainly there is retirements if they stopped water race network debt the CPW is covering so there is consultation going on around those parts of the stock water a system anyone submit citywide yes because there 's this ecosystem lawson fishes things like it so what any other was thinking in terms of result resolving that issue that was raised earlier around late where we were and the governance for it dad we 've asked the theme to come back to us I know and I was just going to add to that I 'm just wondering besides that too when we because I 'll you 'll be attending and series our rep at the Regional Water mention committee if in fact we we helped a chimp to clarify that theater butyl yeah you need a resolution to support it I don 't think so I don 't think so no right okay so Phil you 'd like to move that we receive the report seeking above Pauline I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried lot thank you very much much appreciated _"

    "text": "um right so now we 'll turn to item 14 issues regarding Street Street base six week I don 't know whether you want to present on this or or whether you want to go straight to any questions or what would be easier it I think straight to questions if you hit them straight to questions do any of counselors for crucial Sam 's know Sara Dion Yanni thank you and I 'm just wondering work with a vinyl review happening and 2018 anyway for the topic paper and what would it be the additional costs involved in going through a review now when potential amendment I mean potentially what else might that displace on the priority list of things we 've got to review and the costs for or estimated costs are given and the cue of doing a pile or now I 've given an itch the financial implications section for the second option so some of those costs if we did this at the same time as the public places by a little review would be less but but then you you 've got to assess secretly as it 's you know from the other measures and the public places by law and what it would displace do you hear it would it would displace other words on the policy work program we 'd have to have a look at that following the council decision to determine what would move well the Bible reviews are the Bible refused must go through on the timetable they go through because otherwise the Bible was going out of date so it would be other work within the policy team I are you aware of the Hamilton Bible for Street workers and prostitution I 'm aware that Hamilton has a bylaw clause um it was commented on by the Select Committee in relation for Medicare bill we contacted Hamilton about there by law last year earlier this year um clear division can you recall exactly what they said I my memory is that the answer was that they had never had to enforce their bylaw were they it was put in at a time when there was not actually a problem with sex works in the area I think they also covers the whole district just beds that completely and we in our view that would be ultra virus and but they haven 't been challenged in relation to that but it may be because there 's actually there hasn 't been a six-week well I I did say it was challenged in 2005 not the street yeah I think it was either that was that well it was a brothel oh yes I mean it was it 's interesting in one of the one of the and sorry I 've just gone off yeah one of the objectives of the bylaw was to limit the exposure of children and young people to commercial sex activities and I mean in there by law it says it 's got specifically the soliciting of commercial sexual activities no person shall sell it within the Hamilton City Council area or on any street road footpath Road reserved public place or area and considering what we 've heard from the submission I think it was and the changes of Sam and Chester Street as a whole with the district plan you 've got a problem with children and young people and ease the activity there is there is there a moral issue there I just wanted to the Minister has been going on for a very long time there was a working group set up and they were requests as I understand it too that what was the CD CCD you to look at changes to the physical street layout but nothing has kind of been done if we wanted to look at that what would your advice be around the next step forward and just related to that given that we 've got Manchester Street currently being reconstructed and widened I 'm just interested in any view around they 're not understanding what the current or the potential future situation will be because we 've actually got this work just happening and the product hasn 't been complete so just in terms of advice on are there physical changes we can make to the city streetscape to try and alleviate some of the concerns in north ability now and if so what 's the process to do that and the second one is bylaw what 's your advice around timing given the dynamic situation or Manchester Street at the moment so there 's two parts to that really so the the south part itself of Billy Avenue there are word works on men Chester Street and until those roadworks are complete we won 't know if that move self will just continue in the problem will go away so we 'll have to wait for those those terrific works to be completed if you 're talking about traffic measures wolf of Bailey Avenue we 'd have to get advice from the the roading and traffic parking people as to what could be done there the Working Party that was set up and I guess staff are meeting with the different agencies has has none of those traffic restrictions being brought about or discussed we did talk to the open area community board it about those at one point parking restrictions offer we debated that but I understand in was that they from the traffic and parking advice was that the consultation process would be extremely expensive well expensive and we weren 't sure residential area or pull them back into the more of the commercial zone north so in other words we just we didn 't explore it as pets as far as we should have at the time it was raised we looked at it looked like it wasn 't going on perhaps meat though because it yeah that 's what yes thank you um so the issued north of be Li EV is that now just centered around the intersection of purchase Manchester was it stall the whole of Manchester Street north appeal er um you 've got the information from the observation report and from staff and you 've heard from deputies today about where the activity seems to be located at the present time whereas it was in February when the observation report was done so this is to be workers in the Manchester purchased area of at least and there were perhaps a year or so ago but there are they are further north on and south on Bailey south on Manchester past be here as well so one of the reasons why I said is because obviously which is obviously potentially attracted the big safety area to work and when look I 'm south of Bailey there 's not those types of cameras around that are very highly visible and I 'm wondering you know is that the type of measure we shall be putting in place to actually encourage Street workers to go south of Bailey and move away from the purchased Manchester intersection I imagine for the CCTV cameras are something that you know the interagency group or any new working group could look at I just want to ask some some explanation about the the legal part and what particularly helped how we might achieve some change and like I think Duncan Webb has referred to the that using the public places vital and I think in any report your comment on that really is that the standard of sort of proof to achieve there it 's really to enforce it will be reading difficult so I 'm just wondering is there another by law which we could perhaps ask you to work on to a meet to immune things so in fact it to suggest say that a new bylaw is would be well and in our view would be more workable than trying to work with the current bylaw which because if we 're looking to tackle the issue is the Rises of residential areas then I believe in new bylaw is the the best approach to do that so there 'll be a whole whole new bylaw and a whole new piece of unity and you a new Bible refers to able to the public places bylaw sides of each thinking the tetran a is quite extensive about what 's been going and they 've been attempted I guess excuse my ignorance but the simplest that it does is mentioned by some of the presenters it as a commercial activity like a business like any other of those probably one of the oldest businesses with regards to that has there been any you know we can talk about bylaws that secret has been going on forever in a day has there been any constructive discussion with the and the workers with regards to finding an area and Christchurch that would be the area that is the area to go to for that service we have moved other businesses I mean it 's ah the wall no no it 's got to be acceptable to all but unless you get the buy-in from the business we 're just shifting it around to some of it we 're going to be in the same place we are but just in a different Street and yes the answer is yes we have the working party did look at that as an option they discussed it for some links and of course the challenge is where is that area earnest who would find that acceptable if it was your area that was identified the there 's a lot of issues I mean basically they there was a lot of work put into what might be a possible location but at the end of the day it was how do you get through the challenge of saying to someone or consulting with people around is this alright for your area to become well historically it was all men Chester Street from probably what was straight up like that so what why not Central City I mean we the facts of the matter that 's been easier in a day it 's not going to go away so the idea is to find some way because someone mentioned they feel safe and the northern part of and that 's actually probably the crucial thing so if we could get buy-in from the pumps and the workers to find a safe place that in the Dead is that travelled find a place that is acceptable to all it was in the Central City so why not return it there as soon as possible because it worked there Praxian and after working party could look at it again going good thank you thank you and now my question is around the the duncan web suggested perhaps that the existing bylaw is actually work about that 's enough but week may help tweaking a clause but somewhere in the report mentions that the police would be more inclined to actually step up if we were to I mean the clause or a de clause do you support that do you able to be more helpful if we I mean the clause and we haven 't talked to the police recently about the existing bottle there was and it has been a recent discussion with them about only looking at a new bylaws and their readiness to support the council with enforcement of that yes and has it been positive yes well I think that 's because is the thing as that and I believe the existing by allure is workable too at the moment but it 's it 's getting the buy-in from the police and it 's not I 'm asking them to come in with a big sledgehammer it 's just enabling them to start to work with these people and actually to be able to respond in a more timely manner than they have been so that 's the question I 'm asking you that you have engaged and that there is a positive response yes there has been a positive response from the meeting with the police laughs right thank you thank you um if we chose to go for an approach where we set aside that the six workers were allowed to work and that was away from the suburban residential and then you know the East frame gets developed we have a new residential population living there and we likely then to get as the residence on the city develops more and more communities coming to us within the central city say saying right get them away from our area that kind of thing building we bought in the central city because we wanted to be flesh and now there 's six workers outside I mean we 'd like you to start something then we would get pressure to continue I think with the UM if with a Barlow approach we then will be the next if the council decides to look at a regulatory approach plant or a new bylaw that will be part of the next stage and the report coming back to council about the options of what a viola might look like and in tackling problems like yeah or how do we address problems like um you know the activity moving or other people not wanting yeah wanting about what that will there will be issues but wouldn 't and they would need to be in addressed in the context of looking at where the next stage of regulatory approaches looked at and I think I think there is there is still just to add to that there is still a distinction that that several people have made between expectations of central city residential and expectations of purely suburban residential and the difference in amenity and and a lot of people enjoy the much more diverse in vibrant Central City even if they are occasionally really annoyed by being woken up you know that that that balances what works for them so I think that that people who move to an area knowing what it 's like is quite different to an area changing due to the earthquakes I thank you just curious over parallels with the police coming to us over the window washers seeking empowerment that worked well discretionary approach taken but it seems to me that when I look back at our our own record on our website over this that the heart of that is about threshold for proving a commercial activity and I asked this in relation to the window washes given that it actually arguably a commercial transaction didn 't take place in many instances so drivers would come up window washers would would clean the windows but no money exchanged so and yet the police was still able to act so what actually is the proof need what is the threshold I do I that the police would if the the police are taking a discretionary approached the windscreen washers I have no agent if they didn 't see a commercial transaction money being handed over or with all the preparations for that thing they may not have been the people that they prosecuted the police would maybe need to provide information about how they but I can 't see the police holding back if I 'm probably getting into debate now so yeah okay thanks yes regarding to the existing the actor in the new pile all across it will consider the sex workers are working rights and also consider the protection of the community as well as the sex workers regarding which wise more active more more protection I think a new battle would seek to address you know everybody 's concerns in make it a fair approach to everybody the whole Bob walking right sex was it was right yeah where they 're happy Dios or not well for example counselors folks raised the hinge and viola before and which prevents sex workers from working on the streets at all and Hamilton we don 't believe that would be a Bible that we could enact here that would be ultra very so there wouldn 't be about all that would be able to go as far as bending them completely from the streets okay thank you I speak on the second thing is to nominate counselors cotton swags to join the interagency working group I think there has been an oversight since the last election is that the working group has continued to operate but without the input of the two relevant counselors and and then finally and and this maybe you know controversial or debatable but to bring a report to the regulatory performance committee by the end of that 's not a whole bylaw but a clause that regulates the location of street based sex work away from residential areas and again that this is just a proposal but to be workshop with the working group prior to reporting to council so it 's not making a decision to introduce a bylaw but it is saying let 's pull this issue out of the whole discussion around the public the public blob of our Bible what 's the Battle Creek Lisa 's final public places places by law take it out of the debt and say yes we do actually want to prioritize this is a separate piece of work so that we don 't actually you know hold up the review of of debt one with one issue dominating this is the dominant issue of the moment so it 's address this issue bring it back through the regulatory performance committee but then ask din to workshop what they consider to be the the options with the working group that is the interagency working group and that picks up the points that were made by a number the regulatory performance committee by the end of September which enables us to actually make a decision if we are to go down that track of a new bylaw for the review of the public places bylaw which won 't be reported to council the beginning of that process won 't be reported to Council to the beginning of next year um well then I can certainly appreciate that the need to have this regulatory part process through through the regulatory regulatory performance committee I 'm just wanting to make sure that in fact having being workshop as well especially all of the social issues and the coordination that 's required in fact we Council are going to really resource us so we get that the social change with the the prostitutes collective here southern Peter does work well I 'm perfectly fine if the report goes through your committee if you prepare it but I just don 't know I don 't want I don 't_''_1360.54 I don 't want to report down to Lyons that 's all I understand it and I guess my as long as it it will be resourced because as a it 's easy to say this hell we 'd like regulation wise so you 'd like a social and Community Development Committee well I 'm not sure of any other alternative right now to actually so the Anglican regulatory performance to social and Community Development it doesn 't not necessarily know I wasn 't asking for that really Ian there 's two parts non regulatory approach so that I don 't see why the working group couldn 't report to their Social Committee no no it 's not reporting it 's actually work shopping with a committee of council with the working group so I thought because regulatory performance would be doing a bylaw if there was a bar or decided that they are the appropriate ones to meet worth but I 'm getting some pushback I as long as it works I 'm fine with that in as long as it 's resourced okay how about if the chair of the Social Committee gets the minutes receives the minutes from the working group meetings yep just to keep it in the loop true Jonnie well actually you 're not allowed to sit at the table or to participate so we not anyone can go to the committee medicals so um it 's not true it 's just yeah can I get a song okay so um depends if you 're making a submittals I just wanted to say that under number two I think it would be wise to include a member of the local community board given that some of the issues like parking restrictions could actually be going through the local board so sundered number so I just wanted to UM ask if it was possible to amend that to include which community boards it 's a Linwood central he 's got one comes a swig song oh I see yeah yeah council works us on that but Sir do you want say end in the chair of the community board yeah orgy of the chairs representative I just know it 'd be useful yeah in the end and and and a community board representative yeah it 's Linwood what is that none would central here cook yeah yeah um a good idea some information back around the trance the traffic changes there you could make in the immediate term you know I think I mean the thing is is that because I think that there needs to be a mechanism for the interagency working group to report on anything that they would like consider before that because the reason that I I 'm very aware of something that 's called unintended consequences so you pass a law and you unintentionally create a consequence somewhere else so so I don 't really want to kind of put anything in there that 's directive but but facilitative so is that could could we say that with the ability of the interagency working group to report back through the councilors to an appropriate committee if they have any recommendations in the meantime because it that way you could get it onto the agenda of the relevant community the relevant committee so if it 's a transporter shoe that could go through a that 's a you know you see what I mean sure but it 's just like how long that takes of anti social issues previously and actually giving respite to a group that 's feeling under pressure like the north of Elliot residence actually is something that you know it could be done very quickly maybe you could be transferring the problem to the next set of streets well yeah yeah not important to agree okay yeah yeah but anyway I 'm just hope I mean I think that we 're just we 're going to say in nominating representatives that there is and there is a mechanism to come back through the council if you 've got recommendations coming from the Working Group what I think councillor swags also represents that community board I don 't see why you need three people it doesn 't matter i I thought it 's fine to add a community board member on but no no but the working group has has meetings it 's a question of people getting there if they can so if you make it just a representative from the community board as well I mean a representative of the chair um clean thank you is just a couple of the affected residents to go on that working group as well I don 't_''_1660.059 I don 't know that that 's our role so if the Wickenburg want to invite someone to they could participate it 's an interagency we 've been great sure yeah and just number three I 'm not overly yes just on the the time frame end of September 's four months away we 're just looking at a options for a new clause so that it 's a third of a year for a new clause seems pretty long can we I personally think that 's quite a sensible timeframe you do year for months yeah for a clause this because it honestly we 've heard we 've heard the advice I mean there is a distinct set of views around around the the type of vinyl that can be can be established in what 's enforceable and what 's not air so just to be clear and we 're now going to be voting on the one two and three not the first two options or we 're still riding on those and moved anything I 've been trying to work through some a framing of I think a resolution that that I mean I 've looked for a compromise I 've listened to what people have said and and I 'm happy to move move that but if somebody else wants to move one of the other recommendations I 'm happy to move option okay sorry option do I have a seconder for there no that 's foul for want of a seconder so you move option one second okay moved by sarah temple turn seconded by and galloway so I 'll just 04 shadow mind and sorry I can 't stop it is just that you include sorry just can 't_''_1791.429 see the resolutions the tooth from your one which was too and those elected members to the interagency group so what what 's headed right we 're not I 'm not I 'm not happy they 're in and so he can he can 't you can 't nominate somebody who 's not wanting to be on here so off that second one just I 'm sorry after this is counts that are in place of councillor slugs for that one all right so so depth is the that 's the resolution so I 'll open it up to debate so what yeah yeah sorry I 'm just somebody was you a question note my thumb foreshadow so if this fails then I 'll move my resolution yeah um Sara thank you I 'd like to think that as a city we can look past the regulatory approach and to look what to look at what 's right there are hipping some enormous impacts from the earthquake with stresses on both residents and the workers themselves increase levels of drug and alcohol with a number of different groups and there have been some real impacts on those residents who live in areas that the sex workers have moved into and their real impact on those people in a lot of ways they are not a lot different to the real impacts that residents in the Victorian neighborhood have from the alcohol and that is consumed over the weekends people stepping over vomit on their driveways residents hitting houses broken into looking at extending the hours that people can drink in Victoria Street rather than limiting them to the much the damage to residents nearby I would like to urge people to put the emotion from our deputies today aside and to look at the evidence when the decision making today evidence of the past where an increased regulatory approach actually means that sex work was lease safe for the workers there was high levels of violence and people didn 't feel like they could report it and that led to horrible consequences for many the evidence of the link to the earthquake and the increased and the the moving of the work there we are looking at Manchester Street being finished at some point in the future and in the fact that the workers are moving already slowly South looked at the costs of the process this is the scale of the problem especially when we 've got a review coming and 2018 and it 's also clear that a community approach is best when working with the most marginalized or homeless Street based sex workers and others in our regulatory options have been tried moving the cameras traffic changes talking to the sex workers as people and I 'd like people to think about those things before we spend money on a looking at every give every approach and I 'll probably have a couple more words at the end Thanks I 'm Andrew thank you and if we could just have the screen move so that we can see the foreshadowed motion as well as the one that we 're dealing with now because what I intend to do is to speak to the reasons that I won 't be supporting the motion as it 's been put in favor of supporting the foreshadow of motion on the assumption that we get there the foreshadowed motion I think is a pragmatic approach there 's four months between now and the time that any further action would happen I believe that that gives an opportunity for the non regulatory approach to continue to be pursued and for further steps to be taken and that could well be positive in that space that would then allow that further information to clause 3 so a lot could probably be done in three or four months that would then inform the discussion about whether a regulatory approach is in fact desirable on not bearing in mind that what we 're doing is bringing a report to the committee to consider options for a bylaw one of those options at that point may be to take a softer approach rather than the harder approach that 's been assumed in some ways this morning so I 'm in favor of the the four months in between which is there for practical reasons but also could bring about some positive outcome I 'm certainly in favor of appointing elected members to the interagency working group and certainly it appears that that 's an oversight that we didn 't have people there I think having good local representation and so through the community board and council a representation including one councillor who is on the community board and the council really shows that councils taking this seriously and is there to to help assist getting some positive outcome from the interagency working group and also taking work that 's envisaged by Clause three means that a lot of the points that have been made this morning by the two agencies that are involved in that group can actually be brought to bear on that discussion so that hopefully what we get from Clause 3 is a solution that really is able to take into account the views of all parties bearing in mind that if we do go ahead with a change to a bylaw that would then require community consultation anyway would result in hearings there are a number of ways that we can make sure that all views are brought to bear so that we ideally are able to arrive in a place that I won 't say solves this for everybody but perhaps keeps most of the people happy most at the time so I believe the foreshadowed motion is a very pragmatic approach to I think what we would all agree is a difficult problem that 's been put in front of us today down I think I know here we go yeah I 'm going to support the foreshadowed motion and the reason I 'm not wanting to be on the the motion that 's been moved by Councillor Templeton is because I think we need to look at it all in one package and that 's what the foreshadowed motion is doing it 's a pragmatic approach as deputy mayor and said that looks at time frames action and collaboration and we can all bring that back together and actually start moving forward because this isn 't just an issue just north of be leave the district the district plan has changed the nature of Manchester Street and some of the Central City as a whole and as I saying before we have the Margaret Maggie playground on Manchester Street families are attracted to their area now because of the changes of the district plan the way the city is rebuilding and we 're having as it 960 residential properties built in that East frame so it 's going to be highly dense highly dense wizard in two areas and we 've got to ask ourselves this question is in the future this going to be an appropriate place and pellet of but to actually live with another Society of rules everything else has rules and I think this kind of needs some rules that we work together to actually make something happen that works for everybody because the residents are having issues with it there are problems in the area and we need to look at this and actually deal with that and we can 't just sit on our hands and let it happen and do these things but at the same time you 've got to respect the workers and everybody said they 're working they are working we work we work with inside rules and that 's what I want to see happen and that 's that is to me doing what 's right doing what 's right by the people doing what 's right by us as regulus regulators and looking after the communities and especially the ones that have been you know talking to us around this today and I just want to finish off on saying around the children and the Bible and Hamilton Benz it completely I don 't think that 's but I keep going back to that clause within the that bylaw that Hamilton and actually Rodney District Council have adopted as well saying that they are basing this on children and and reducing the exposure to that and with Manchester Street now having the Margaret May he playground and family it 's probably being retracted because the district plan I think we need to have a bit more of an approach that actually holistically looks at that which is why I 'll be supporting the fortunate emotion Pauline thank you and I support Andrew put it very succinctly in thanks Dion us for your comments to I 'll be supporting the mayor 's foreshadowed amendment they 're actually very close these to accept that Dion 's missing add one and the fact that the foreshadowed amendment allows us to begin working on options for a bylaw clause we 're talking about a bylaw clause we 're not talking as I said about a sledgehammer and the police no that will not work in this situation but what it does is gives them another tool so they can actually work Philips town was this proactive approach to communities they 've done fabulous work and near with reducing crime but also engaging the residents and their own solutions they 've also worked well in Rick Otton and we also had a example in st. Albans where we walked around with the police the community board members and councillors walked around with the police and did some door-knocking at one point in the crime rate plummeted after that so this is how the police work these days it 's not asking for a sledgehammer that would actually bring the result that you were talking about Sarah that would actually cause and the collective spoke about that would cause violence and risk to the workers because they would then be fearful they would hairy transactions and put themselves at risk there is not what the police want either but I just think this is a good way forward to actually get some action happening we 've been working with non regulatory approaches and solutions for a long time we 'll continue to do that but if we can get the police on board will actually encourage them to to step up to me that 's extremely encouraging that 's what we need so we 're going to have to also all saloon to behaviors now they 've moved you have to move them somewhere else so that 's a huge challenge now and so I think that this this is a way forward for me I 'll be supporting the foreshadowed amendment we 've just had three speakers in a row the same kin of the speakers I 've got noted Yanni Erin Glen Phil does anyone want to speak in favor of the current resolution Yanni thank you um I think it 's really important to put this into historic context and that is that I can recall when this the sex workers on the street used to work further towards more how safe so what happened was the proliferation of bars on the corner sites on places like casual Street meant that it got displaced further south us further north and so what we saw is through the city plan enabling these activities to happen on these corner sites that the think we do need to come up with a long-term solution but I think actually getting more information is the right approach and the reason I said is this Manchester Street has not been finished yet so I think we need to how can we do any sort of assessment rational reasonable assessment of the issue when we 've got all the construction work happening on Manchester Street now I don 't think we can do that within the four months that 's been proposed we 've also got the Liev it 's going to have a huge upgrade in terms of the resealing so you 're actually probably going to have traffic shut I presume at some point along the way of Manchester Street um you 've also got all the other things happening around the central city in terms of traffic which again we don 't have any timeframe for that to be complete but it is going to happen hopefully within the next six months so personally I think you need to do you need to do a much better assessment we 've already heard from the is and any by law that 's defendable and reasonable and rational or any non regulatory approach we need to understand what the issue will be and we 're not in a position to do that now and I don 't believe we 'll be able in a position to do that in four months what I do support if you want to have the conversation around a regulatory approach which personally I don 't think is the right approach but bring the public places vital forward the other thing I can 't see working is the Gulf for an amendment to the public places by law now and then next year we consult on the whole bylaw and we just duplicate the use of resources we get people that aren 't happy with what the amendment is saying it shouldn 't be in their area they come and get involved in the second process to me it makes no sense if you want to go through the regulatory approach then bring that public places by law review forward don 't waste money time and effort in an inefficient amendment in six months time and the final point I 'll make is that for two final points that I wanted to make one is this also comes down to the fact that there 's been no social impact assessment of the blueprint and the impact that that had on the inner-city communities so we see the poorest the most vulnerable being displaced having to deal with those who can least afford it dealing with increased costs and a huge range of issues in terms of the central city there was a community and the central city there is a community in the Central City and all the money that 's been spent on developers and on Street upgrades a huge amount of money being spent millions hundreds of millions on that and very little money going into dealing with the social issues that are arising through CCD use blueprint and I think the eastern frame will be very interesting to see how that comes out you know when you think about long term solutions which this council actually asked ççde to consider back in 2015 you think of things like after hours so well okay so I 'll just make the conclusion conclusion point is that there needs to be a social impact assessment done off this entire Eastern frame area and the implications of things like the multi-purpose arena and the accessible city and that will give you a really good understanding I think of what solutions are to deal with some of these issues but at the moment we don 't have adequate information we can do stuff in the short term that can give an immediate solution which is around traffic and temporary parking restrictions get that sorted and then look at the long term Thank You Marion so I will not be supporting option option one and I won 't be overly chuffed about the other vision as well because I believe the non-regulatory approach hasn 't worked and it hasn 't helped the residents that this that are mostly affected those north of being EF over the past six years will mainly back five and six years ago I spent a lot of time with the residents down in their area talking to them meeting than a dozen occasions I went out with the police on more than three occasions and spent a couple nights with the NCPC and and the people they represent and I wasn 't even lucky enough to spend a night in their caravan which not many males are ever invited in there and so I was allowed in there and got to skip every side of the story and not even all the girls that work down at there in dementia stew Street liked being there but they do feel safe there and that is understandable what the city does need is a zone that works for them and was Duncan 's point around having an area where a permit is not required seemed to make the most sense and that should have been what we were working towards today their area should also have toilets and it should have really good lighting it should be safe and secure since the decriminalization of prostitution I don 't feel it 's been overly safer for the gills and there 's been at least three meters I can think of in Christchurch had a safer environment we 're not one of them because they are human beings they are someone 's daughter and their family members of people where they need to be safe as well but that does not need to be on residential doorsteps and it 's those people that I feel for and that we should have been heading towards today it is a commercial activity it 's pretty clear when you see the definition of what a commercial activity is and it 's a legal one and we have regulations for things like bars factories shopping districts crematoriums and yet something with such that that carries some dangers and the industry or quite a number of dangers and here 's such close personal contact doesn 't have any regulations around it or checks and balances I find we are letting down all aspects of our community and for that reason that I would have hoped we could have gone down some sort of regulation and it 's not a sin each hammer approach because I find that if we just ask the girls not to be in the I don 't think there would be a very big fight at all and so is that it 's where I would like to finish my point is that this is not going to be a good outcome for the residence down there and I don 't think that got it outcome for the girls at this point either so everyone loses thank you I 'm going to support the foreshadowed motion there for me from time to time counsels our council will be faced with difficult decisions like this and sometimes these decisions involve looking along a spectrum of which one end is kind of like the the first option non-regulatory so it sounds a bit kind of less a fear along to interventionist and I I 'm I 'm siting on the the intervention interventionist part of that spectrum for the simple reason that status quo is not tenable for these families for the residents secondly I also feel that once that Clause is worked out that with what I 've seen over action where police came to us looking for delegation to saw our work on the approach and it didn 't stop there either they worked with the younger people so I see this as some kind of you know this offers potential for further development because these issues are sophisticated and complex put yourself in and met balances shoes the email documentation goes back five or six years I think he 's been quite reasonable he 's been more than patient he 's come to his counsel please help me counsel what are the tools you have in your toolbox to do something because you know if I 'm a parent you know as a father you 're protective if as a mother my wife describes itself as a lioness like her mother you are protective of your family you look to your counsel to please help one of our council objectives is to create long to create strong local communities so let 's please act reasonably let us do what we can for the families but also the women on the street I I take I take note of what the collective said before and and I do know that embarking on a kind a few years ago where you were you did feel pushed down but I think we can you know I 'm confident that I 'm working in partnership we can find a way here but to me not to do anything is just not tenable I think we need to wait thank you and I just like to address a couple of points that have been made option one is not a case of us sitting on our hands in doing nothing option one is continuing to work on a non-regulatory approach it is clear that we haven 't used all of the non rigged tools in the toolbox and I think that we should be moving towards those there 's been much talk of children which does bring the emotion thing into it you guys know I 've got kids I 've got a 12 year old daughter like Aaron does what I don 't want and it 's for my children to grow up in a society where we decide that because something is uncomfortable we push it to one side we regulate it and we take the we dehumanize the people that are involved I want my kids to grow up in a city where we look after the most marginalized and we work with them and we don 't tell them we don 't want them here saying that we 're not punitive that it 's just rules that there are unintended consequences and I would tend to take the prostitute collectives view of what those will be for the workers themselves over over those of us who haven 't been through that experience this is the issue of the moment it has had many emails deputations it 's got lots of media coverage but we 've had other issues at the moment we 've got our procurement policy our community facilities our smoke-free policy which has been waiting eight months which was based on deputations we 've got coastal hazards and we don 't know which of our policies work will be deferred put off and pushed aside while we potentially look at maybe doing a clause in a bylaw prior to doing a whole review and I don 't think that that 's a to move with option one and to look at a really good non regulatory approach and presa tea would we want also any residents representatives on okay we can change it thank you we put the home soon also you fashion on the whole thing he 's on our bed really just be the same I I don 't okay I 'm gonna say something I don 't want to be able to weaken committee if we 're not going to be doing another loop it 'll be lost in you my dear we need that week it 'll be lost will be the same people so just put the names in now yes I know this is why it needs to be intended why don 't we just not make those that once about you I 'm three one two and three all those in favor say aye I hope so say no that 's Perry and those who want to vote against artistry for everything Brow 's did we have a seconder for that much Oh _"

    "text": "and now we move on to public participation and Rex Harrison who has made a submission on our annual plan unfortunately I was most during the hearings process so I 'd like to invite Rex Harrison to present a submission to the council thank you if you just press your wait button on your speaker there that 'll turn green and you 'll be away thank you and like to express my thanks for being able to speak to my submission this late in the process clearly United Airlines could take a lesson from the council and putting things right my submission hangs on three principles the first is rating does not necessarily follow the taxation principle for taxation should reflect the ability to pay now counselors buckin johansson may remember way back when the council repaired its first revenue policy at the turn of the last last century the data was presented that showed the capital value did not necessarily reflect a person 's ability to pay rates particularly those on a fixed income my own exhibits case for example when I retired my income went down my income rates went up and my rates are gather are going to continue going up clearly something has to change the second principle is that rates rises are cumulative the impact is cumulative it 's tempting to look at the rate rise and divide it by the number of weeks and come to the conclusion that the rates rise and the average property is no more than the price of an expresso per week but over the course of the three years covered by the present long term plan the rate rise on an average property adds up to a week 's take-home pay to a couple on the pension so instead of getting 52 weeks pay they get 51 weeks pay clearly there needs to be a restraint and not raises the question of where can the council apply restraint without doing harm to its city I would submit that the best place to look for restraints is on transfer payments and this is the third principle I 'm making is that making transfer payments people who are struggling to pay the rates or fine paying rates an issue may so clearly cuts have to be made where can it go and as I said without doing harm to the city the most fruitful place to make cuts would be in transfer payments now the council makes some twenty eight million dollars in transfer payments each year voluntary grants it 's in a scheduled out in my submission if half of these were cut that would result in a saving of twelve million dollars per year which would make a significant dent in the rates rise and that basically councillors and mayor the worship is my submission and I 'd be happy to entertain any questions big effect on questions yeah Glenn thank you thank you for your submission just on that third point then I have you have you been able to take that further over how that actually factors out in terms of actual size words according to the information the council provided there 's about just shy of 24 million dollars in discretionary payments they don 't go into any great detail on what those payments are I 'm just suggesting a 12 reducing by about 12 enough information to make a informed recommendation on that I believe the people around this table a best place to decide where such cuts should be made okay so you aren 't able to land on an actual right figure is such well twelve million dollars saving what would that resort 2 percent saving and the rates you kept it all okay yeah pins on one yeah and I 'm I think that part is also when land values increase and rates go up so there 's an exponential increase I mean there 's one on top of the other so property values go up rates go up and it 's on an increase rate so even if there was a zero rate increase they still would been increasing rate yeah except that property values determine your share of the rates it 's not the rates themselves and so even though property values go up then that changes the way rates are distributed not at that cost of eliezer some increased expenditure well that 's what I 'm saying is the visit realignment across the city and some go down that will indeed be the case I 'm looking at the broad picture across the board some will be affected more severely some will be affected less severely than others would you favor us looking peps on the longer term separating the the land value from you know rating on land value as opposed to improvements as well I 'm not the rating system itself is not at issue at issue is council expenditure could no matter how you what method you use to calculate the rights your expenditure is still increasing and it 's the expenditure that needs to be contained rather than rather than change the way that rates are calculated now just as an aside in the best of all possible worlds local government would do a lot more than it 's doing at the present yeah unfortunately you 're less taxation revenue system forces you into this strange bind you 're not in the position to do what the government is doing if you commentators on the budget or to be believed yeah no I agree entirely yeah no thank you very much for your submission the opportunity thank you right now we move to deputations by appointment and could I invite Duncan Webb to come forward terrible okay [Music] good morning reporting near counselors first of all just a disclosure and really clarification although I am standing for public office I 'm making today as a lawyer for mr. bonus and the residents the issue it 's important to clarify what the issue here is because I think there has been some confusion this is not about sex work per se what this is about is about the conduct of disruptive commercial activities and as the document which I have distributed to counsel shows in the appended documents there this is a problem that 's been ongoing in this area that is to say the purchase Manchester Street area since 2011 and 2012 at least and a cursory review of those documents will show that the problem has not abated I don 't intend to speak directly to the paper I 've presented but really just to summarize some notes there are real concerns around the council report that I 've identified the survey which place and certainly eight nights is not enough to establish any kind of trend the lived experience of the residents is that this problem is ongoing and is not abating every spring it reaches it resurfaces after some quite a chewed in the winter it is our firm view that the council already has the power to regulate this this matter through the public places by law the counsels view provided in a legal opinion is that it has no power the public places by law doesn 't cover the situation my legal view is that that is clearly wrong and I would urge the council to revisit that opinion for the reasons set out in detail there 's a couple of other things I want to identify not only is this not about sex and sex work per se it 's also not about the Bill of Rights egg there 's no suggestion it 's accepted that sex work and prostitution is illegal trade it 's entirely permitted however many trades are legal but there 's no suggestion that they can be conducted all hours of the day or or ice creams or coffee or whatever that might be so there 's no suggestion that there 's some infringement of rights of the sex workers the other thing to note is that you know this council has a duty to protect its communities and I want to take a moment to identify that this is not only about the residents it is about the people who engage in the sex work and they need to be cared for and protected but those interests also need to be balanced against the interests of the residents this is a very residential neighborhood there 's a mixed use in terms of who lives there there 's rentals these families there 's older people these young people and they can 't live ordinary lives in the leafy suburb because of the disruption that 's occurred if you go through the doctrine from it 's only a sampling you 'll see that they have been creasing for years for this problem to be addressed this is not some karpas and whingers who don 't like living in an urban setting this is a problem hear from people today who haven 't been able to put up with it and who have in fact left I was concerned to see that when the council executive in its paper identified the risks in identified litigation risk this is not about litigation the real risks here are risks to people and communities and you will see that there has been in my paper I presented there have been violent incidents instances there have been instances of assault there have been instances of threats and threats to kill so that you know they are real and immediate threats there need to be addressed and avoided there has been damage to prophecy the look we know these are criminal offences but unfortunately the police resources are pressed there 's documentation showing a lack of police response to these instance I 'm not criticizing the police but I 'm saying that action is needed to address it the other the other risks are risks to amenity the risk that this stops being a neighborhood in what in which a diverse group of people can live and a loss of community up by this by this disruptive behavior and I 'll say the other risk we need to identify is the risks to the workers we need to find a solution to this and I think the solution exists in the public places by law and the proper enforcement of it the proper education and respect of it and the proper persuasion around it but we need to protect not only the communities but the workers by providing and ensuring that they have a safe and appropriate place to work which is free of the kind of conflict which arises here so the public places by law is really the crux of the matter and the council has a view or it 's legal advisor from 2011 has a view that what goes on in these street corners is not a commercial activity this frankly defies belief the in the very same document where that is recited in that in the council paper we also have a survey which identifies how many street workers are out there is utterly contradictory to on the one hand say we 're identifying street workers actually engaging in a communal activity that is to say they 're not working so the commercial activity includes trading selling hiring or displaying for sale any goods or services including advertising goods or services or events now the fact of the matter is that there is evidence of the services themselves being provided in a public space but even if that were the case the mere fact that these people choose to work in this area is exactly the same as any of these other identified activities they are presenting themselves to provide services whether those services are provided in public or elsewhere and that 's a commercial activity so in that sense we see that there is really enough tools there for council to take action can we say however that this is not an or we 're not saying bring a harsh enforcement regime down what we are saying is we need to have in the background effective tools to coerce as an absolute last resort obviously and may I say that the New Zealand prostitutes collective have been very cooperative and helpful we don 't agree you were hear from them we highly accept that the appropriate first course of action is persuasion and education however at the moment there is a misunderstanding by this council and by the street works themselves that what is going on is entirely permitted it 's not what we need to note is that it 's not permitted that there are other options and opportunities and that some persuasive tools and education need to be used it would be the best outcome if no prosecutions in respect of this were ever made however unless it 's possible to enforce this by law there is absolutely no reason to move away from these residential areas that 's why action is needed I 'm aware that the council 's time is precious so I think I 'll stop there and be available for any questions should you have any the dance would would favor and a vial or that that was I mean if it was not accepted that the existing bar door gave us powers the residents would accept a change to the bile or that may have explicit about where which would make some sense the envious would be to to tweak the definition to make it clear that sort of loitering with a view to providing services or goods with a on site or elsewhere is a commercial activity I don 't know that loitering is a good phrase to use under the circumstances so you but the just is clear that would be the other way around it well but that would lead to permits being required and yeah course thirteen I think it is makes it clear that you can have some areas which are set aside where no permit is required yes this right and it might be the easier way to go Yani and who is that is it you oh I was just gonna ask we don 't we don 't have a list of the dick it 's up there so are there any other reasons from that era going to speak or is this the one chance we 've got to ask questions nicely met sitting at the table I understand that a formal resident is going to speak okay well can the resident sitting next to you you haven 't really talked much about the cause of the problem although in the staff report it does go to the fact that some of us is to do with the way in which the cordon was applied in the central city that the changing physical environment have you thought about any other solutions like no stopping restrictions at night which we counsel used very successfully and what else they have or traffic changes at the Manchester Bailey intersection that could actually deal with some of the causes of the problem in a more timely manner those matters have all been traversed by council before and I the council provided me its fault file on this matter and no stopping restrictions and other no interning restrictions have been identified but for whatever reason nothing along those lines has been implemented to date as do you have a view on whether we should be looking at those I do have more immediate ways of dealing with the situation I do have a few in the viewers that all tools should be used but unless will not be particularly useful because the council has pride and the news and prostitutes collective have tried to use tools that are available Paul it 's allowed Pauline one quickly so far the conflict and the report which are our staff reports is that the activity is actually moving back and towards the CBD you 're saying that there 's no evidence of that from the residents around this area of purchase Street we clarify that please yeah thank you what I can say is that this the the presence of workers on the street is seasonal there is a natural decline as we enter a winter period but across six plus years what we have seen is it simply be revisited every spring so in end at the earlier forum mr. Bonners presented a months-long survey which indicated on almost every night not only where Street workers present but there was disruption at some level so it 's abundantly clear that the eighth night council survey was an inadequate investigation all right thank you very good thank you very much thank you for prisoners presenting to us and um Katherine Healy and Bridey Sweetland from the New Zealand prostitutes collector if we just follow this morning let 's hope it lasts now thank you thank you I 've been working with these issues for 30 years and we certainly commiserate with the residents and hope that we can find a non-regulatory resolution I 've put this up this cartoon because it takes me back to when it was published I think in one of your dailies the last time we had a discussion and it as you can tell it dehumanizes sex workers and refers to them as meat I hope that this kind of debate doesn 't spawn that kind of response my taking off and we contract the Ministry of Health just to give some of your background and we work across the country and we also work in an international way as well we are often called on to give expert advice including to such countries as the Netherlands South Africa Vietnam just to name a few so we have a great deal of experience in terms of these issues I also have personal experience the summary offences act and soliciting was a crime and I can say that cut right across our relationship with the police which is a very important relationship that has changed in the context of decriminalization you know sex workers speak it comes as a sense of entitlement when something goes wrong they will say I 'm going to contact the police this was unheard of and my generation of sex workers we had to duck and hide we would take scant time to Green our clients if we were working on the street and our fear of courses that if we go back to having what might appear to be a light touch and respect to the introduction of a bylaw nevertheless it will take us back into that kind of relationship where we will perceive the police to not be our allies to combat violence or to turn to so we would urge that the council not go down the path of introducing specific legislation or indeed any legislation that targets sex workers or clients or other third parties that you look to what is already happening you there who work in a collaborative way who are leaning on the sex workers who are causing some of these situations that you must rely on us because I know from historical experience that regulations laws permits find zonings you know none of that seems to make any impact on the amount of sex work that can you know will occur in fact it could feed a kind of attitude where sex workers may feel less than friendly towards their neighborhoods and one of the ideas we looked at and you know has gotten bad points was in the Netherlands they have particular areas and of course they talk about amenities they talk about providing toilets and showers my personal favorite was the idea that they would have personal lockers for sex workers to keep their things and another personal favorite and which was something that it was was quite interesting was something they referred to as cuddle walls where they 're heated walls for very cold cities and when tur we residence by day would lean up against them and warm their backs and you know just slightly innovative areas I know in Wellington we have a heated sofa a concrete sofa that 's a piece of art I 'm not saying that 60 acres sit on it because it 's not on the sex worker area but just innovative ideas that you know would encourage people to work and areas that are more friendly towards this kind of activity and I want to round up and say that we 're very opposed to zoning that that would be coercive our concern would be that sex workers would be walking and through an area and you know and this happened in fact and the days when we had soliciting and would be mistaken for being out and about and sex working and breach of you know whatever the zone prescribed and of course we 're opposed to permits sex workers ignore this you know it doesn 't it 's not a system that we hope that you wouldn 't reconsider I want to stop because we 've got a body who 's going to present on the practicalities of what 's happening on the ground here so here as off and Street with most sex workers who traditionally worked south of Bailey Avenue are Manchester Street could not work from the traditional area and and started to work from the residential area north of Bailey Avenue when I started doing outreach with NZD PC a year ago I would observe four to six workers and I understand that before my time it was more than sex workers since then whenever I do outreach with the outreach coordinator I observe usually zero sometimes one or two and I have figures that I 'll show you later which support that the drift is continuing south there are still issues working south of Bailey Avenue the workers themselves have disclosed that they prefer to work north of Bailey Avenue because roadworks south of Billy Avenue on Manchester Street effect traffic flow I go up and down Manchester Street both driving and walking on my way to work and observe and pediments both to watch the traffic flow and to car traffic flow um there is a in your agenda there is a council citation that there are about a hundred and twenty that at any given evening this would be an absolute maximum of twenty so I just want to highlight that and I 've discussed that figure with the other agencies you think cultural development and the Salvation Army in the police and they sort of think year 20x elute maximum so doesn 't want of like that so and missus arriba pointed out that only eight nights there was only an eight night observation period so the suggestion that the figures had dropped was inconsistent with residents observations and I 've alerted to my own observations ycd provided us with this very helpful data of their observations of the number of sex workers north of biele you 'll see there it 's in the middle of summer January February when the weather 's favorable is observed on two occasions zero to one is the usual number so I won 't go into detail about the public places by law and the person who provided the legal opinion to the council can elaborate on why they have found both as a meta effect and evidently why it would be an inappropriate will touch on you know the regulatory approach that 's been accepters that it probably wouldn 't work there 's also talk about whether or not it 's very criminalization so if the worker is fined for trading in a public place if it 's found that you know that vital can be used in that way and they don 't pay the fine they get summons to court don 't appear for court then they can be prosecuted for failing to appear which brings in a criminal element so one counselor touched on you know have other options being exhausted it was submitted that other non regulatory options have been exhausted and the same brief that was accepted that they haven 't changes in traffic flow waiting to see if what might happen the roadworks left we 've certainly only recently upped our persuasive persuasive persuasion powers and terms of approaching these workers and set benefits to a non-regulatory approach to continue using non regulatory options as well as the obvious got a greater chance of working and the essence of legal issues there won 't be you know the prostitution Reform Act and as a sport of us in youth and cultural development in the Salvation Army and the police last time we met with the police they indicated that this was the preference and given that we all prefer this option it 's easy for us to work together we all come from NGOs with limited resources and so but if we can use our resources together with YC DS resources together with the Salvation Army 's resources then it 's you know and you see that in a street outreach how we work together no one agency and of you know we can 't do outreach on their own ycd can 't the Salvation Army can 't we all come from different angles too but when we pulled our resources we can work quite nicely together and so holistically that 's the best outcome for everyone for six week is for residents for the community yes okay like without take questions I don 't know how much time we 've got okay we reach the ten minutes but Sarah was had her hand up so does 's really important to look back to what has happened in the past and I start to clarify it was what you were saying earlier mean that should we take a regulatory approach that it would become less likely for six workers to report harm that they were at rest that you want so the levels of potential violence toward sex workers could increase if this was the case that 's right and there 's strong evidence for this yeah thank you you 're good I 'm sorry the the ten minutes is up but thank you very much appreciate your time and could I invite Erica kids from Salvation Army Good Morning America kiss and my I 'm a lieutenant and the Salvation Army I want to thank you for this opportunity to present a deputation to counsel on behalf of the Salvation Army I 'm the current street outreach service officer was a specific ministry to Street based sex workers in making this deputation today the Salvation Army will state of you that six phase sex workers are often marginalized and vulnerable our concern is they 're introducing widen their marginalization and vulnerability making positive change in communication less likely where safety works risks also likely to rise as a result the Salvation Army has shown care for sex workers since its earliest days in as hopper fire has operated our Christ Church Street outreach service for several years sex workers can be vulnerable to violence robbery drug and alcohol abuse and exploitation and the Salvation Army that is our opportunity to provide a listening ear and practical assistance when this is required although the Salvation Army does not endorse the use of sex as a commodity for purchase we do believe it 's important that all sex workers are given respect and that is safety health and human rights are upheld we also believe though while it 's an individual 's choice to work within the sex industry it 's important that opportunities are made available for those who do wish to leave the industry our street outreach service is a team consisting of the Salvation Army and the NZ OPC we operate from the corner of Manchester Street and Casals we street in front of buskers is clearly visible as a camp event with Salvation Army signage the service provides a safe in non-judgmental space for workers to come the social and spiritual support as well as to receive health and advice from the NCPC in addition the Salvation Army in zpc and street based sex workers network with youth and cultural development city council and the police through our bimonthly interagency meetings this helps keep lines of communication open between all parties as well as providing a forum to discuss and address the concerns of local residents the Salvation Army also recognizes the difficulties that residents are facing because of street workers operating in the area of particular concern is the possible impact on children we understand that any solution needs to be considerate of and try to address the desires of residents for a safe and respectful environment for their families and visitors as a mother I can certainly understand residents concerns while wishing to find a way for all parties to coexist in a way that seems respect and safety upheld of paramount values the Salvation Army would urge council to adopt a for positive change on Manchester Street we do not want to see life become harder for vulnerable people such as sex workers or other demographic groups such as rough sleepers we believe a solution can be found that will satisfy everyone without the need for regulatory approach like new bylaws or police enforcement the number of woman working around purchase Street has decreased significantly and we think with a bit of work a solution can be found that satisfies everyone we are not intending to minimize the significant stands for the well-being of residents in the overall environment I meant is the street but believe a regulatory approach is not the answer such an approach is likely to create fear of the tensions between residents and sex workers a regulatory approach is also likely to increase safety concerns for 6we because who made the comb more fearful of reporting incidents or abuse or mistreatment to the police this approach would also be difficult to enforce if another place was available for the woman 's ago that was safe and had with toilets and burns we think they 'd be happy pushing them to places that are less safe The Salvation Army believes every human life is valuable we don 't want to be telling these women that their safety is worth less than anyone elses especially not when there are ways to safely help everyone involved when the cost could be a camera a toilet in a bun that would be used by the whole community as well it 's important to note that while a regulatory approach addresses sex workers it does not address other groups in the area such as the homeless or young people a regulatory solution that tigers just one group rather than looking more broadly at other demographics represented in the area Russ being perceived as discriminatory as well as limited and its effect as we 've been communicating with the sex workers over the past few months we have noticed that the number of women working on purchase Street has decreased in Warren that women have shown more consideration towards residents we believe that through positive communication instead ities and Cleveland including communication between residents sex workers The Salvation Army NCPC ycd and police to the challenges that we currently face we would like to see council in cooperation with the Salvation Army in zpc ycd police and residents take a non-regulatory approach to ensure that Manchester Street is a safer community where all demographics including street based sex workers are treated with dignity and respect we hope that the diversity of this community can be embraced so the safety of sex workers in especially the children are insured and a positive manner our hope is that we can problem solve and move forward together rather than adopting the backwards step of a regulatory approach which we believe is likely to increase safety issues and negative communication between the sex workers and residents I thank you for your time and considerations and now invite your questions Erika thank you for your submission and for the work you do to the Salvation Army I just want to ask you if there might be a compromise here like the me alluded to and that is okay clearly the current regulations and aren 't working in terms of resolving things and as a whole lot of work know clean would benefit from being coordinated better so the other part too though if if we were to make sure efforts on wound one exists the existing bylaw and make sure that in fact it isn 't punitive but in fact works better than the existing rules we have would you would that have you know potentially be helpful I think you need a mint mint would be the crucial thing would be to communicate with the organizations who are currently working with the sex workers so if we did do an amendment it would be with consideration to NCPC ycd Police and Salvation Army as well because we 're on the street and we can know the ladies in I guess for me it 's about ensuring that their voices are being heard Thank You Erica and I would like to thank you most sincerely for the work Salvation Army does with the community and Leatherman square and beyond I know of that work and I know a lot well until now flies under the radar but thank you just in relation to what filmer colleague has said quite a reasonable approach I thought and he did make the point of that it wasn 't_''_2463.749 or so you know parent-to-parent a church member to church member our values are about building neighborhoods and communities so I think what we 're looking for what you know would you accept that where things aren 't working you actually do have to take steps sometimes to to ensure that communities are working together rather than pitched against each other yes so again it is about working together and having those lines of communication open so some of the observations and the report alluded to other demographics as well which clearly aren 't being addressed and here and and it 's actually understanding just situation as a whole that has decreased over time and I have noticed late earlier I know the situation 's of residences too many 11 I was speaking with a lady just last night and the reason why she doesn 't work an endures situation is because of the quakes a lot of the establishments were destroyed so a lot of women have it 's you 've been well as as other options are becoming available thank you um thanks Erika no you mentioned that bimonthly meetings are they currently still being held yes because it seems to me that the City Council has not been attending those they had they lead it tend to chew it okay I 'm not maybe it 's something that 's worn over from the election I 'd say yeah because prior to the election I was a member of that group okay and we do the council does the secretarial side of it takes the minutes and writes the reports etc so um okay so we need to pick that up again now a membership um and you mentioned that amenity like toilets burns lights cameras every time the City Council 's try to be proactive and put these on we 've had a real neat reaction from surrounding residents and businesses to say we don 't want that here but not only that we are then the councilors then accused of actually proactively encouraging prostitution and street work right so to me it seems the only way forward here is can you think of anyone who might wish to lead some support like that I guess we would love to Salvation Army would love to provide a place that 's actually a safe environment tartly working out of a camp event it is limiting because only so many people can actually fit in there and then whimper it 's not ideal and they have a physical place another was a building and originally straight out which was and a building yeah in the city and fortunately got damaged in the quake and we have a grade one sons something like that Bedford Road I was quite centrally as it was and so do you think then that the location of that is quite crucial I think so so it would be we 're ideally Manchester Street right ideally it could be through in zpc or ycd or in the cot with all of us together it could be that we pull our resources together I mean we will be out of Syria at some point ton of only you as a question yeah yeah I think we know where the you very much thank you very much we die Lucas and Barry Brooker from the Peterborough village incorporated society Biron code out in the code wrote in the code okay thank you for having us here today Barry 's going to start having don 't annoy are not representing groups of such we 're both involved with the Peterborough village group team with Mullen neighborhood group and I think it 's important for this discussion because those are communities that are south of billion and we do see a difference between those and the very core loving residential zone north of behave in the more mixed area that we live on and so I think it is quite an important distinction we feel some sympathy for those in the purchase Street area being south of the year we 've experienced a lot of those activities but I think we are more of the view that there are there is a way round those and some of those issues have to be addressed or supposed to starting point is as others have seed prostitution or Street baits six work as legal off for thousands of years it 's not going to stop so it seems if it 's legal it 's going to continue we have to find some good solutions to this and a number of births and the Peterborough mower groups and I can 't_''_2793.219 say all of us because there are diverse views but we do see that the six workers perfectly for those of us living south of really a part of our community and the discussion often goes at these community and the news the sex workers are some not some here not part of it for us they are part of our community and we want to make it 's safe for them in life to be reasonable for those residents who live there so we 're looking for a solution for both parties without going into detail we do also note the frustration in the council has tried to put safer conditions and for street based sex workers and there 's been a lot of opposition and we have supported that in the past but other residents in our groups have actually been quite and stick issue at the moment people seem to be focusing on the stick but perhaps the carrot of somewhere safe to work would actually solve some of our issues the other one is that it would seem that issues facing people north of Billie is also one of the unexpected outcomes of the earthquakes and being residents along the way in Chester Street area we do see the six work north of Billy reducing over time so part of our submission really is that in the next year I think things a year from now things will be different will be different than they are now and really the earthquakes in all the roadworks have resulted in an unexpected change to the route of the way six workers are operating it so for us really I think we just went back to the idea that a sense of community is really important here the six workers are part of that community we want them to be safe we want our residents to feel it 's a safe and good place to live and as a result we don 't of dealing with it we are hoping if it was addressed a year from there things may be different than they are but we do see a real need to keep talking with all those groups involved I think the thing about being here today which has been really positive it does matter which approach you 've taken everybody has wanted a community that is safe for everybody and what the speakers have said that differ only really in how this can be achieved thank you thanks Barry now we 've provided a copy of a letter from from two locals from Lynette and Phil 's DNA and who loved just by the Manchester Street Salisbury corner and they 've been their faces damage they 're going to love moving after 21 years there they 're moving on to Manchester Street and they 've written ly I won 't to read it out you 'll do can do that but they find a totally acceptable and that the the sex workers are part of the community and when there are sex workers that are difficult there might be noisy something and generally it 's sorted and I though that for me I 've lived on Manchester Street since 1991 and I work my office there and you know with their sex workers moved into the street in the mid 90s and there for me for us there is not initial sometimes there 's some really noisy people and we have one time I went to the posture it 's collective and I went to the van and I met them in a latent and night and I talked with them there was a immediate change of behavior I told them what was upsetting the locals that girls yelling across intersections things like that and when I talked to them they were so pleased that someone would come and talk with them about it and there was a complete change of behaviour and so we think we can work these things through that they are part of our community and if we reasonable and discuss things and respectful then we will have a solution until you won 't incident my partner 's car was broken into one night a sex worker thing here about community so I think that it 's important that the central city residential area we 're in that separate zone south of Billy Avenue and that this as a traditional what Duncan we 've referred to as a traditional area and for the general thinking in the community as it 's not a problem we have never in the Peterborough village which is also post-quake phenomenon we 've never had people come and ask for an agenda item to address six week or so I think that that 's a an indication that it 's not seen really as an issue okay through welcome any questions um Sarah thank you and I like the way that you talked about it being um about community and I like the way that the Leisha and name is Jade and humanizes her and it 's not someone that other and irrational eyes which I really like I was just wondering about other nuisance behaviors and so do you get and it 's a pity residence is the the occasional sex worker nuisance behavior the only type of nuisance or is what 's more frequent this alcohol-related noisy nonsense around we 're Central City residents you expect there you know you expect that sort of diversity around people don 't come to live in the central city expecting to be as a fern a quiet suburb and you know that 's that 's a diversity and people move the afford it for the diversity and it 's appreciated and I think some of the issues which are probably blamed on the sex workers I 'm not actually for sex workers there are other reality elements in the street yeah a drive-by culture is noisy hi Yonny thank you I just thank you for the deputation I just would you support us putting pressure on CCD you to get oh sorry I 'm at a crow to get Manchester Street finished and actually then seeing what happens before we sort of embark on a quite a you know difficult piece of work if we are going to go down the regulatory definitely I definitely don 't think there should be anything the moment was still in very much and transitional arrangement with can barely drive down in the moment you know it 's an artificial environment moment through the south and means you so Street so I think it would be very good to tie how I wan to do you have any thoughts about what you think might happen once that works can play with the nice bull of Arden no um no I don 't what we have a lovely diversity of people using Manchester straight the Margaret may he playground we have a lot of families coming up and down we have this new visitor tourist accommodation on Billy ever we have a lot of tourists walking up and down there 's a lovely lively mix of people using the street and that 's healthy that 's important and I think that will just increase with with the boulevard being completed yes and I suppose from a personal sense would be great if the council was brave enough to once again here we go tour that some facilities that may resolve some of these issues when I was residents we 're part of the problem yeah because they are like you 're attracting them but we really do need to make it safe for them and also they will also make it safer for those who live these years our toilet was put in a porter though was put in and available for use workers on a site but also open to the street for the sex workers unfortunately various parties and perhaps the drunken ones have pushed it over several times and so it 's been taken away now that 's unfortunate it 's good to him a toilet there that 's available and that was a good facility so it just needed securing really fear yes thank you very much that 's some very helpful and great smashing thank you very much Stewart the future good morning my position is really about the data that 's being provided the observations more around the we seem to have a conflict of information from 0 to 1 between 30 and 11 o 'clock on the data that 's been provided and in the Salvation Army which suggested that perhaps they caramel would not be big enough for all the a Hank 's Co was around the dedication and condom waste that is very evident around the area I have an 8 and 6 year old we step over these sort of things on a daily basis especially outside certain our primary schools and I usually I 'm just frustrated by the whole process of it and I 'm kind of wondering just as this hearing started to take some shape why a partial bylaw wouldn 't actually be a good idea in the sense of putting a a specific area around where workers can actually work if this is something that we can 't change and it 's part of the community and perhaps we actually build the facility and have a Bible or outside of that then it becomes a punitive response but within that area it 's actually quite legal that 's my thoughts we have dieting made some very good comments and very made some very good comments on the sensor community we don 't want to push people out and be overly negative on it but it is actually having an impact on people like we end up with being waved at my 8 and 6 year old quite rightly say what is that about I just say they are extremely friendly people and then we have to get into the whole scenario of well why the waiver did so we actually start avoiding these sort of areas between certain times a day or night which I don 't think this part of community we use the magomayev Park on it 's a fantastic facility but we have to drive past a certain element of the community and we can sort of close it away under corner and Auckland have the same sort of problem it 's the element that attracts other elements to the area which then by default causes also spongy problems and that 's what I 'm concerned about as a resident of San Albans questions one of one of the elements that was brought to our attention was that if you have a very tight regulatory environment within which people can only operate when they 're walking to there they can be also targeted you know like so do you think of the approach that you would want the council to adopt but I did hear you say that you 'd support us providing facilities in a particular area as long as it wasn 't residential is that again it comes down to the data I you know the police have got more CCT CCTV coverage than anybody else in the city and having a static I don 't know if the the prostitutes collective review of the area or frequency of use or how many people were actually attended in the area was actually static approach or was it just a walkthrough I imagined that there would be an element of there would be a general turnover of customers and what have you so I think we need to actually invest in a proper 30-day review or data collection by somebody who 's you know an independent body if you like that it 's actually going to count the number and look at the problems and actually do proper walkthroughs on okay well this condom ref is here and there 's other elements of human evidence over here I think I think it 's absolutely necessary that we have all of the facts as opposed to a selective snapshot of one night perhaps which may have been extremely cold or maybe it was just the bottom who knows I don 't think is enough information to make any great call but I think heading down the track of some sort of flexibility with facilities or something would it be extremely helpful it may be having a look at them what are the problem and sin ovens that you 're in to the street when whipped before the earthquakes I use it was yes okay around shipping Trafalgar Dover and English Park it could be 15 year-olds but I don 't know hopefully 16 but that 's it has always been a problem that has become worse post-quake very good any other questions Aaron yeah I do feel for you having that conversation with your children and before we had a great submission of re almost the difference between inner city living and suburban living and and I think there is that clear line at BEF where you go from inner rowdy people in the inner city as we heard and some of the people that live in there accept openly accept street workers they seem okay with that but you don 't expect that in the suburbs and I 've children myself the oldest is 12 and my birth daughter and I 've got a son who 's 9 and my children no transgender people they know gay people they know what it is to be those people we don 't talk about what those people do behind closed doors or what heterosexual people do behind closed doors but the conversation I find really hard to have with my children and so that 's my question to you is how do you have that conversation with children of what a street worker does when it is so obvious and you do see their evidence left on the footpath because I 've seen and unfortunately down by migrant making something that looks like a large used piece of Jenga and my children asks what of this how do you explain that to your children because I 'm sure not all of us how is a parent you very specifically relevant or Pleasant comment tonight do you not like this I try not to engage and that sort of comes out it comes Norma 's point Nina 's if those people were standing at my gate how do I explain that to my children I don 't know that that 's the question that we 've been asked to answer and we 've taught him to a resident who 's making a has you know very valid points to the council and we are obliged to consider those and take those into account but has anyone got any specific questions for straw I 'm Sara thank you and and I know that while it 's a um it 's it 's a wider society issue and you know like Biggers and things that we find us uncomfortable that everybody is at a state where we hear people and more vulnerable and marginalized situations and I was just wondering if because you have very local real impacts from this wider thing I 'm just wondering if you 've taken dyes approach at all working locally and to let them know those individual impacts on you and your family and to see if you can actually have you manage to talk to someone about that one of the workers who tried that approach it do you have any of your neighbors head I think the the conversation that we have on the weekend for example yeah world was simply around consideration and if there is an element of a belief of community focus then let 's just have some general consideration what we 're stepping over and what I 'm finding on the streets it 's not consider it know we seem to be having a belief that everything happens around Manchester or just north of or there abouts these people hop in the vehicles and they drive to other parts and one of them outside certain primary schools and parking areas its consideration we use something pick up after yourself then we probably wouldn 't know that you 'd been there but it 's this general lack of community if you 'd like yeah but have you talked to them about their they like it could be an approach that that 's useful yeah um Pauline you just quickly a lot of the data that you refer to that 's been the surveys that have been done seem to me they kind of finish around 30 or 00 zero reason for their short does it not continue after 00 for I don 't know I haven 't been privy to all of the information that 's been provided or I came I 've come in secondary to this all I 'm asking as a see reactivity between same igniting and dawn or does it tail off I 've driven through the city on the way to the airport when I was living in across the Arizona town and it 's it 's 30 in the morning five o 'clock in the morning it 's absolutely to me right through to I think up to midday or there abouts or maybe it starts um at dana 's 24-hour shift I don 't know think thank you very much Joe and we really appreciate the fact that you 've you know made the time and I know it can 't always be easy to do so so that is appreciated thank you thank you and Giles golden that 's my wife Suzanne as well welcome to both of you thank you thank you well keep this brief we we don 't live on Manchester Street anymore we lived there from about 1990 till 2013 I won 't bore you with the details of what we put up with with the defecation condom syringes movies concert noise all or that that 's well documented well known but well I can say that after 2011 2011 earthquake life changed quite dramatically for us then with the CBD being locked off the prostitutes came and worked in our part of Manchester Street we just north of Billie Avenue and even after discussions with the girls etc on the odd basis they said that you know when when the accordant has taken up they 'll move back to the south of Ellie and when that cordon was moved they didn 't go and the reason given was they she feels safer working in a commercial sari at a residential from the 2011 earthquake our life turned pretty bad okay we we had all sorts of promises from MPs and we had meetings at a house with MPs we had councilors there 's only one councillor one person and I 'm looking at him right now who actually did anything concrete and the whole time and his efforts were actually penalised by the council within 24 hours if you remember on the signs you put up no prostitution and the one thing that happened was the council took down the signs within 24 hours so we felt actually quite let them buy that that part of things okay is a job I travel overseas on a regular basis with the constant lawyers at night with lights going on with with yelling etc I didn 't feel safe leaving Suzy at home so we moved we had the ability to sell up we took quite a financial loss to do that but to me was important that if I was overseas I was happy that my wife is safe could I just look for second yeah just on that point we Street conservatively estimated at 250,000 dollars so therefore we have significant interest in this entire thing we 've been significantly affected by the street worker activity but everybody seems to want to sweep it under the carpet but there is parties here today posture about street workers safety and various parts of legislation that gives right to rights to workers or parts of legislation that are difficult to prove in terms of trading but the safety of the sex workers is not adequate reason to deny the residents of the affected area the enjoyment of their property the street workers we encountered over two years were quick to state their rights but rights come with responsibilities we never encountered a single street worker with any sense of responsibility through there generally alcohol or drug affected psyches there is no understanding from them as to how they 're affecting the residential area we encountered a range of behaviours almost entirely negative we were regularly verbally abused direct threats were made as to the safety of ourselves our house and our dog occasionally with physically jostle and on one occasion I was dial for a range of complaints just let us understand while there is probably some really nice Street workers out there many of them aren 't but it 's not just about the street workers it 's about the people that they associate or who come into the area because of that activity we had drug dealing we 've got the minders we 've got the clients so perhaps the street workers do come from broken backgrounds but it 's not the responsibility of the affected neighborhood to fix this it is however the responsibility of council to ensure that these residents do not suffer these ongoing effects any longer and just been summer I guess our points are threefold one is that it 's not just a sex workers when you talk about surveys of 18 or 12 or whatever it 's the customers they bring it 's a weirdos turn up it 's a people hanging around the street it 's the pimps it 's the drug dealers all those sort of people it changed neighborhood for us completely we felt out of love with what was going I don 't see that we need to feel sorry these people I mean they 're just people doing a business like anyone else if if I did the same thing for example outside the council offices how far do you think I 'd get before I was thrown out for the cops arrested me so they 're just people doing a job I don 't think there 's any need to feel any social responsibility the third thing is it 's a commercial activity end of the day it 's a straight commercial activity that needs regulation that needs to be curtailed thank you any questions clean thank you for your deputation it strikes me it 's a proximity dynamic so you 've looked there you 've experienced it we 've hit a lot of kind of sympathy empathy towards those working on the street today that 's fine but from those who have been supportive do any actually live in the area they your former neighbors for instance sort of what 's the question the question is I sense that those who live nearby know full well what appreciate as much I think it 's a very very local problem that 's what you mean yeah and we still keep in contact with the people because it was or there was a community that lives there of neighbors of you know people raising kids working all that sort of thing it 's very strong it 's um and you know just as your wherever you live as a community you know your neighbors you know your people you try to I 'm trying to draw a parallel with the earthquakes so if you were close to more affected areas that 's your experience if you 're a fear that you 're further away will that colors it as well you don 't have the same appreciation of the OB yes very nice fair comment of course it is we lived it you know not everyone did yeah it 's very hard probably unless you 've lived through what we 've been through to get any real concept of the disruption to normal life and I think it 's fair to say that now given when we purchased and that there was some Street where creativity in the CBD but prior to the cordon going up there was never a single street work and north of Billy of our lives changed very very markedly well I think the worst thing for us is that you know we fell out of love would be near 20 years we 'd renovated an old villa we you know put in gardens we 'd made it yeah our little place in the world and we fell out of love with it because what happened on the street and I think I think the thing that 's funny that it for me was when we had a new labrador puppy to take weeks old and it 's out in the driveway looking at a condom you know it said it 's hard to describe the feeling that gives you why thank you for coming I know that 's really difficult for you speaking about this and I can feel the emotion that you have about this I really understand it um we 're hearing a lot about the activities possibly moving back towards town you found you can be disrupted heavily by just one person or is it always a whole lot of it to the T all at once um you 've been one person yelling whatever okay it 's the disruption was a what was left behind be at those things like security lights coming on at different times the cars just idling on the street you know the throbbing of the engines etc they 're yelling across the street so was it any one person you know not a specific is it a question of numbers or can one person so the sliding caused you disruption one person can definitely cause disruption calling there was one Nolan person who was affected by substance of some sort and sing loudly right into the early hours of the morning loudly it 's not always a question of a whole lot of number gathering in one place it 's just it can be one person that can just do this which it could be but there was that flow on effect of you know they 're one person there 's another person there 's at Manchester Street was it just an intersection that 's true because it was the whole Street north of the wind from Bailey and they 're about three three blocks up towards some Jemima 's lettuce where 's your extending up to an occasional house Cannon Street you know at least two blocks so primarily they block between Manchester and perches and particularly the purchased corner thank you thank you very much and appreciate again the different coming under making a deputation to think Castle thank you we have another deputation which is on a completely different matter so could I invite viene de Vere corporate property and marketing manager series New Zealand to speak to item 16 simple city regeneration tackling barrier sites as well thank you madam mayor and my counselors for allowing me to come and speak here today my name is Bernie Tuvia and I I 'm speaking on behalf of Ceres New Zealand on the corporate manager for series New Zealand and I 'm also a director of the companies that own the Peterborough Center and Victoria mansions as I have not spoken here at little bit about series New Zealand it was established around the time of the earthquakes in 2011 and it was a sister company to series enviromental which has been in business in the States for 40 odd years series in the States is a company that it 's a disaster recovery company responds to earthquakes storms carries out a lot of civil works and principally the difference with disasters in the States and disasters in New Zealand as in the States we contract in advance of a disaster so we are a first responder them for many cities and for instance the city of Los Angeles if it has north quake we 're expected to respond within well an instant response so it 's quite different and our activities in New Zealand have involved the demolition of major buildings in the city here including the old city council chambers we carried out quite a two notable implosion police station and radio broadcast house and more in recent times we 've been taking down high-rise buildings in Wellington the build in multi street and the readings theater building as well as see town centre and demolition works in Dunedin with the hospital and the University so we have quite a diverse activity going on around the country and I 'd like to take the council back to a time when Sarah had a policy to order the demolition of any dangerous buildings a section 38 notice was served and a body corporate or owner had ten days to respond and if they didn 't respond Sarah took the power of the property from these people and proceeded to demolish the building now around this time both the Peterborough Center and criminal courts were issued with section 38 notices and we had stand-up arguments and Peterborough Street our engineers versus era engineers and we convinced Sarah that we could make safe that building and save it from the courts was not successful they did they were dysfunctional in in terms of their being able to cooperate with one another and we lost crammed the courts which was just terrible and you may recall how people responded in the streets around that time so as a part of our plan to save the in couldn 't off Victoria Street we have had to cover the cost of that for the past five years and maintain the coordinates and at the same time we 've been fighting with our insurance and I 'm sure as councillors you know how difficult it is when you 're dealing with insurance companies who want to pay out the minimum amount and you 've got a an asset that needs to be repaired correctly so that 's the situation that we 're in we took our insurers to court the court instructed a expert confirm process our engineers and our experts versus the experts of the insurance companies our Pepperell process has been the longest process that 's taken place in Christchurch we have dug trenches around the foundations of the Peterborough we 've cut into the floor slabs so we could see right through from one into the foundation to the other unfortunately it 's not very pretty the foundations of the Peterborough have been lifted up out of the ground the real new steel in them it 's a very heavy building and the turrets went ake and created huge damage inside the southwest world it 's been retained by containers with big water bladders in to keep the weight to hold the world from falling over and this was one of the reasons why the Peterborough Center was going to be taken down now the councillor obviously concerned and we had a letter from tell England with regards to people with prominent sights Derrick buildings and here we are trying to save a very precious building and we own two buildings and they 're both very special heritage buildings I 'd like to address some of the damage that occurred in Victorian mansions and how we intend to save that Victoria mansions was built after the Napier earthquakes it 's a very heavy building all of the internal walls are built on some sort of obscure block that came from overseas which is plastered early into tenancy worms have I 've got this block and the building is very very heavy as mentioned before the water table is high and there is a penthouse on the roof that 's poured of solid solid concrete now lighten the building now we 've had a team of 16 professional experts working in Victorian mansions from heritage people to design engineers we 've just completed a complete strip out of the entire Victoria mansions there were no redeeming features inside relating to heritage that have been stripped out sometime in the 80s but we have taken a lot of the weight out and the next job is that we need to get a resource consent to remove the penthouse off the roof now all of these processes take a lot of consultation and a lot of time and we feel personally that we 're being targeted as a poor corporate citizen who 's dragging their heels with two heritage buildings and we 're bringing down the look of the city and and that 's just not right so in a letter sent 16th of May from Cowen 's 30 sites seen as the most prominent examples of barrier sites with buildings that are considered barriers to the regeneration of the city of Christchurch what an insult in a recent report before in the report before you today it 's owners as stubborn since we purchase the Penta Burroughs Center and made a major commitment to say that we have had zilch response from the council not one person from the council has ever come along and said how 're you going do you want to hand what 's the damage not one person has shown any interest so the response to the letter and the report as follows we 're extremely disappointed to read the letter the report before you and the council 's new line that we have been included in group described as stubborn owners as they 're thought of some concern that the council did not engage with series in the preparation of the report we do not consider this as best practice to provide notice to accompany a mere doing days notice before a report and its recommendation are presented to the council for approval stubborn and derelict which on save a couple of precious buildings it doesn 't fairly and accurately reflect the position does it see reasons it has always placed a high priority on early and ongoing engagement with us in that the report remain on the table that the council staff instructed engage with representatives of the 30 sites to a certain a true and accurate position regarding the status of each property because it probably follows that a lot of these other buildings are in a similar state and the owners are having similar problem once the council has the full information it can then with certainty approach and engage recursive important owners with direct buildings and where appropriate pursue formal enforcement strategies should the council not agree to adopt the above-mentioned request series New Zealand formally requests that 25 Peterborough Street the Peterborough centre and 91 Victoria Street Victoria mentions be removed from the list described in the report this is the Central City regeneration tackling barrier sites thank you for hearing my deputation it was never of a business plan of series to set out to save heritage buildings we have made a huge investment in Christchurch and when we we don 't want to be seen as standing in the way of the recovery and I just hope you can understand that what I 've said understand because the council must have been in the same situation with buildings that the council owns and if at any time in the future some councillors wanted to have a look inside these buildings inside the Peterborough especially you 'd be shocked but we would facilitate that there are large pieces of masonry that have fallen down onto people 's kitchen units most of the people 's possessions are still in the Peterborough so there 's white where there 's beds as drapes curtains carpets and we 've recently thrown all of the stuff out of the Victorian mansions and cut a bit for the dump and that 's what we 'll have to do with the peeler and we anticipate starting to do the soft strip out in a matter of weeks because we 're terribly concerned about fire risk we 've had people breaking in we 've got security there we 've got cameras and all the time people are breaking in sleeping in the beds they 've gone from one end of the building to the other and graffiti that and it really upsets us greatly hope you would take on board these requests that I 've made thank you so much thank you very much and really appreciate the time any for the payment and and just for the record really appreciate stepping in on both Victoria mentions in Peterborough seeing I remember standing outside the in watching the demolition of Criminal Courts and I broke my heart in the heart of everyone else that stood there so thank you very much for what you 're doing even better up on the offer of a site visit as well great thank you thank you _"

    "text": "anyway over to to cool so I 'm Angus McDonald and I love living in South Brighton with my wife Janet we 've just heard obviously and their three children I 'm also director of a consulting engineering company in Christchurch when we told my six-year-old son this morning we were presenting to Council today he said I hope you didn 't get fired from New Zealand dad but he thought we could just drive to Africa if there happened with Janet and a number of people in New Brighton you 've obviously just addressed that question but we sort of shook our heads in despair when we read the annual plan submission form out of dozens of recreational sports facilities the proposed funding and the plan there was only one project which received a specific mention and that was the New Brighton hop saltwater pools project and along with Janet and hundreds of residents and you Brian the East and I do hope and you 've also hopefully said as well the whole of Christchurch I wish to give my full support for the new bright and hot saltwater funding for this project I also support reinstatement of recreational facilities along the coastal industry age the work to appear the Easter huge protection and the implementation of the New Brighton master plan I also agree with some of the comments made today that communication about what is happening and what the council is doing has not been the best I believe that people before people were more aware and were kept more informed this would relieve a measure of anxiety that nothing is happening I do want to make the comment though the in-ground infrastructure I don 't yes--it 's money spent but I don 't see that pulling that out and say hey we spend this money repairing your sewers I don 't agree with that as as an investment and the whole of Christchurch has had that issue so I don 't think you can pull that out and say hey look what we 've done you Brian we fixed your drainage so I just like to make that comment but I just did want to briefly recap the progress of the New Brighton master plan I the current version and over the next three years there are numerous revisions follow-up investigations and new drafts with the plan adopted by the council in March 2015 so in two years what tangible progress have we seen we 've had a mural painted on the more concrete we 've got some new rubbish bins and we got the tiny huts don 't get me wrong we love the new bins but two years it doesn 't seem like we have a lot to show for it as I mentioned in is discussed by an earlier submitter I also support work to repair the East Ridge to South New Brighton in South Shore and I know your comments about the red zone what 's happening and whether you can build on us and what the story is but I 'm particularly impressed with the South Shore inundation protection levee is detailed at no CL report as proposed by the self Shore residents association I just like to make note that the cost of it was estimated about nine million dollars or around eighteen thousand per property protected compares quite favorably roads evil a virtual Road seawall sorry and the 82,000 per property for the Dudley Creek flotsam basement flood mitigation works which I actually don 't recall being asked my opinion on I 'm having to hear today that the astrea 's protection is under consideration but again it goes back to my earlier comment about the the communication of these things I do want to end on a positive note and say I 'm very pleased the rebuild of the South Brighton GT is underway and we 've recently been advised that the South Bryan boardwalk is to be repaired and we love the boardwalk it 's fantastic I run along the history every week and to have that repaired will be fantastic but we must build the momentum I don 't want to be here in a year 's time lamenting more in action or perceives in action and procrastination the time for consultation is over and we want to see progress on what has been promising you guys yeah thank you and I think the communications over what is happening a really important and I think you it 's tough it hit happen like it did actually and flopped in and it was consulted on but then what I hear from people I 've seen the Pickers are supposed we 're here from four inside and visit them and bright and open things isn 't always that build us something new for the most part its effects what 's broken you know it 's dead flex the street success tough pages Rosso exam footpaths get all of that kind of stuff and it seems like that 's the stuff of stuff that you drive past that you walk past every day that seems to be bringing people down yeah I mean would it be because I was surprised not to see that in their petition and would it be better to like maybe like bring forward and fast forward all of the funding to get the stuff that 's broken that you see every day fixed nice but I mean it 's kind of like a house we just we look past there now it 's been so long you can just ignore it knowing I 'm prayed and self Maryam prayed every day and but if you 're real I guess you don 't you can 't focus on that because then you 'll just you 'd be in a constant state of depression so I guess we want to focus on on the new stuff because I guess we figure that the pot the manholes and the roads will be repaired eventually and that 's great what we want is is we would like some new stuff I mean yes apart from the petition want to hear day to day from people just fix the broken stuff yeah no yeah yeah actually complete agree yeah make the place look nice we want it to look like it really is you know high maintenance good footpath that kind of stuff of what I hear day-to-day as opposed to just the in your plan process thank you very much and much appreciated can I pour on _"

    "text": "you boys you you you I just hello everyone welcome back to clear the meeting open again and I 've got an apology for lateness from Counsell swings would someone like to move that happy to move it to Aaron q1 seconded by Pauline Cotter I shall put up motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that is carried declarations of interest I 've had none of those and we 'll move on to the hearing of further submissions first of all Crusaders limited partnership Hamish Creek please come forward page 12 on your agenda you know services here is that Alright yeah no that 's absolutely fine I 'm just councillors you may not have noticed but on the hub give all of the annual plan documents an hour under annual plan for 17 days so we 've actually set up I think it was a request from the weekend that everything go on to enter one page and that all the air now I can 't find anything what 's today 22nd 421 23rd stood a second hey principal right okay let 's divide for the opportunity to address the council we understand that the submission we have made has been read so we don 't wish to go through it in any detail again the priests as well this is super sore there now that there 's a couple of comments perhaps we could could make at the beginning of this ten minutes and we know initially that our submission was made nearly a month ago and in since then of course there has been the commitment to the pre-feasibility study for a multi-purpose arena and it 's an important step and our submission finishes with the plea to get the business case underway well clearly events have moved positively from our perspective in basse Christchurch has had an outdoor arena for well over a hundred years and that was Lancaster Park Lancaster Park was of course a multi-purpose venue in its own right in the history of Lancaster Park is a very storied one and had an extraordinary array of community events over its life it was insured it was damaged through no fault of anybody 's in the earthquakes but the excuse me for just you know laughing a little bit but right I mean the settlement is that is it not not comparable to the amount it was insured for indeed not yet but but has been settled and my point is that of the things there have been legitimate issues and impediments to dealing with the future some of them are now gone and my point really owes the big insurance claim has been settled for better or for worse Lancaster Park has been deemed or a parable and therefore we are now at the point where the future outdoor arena for the city is legitimately and needs to be decided we 'd also like to make the point that we do sit here and in a sense representing a very big silent majority and while a number of people Express account of view the research that we conducted showed 94% of the citizens of the city I think it is important for christchurch to host a variety of large-scale national and international events 94% so you can argue about a margin of error and how many people were you understand that 's a very big number that supports a facility 91% believe Christchurch needs a modern mix juice outdoor event center it is true that 61% of wanted a new venue and 28 would have preferred Lancaster Park to be repaired but that issue has has been dealt with so there 's a vast number of the citizens of the city who who want this meta dealt with we would also like to emphasize that our support is and has always been for a multi-purpose arena just as Lancaster Park hosted a wide array of community events our supporters for a multi-purpose arena and we will be but one user hopefully an anchor tenant paying an agreed commercial rental but only one of many users I just like to conclude these very brief comments in support of our submission to also emphasize our offer to support so any part of the process around the feasibility work around design around how our lease and operating arrangements might work into the future we stand ready to work with decision makers like the council to help make that process go well one that one or two comments and Imus has already stated it but we 've been very public in our in our stance I suppose that we 'll do everything that we can as an organization that is Crusaders as a as a rugby organization to do what we can to help and support any business case work and come up with a model that will work well for our city there 's no question that the Crusaders brand the crusaders rugby team does its but to help jail the city and help jail the supporters of our region we 're sure that in the future we 'll continue to make the team work well do what it can to continue to actually get people to come along to whatever multi-purpose arena or ground they 're playing and we 've been really grateful for what we 've had with the temporary stadium but we all know how difficult it is to live in a temporary environment for too long without starting to have issues inside your business we 've got a really healthy future we 've made some changes in Crusaders and the supporters that we have out there a new multi-purpose arena time planned in the future will give us a bit of surety that we can continue to keep developing our business as well as our rugby team to an able us to continue that support to widen and grow as well it 's pretty important to the people of Christchurch that we have something to look forward to and the Crusaders have been helping that I think in the last four or five years and as I say really grateful for what we 've had like really looking forward to working with the council in the government and whoever can help us with regard to a new arena for our team to play in thank you um my question really goes back to the cost-sharing agreement arrangements because the thing that kind of worries me always is that there 's the level of expectation that 's been built in the public mind I mean I could get a 95 percent result on a on a on a on a survey if I didn 't tell people that capital and it would have an impact on the rate spell and their children 's rates fall and their children 's children 's rates ball but so these things are not they don 't come without a price sure and I guess that was my little chip on the insurance is that we were disappointed in terms of the you know what we were able to obtain but there were a number of challenging issues not least of which the fact that the land had been allocated for a stadium to be built elsewhere when you 're trying to negotiate over technical issues such as still strain yeah so the thing that worries me is that there 's an expectation that the 253 million dollars that we have on our books will be sufficient to meet what people believe will be a thirty-five thousand seat and or enclosed arena when in fact the cost-sharing agreement shows that that 's not possible to be achieved for two hundred and fifty three million there 's an expectation you know there are some of money will come in from the private sector so the nth degree business case it 's about how do you make this not a burden on the people of Christchurch forever and ever yeah and and literally we understand that statement it makes perfectly good sense to us what what what we 've I guess been stuck if that 's the right word has been that that conversation has been really hard to have yeah because it 's been trapped in this is this is not needed or this is not necessary or this is extravagant or you can do without it or look what you 've got out there anyway and and just pushing the whole thing away I think it 's entirely legitimate to have a proper conversation about what in what cost and what it looks like and what other things should be in there to help the financial model work but we 're really open about that conversation rather than tucking all that away inside the sort of pushing the project out of the way is no soap so we are we give yet we give and and what that will do is that because be an LTP conversation to bring it forward yeah and that will enable us to have that conversation with the people of Christchurch in a very explicit way and we will know what those costs really are yeah yep yeah Jonnie then ton thank you and thank you for the submission I was going to ask about when your survey whether you ask people what what their priorities were for the city rather than just the stadium but I think the mayor 's already touched a little bit on that so um I guess at a high level the government was supposed to do the business case so that 's beyond our control there was what was in the cost year they haven 't done it know this because we pushed it as nothing Jonnie as I understand that was stopping the government from doing that work we pushed it out so she at the June 2016 we do pushed it out on 2015 so anyway we oh yeah we would we were told we would get briefings we never got briefings yeah things have happened but the I can I guess I was interested to know in terms of the future of professional sports which does seem to be the kind of bigger issue in terms of a city and in terms of the ratepayers where do you see professional sports going what sort of declining attendance declining TV you know there 's already and raising salary so TV for rugby is not declining attendance is not declining so we but but do you want me to predict thirty or fifty years time I don 't know quite how to do that what I do know is that sport in general and professional sport is only one little piece of sports that 's the tip of the iceberg if you like is is still a very very important part of many people 's lives and I I foresee that it will continue to be so and that 's just the sport and if you look if you think about a multi-purpose arena that might attract concerts and exhibitions and other community events and I 'd urge urge you perhaps to read the history of Lancaster park and it isn place of a size there attracts particular vents that otherwise wouldn 't be there and so the future of sport I think is secure in our psyche whether it is between one sport and another whether you have lean years and then great years all of that is probably true but none of it can be celebrated property if you haven 't got the platform to do it yeah my question was really around like this seems to be an increasing demand on ratepayers to subsidize professional sports we 're getting into betting Ward 's with other cities around New Zealand and it doesn 't seem very sustainable from a financial point of view now maybe those things that you 've said are true but the reality for us as as you know the public purse as we seem to be getting increased requests for funding to subsidize professional sports yeah I don 't know if they 're Swami 's promoters we want the All Blacks to play here at costs you know it does that then perhaps it costs at the moment because because we 've got a temporary goes on between different venues so we 'll be in competition with Dunedin yeah we 'll be in command they 've must out too but you know in terms of in terms of the cost and professional sport and it 's not just rugby union rugby league 's the same I mean all of the professional sports and they get us to bid against each other as cities in regions that 's right and build bigger rooms I guess stadiums because otherwise they won 't come and it just seems to me that there 's a really fundamental question around the sustainability with a financial model of professional sports which is why we want this pre-feasibility to kind of address a number of these issues I heard the minister say very explicitly that he does not want to see this as the the former minister as a burden on the ratepayers of Christchurch I am of one mind with the minister on that because I do not want to go out and promote a burden on the ratepayers of Christchurch and I think around the world there are some fantastic them their help with with the financial model and and you can just look just google it and there 's just anything you can think of that 's attached to the stadia build hotels hotels shopping and retail hospitality there 's just so so in our submission we 've said that 's rightly in my view that the council should be deciding that part of the city most needs in terms of other facilities and then you can easily put that with an arena build and get the benefits of that to mitigate the costs that would otherwise fly that 's what we 're asking the yeah that the trust today at 10 I think it 's just a very simple question as you guys are clients or users of the temporary stadium because I see it from the other side what do you think that 's life spinners as it is because we know the costs are rising etcetera look to be absolutely honest I don 't think I can sit in the council chamber and answer that question I don 't know I 'm not an engineer I we hear all the same things in the community that I 'm sure you all hear as you move around all sorts of dates get quoted quite merrily I don 't know what is true what we do know is that the maintenance costs on an exponential curve upwards and as you would expect with the temporary facility it 's starting to cost a lot to keep it open more ways of lumber thank you very much one thing that we 've done just to add to that for you for your two tumors that we have we 've said that will work as close as we can with the current stadium trust to help make the the business for them in terms that temporary stadium work and work for us so we 're going to we 're on a temporary arrangement with them but we 're going to look at look to put in place a more a more commercial arrangement going forward that ensures that we can do our bit to help mitigate that cost going forward in the interim while the business case and there may be we don 't want there to fall over it 's critical for our business as well it 's critical for our community to have it and we 'll do our bit to make sure we keep it going we can do it in and that 's why that pre feasible is so important to have all the parties absolutely cool I think you can would commit and if the Crusaders keep paying away that they are you know become farmers are doing all we can exit or abroad okay well thank you very much that 's much appreciated thank you Tom could I invite the multi-purpose arena trust barry meister meister sorry and john marshall oh no Mary you 're neither me thank you very much we appreciate the opportunity to submit to you and a good opportunity to follow on from faun Hamish and grant because much of what they were saying we are saying perhaps in a different language in a different tone but philosophically we are absolutely in support of the submission that they have made because I just introduced myself very most of the chair of of which are here tonight Jeff Saunders Stuart Mitchell Natalie Thane milk and Hudson David Kennedy and Tom Craig who 's our adviser and that group is a group of passionate vibrant can 't abeyance who have said about the task of establishing that we work with central government and local government to to help develop a major event strategy for Christchurch which includes as its core component the multi-purpose arena which we 're focused on we envisage as you 've already indicated a high-tech care facility a covered facility a landmark facility as an anchor project for the East frame of Christchurch incorporating several elements which we see you will determine needed for the city we have a wide range of local stakeholders who have either approached or have come to us we do not represent them here tonight but we are the group de-facto it that they have come to us and indicated strong support and that includes sports groups hospitality sector facility management groups cultural groups commercial interests and the like all of whom have been in touch with our group to indicate support for what we mixture of anxiety and in optimism anxiety in the thought that the temporary stadium might outlive its temporary life before we have a multi-purpose arena in place leaving our city without a major events facility and that means being left behind which concerns us but we 're optimistic in the sense that the recent announcement about the pre-feasibility study together with the published comment from the council that you will look at moving this up timeline forward we our trust is already met with the key leaders of the feasibility group and we have committed our full support our sharing of what we have the context that we have built up so that it 's a seamless operation we are right behind the work that they do and I want to be seen to be supporting it we appreciate that you as a council have had lots of different needs over the last six years and you 've prioritized those and we respect that and we understand that fully but we 'll also want you to understand that the timeframe to build this facility as we understand it would be to completion would be four to five years and that takes us out to 2021 at the earliest the four we could even have this multi-purpose facility and that is very likely that by that stage the temporary facility will have outlived its temporary life and so there is a potential for that period of time and we don 't have a facility and while is a cost of building there 's also a cost of not having a facility for Christchurch you will have read as I have about the Ed Sheeran concert in Dunedin of the last week attracting 70 to 80 thousand people over a two night gig we want to ensure that Christchurch is the major event capital of the South Island if not New Zealand we are fortunate we believe that we have a piece of purchased inspired piece of land purchased by the government in the East frame which sits logically waiting for development to occur I in my work work with major events groups in New Zealand major events in New Zealand so I can look around the country and I can see and we surely as Christchurch and as Canterbury as a region want to ensure that we are part of that major event strategy which is growing momentum as people are seeing increasingly the value of major events for their cities and we are keen to contribute to that we would like to show you a brief video that video this video was put together prior to the feasibility study being commissioned and it was very much put forward as a concept as a thought provoker as a catalyst generator for ideas the things that you will see in this video are neither costed nor researched we didn 't intend to do that it is not our role but we wanted to start a conversation with Christchurch people which you may be able to you will use in your in your discussion process to say hey these things are possible they may not be the priorities for the city and therefore they may be abandoned but there are things in here that we think will stimulate discussion as a catalyst for what we 're about would like to now show the video and outline some of the features of it as we go through thank you let me think [Music] sweet delights christchurch is in the unique and exciting position of delivering a truly urban community multi-purpose hub a people place a place that goes beyond a singular sport centric iconic build to one that literally and metaphorically engages with all the people of Christchurch on the South Island to be truly multi-purpose the engagement should incorporate corporate and social spaces that can be utilized seven days a week a design to be used to host sports and non sport related events providing vibrant and active gathering spaces [Music] a mixed-use development has the opportunity to influence the city 's thinking at both a macro and micro level addressing architecture urban planning landscape and transport a design specifically with the local community and mind to introduce commercial and entertainment benefits a world-class venue will help improve the competitive position of Canterbury and the northern South Island when attracting major events to the city both sporting and non sporting [Music] a carnival atmosphere before and after live events [Applause] [Music] [Music] exhibition mutton die stools a place with family and friends can gather planning for a truly multi-purpose arena will give Christchurch the opportunity to revive and becoming as an exciting amalgam of engagement dialogue planning that seats a benchmark for understanding and delivering a unique and iconic statement for the city thank you could I say that the video was produced through our own fundraising not through any other sponsorship and we understand it it 's well known that stadia per se in themselves don 't generate income but what I hope we 've given you a sample of is that if you took a number of those catalyst ideas up there and thought they fitted with the long term plan for the city that could become closer to a break-even Enterprise we have no evidence of that but we 're putting the ideas up which need to be investigated in the next stage which is what we intend to do so in conclusion we we want to make ask you three things or ask for a council think three things first of all we would like a philosophical and a one we would like is an appreciation that this facility needs to be started as soon as possible because of the timeline that 's referred to and the costs to the city of not having a major events facility for a period of time if we don 't start immediately and the third one is an understanding that our trust will continue to work as a group of passionate enthusiasts at Canterbury uns to promote ideas to share what we have to work with those who are making the decisions and to represent people that come to us and put those ideas into the mix so that we can ensure that Christchurch remains the event capital for the South Island at least if not New Zealand thanks very much thank you I will ask him but I just want to highlight one thing in your submission paragraph 12 and the original cost share agreement the council committed to half the cost of the new stadium 253 million central government have committed the same there isn 't accurate central government had not committed 253 million dollars to the stadium they 've a position to meet the business case which is yet to be done of meeting the requirements over a closed stadium so and we haven 't committed to half the cost our costs are capped at 253 if the first option is chosen which is the covered one so I just remind people I think and that 's what worries me is is that people 's expectations have been put way up here and we 're now left with the really hard decisions we can only bring it forward on our LTP after a special consultative procedure which is the long-term plan process but and that 's the purpose of the proposed the work that the stadium trusts are doing in terms of the pre-feasibility which is to look at those options how can we make this pay for itself so that we can achieve the objective without going across across that line or even getting underneath that line would be my personal preference leaning Thank You Barry just to be a bad pop from it I note so the big day arrives aligns to a as rare as hen the Highlanders have a covered stadium but they end up with a match of the Highlanders vers lions we have a temporary stadium we have Crusaders vs. lions there 's no guarantee that we could end up with the big matches as there in just because we have a covered Stadium absolutely not and it 's not for me to make that judgement anyway but if you go to England all the test matches seem to be played at tooken them so they don 't spread them around the country so that 's that 's a possible scenario for the future but surely out our task is Kent Aryans is to position give ourselves the best chance of major events including rugby tests I didn 't know whether we would stand up if we had a thirty thirty five thousand stadia where that would be sufficient I don 't know the answer to that but it gives you a sort of a shot of being in there I suggest that our current stadium does not do that okay you know I haven 't seen and I 'm sure the trust any specifics over the deterioration of the current Stadium I could take it at face value I can see the rust and research piece the paper I can 't find the paper I can find that Dunedin study done by that company but I can 't find the paper and also note the sample isn 't even a thousand people so I want a bigger start which is to give it greater you know validity is in terms of a survey but so what which server your parent this is the survey that 's for that you refer to and you 're submitting yeah yeah yeah yeah so I mean obviously since that survey was instigated and the establishment of our trust which has only formally taken place at the beginning of this year we 've built up quite a wide number of stakeholders and we 'll continue to grow that and that will certainly be a vehicle I think going forward that will be useful for the council okay points take good we 've heard from the mayor the position on on funding 253 million zaire cap and in interest from a number of groups there 's there any sort of indication of investment private investment that may come forward out of those discussions no we haven 't_''_3082.369 we haven 't put that proposition to people we haven 't been working with them on that basis we 've been establishing a need establishing a need but in that sort of conversation do you get the feeling that there is a willingness of some groups to perhaps invest absolutely absolutely and from outside interests and overseas interests Devon look thank you think I say that we also do accept me or your comment about the government funding we do actually understand that post post our submission where you understand their position ya know that thank you very much thank you thank you Sam great great video to UM Kennedy 's Bush Road Neighborhood Association you know these Bush Road neighborhoods sylvia looky not here give it chick done either Diamond Harbor Community Association Richard Saget it 's on page duty welcome right thank you I 'm cure akuto couture thank you for the opportunity to present talk to our submission the smaller community issues anyway we 'll see what we can do to keep you interested for the next ten minutes the first part of our submission addresses the what I saw as being what we saw as being in the draft plan and I 'll just highlight a few things in there that are more interest than than others but just overall just aside we 're always grateful that there is that money coming towards the southern base so with the portent of those sort of allocations the first ones that hit the head walkway we don 't seem to get much clarity as to where the next piece of work is to be we understood that there was work to be done between the very damaged track between Chad Rose Bay and Parral but would really like to know is that money coming to do that or some other piece of the harbor very supportive of the continuing investment in the wastewater lyttelton harbour project to get the wastewater out of lyttelton harbour and really pleased that the council 's made steady progress was that just a slight 689 thousand in the coming year and then further big chunk of money we don 't know what that 's for and as I live in Faro Avenue I 'm actually quite curious as to why a very large amount of money is being spent on our wastewater there two other items just down the bottom just in terms of the track and signage work very pleased to have that set aside that relates to delayed work that 's in the sonic starter point reserved management plan that we really haven 't had any funding over the last few years so it 's good to see some money coming through there now actually what I did need to do was meant me to start start my presentation by just to congratulating the council on what it has done in diamond harbour in the last year and the two most significant things that it 's done is actually renovated the community hall at considerable expense and renovated the Stoddard historic Stoddard cottage and both of those have been reopened and so the community is very grateful that the earthquake renovations and council 's work in the last year the next section relates to the that Staller point and coastal reserve management plan that hasn 't had a lot of funding and effort in recent years but overall I 'm pleased to see that those items are listed there some of those actually now starting to be indicated as being action under the under the allocation in the draft plan point for that 's to do was actually green waste and diamond Harbert so it 's a long way for people to take their green waste around from the southern bays to the transfer stations in Christchurch we have in the past there was those council financial support for a subsidy for chipping and last year we went to the community board to get a subsidy and got got some contribution there we 'd really like to see that and it 's continued in the interim until such time as perhaps the council came on board the waste management people in the council came on board and and talked with locals and possibly like something some organization like the organ Bradley Trust composting facility put in in somewhere only the southern base but in the interim really if you don 't have something like shipping to reduce the amount of green waste you tend to get a lot of it thrown over the edges into council reserves the reality I 'm point-five godly house site planning now I just once again I 'd like to thank the the contribution of the council planners to assisting the community with the preparation of a Community Action Plan there was a five-year effort to achieve that and we have a document that 's been finalized it sets out ten ten priorities for the community and we 're working through those with the council so we have a completed document some stage I hope the community board and formally actually puts that in front of the council the other project we 've been working on and whether the council plan is actually the preparation of a concept plan for the whole area and we definitely want to see that put in front of the whole council and we 've made very good progress to get to putting that to the community board and there 's been a lot of community consultation once again it 's a five-year post-earthquake effort a bit like the little team consultation process the Sumner consultation process the River consultation process and it 's been very much driven by an automatic unity effort with support from council staff and we very much like to talk to the council about the final product and the the project that 's come out of that that 's of most importance to us next having made this good progress on the planning is something to be done about the godly house site so we 'd like to further engage with the council on that we think that the site does deserve something it it was obviously an important facility for the council and historic resource we 'd like the site which we hold temporary concerts on to have a multi-purpose facility not necessarily massive but something that can incorporate indoor and outdoor concert facilities and the temporary cafe that we 've now got sort of part tunes and containers to the side of it but we to be the next project we 'd like the council to work with us on and the last point was just acknowledging the great work that the council has done in the contractors to upgrade the community hall which is very heavily used for various community sporting and cultural activities and there 's a bit more work saw to be done in that with redone this next financial year or later you 're not sure but there 's still accepted by the council staff have been dealing words that the toilets and the foyer area still needs further work so that 's my sort of articulation of what is on our minds slipped you some time for questions thank you thank you very much I mean I have to say that I always look forward to these submissions you know that because they 're genuinely from the community they 've not that that end they 're very it 's not about coming to the council and saying do this do this do this as what we can do together and it just yeah it does does hearten me I have able to answer some of your questions and our response to your submission I mean obviously I can 't tell you what what bit of the head heads being progressed through this particular funding Andrew probably knows that cuz he knows everything off by heart and has in his ward so but so we 'll be able to answer all those questions but I really picked up also that you want a little bit better communication around some of the projects that we have on budget and your area and there you as an association would be more than happy to distribute them and organize for you know engagements to discuss them if people wanted to raise issues with am I reading that career absolutely it 's a bit heaviness sometimes we get really good engagement prior engagement and sometimes things arrive out of the blue right yeah but mystifying hmm and sometimes it 's sort of relayed the community board but then doesn 't filter down to us so thank you I Pauline David then I know you 're running on the smell of an oily rag but you wondering do you have any idea of what would help was this in relation to the reserve management committee yes yes um they certainly need at least a few thousand dollars to to essentially buy essential equipment and to 2,000 or 20,000 no no something like two thousand dollars will keep them going because they actually the reserve staff have actually been very good in terms of a specific requests for work to be done on the ground managing the fine things within the budget I think I 've got a suspicion this might actually be possibly dealt the moment decision to actually fund something to a pot before that for the committees the basement your doTERRA teas yeah yeah I think that 's true yeah but we 'll certainly follow up on me yeah David did you look I just wanted to reinforce that comment about communication with the local residents it was evident today and our bus trip around the coastal and build wards where there was the odd project that I 'm not being critical of staff I realize there 's a huge number of projects going one is slipping through the cracks in terms of local communities not finding out about things until they just actually Evan yeah but I mean I think that 's something that we 're all very very conscious of is the need to engage communities in a better way you know in terms of what 's going on Andrew thank you and thank you very much indeed for the submission the item five godly house site planning I 'm assuming that the community wants to work in partnership with the council on this so that we get the the best results how do you how do you see this panning out moving forward how would the diamond have a community like to work with the council in order to deliver something that really works in the long term for that godly house site well probably you go back some five years now the year after the earthquake we had a share an idea session and the community very strong one dinner and a lot of ideas came out and they 've actually been incorporated into the planning document that I 'm idea is to actually pair those ideas down to those that are realistic capable of achieving in some form of budget with also possibly a private partnership if we 're talking about a cafe and in working with council making some sort of commitment to actually doing something so for the last six years the council has carefully avoided the subject where they 're prepared to put any of that insurance money they got for godly house site actually back into doing something on the site and so this and that we prepared with council staff has a blank spot on it called godly house site so we want to see the blade spot fill that well otherwise the councillor to come to us and say in the end well we 're just not going to put anything there and suck it up but we 're not really getting any communication engagement we haven 't over the last five years on the matter except to the fact actually we have received notice that there is a conservation report historic conservation report on the site about to represent of the community governance people to help set up a meeting about that so we 're all now very happy to engage very happy to put forward the ideas have been working with and it 's this matter of engagement yep very good all right thank you very much thank you for your time and occurring in this evening okay thank you now the Peter Townsend dice to understand you 're here on behalf of the Christchurch children 's Christmas parade thank you madam and greetings everybody yes I am I 'm Peter Townsend executive the Canterbury and post hammer of Commerce and the Canberra impose Chamber of Commerce is a trustee of the Christchurch a children 's Christmas parade trust I 'm here for a really simple request here tonight I 'm here to put certainty into the Christmas parade we 're going to need your help your ongoing help in the context of what has been a long and truly collaborative relationship to ensure that the finances are available for the trust for the next two years the Christmas parade as you will have seen from the submission has been in the Christchurch City Council has supported financially supported the Christmas parade through the auspices of a trust and there are people around here that have assisted us all the way through that journey and there are people here that have been here right from beginning of the transition of the Christmas parade about being a council completely council controlled entity right through to being running as a young independent trust we the problem with God is that the the trust has 40 floats it has a thousand over a thousand costumes and it has two it has to house those throughout the year it also is involved in traffic management and as various piece of plan that have to be stored it is a total cost of about 120 1000 K a year the total cost of the parade is about two hundred thousand dollars a year and that parade is driven totally by voluntary commitment apart from the council 's ongoing support from 2013 to 2015 the council supported ninety seven thousand seven hundred fifty dollars per year 2016 that dropped to 69 thousand and at the moment there hundred thousand dollars this year what we would like to see is a hundred thousand dollars locked in this year this coming year in the following year and we see that is absolutely critical to ensure that the parade can continue without that support the parade will not be there after 71 years so the the funds requested post December 2018 are likely to be markedly reduced because the trust has we had recently and has it access to a property that at a minimal cost can house the floats and the costumes which obviously saves the fig in of 100,000 Connect property is the New Zealand school of gymnastics so in short we need council support with effect from the beginning of July 2017 and and this trust needs the cash it needs it quickly cash flows tight and support is critical it is an iconic event and its event that and will require the council support for the next two years really hard to imagine Christchurch without us Christmas parade it 's an integral part of our city it 's one of the iconic events that attracts over thing is driven by voluntary input and voluntary contribution by well-meaning people in our community and of course it has a really strong focus on family and children the port the parade does need certainty the council is the only entity that can provide that certainty and as I said in short we 're asking for support to be locked in 2017-2018 hundred thousand dollars 2018-2019 hundred thousand dollars from December 2018 after that parade we are quite confident that we 'll be able to markedly reduce council dependency absolutely important that the council makes this commitment to ensure the vitality and the continuity of the parade thank you and I was looking at this and I couldn 't couldn 't see we 're all your sponsorships are and I can see main freight producers unkind and I presume we 're producing the traffic management and kind derby well a part of had a historically part of the council contribution has been to contribute to the traffic management the total cost of traffic management and the storage of the floats and things about 120,000 a year well I was gobsmacked what we were paying for was the cost of storage and I don 't_''_4116.62 I think the people crushed it to be surprised that that was the cost you know it 's a high cost and it needs to be resolved and we hope that from December 2018 it will be yeah and I know that council race raised this the other day that they look like be a win-win outcome as far as that is concerned and there have been various options looked at at alternatives for storage including some council own properties but none of those have come to fruition but we look as if now look looks as if we 've got a solution what we haven 't got is the funding to see us through to having that solution realized and there 's no sponsorship available near the sponsorship but the council has always been me to support the children 's parade it is seen to be into care and share and these other people contributes always seem to be a council event and actually that that doesn 't it was a haze event well a dropped out of being a council of it it 's a problem we 've got is that it seemed to be a Council of whether or not it is or isn 't so it seemed to be the Christchurch City Council is the the key instigator off the Christmas parade and makes it quite difficult for private sponsorship if we dropped off council support there is no way as this parade will continue no I 'm not suggesting that we should drop it off so I ask that this come forward as a proposal that we make it a line item and this is not a proposal to make it a line item it 's actually a better proposal that 's to give it secure the funding for teachers so that the suburb pitchers can be made and the problem that that was confronting us as a new council was that the events and festivals fund has a finite sum inert and the numbers of people seeking to have their events and festivals supported by the Christchurch City Council far outweighed the amount of money that was in there and we reduce the amount that was claimed or thought last time and in the only way that I could see beyond that was to line-item up but salmon so it 's a total cost of 200,000 a year of which we 're looking for fifty percent support from the council all right Peter with the festival 's finally we get more and more pressures you know every year just like any other group it 's harder and harder to get sponsorship but with the expertise and available to the chamber ourselves and the trust there must be a way for us all to work together to try and and improve or help or assist or look for benefits with regards to fear the sponsorship so I know that you know some can see the council 's you know the City Council as being as you just mentioned hard for sponsors to get on but others see it as a real positive so there must be a way around here you look what my we 'll be prepared to talk to the chamber about the ship opportunism kind commitment to this 're right but we we have a we have they 've tried really hard to get this thing financially independent and and we think we 've got the answer in December 2018 to markedly reduce the cost yeah 80 90,000 a year reduction costs would mean that we wouldn 't be coming cap in hand to the council what we 've got is not a line item request as the mirrors pointed out it is a two-year request for 100,000 a year to give this thing certainty and the and the other option is untenable the other option is that it stops this this trust runs out of money in July mmm this year a perky um info Becky but so this actually comes to the committee on Wednesdays so are you suggesting a hundred a hundred and then what 's year three year three is is not not well if we can if we can land this an accommodation that saves us ninety thousand dollars a year so year three year three we 're not asking for anything what we 're asking for is we 're a hundred thousand three you don 't want anything not at this stage I 'm almost certain if this goes really okay and just in terms of where the parade goes yeah because it 's currently down record and Road are you intending to bring it back into town yeah would great to have it back into town but I don 't think that 's something out control I think it 's under yours is that are you okay if it is under our control so what a chairperson says if we can get back to town which only love to get back to things only something that we can ask staff to report back on yeah our Phil thanks Peter I 'm just wondering in fact if that Christmas parade has really become so like it almost a victim of its own success and that as a parent and now grandparent I 've got like everybody else in Christchurch have gone along for many years and it 's got much much bigger like it 's a really nice component and recently is has been the multicultural aspect we all are different cultures they 're all sort of increase the cost in terms of for example things like traffic management and yeah your traffic traffic management costs have increased but of the total traffic management is about fifteen sixteen thousand dollars a year that 's that 's an expensive thing but the overall cost hasn 't increased in fact it 's converse because the more people we get involved the more volunteers we can get involved the more support we can get the more people that will sponsor in-kind various parts so it 's it 's not a victim of its own success it as an extraordinarily successful parade which runs on as I quote in the submitted vs submitters the smell of an oily rag huge voluntary commitment people getting doing an enormous amount of work just because they believe in the parade and it just needs to get through these next two years it just you see it through this patch and and as I said it 's untenable to think that it wouldn 't take yeah right if you have a question that 's good thank you very much thank angle field residents association welcome thank you um my name is I Rinker brignall and this is Robin corty a committee member and we 're here today on behalf of the Engel field residents Association a neighborhood group that is passionate about heritage buildings and places we also connect to the oetiker Oh Aven River and were the first group to consult the tongue adiphene wha about protection of the riverbanks from traffic in our area and also to identify Maori heritage sites in our area under former Muir McVicker buck it was Bill karate Ana who made the submission to the council in 1992 not long after the crisis City Council 1991 policy to consult with local Maori I would like to acknowledge and think counselor Dion swigs who came to an ingre field committee meeting recently to assist us understand the draft annual City plan thank you that was really helpful the main points we wish to remind the council are if we 're serious about saving our heritage the council needs to put a lot more financial and educational effort earng where are the same the special of heritage areas some of our area is recognized by the Historic Places Trust but meaningless without teeth we want to see here is heritage trees put back on the council listing not taken off why were they removed there should be an audit of our heritage and natural environment it has value we have an agreement with the council for heritage willows to be replaced with willows in our area one needs replacing both fits George Avenue and even side Drive and another by Hemnes Street why are the hundred and eighty five trees along River Road coming out and there have been some badly hacked trees we 're not sure by who but there 's some photos we also have concerns about the increase of traffic on even side Drive and fear traffic will divert down there of through access has closed off it was the street at Fitzgerald Avenue a jetty was promised by the by the council many years ago in an out of environment court settlement we 're still waiting for the council to honor this agreement in the redzone regeneration plan we note there area we would like to see a heritage trail through here reminding us that the styles of homes and preserving as much of the original trees and gardens as possible I 'm just making point set pedestrians and cycles on the same path are an unsafe mix we see Eastside neglect and want to see more effort to save the traditional shops of Linwood Village with one of the best butcher shops around for miles among the other interesting and necessary amenities of the area the shops have been reduced to half in shrinking this is also a heritage area and its own right and it would be a tragic loss to the aging ailing lower socioeconomic community of this area we hope our presentation will assist you to make positive decisions for our area and the city and in closing Robin would like to say about the Cathedral well would like to see the Cathedral faith the church may own it but the ratepayers stakeholders may players had contributed to the maintenance for many many years so that was just a few points about to assist you to have no specific budget requirements but we 'd like to see more money put into heritage and more enthusiasm we 're very enthusiastic our porting week worry about the GT we plan to go I didn 't hear to fit well um quite a few years ago probably about I don 't know um I haven 't actually got this blue we had an invite it was around the year 2001 and there was an out of court environment settlement out of environment court settlement set one of the things that we could get would be a GT down close to the maybe Stanwell Road bridge on the other side on River Road and the idea was for tourists or anybody to be able to come down the river and on the punting boats or something like that and be able to land and walk around on the Heritage Trail of area which has got the Heritage rose garden and Beverly Park the well unfortunately the historic Trinity Church fell over a means and the earthquakes but it still got the little hole there in the graveyard in a lot of area and then people there are walking tours that come through there and Robin actually hosts a lot of walking in garden to us in that area and people who are interested in the old worka cottages and Henman gurbin ha Street I think that would be with some mm-hmm Dion thank you for coming along it 's good to hear um and good to raise those points but could you just let us know a little bit about what you 're worried about with the Wooster Street closing for for your neighborhood just we think that it will probably push more traffic coming down aid inside Drive as a diversion it will be going down Wooster Street but we noticed an increase in traffic on even so I Drive once Latimer Square was closed and yeah it 's used improbably and because I live we live in Hema Street and you can see it bumper-to-bumper vir at night and in the morning already so I don 't know but we 're just saying originally when we consulted with tango Dafina we 're in 1992 they also were concerned about everything it 's because the very narrow river bank there so yeah that 's the specific concerns about traffic coming into our area yep any other questions hmm all right thank you very much thank you very much Michael Britten all [Music] eighth note now basically I 'm just going to talk for a few minutes major concern is the shopping center known as the limbered village on the corner of Wooster Street and stem wall Road there 's a circle way being put down down the road and there is concerned about loss of car parks and this sort of thing but the major concern is now is the imminent closing of Wooster Street at Fitzgerald ev2 traffic going up and down Wooster Street so as cutting off access to the main base system so anybody going wanting to get onto the one way or come off them I may go down there as the previous submitters have said this traffic is now going to be pushed onto the adjacent streets neither Hereford cluster I am our raw Haven side Drive and the loss of that traffic to the at the moment our concern is the survival if that can be achieved then there is the revival prospect originally they did put have a limit village plan they looked at putting together without much thought that seems to have been overlaid by the cycle way plan which just wipes out any idea of the previous plan for the survival of it because if we haven 't got Daris over my cows going up the earth well if we haven 't got the shoppers it only takes one or two percent knocked off the top of any of those businesses to put them out of business it 's as simple as that previous speakers talked about the butcher shop she was in near the other day there shaky wondering what today most of the other businesses in there operated by new arrivals to New Zealand immigrants various from various places not over them totally ofay with how the system works or maybe maybe have some language difficulties so they haven 't necessarily been able to get involved in the process of what 's going on in their area totally they you call an inept or plan to fail on our behalf anyway because it was non-existent I myself run a couple of businesses and Westar Street at the other end no consultation came to us the consultation decision was to stop the consultation process at the intersection for us so the last block wasn 't even told what was going on didn 't concern us apparently though according to the act anybody who is to be affected must be consulted so this is not the council rules these are not something that you guys have dreamed up this is an act of Parliament which is not being followed to the letter therefore not properly people are missing out we missed out we didn 't get the opportunity to on the last day that there was four submissions we found out about the proposal we didn 't really have time to consider much we rushed in managed to check something in and get involved but basically too late so the the things I 've got here as well but I 'll just check in here is it wasn 't full here like a petition it 's a brief statement it 's been signed by about I think it 's about 1819 businesses and about six community groups that are involved in our local area it wasn 't gathered for presentation at this particular stage but I want to present it now anyway there is one or two other people that want to sign up there we haven 't managed to catch up with and all of these people are basically just the businesses doesn 't the general public to such those businesses are believe they can be affected and other groups we 've spoken also to the school on Gloucester Street who would like to join this this particular action but of course they 've got to put it back through the board and that 's a bit of a process before they can sort of get firmly involved then there 's a couple other businesses that are we just haven 't managed to connect with to get a signature but they do want to be involved so basically it 's everybody everybody here is in total fear that they are and near family security is all going to go down the tube because for some reason someone that the council has decided that that sitted lights has to be stopped for the circle way they 're going to stop transit for cars up and down west of the street but they 're still going to have to have a satellites for the cycles and the pedestrians so where 's the advantage and if they 're saying that it 's that one of the theories is that it 's going to speed up progress of vehicles going up and down fish or death but how 's that going to work we 've taken all the cows that were on Wooster Street and put them into the next set of lights and he referred in Gloucester and if it 's about pollution that we 're creating these cycleways net house they can work when all these extra cows are now sitting at the lights across the street and so it now takes you four sets of rotations to get through the lights instead of two so how 's that going to work we got the cows instead of just cruising up down there now they 're parked at the city lights on this on the next street so it 's it 's mainly nonsensical there has been no cost-benefit analysis done there was no numbers there was no figures not even those how many bike riders there are in Christchurch little own Hemi bikes are how many were sold at last year how many you 're anticipating to sell this year what how many is is going to be ten years time there 's nothing so basically we want something done because this is the destruction of one of the oldest little shopping zones in town and the other thought is on some people 's minds this what does the council doing trying to shut it down because they 're you know they don 't want competition for the inner city which is now struggling and is going to struggle because part of your submission is it 's in fact where is the opportunity for these small businesses to get started to operate in town they 're not going to be intent there are going to be they 're all businesses who are going to be in town or have already got previous experience of some sort money behind them maybe a name that the built up over years and now they 're moving into town but for some small you know someone wants died in a dress shop I don 't think they 'll be doing it in Christchurch central there 's not many shops left I own some shops down on the corner of La medev which I was planning on effexor I 've spent money on architects and engineers we 've got all lined up to do it but I 'm not sure whether we will now want to throw the extra money at doing it what for I mean who is there even a value and me doing it because originally we wanted to restore those shots so we could say well here 's some shops that are going to still be available for people at a reasonable price we 're a new business might be able to get in and give it a go but now they whatever traffic was left they 've had hemily goes the head of Wooster Street they 've knocked it off at Linwood ev they 've gone down at that stage we 're running business they 're just about half the business and quite a few businesses went out at Stanwell road at the time then they went down to let him ask where they knocked it off there about another half the businesses that were at Stanwell Road fell off okay and there was there was blank shops there there were just the Front 's were just blanked off though we use for nothing for storage and that 's how it was something to leave earthquake and now we 're going to what just say now we 've got empty property debt we 've got who are the owners going to want to rebuild their property or for if they can 't rent it out they can 't go into debt if the person can 't rely on having some customers drive past what 's going to happen and we is it just going to be some bike riders on the they can they can be going and now the butcher shop I don 't know I doubt it so what I say is quite frankly it 's a total fail with the design and and getting involved with the community to find out what is actually required there what 's needed what 's modern but the future potential is all the rest of it so there 's already been goodness knows how many people have gone bankrupt and gone where we don 't know what 's happened to them up there no one really cares they just disappear off the Mets and we so is that what is that the is that what it is for everybody else that I 've got on this list as that would be a destiny is not only not but look thank you very much the time oh just one other thing now you 've gone well over the five minutes I over done five minutes simply by working at the bus exchanges is non-existent if you 're a public if you remember the public trying to drop someone off and pick someone up a taxi stand or a bus or a bus stop another failed but a design work and that 's what happens when you try and rush all the stuff to three feet away quickly yeah this a small speed yes thank you very much thank you for that thank you right um next is Warren Haynes to Oh huh thank you I 've been a resident in rocks and terrace since 1993 that design work for the complete renewal of that Street involving the replacement of old dish channel footpaths booms and carriageway in and around the preservation of existing plane-trees was actively worked through by a council project team in an active residents association are throughout 2009 and 2010 the film from Waimea Community Board considered and approved the design on its 13th of July 2010 meeting and the works were scheduled for construction in the financial year first of July 2011 we appreciate what happened to our city from September 2010 onwards in October 2010 the council 's capital programs group wrote to Street residents a copies in the year to inform that due to extensive damage there program for nine months in February 2011 the earthquakes sequence continued with further damage to councils infrastructure however since 2010 there 's been no further contact with rocks and Terrace residents at least my knowledge by the capital where program crew I recently made a few calls to follow-up in advance of this submission to the annual plan with councils traffic operations team and it appears that rocks and Terrace isn 't at any stage in any current timeframe for the next ten years I believe I understand why there 's obviously other priorities we 're disappointed that our weight over recent years for council to bring the renewal back onto budgets is now seemingly in vain now the level of service criteria that triggered the need for Street renewal in 2010 has obviously changed but in my view is that is that council change of strategy has not been articulated well to residents if we cannot rely on council renewal mechanisms to fix our street how a residents to be assured that Council are dealing with repairs and maintenance is as a type of holding pattern strategy for managing of its roading assets that were once due for renewal now the reason it 's interact with councilors ratepayers to tell council there appears to be no logical transparent system of strategic maintenance versus various levels of street work renewal having waited for six years to get rocks and terraced renewal work to be actioned our council council law is now signalling that they would prefer to see residents use the request for service or report a problem function in its website to manage ratepayer street maintenance expectations my suggestion is that council insist on the settling of in-house transparent criteria to fairly assign the funds for repair and renewal and to re-engage with ratepayers like ourselves who do not understand what 's happening to their neighborhoods from a maintenance perspective they kind of just started to write some criteria but look the age and evenness of footpaths the cracks and repair history of foot x the RFS history foot footpath repairs accidents due to footpath condition our condition of carriage way including loadings and repair history and failure safety considerations for example is the street close to a school association and how do we fairly balance the expectations who perhaps paying more and rates per 10 meters of road compared to others if Council chooses to undertake works and certain streets how this influences property values compared to streets that have no perceived maintenance or in your works now just as a footnote and the last photograph fair that 's in the attachment take I am I was who suit because last Tuesday the carrots way over lay a Nashville tactually occurred an idris road and between idris road and jackson 's road along rocks and terrace it 's interesting the the contract works were done an asphalt what would have been done from a renewal perspective probably would have been chipped seal but in actual fact the Asheville was viewed as a bit a longer term maintenance solution for that particular section of Street I 'm a little perplexed about that but we 've still got large sections of dis channel down the street and a high standard of house and home renewals that are occurring emptying out on to the street that was ready for renewal and 's a number of other streets so I just courage council to sit about some transparent criteria and to communicate it to residents thank you when I when I read your submission I was actually really pleased with how you presented it because I mean I couldn 't agree with you more that they 're having a transparent set of criteria and a post-disaster environment would be much better than just saying nothing well in its effect I 've been I 've been sitting waiting for the renewal and the site this year I decided to make a submission to anyway it does because I mean you know I 'm obviously discuss it as a council but I really favor that what your your idea about the sorts of things that you might want to put into a set of criteria and I really want us to have a quite an open conversation about that I mean we 're not going to fix it overnight on the annual plan but we 're going into an LTP process next time and I think we could be much better prepared for that LTP yeah I I agree it 's very reactive inside your council at the moment well we come into the skirt program so there 's this you know the scope program has really driven that earthquake related damage and now it 's earthquake related damage we 'll be coming back to the council to prioritize is against renewals and it 's going to be hugely challenging which is why I really like the idea of having an agreed set of criteria which we could publicly consult on absolutely so I think you know thank you very much for your submission it 's much appreciated I 'm glad that you didn 't just sit at homeless time thank you thank you and look I 'm sorry but Tim Baker sent in a submission and somehow our system didn 't receive it so Tim could you come forward and and we 'll hand out hard copies of a submission but we won 't have that had the benefit of having read it first it 's okay so you alone are the only one who hasn 't heard your submission read before you away well hello all I 'm here today to talk about peer pressure and I just ask that all you people today don 't bow down to peer pressure but after you 've heard all the facts and questions and talked a lot of people make up your own lines without looking at peer pressure so I think I 'm probably the only one speaking against the hot water pools of Brighton and when the reasons I believe that is is because people I speak to who agree with me don 't want to talk out for different reasons and patter there is peer pressure so so it would have pause and Brighton the reasons I don 't agree with them as I don 't_''_6139.909 I think the best asset for Brighton as the carpark between the Surf Club and the whirlpool thousands of people got their impact their cars and look out and take your body boards out and play the kids it 's nice and safe getting back to your car and so that 's the I believe that 's the best they sit in Brighton we don going to regenerate Brighton I don 't believe that these shops are going to get any more patronage through people going to salt pools currently 10,000 people a month go on the pier but they shop in the mall likely I know here I don 't believe that 75,000 people in the first year and 50,000 people in the second year are going to be going to the polls and at 50,000 people a year it 's going to cost the ratepayers 100,000 sorry em it 's been across if there 's 50,000 people 's going to cost up at 2 million dollars a year for OPEX from the rate payer so what I 'm suggesting is let 's not put salt water pause here if you read that later on you 'll see also about the equation here the summary done by DCL and I pull it to pieces as well but look at yourself and decide for yourselves and I think also the council from last two input DCL and a hard position of trying to create something they can 't do and it 's where I 'm board the board as a whole had supported this hot would oppose me as an individual I 'm acting as an individual so instead of hot will oppose I just put down some thoughts and one of my thoughts is if you 're going to build a Turner square meter how as Toyota square meter shop and Brighton what 's it going to cost two million dollars let 's say it 's a million dollars how much do you want to get back when you return 10% 400,000 so I 'm going to pay somebody going to pay 100,000 rent I suggest not so what I 'm suggesting is let 's do the whirlpool of course not don 't worry about warm water or hot water kids don 't mind cold water and the playground area and their green space for example why not build a big hill and put 12 slides on it so my kids will say come on dad let 's go and plan the water pulling on the slides and go to the beach and then we may go to the mall as well afterwards and the mall we 've got a great master plan it 's got no money with it but it 's a really good plan so why not put some seeding money into foundations so say to those people are going to be building those companies say look we 'll pay for your foundations but you kept the routes at a reasonable rent so people can afford to they 're at least the builders and there 'll be a win-win for everybody so that 's all about the sale take questions for a minute and 34 seconds away David and thanks to look I ultimately support you will write to submit against the hot saltwater pools but what I 'm interested in you 've spoken to many people and many agree with what I 'm saying but look we 've had a number of submissions surveys commissioned by individuals commissioned by DCL commissioned by council all of which come back supporting the inclusion of hot saltwater pools and new brighton how many and how to use them how do you justify your comment that there are a number of people in opposition would suggest because what I 've done is I 've an atom 's in plus do you think there 's going to be swimming yes well if there 's not do you support them what I do you realize it 's not single we 're going in there what do you mean now they 're going to add salt water oh you know chlorine though yes salt water has chlorine so people aren 't aware of what 's being talked about what DCL and to what is going to be there and I know there 's gotta be consultation stuff like that but this is what people think we 've been told at DCL meetings is some more facts and they know so that so that 's talking to people about those things as how I can take conclusion but you would agree that you 're in quite a minority when you wonder water park and Brighton there was 20,000 signatures who would today support a water part in Brighton of 20,000 signatures would you bear out that pressure today probably the same 20,000 exactly thank you there you go it 's I also agree that with what David said absolutely right to present the point of view um Linda Linda Rutland I could even counselor me I 'm Jackie Maurice Wilkes peaked fist hmm thanks for giving us the opportunity to be here tonight we 're part of the Linwood college community partnership group we 've been working with Linwood college for a couple of years now just to help facilitate their reconnection with their local cohort and the wider community so our submission focused on the things that we thought would have a positive impact on the students who be attending than we College in the family so we were just wanted to endorse and say that we were delighted to see the budget allocation for the Rapanui shake rock cycle way also the Coastal pathway project our you know it 's going to make a huge difference for for local children to be able to cycle safely to school and given that all the stars are aligned with all the other wonderful things that are going on with the school at the moment that so it 's were we were pleased to see that there 's going to be some work done on intersection safety and around that area the main focus of tonight 's conversation with you is really to do with the Linwood Woolston Paul though and Linda 's going to talk a bit about that yes so um we noted was relief last years of planned expenditure and long to him in your plan and also the timeframe for their delivery of their and we 're really excited that 's great and we 're coming to you today just to urge you to keep to that timeframe and to keep that budget as you 've already signalled it 's hugely important for the community and everyone out there is very excited about it so we understand that it 's to be delivered the building will start in 2008 18 an April and be complete by December 2019 I 'm in a unique position to talk about just how long the children and families of this community have been waiting for the campus council investment and then as I was chair of the first Linwood board back in 2002 at some 15 years ago the reason board set up the subcommittee was in response to a deputation made by our dearest and now departed friend rod Donald rod brought to the board 's attention the absolute lack of a recreational resource there is and I 'm not only Linwood but the whole of the southeast area there 's no such facility from Scarborough right through to the study together we worked very hard on this issue and then way back then and finally in the 2007 annual plan we thanks to the hard work of counselor counselor identity '_''_6617.489 Rourke we were able to be successful put money on budget for a pool regrettably due to a very tragic accident we lost that money to the pepper new award which already had a fantastic swimming pool nearby in the form of jelly park we lost it due to the said an untimely death of Graham Condon um which was you know really said and understaffed er that happened dinosaur or lost his seat so um we were sort of a bit at sea to try is not history is that the children and youth from the Seri are still waiting for and are even more in need of a premium recreational space particularly Aquatic space unfortunately the Kilis community is not an active community as you know it 's got lots of issues it cannot get out here and be the squeaky wheel and so it 's why groups like have even set up to support the high school so you 've really got to look look hard at that community and what it needs we know that 's got the hole that the highest level of criminality running through it and the corridor and all sorts of social issues so to have a recreational facility like that aquatic pool would just be an awesome thing for kids to just take off and make yourself and get some joy in their lives um and it 's I think it 's also really important for the families of lung wood to just see that the council is giving equal to its giving resource where it 's given in other parts of the city so on the council to support this project by retaining the budget and the delivery time is previously announced to the community it 's finally allowed Rod Donald 's dream of a aquatic facility for the children of South East Christchurch to become a reality thanks very much okay Sara thank you as doesn 't say that some some of that background a lot of the council 's won 't of heard before and it 's not on the edge of submission he able to email that through to see chariot to come out to us yes like she was gonna yeah exactly the same thing that would be very helpful to have that because I didn 't know that there you know far back the history went either you know it 's been around a long time yeah Phil dear you 're not down you 're clean and Pauline or the both got the same haircut so thank you very much for your submission and particularly for that history which TV means a lot to everyone here I just I 'm just putting them for speak because you make the point that and I 'm just wondering how you might see the poor a pulse and Lynwood in conjunction with many others which counsel of it has also got requests for in particularly because we won 't have done a whole yeah I guess a whole assessment of all of the pools and the future operations costs by the time we sign off the annual plan so would you be open to making sure than fact all the pools but and potentially including one at one word that in fact they 'll be workable in terms of for example future operations costs and so that the scale of the pool actually would work for everybody well it 's just that when at the time when we were doing it the areas that were needing it were pepin air horn be an inland word and those areas of that actually being taken care of um and we accept home be home be and that 's it but they still got the horse will pop in my hay other way yes so I 'm Hornby 's got a huge present we 've lost Centennial we 've got virtually nothing we have got nothing and so it 's not just a matter of time it 's just our time and I just feel it 's an equitable to delay it even through that yes oh yeah like I guess like me could you can you push house noise it was a very very very good very cleverly drafted question but the answer was no no thank you would like to have the confirmation you just can 't tell a community we 're giving it to you were giving it to not do it I wasn 't implying it no no but it 's it I understand Phil 's question because there are you know multiple objects costs which go with all of the facilities you know and even though we 're replacing a metro facility with a local facility at qe2 we are we 're putting in a metro facility and to enter the CBD which is nowhere near the scale of what was there before was it continuous and the most popular swimming pool in facility there the City Council rent so so and 's quite clear that the a smaller community-based swimming pool for the Lynwood area is what you 're saying becomes a non-negotiable part of the future yes yeah it doesn 't you 're not saying about timing you 're not saying about you know but it 's got to stay and the plan is a non-negotiable here 's delivery well it is tight about timing I mean how long can you wait I mean I 'm talking 15 years my time and then I didn 't even know about the issue to rod came yet but we do have we have had earthquakes and various other I 'm sure Tony in it think about the metro facility it 's not going to really touch those kids in Lynwood because they just don 't have the cash to get get there and all the ability to get yeah we need to also look at how we transport cuts there because we should we should actually make sure that all of our kids get access to that facility and I 'm sure that any decisions that you make you know around cost consideration the need in the end the desire of a community to have a facility for their for their families yep yeah um so Glen in Pauline I thank you and thank you for this and I understand I think a Bob taught often to actually when you know learn what is mentioned but also think of each we 're Paul so they don 't have any as far as I 'm aware any kind of funding allocation capital wise you 've got any thoughts on this so there 's a long battle as you know so a jury is a community pool I can 't recall the detail why each poor Paul went down but why we lost up was that the earthquakes will previous rate oh it was previous yes yeah yeah so council we made a decision that that wasn 't need of them oh but the community rose up and they 've got some money as I understand it and now you were adding to that but that 's a much different scale to what we need inland work yes but I still did as far 's okay yeah but that issue rose up not just yet or the earthquakes yeah they 're also a different type of community yeah I 'm asking Linda yeah no no I don 't know this fair enough I might Jesus often the the thing I must admit that the submitters people in time to come home and yeah and say we 're the same time at Paul Ames slowly yeah noted one is here um congratulations on having lost partnership group that 's really great and mentioning the edge we 've pulled as a community project and that 's being lead by a charitable trusts are called their society and they 're going to run that key if you get the thing built and I know they will what 's a special time they 've been battling for 11 years now so you do need to Nestle but that means that there will be no operational costs for council because they 'll be able to if there 's any short involve ever able to hopefully raise money through trusts and donations have you thought of possibly running the limit things up for council a little bit and also to power the community no but I I would I like to see that looked at but I doubt very much that that could happen them them would it is the count from the community yeah they 're just so street just so yeah I just don 't have the resources to do it yeah and there 's not even strong residents associations or anything um yeah I would doubt that it could even many and the other thing is was I don 't even know if it 's got as far as being designed to anything yet but have you got a an idea of what if you say it was rods vision what was the size and scale of it when you say a community Paul walk it wasn 't enormous but it was some yeah was at one Paul Paul there was some multi like young toddlers Paul win the bigger pool but like pioneer really well yeah okay I guess it all come out eventually when people start working on what they wanted it 's got to was exactly ever get so well used because it 's on the transport corridors right through from some nut and on the bus routes that would be incredibly well used so appreciate that I guess none of us would like to see it offers such a scale that it became competition with the Metro one either so do you think it 's an issue no no not at all I know you 've got a lot of people don 't even think about town anymore I just yeah but they weren 't this subject well I mean the thing is in terms of the time scale yeah but I mean it 's it 's it 's a justifiable both ways but Mike thank you I 'm just curious because there 's quite a lot of like is qualit facilities and other leisure facilities currently being built around their annual plant so in terms of priority would you prioritize I guess a community pull over a tourist attraction yeah I would guess yeah well I I guess it 's all about healthy community it does make strong cities strong there doesn I just sense that you 're not quite clear about what 's happening so what communication given that you 're doing really amazing work with Lynwood College what communication have you heard from Council over what 's happening with the Lord Austin Paul and do you have any suggestions about how we might improve the engagement and the communication well I wouldn 't put hand over heart say I haven 't had anything but to my knowledge I we haven 't had any major initiator of consultation yeah yeah presume which I 'm a bit concerned about because of the time frame that 's already things signaled there hasn 't been a start to the consultation yeah very good well thank you very much for coming in and sorry that your last of that 's right but not least last but not least it 's absolutely the case and good to see you thank you this my friends is the end of the of the hearing of submissions am I going to close the meeting or am i joining it to win week instead of it it 'll be a we consider the

we 've been working with Lynwood College for a couple of years now just to help facilitate their reconnection with their local cohort and the wider community so our submission focused on the things that we thought would have a positive impact on the students who be attending them with college in their families so we were just wanted to endorse and say that we were delighted to see the budget allocation for the Rapanui shake rock cycle way also the Coastal pathway project you know it 's going to make a huge difference for for local children to be able to cycle safely to school and given that all the stars are aligned with all the other wonderful things that are going on with the school at the moment that so it 's a really positive thing and in a similar way we were we were pleased to see that there 's going to be the main focus of tonight 's conversation with you is really to do with the Lynwood Woolston pool though and Linda 's going to talk about about that yes so um we noted was relief last year of planned expenditure and long to him in your plan and also the timeframe for their delivery of that and we were really excited that 's great and we 're coming to you today just to urge you to keep to that timeframe and to keep that budget as you 've already signalled it 's hugely important for the community and everyone out there is very excited about it so we understand that it 's to be delivered the building will start in 2008 18 an April and be complete by December 2019 I 'm in a unique position to talk about just how long the children and families of this community have been waiting for the COS council investment and as I was chair of the first lemon Austin aquatics facility committee when I was on the community board back in 2002 at some 15 years ago the reason board set up our dearest and now departed friend rod Donald rod brought to the board 's attention the absolute lack of a recreational resource there is an not only Lynwood but the whole of the southeast area there 's no such facility from Scarborough right through to the study together we work very hard on this issue and then way back then and finally in the 2007 annual plan we thanks to the hard work of counselor counselor identity '_''_173.57 Rourke we were able to be successful important money on budget for a pool regrettably due to a very tragic accident we lost that money to the pepra new reward which already had a fantastic swimming pool nearby in the form of jelly park we lost it due to the said an untimely death of Graham Condon um which was you know really said and additionally after that happened Dennis or or lost his seat so um we were sort of about at sea to try and get pull now this is history but what is not history is that the children and youth from this area are still waiting for and particularly Aquatic space unfortunately the Kilis community is not an active community as you know it 's got lots of issues it cannot get out there and be the squeaky wheel and so it 's why groups like Alfred have even set up to support the high school so you 've really got to look look hard at that community and what it needs we know that 's got the hole that the

time as previously 's dream of a aquatic facility for the children of South East Christchurch to become a reality thanks very much okay Sara thank you as doesn 't say that some some of that background a lot of the councillors won 't_''_290.7 of her before and it 's not on the edge of submission he able to email that through to see chariot to come out to us is like she was gonna yeah exactly the same thing that would be very helpful to have that because I didn 't know that there you know far back letters to you into either you know it 's been around a long time yeah Phil dear you 're not be on your clean and plain or that both got the same haircut sure so um thank you very much for your submission and particularly for that history which TV means a lot to everyone here but I just I 'm just putting them to speak because you make the point that the expenditure will be non-negotiable in terms of the delivery and I 'm just wondering how you might see the poor a of it has also got

of the pool actually would work for everybody well it 's just that when at the time when we were doing it the areas that were needing it were Pepin or horn be an end limb word and those areas and that largely being taken care of um and we accept Hornby humbly and it 's but they 've still got the horse will pull in line no other way here so I 'm Hornby 's got a huge project we 've lost Centennial pool and and we 've closed down Woolston pool so we 've got virtually nothing we have got nothing and so it 's and I just feel it 's an equitable to delay it even through that so yeah like I guess like maybe a thousand dollars it was a very very good very very cleverly a drafted question but the answer was no no thank you we 'd like to have the confirmation you just can 't tell a community we 're giving it to you were giving it to not do it what I wasn 't implying it no no but it 's it I understand Phil 's question because there are you know multiple objects costs which go with all of the

community based swimming pool for the Lynwood area is future yes yeah yeah it doesn 't you 're not saying about time and you 're not saying about you know but it 's got to stay and the plan as a non-negotiable yes delivery well it is tight about timing I mean how long can you wait I mean I 'm talking 15 years my time and then I didn 't even know about the issue to rod cam yet but we do have we have had earthquakes and various I 'm sure Tony understand it but think about the metro facilitate it 's not going to really touch those kids in Lynwood because they just don 't have the cash to get get there and all the ability to get yeah well we need to also look at how we transport cuts here because we should we should actually make sure that all of our kids get access to that facility and I 'm sure that any decisions that you make you know around cost will be will be mitigated at all you will take into consideration the need in the end the desire of a community to um so I 've gleaned in Pauline I thank you and thank you for this and I understand though I think a Bob taught often to actually when you know learn what has mentioned but also think of each we 're Paul so they don 't have any far as I 'm aware any kind of funding allocation capital wise you 've got any thoughts on this so this isn 't a long battle as you know is it so itchy is a community pool I can 't recall the detail YH poor Paul went down why we lost it was that the earthquakes will pre youth great know it was previous yeah yeah so council word no decision that that wasn 't need of them all but the community rose up and they 've got some money as I understand it and now you are adding to that but it 's a much different scale to what we need in Lemoore yes but I still there as far as I 'm aware there 's no funding there no believe okay yeah but that issue rose up what just yet of community yeah I 'm asking Linda yeah I don 't know that 's that 's fair enough I my mind is it 's awful the the thing I must admit that the submitters pivot in time to come home and yeah and say we 're the same time at Paul Ames slowly yeah noted one is here um congratulations on having lost partnership group that 's really great and mentioning the you to be pulled as a community project and that 's being lead by a charitable trust circle their society and they 're going to run that clip if they ever get this thing built and I know they will watch a special time they 've been battling for 11 years now um so you do need to Nessa T but that means that there 'll be no operational costs for council because they 'll be able to if there 's any suitable to hopefully raise money through trusts and donations have you thought of possibly running a little mud pool is a as a trust in order to ease things up the counts a little bit and like to see that looked at but I doubt very much that that could happen then limit it has to come from the king yeah they 're just so stretched and just so yeah I just don 't have the resources to do it yeah and there 's not even strong wizards associations or anything so um yeah I would doubt that it could even many and the other thing is because I don 't even know if it 's got as far as being designed or anything yet but have you got a an idea of what if you say it was rods vision what was the size and scale of it when you say a community Paul walk it wasn 't enormous but it was some yeah was at one Paul Paul there was some multi like young toddlers Paul win the bigger pool but like pioneer really well yeah okay I guess it all come out eventually when people start working on what they want them it 's got to be fit for purpose that 's the main thing it was exactly I forget so well use some nut and on the bus routes that would be incredibly well used so appreciate that I guess none of us would like to see it 's over such a scale that it became competition with the Metro one either so do you think it 's an issue no no not at all I know you 've got a lot of people don 't even think about town anymore I just yeah but they worked this subway well I mean the thing is in terms of the time scale yeah but I mean it 's it 's a justifiable issue both ways but Mike thank you um I was just curious because there 's quite a lot of like is qualit facilities and other leisure facilities currently being built on their annual plan so in terms of priority would you prioritize I guess a community pull over a tourist attraction yeah I would yeah well I mean yes it 's all about healthy community it doesn 't make strong cities strong there doesn 't need Johnny thank you for coming on just quickly I just sense that you 're not that you 're doing really amazing work with Lynwood College what communication have you had from counsel over what 's happening with the lumen Woolston Paul and do you have any suggestions about how we might improve the engagement in the communication well I wouldn 't put hand over heart say I haven 't had anything but to my knowledge I we haven 't had any major initiator of consultation yeah which I don 't look concerned about because of the time frame that 's all these things signaled there hasn 't been a start to the Constitution yeah very good well thank you very much for coming in and sorry that your last of that 's right but personally last but not least it 's absolutely the case and good to see

won 't have that had the benefit of having read it first it 's okay so you alone are the only one who hasn 't had your submission read before you come to the table yeah deal here a stick figure far away well hello all I 'm here today to talk about peer pressure and I just ask that all you people today don 't bow down to peer pressure but after you 've heard all the facts and questions and talks a lot of people make up your own lines without looking at peer pressure so I think I 'm probably anyone speaking against the hot water pools are brought in and one of the reasons I believe that is is because people I speak to who agree with me don 't want to talk out for different reasons and part of that is peer pressure so so it agree with them as I don 't_''_70.28 I think the best asset for Brighton as the car park between the Surf Club and the whirlpool thousands of people go there and paint their cars and look out and take your body boards out and play the kids that 's nice and safe getting back to your car and so that 's the I believe that 's the best they sit in Brighton we don 't want to lose that and to think it 's going to regenerate Brighton I don 't believe that these shops are going to get any more patronage through people going to salt pools currently 10,000 people a month go on the pier but they sharpen them all and likely I know I don 't believe that 75,000 people in the first year and 50,000 people in the second year are going to be going to the pools and at 50,000 people a year it 's going to cost the ratepayers 100,000 sorry em it 's going to cost FS 50,000 people is going to cost up to 2 million dollars a year for OPEX from 's not put salt water pause there if you read that later on you 'll see also that the the question here the summary done by D CL and I pull it to pieces as well but look at that yourself and decide for yourselves and I think also the council from last two input D CL and a hard position of trying to create something they can 't do and it 's where I 'm coming from I 'm speaking as individual because as a board the board as a whole had supported this hot would oppose me as an individual I 'm painting as an individual so instead of hot water poles I just put down some thoughts and one of my thoughts is if you 're going to build a 200 square meter how as 200 square meter shop and Brighton what 's it going to cost two million dollars let 's say it 's a million dollars how much do you want to get back on your return 10% so 100,000 so I 'm going to pay somebody going to pay 100,000 rent I suggest not whirlpool of course no don 't worry about warm water or hot water kids don 't mind cold water and the playground area and their green space for example why not build a big hill and put 12 slides on it so my kids will say come on dad let 's go and plan the water pulling on the slides and go to the beach and then we may go to the mall as well afterwards and so we 'll put the other 16 million dollars into the mall we 've got a great master plan it 's got no money with it but it 's a really good plan so why not put some seeding money into foundations so say to those people are going to be building those companies say look we 'll pay for your foundations but you kept the REITs at a reasonable rent so people can afford to rent there at least the buildings and there will be a win-win for everybody so let 's all live up to sale take questions for a minute and 34 seconds away David um thanks to look who hot saltwater pool so what I 'm interested in you 've spoken to many people and many agree with what I 'm saying but look we 've had a number of submissions surveys commissioned by individuals commissioned by DCL commissioned by council all of which come back supporting the inclusion of hot saltwater pools in New Brighton how many and how to use them how do you justify your comment that there are a number of people in opposition when when we clearly see that surveys that have been done would suggest because what I 've done is I 've an ask them is n+ do you think there 's going to be swimming yes well if there 's not do you support them what do you realize it 's not single her going in there what do you mean now they 're going to add salt water AVI no chlorine though yes salt water has chlorine so people aren 't aware of what 's being talked about what DCL and to what is going to be there and I know there 's going to be consultation stuff like that at DCL meetings is some more effects and they know so that so that 's talking to people about those things as how I kept it conclusion but you would agree that you 're in quite a minority when you wonder water park and Brighton there was 20,000 signatures who would today support a water part in Brighton of 20,000 signatures would you bow down to that pressure today probably the same 20,000 exactly thank you there you go you 've had your five minutes thank you very much Thanks I also agree that with what David said absolutely right to present any point of view um _"

    "text": "um next is Warren Haynes thank you I 've been a resident in rocks and terrace since 1993 that design work for the complete renewal of that Street involving the replacement of old dish channel footpaths berms and carriageway in and around the preservation of existing plank trees was actively worked through by a council project team in an active residents association throughout 2009 and 2010 the film from Waimea Community Board considered and approved the design on its 13th of July 2010 meeting and the works were scheduled for construction in the financial year first of July 2011 we appreciate what happened to our city from September 2010 onwards in October 2010 the council 's capital programs group wrote to Street residents a copies in the year to inform that due to extensive damage there would be a deferral of the 2010-2011 capital works renewal program for nine months in February 2011 the earthquakes sequence continued with further damage to councils infrastructure however since 2010 there 's been no further contact with rocks and Terrace residents at least my knowledge by the capital where program crew I recently made to the annual plan with councils traffic operations team and it appears that rocks and Terrace isn 't at any stage in any current timeframe for the next ten years I believe I understand why there 's obviously other priorities we 're disappointed that our weight over recent years for council to bring the renewal back onto budgets is now seemingly in vain now the level of service criteria that triggered the need for Street renewal in 2010 has obviously changed but in my view is that is that council change of strategy has not been articulated well to residents if we cannot rely on council renewal mechanisms to fix our street how a residents to be assured that Council are dealing with repairs and maintenance is as a type of holding pattern strategy for managing its asset how does Council intend differently assessing the condition of its roading assets that were once due for renewal now the reason its interact with councilors ratepayers to tell council there appears to be no logical transparent system of strategic maintenance versus various levels of Street work renewal having waited for six years our council council law is now signaling that they would prefer to see residents use the request for service or report a problem function in its website to manage ratepayer Street maintenance expectations my suggestion is that council insist on the settling of in-house transparent criteria to fairly assign the funds for repair and renewal and to re-engage with ratepayers like ourselves who do not understand what 's happening to their neighborhoods from a maintenance perspective they kind of just started to write some criteria but look the age and evenness of footpaths the cracks and repair history of foot x the RFS history foot footpath repairs accidents due to footpath condition our condition of carriage way including loadings and repair history and failure safety considerations for example is the street close to a school or a cycle route the ability to interact with residents association and how do we fairly balance the expectations who perhaps paying more and rates per 10 meters of Road compared to others if Council chooses to undertake works and certain streets how this influences property values compared to streets that have no perceived maintenance last photograph there that 's in the attachment take I am I was pursuit because last Tuesday the carrots way over lay a Nashville tactually occurred an idris road and between idris road and jackson 's road along rocks from terrace it 's interesting the the contract works were done an asphalt what would have been done from a renewal perspective probably would have been chipped seal but in actual fact the Asheville was viewed as a bit a longer term maintenance solution for that particular section of Street I 'm a little perplexed about that but we 've still got large sections of dis channel down the street and a high standard of house and home renewals that are occurring emptying out on to a street that was ready for renewal and 2010 rocks and Terrace isn 't the only street there 's a number of other streets so I just courage council to sit about some transparent criteria and to communicate it to residents thank you when I when I read your submission I was actually really pleased with how you presented it because I mean I couldn transparent set of criteria and a post-disaster environment would be much better than just saying nothing well energy factoids fair I 've been sitting waiting for the renewal and the site this year I decided to make a submission to community does because I mean you know I 'm obviously discuss it as a council but I really favor that what your your idea about the sorts of things that you might want to put into a set of criteria and I really want us to have a quite an open conversation about that I mean we 're not going to fix it overnight on the annual plan but we 're going into an LTP process next time and I think we could be much better prepared for that process if we establish the criteria and time for the LTP yeah I I agree it 's very reactive inside your council at the moment well we come me into the skirt program so there 's this you know the scope program has really driven that earthquake related damage and now it 's earthquake related damage we 'll be coming back 's going to be hugely challenging which is why I really like the idea of having an effete set of criteria yes we could publicly consult on absolutely so I think you know thank you very much for your submission it 's much appreciated I 'm glad that you didn 't just sit at home this time thank you thank you and _"

    "text": "right now eighth note now basically I 'm just going to talk for a few minutes major concern is the shopping center known as the limb bud village on the corner of Wooster Street and stem wall Road there was a circle way being put down down the road and there is concern about loss of car parks and this sort of thing but the major concern is now is the imminent closing of Wooster Street at Fitzgerald ev2 traffic going up and down Wister Street so as cutting off access to the main base system so anybody going wanting to get onto the one-way or come off them I may go down there as the previous submitters have said this traffic is now going to be pushed onto the adjacent streets neither Hereford cluster I am our raw they 've inside Drive and the loss of that traffic to the village is going to mean the demise of the village at the moment our concern is the survival if that can be achieved then there is the revival prospect originally they did put have a limit village plan they have been overlaid by the cycle way plan which just wipes out any idea of the previous plan for the survival of the but because if we haven 't_''_104.729 got Daris out of MgO cows going up the F well if we haven 't got the shoppers that only takes one or two percent knocked off the top of any of those businesses to put them out of business it 's as simple as that previous speakers talked about the butcher shop she was in near the other day there shaky wondering what to do most of the other businesses in there operated by new arrivals to New Zealand immigrants various from various places not all of them totally okay with how the system works or maybe maybe have some language difficulties so they haven 't necessarily been able to get involved in the process of what 's going on in their area totally they 've been consulted properly the consultation process is totally done if you call an inept or plan to fail on our behalf anyway because it was non-existent I myself run a couple of businesses in us the consultation decision was to stop the consultation process at the intersection for us so the last block wasn 't even told what was going on didn 't concern us apparently though according to the act anybody who is to be affected must be consulted so this is not council rules these are not something that you guys have dreamed up this is an act of Parliament which is not being followed to the letter therefore not properly people are missing out we missed out we didn 't get the opportunity to on the last day that there was for submissions we found out about the proposal we didn 't really have time to consider much we rushed and managed to check something in and get involved but basically too late so the the thing is I 've got here as well well I 'll just check in here is it wasn 't through here but we actually prepared a document which is a bit like a petition it 's a brief statement has been signed by about I think it 's about 18 19 businesses and about six wasn 't gathered for presentation at this particular stage but I want to present it now anyway there is one or two other people one sign that we haven 't managed to catch up with and all of these people are basically just the businesses this isn 't the general public as such those businesses are believe they can be affected and other groups we 've spoken also to the school on Gloucester Street who would like to join this this particular action but of course they 've got to put it back through the board and that 's a bit of a process before they can sort of get firmly involved then there 's a couple other businesses that we just haven 't managed to connect with to get a signature but they do want to be involved so basically it 's everybody everybody here is in total fear that they are about to lose their life 's work their life savings and their family security is all going to go down the tube because for some reason someone that the council has decided that that set of lights going to stop transit for cars up and down Westar Street but the still going to have to have Vasudha lights for the cycles and the pedestrians so there 's the advantage and if they 're saying that it 's that one of the theories is that it 's going to speed up progress of vehicles going up and down fish or death but how 's that going to work I 've we 've taken all the cows that were on Wooster Street and put them into the next set of lights and he referred in Gloucester and if it 's about pollution that we 're creating these cycleways net house they can work when all these extra cows are now sitting at the lights across the street and so it now takes you four set to the rotations to get through the lights instead of two so how 's that going where where where 's the gain and pollution near what happened when we got the cows instead of just cruising up down there now they 're parked at the city lights on this on the next street so cost-benefit analysis done there was no numbers there was no figures not even those how many bike riders there are and cry Church little down heavenly bikes are how many were sold last year how many were anticipating to sell this year what how many is is going to be in 10 years time there 's nothing so basically we want something done because this is the destruction of one of the oldest little shopping zones in town and the other thought has on some people 's minds that 's what does the council doing trying to shut it down because they 're you know they don 't want competition for the inner city which is now struggling and is going to struggle because part of our submission is is in fact where is the opportunity for these small businesses to get started to operate in town they 're not going to be in tenth door wrench to dia there 's no opportunity for small-time startup there are going to be they 're all businesses who are going to be in town or have already got previous experience of some up over years and now they 're moving into town but for some small you know someone wants to open a dress shop I don 't think they 'll be doing it and Christ you central does not many shops left I own some shops down on the corner of lumber dev which I was planning on effexor I 've spent money on architects and engineers we 've got all lined up to do it but I 'm not sure whether we now want to throw the extra money at doing it what for I mean who is there even a value and me doing that because originally we want to restore those shops so we could say well here 's some shops that are going to still be available for people at a reasonable price we 're a new business might be able to get in and give it a go but now they 'll be about you know had 80% of whatever traffic was left they 've had hemily goes they had at Wooster Street they 've knocked it off at Linwood eV they 've gone down at the business and quite a few businesses went out at Stanwell Road at the time then they went down to let him ask where they knocked it off there about another half the businesses that were at Stanwell Road okay and there was there was blank shops there that were just the Front 's were just blanked off though we use for nothing for storage and that 's how it was something to leave earthquake and now we 're going to what just say now we 've got empty property there we 've got where are the owners going to want to rebuild their property or for if they can 't rent it out they can 't rented out if the person can 't rely on having some customers drive past what 's going to happen and we is it just going to be some bike riders on the weekend that are going to support all these businesses so they can they can be going and now the butcher shop I don 't know I doubt it so what I 'd say is quite frankly it 's a total fail to find out what is actually required there what 's needed what 's modded what the future potential is all the rest of it so there 's already been goodness knows how many people have gone bankrupt and gone where we don 't know what 's happened to them after their know and really Kia 's they just disappear off the maps and we so is that what is that the is that what it is for everybody else that I 've got on this list is that would be a distant is it or not but look thank you very much the time or just one other thing now you 've gone well over the five minutes I over done five minutes simply working at the bus exchanges is non-existent if you 're public if you remember the public trying to drop someone off and pick someone up at the bus exchange you 're going to park on a taxi stand or a bus or a bus stop another failed but a design work and that 's what happens when you try and rush all the stuff to three you very much thank you for that thank you right um _"

    "text": "the next day next is the angle field residents association welcome thank you um my name is Irina Britain all and this is Robin corty a committee member and we 're here today on behalf of the Engel field residents Association a neighborhood group that is passionate about heritage buildings and places we also connect to the oetiker Oh Aven River and were the first group to consult the tongue adiphene wha about protection of the riverbanks from traffic in our area and also to identify Maori heritage sites in our area under former meer Mickey buck it was Bill karate Ana who made the submission to the council in 1992 not long after the crisis City Council 1991 policy to consult with local Maori I would like to acknowledge and thank councillor Dion swigs who came to an anger filled committee meeting recently to assist us understand the draft annual city plan thank you that was really helpful the main points we wish to remind the council are if we 're serious about saving our heritage the council needs to put a lot more financial and educational effort earng not Ward council policy on protection of heritage areas some of our area is recognized by the Historic Places Trust but meaningless without teeth we want to see here is heritage trees put back on the council listing not taken off why were they removed there should be an audit of heritage and natural environment it has value we have an agreement with the Council for heritage willows to be replaced with willows in our area one needs replacing both fits George Avenue and even side Drive and another by Hemnes Street why are the hundred and eighty-five trees along River Road coming out and there have been some badly hacked trees we 're not sure by who but there 's some photos we also have concerns about the increase of traffic on urban side drive and fear traffic will divert down there of through access is closed off it was the street at Fitzgerald Avenue a jetty was promised by the council many years ago in an out of environment court settlement we 're still waiting for the council to honor this agreement in the redzone regeneration plan we of the area we would like to see a heritage trail through here reminding us of the styles of homes and preserving as much of the original trees and gardens as possible I 'm just making points if pedestrians and cycles on the same path are an unsafe mix we see Eastside neglect and want to see more effort to save the traditional shops of Linwood village with one of the best butcher shops around for miles among the other interesting and necessary amenities of the area the shops have been reduced to half in shrinking this is also a heritage area and its own right and it would be a tragic loss to the aging ailing lower socioeconomic community of this area we hope our presentation will assist you to make positive decisions for our area and the city and in closing Robin would like to say about the Cathedral well would like to see the Cathedral said the church may own it but the ratepayers stakeholders make payers have contributed to the maintenance for many many years so that was just a few points about to assist you there 's no specific budget requirements but we 'd like to see more money put into heritage and more enthusiasm we 're very enthusiastic our porting and we query about the duty we set plan to go I didn 't notice it well um quite a few years ago probably about I don 't know um I haven 't actually got this blue we had an invite it was around the year 2001 and there was an out of court environment settlement out of Environment Court settlement said one of the things that we could get would be a jetty down close to the maybe Stanwell Road bridge on the other side on River Road and the idea was for tourists or anybody to be able to come down the river and on the punting boats or something like that and be able to land and walk around on the Heritage Trail of area which has got the Heritage rose garden and Beverly Park the well unfortunately the historic Trinity Church fell over a me ins and the earthquakes but it 's still got the little hole there in the the area so very historical area and then people there are walking tours that come through there and Robin actually hosts a lot of walking in garden to us in that area and people who are interested in the old work cottages and Henman go beyond our street I think here that would be with some mm-hmm Dion thank you for coming along it 's good to hear um and good to raise those points but could you just let us know a little bit about what you 're worried about with austere Street closing for for your neighborhood just we think that it will probably push more traffic coming down even side drive as the diversion it 'll be going down was the street but we noticed an increase in traffic on even side Drive once Latimer Square was closed and yeah it 's used improbably and because I haven 't_''_405.979 we live in hem ministry and you can see it bumper-to-bumper fear at night and in the morning already so I don 't know but we 're just saying originally when we consulted with Tang Gaddafi Noah in much traffic on the River Thames everything is because the very narrow river bank there so yeah that 's the specific concerns about traffic coming into our area yep any other questions hmm all right thank you very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "now the Peter Townsend dice to understand you 're here on behalf of the Christchurch children 's Christmas parade Thank You Madame Anton greetings everybody yes I am I 'm Peter Townsend executor of the Canterbury important of Commerce and the Ken Brevoort Chamber of Commerce is a trustee of the Christchurch a children 's Christmas parade trust I 'm here for a really simple request here tonight I 'm here to put certainty into the Christmas parade we 're going to need your help your ongoing help in the context of what has been a long and truly collaborative relationship to ensure that the finances are available for the trust for the next two years the Christmas parade as you will have seen from the submission has been in existence for 71 years and for the last 26 years the Christchurch City Council has supported financially supported the Christmas parade through the auspices of a trust and there are people around here that have assisted us all the way through that journey and there are people here that have been here right from the beginning of the transition of entity right through to being running as a independent trust we the problem with God is that the the trust has 40 floats it has a thousand over a thousand costumes and it has to it has to house those throughout the year it also is involved in traffic management and as various piece of plan that has to be stored it is a total cost of about one hundred twenty one thousand K a year the total cost of the parade is about two hundred thousand dollars a year and that parade is driven totally by voluntary commitment apart from the council 's ongoing support from 2013 to 2015 the council supported ninety seven thousand seven hundred fifty dollars per year 2016 that dropped to 69 thousand and at the moment there is an application in front of the council for a hundred thousand dollars this year what we would like to see is a hundred thousand dollars locked in this year this coming year in the following year and we see that as absolutely critical to ensure that the parade can continue without that support the parade will requested post December 2018 are likely to be markedly reduced because the trust has we had recently had access to a property that at a minimal cost can house the floats and the costumes which obviously saves the thick end of 100,000 connect property is the New Zealand school of gymnastics so ensure we need counsel support with effect from the beginning of July 2017 and that and this trust needs the cash it needs it quickly cash flows tight and support is critical it is an iconic event and its event that and will require the council support for the next two years really hard to imagine Christchurch without us Christmas parade it 's an integral part of our city it 's one of the iconic events that attracts over 100,000 attendees 2,500 participants 500 volunteers the whole thing is driven by voluntary input and voluntary contribution by well-meaning people in our community and of course it has a really strong focus on family and children the plot the parade does need certainty the council is the only entity that can provide that certainty and as I said in 2017 2018 hundred thousand dollars 2018 2019 hundred thousand dollars from December 2018 after that parade we are quite confident that we 'll be able to markedly reduce council dependency absolutely important that the council makes this commitment to ensure the vitality and the continuity of the parade thank you and I was looking at this and I couldn 't couldn 't see we 're all your sponsorships are and I can see main Freight producers unkind and I presume we 're producing their traffic management in kinder B well a part of had historically part of the council contribution has been to contribute to the traffic management the total cost of traffic management and the storage of the floats and things about a hundred twenty one thousand dollars a year well I was gobsmacked about was the costumes so I didn 't realize that what we were paying for was the cost of storage and I don 't_''_271.069 I think the people crushed it should be surprised that that was the cost you know you know it 's a high cost and it needs to be resolved and we I know that counsel Reese raised this the other day that they looked like fear when one outcome as far as that 's concerned and there have been various options looked at at alternatives for storage including some council owned properties but none of those have come to fruition but we look as if now look looks as if we 've got a solution what we haven 't got is the funding to see us through to having that solution realized and there 's no sponsorship available near the sponsorship but the council has always been me to support the children 's parade it is seen to be into care and share and these other people contributes always seem to be a council event and actually that that doesn 't it was a haze event well a minute moved into being a council event then it dropped out of being a Council of it it 's the problem we 've got is that is seen to be a council of whether or not it is or isn 't so it seemed to be the Christchurch City Council as the the quite difficult for private sponsorship if if we dropped off council support there is no way there 's this parade will continue I 'm not suggesting that we should drop it off so I ask that this come forward as a proposal that we make it a line-item and this is not a proposal to make it a line-item it 's actually a better proposal that 's to give it secured the funding for teachers so that the suburb pictures can be made and that the problem that that was confronting us as a new council was that the events and festivals fund has a finite sum inert and the numbers of people seeking to have their events and festivals supported by the Christchurch City Council far outweigh the amount of money that was in there and so the centre parade felt the effects of that when we reduce the amount that was claimed or thought last time and and the only way that I could see beyond that was to line item up but salmon so it 's a total cost of 200,000 a year of which we 're the case was finally we get more and more pressures you know every year just like your the other group it 's harder and harder to get sponsorship but with the expertise and available to the chamber ourselves and the trust there must be a way for us all to work together to try and and improve or help or assist or look for benefits with regards to fear the sponsorship so I know that you know some can see the council 's you know the City Council as being as you just mentioned hard for sponsors to get on but others see it as a real positive so there must be a way around there sure look what my web be prepared to talk to the chamber about yourselves a ship opportunity Murs and kind commitment to this event is very significant I know I know and um you 're right but we we have a we have they 've tried really hard to get this thing financially independent and we think we 've got the answer and December 2018 to markedly reduce the cost yeah 80 90,000 a coming cap in hand to the council what we 've got is not a line-item request as the mirrors pointed out it is a two-year request for a hundred thousand dollars a year to give this thing certainty and the and the other option is untenable the other option is at pit stops this this purpose trust runs out of money in July mmm this year a perky and info Vicky but so this actually comes to the committee on Wednesdays so are you suggesting a hundred a hundred and then what 's year three year three is is not not well if we can if we can land this an accommodation that saves us ninety thousand dollars a year so year three year three we 're not asking for anything what we 're asking for is we 're a hundred thousand dollars for the next two years all right so year three you don 't want anything not at this stage I 'm almost certain if this goes really okay and just in terms of where the parade goes yeah because it 's currently down Rexton Road are you have it back into town but I don 't think they 'd send out control I think it 's under yours I said are you okay if it is under our control so what the chairperson says if we can get back to town which only love to get back to only something that we can ask staff to report back on yeah our felt thanks Peter I 'm just wondering in fact if that Christmas parade has really become so like it almost a victim of its own success and that as a parent and now grandparent I 've got like everybody else in Christchurch you 've gone along for many years and it 's got much much bigger like it 's a really nice component and recently is has been the multi culture SP where all the different cultures have their own floats and I 'm just wondering has there all sort of increased the cost in terms of for example things like traffic management and yeah your traffic traffic management costs have increased but of the total credit management 's about fifteen sixteen thousand dollars a year cost hasn 't increased in fact it 's it 's converse because the more people we get involved the more volunteers we can get involved the more support we can get the more people that will sponsor and kind various parts of it so it 's it 's not a victim of its own success it as an extraordinarily successful parade which runs on as I 'd be quoting the submission disappear yes submitters the smell of an oily rag huge voluntary commitment people getting doing an enormous amount of work just because they believe in the parade and it just needs to get through these next two years it just needs to get through this patch and as I said it 's untenable to think that it wouldn 't take yeah right any other questions that 's good thank you very much Thank You Rachel thank you you _"

    "text": "have a community association Richards Eggert it 's on page duty welcome right thank you I 'm pure açaí tokoto thank you for the opportunity to present talk to our submission on the annual plan going from the big project to the smaller community issues anyway we 'll see what we can do to keep you interested for the next ten minutes the first part of our submission addresses the what I saw as being what we saw as being in the draft plan and I 'll just highlight a few things in there that are more interest than than others but just overall just aside we 're always grateful that there is that money coming towards the southern base so we 're supportive of those sort of allocations the first one to hit the head walkway we don 't seem to get much clarity as to where the next piece of work is to be we understood that there was work to be done between the very damaged track between Charteris Bay and Parral but would really like to know is that money coming to do that or some investment in the wastewater lyttelton harbour project to get the waste water out of lyttelton harbour and very pleased that the council 's made steady progress was that just a slight question mark over the Faro Avenue wastewater articulation that 's 689 thousand in the coming year and then further big chunk of money we don 't know what that 's for and as I live in Faro Avenue I 'm actually quite curious as to why a very large amount of money is being spent on our wastewater there two other items just down the bottom just in terms of the trek and silage work very pleased to have that set aside that relates to delayed work that 's in the Sonic Stoddard point reserve management plan that we really haven 't had any funding over the last few years so it 's good to see some money coming through there now actually what I did me to do was meant me to starts up my presentation by just to congratulating the council on what it has done in Garden Harbor in the last year and the two most community hall at considerable expense and renovated the Stoddard historic Stoddard cottage and both of those have been reopened and so the community is very grateful that the earthquake renovations and other upgrades have been done so very protect to the council 's work in the last year the next section relates to the Stata point and customers management plan that hasn 't had a lot of funding and effort in recent years but overall pleased to see that those items I 've listed there some of those actually now starting to be indicated as being action under the under the allocation in the draft plan point for that 's to do was actually green waste and diamond Harbert so it 's a long way for people to take their green waste around from the southern bays to the transfer stations in christchurch we have in the past there was those council financial support for a subsidy for chipping and last year we went to the community board to get a subsidy and got got some contribution there would really like to see that and it 's continued in the board the waste management people in the council came on board and and talked with locals and possibly like something some organization like the organ bradley trust whether or not there could be some kind of small composting facility put in in somewhere in the the southern base but in the interim really if you don 't have something like chipping to reduce the amount of green waste you tend to get a lot of it thrown over the edges into council reserves it 's the reality and point-five godly house site planning now i just once again i 'd like to thank the the contribution of the council planners to assist the community with the preparation of a Community Action Plan there was a five-year effort to achieve that we have a document that 's been finalized it sets out ten ten priorities for the community and we 're working through those with the council so we have a completed document some stage I hope the community board formally actually puts that in front of the council the other project we 've been working on and with the council the whole area and we definitely want to see that put in front of the whole council and we 've made very good progress to get to the point now with the final draft of that and putting that to the community board and there 's been a lot of community consultation once again it 's a five-year post-earthquake effort a bit likely a little team consultation process the sumner consultation process that ever counseled tation process and it 's been very much driven by an automatic community effort with support from council staff and we very much like to talk to the council about the final product and the the project that 's come out of that that 's of most importance to us next having made this good progress on the planning is something to be done about the godly house site so we 'd like to further engage with the council on that we think that the site does deserve something it it was obviously an important facility for the council and historic resource we 'd like the site which we hold temporary concerts on to have incorporate indoor and outdoor concert facilities and in the temporary cafe that we 've now got sort of cartons and containers to the side of it but we 'll certainly be pushing in the next year for that to be the next project we 'd like the council to work with us on and the last point was just acknowledging the great work that the council has done in the contractors to upgrade the community Hall which is very heavily used for various community sporting and cultural activities and there 's a bit more work saw to be done in that whether we done this next financial year or or later we 're not sure but there 's still accepted by the council staff we 've been dealing with that the toilets and the foyer area still needs further work so that 's my sort of articulation of what is on our minds slipped you some time for questions thank you thank you very much I mean I have to say that I always look forward to these submissions you know that because they 're genuinely from the community they not about coming to the council and saying do this do this do this as what we can do together and it just it does does har to me I have to say very collaborative and I think we 'll be able to answer some of your questions and our response to your submission I mean obviously I can 't tell you what what bit of the head heads being progressed through this particular funding Andrew probably knows that cuz he knows everything off by heart and has been his ward so but so we 'll be able to answer all those questions but I really picked up also that you want a little bit better communication around some of the projects that we have on budget and your area and there you as an association would be more than happy to distribute them and organize for you know engagements to discuss them if people wanted to raise issues that am I reading that career absolutely it 's a bit heaviness sometimes we get really good engagement prior engagement and send those things arrive out of the blue right yeah the community board but then doesn 't filter down to us so thank you I Pauline David then I know you 're running on the smell of an oily rag but you mentioned operational money given it she asked for any guys was wondering do you have any idea of what would help was this in relation to the reserve management committee yes yes um they certainly need at least a few thousand dollars to to essentially buy essential equipment and to 2,000 or 20,000 no no suddenly two thousand dollars will keep them going because they actually the reserve staff have actually been very good in terms of a specific request for work to be done on the ground mentioning the fine things within the budget I think I 've got a suspicious might actually be possibly dealt the moment decision to actually fund put something to report for that for the Pacific 's committees the basement yeah yeah I think that 's true yeah that will certainly follow up on me yeah David did you look I just wanted to reinforce that comment about communication with the local the coastal and build wards where there was the odd project that I 'm not being critical or staff I realize there 's a huge number of projects going on around the city but it appears that the odd one is slipping through the cracks in terms of local communities not finding out about things until they just actually happen yeah but I mean I think that 's something that we 're all very very conscious of as the need to engage communities in a better way you know in terms of what 's going on Andrew thank you and thank you very much indeed for the submission the item five godly house site planning I 'm assuming that the community wants to work in partnership with the council on this so that we get the the best results how do you how do you see this panning out moving forward how would the diamond Harbor community like to work with the council in order to deliver something that really works in the long term for that godly house site well probably you go back some five years now the session in the community very strong one dinner and a lot of ideas came out and they 've actually been incorporated into the planning document that I 'm referring to for for exactly for the site now the idea is to actually pair those ideas down to those that are realistic capable of achieving in some form of budget with also possibly a private partnership of we 're talking about a cafe and in working with council making some sort of commitment to actually doing something so for the last six years the council has carefully avoided the subject where they 're prepared to put any of that insurance money they got for godly house site actually back into doing something on the site and so this plan that we prepared the council start has a blank spot on it called godly house site so we want to see the blank spot filled up or otherwise the counselor to come to us and say in the end well we 're just not going to put anything there and suck it up but we 're not really getting any communication engagement matter except to the fact actually we have received notice that there is a conservation report historic conservation report on the site about to representative the community in the next two months being approached by the community governance people to help set up a meeting about that so we 're all very happy to engage very happy to put forward the ideas have been working with and it 's this matter of engagement yep very good all right thank you very much thank you for your time and try again this evening okay thank you _"

    "text": "okay feet on could I invite the multi-purpose arena trust Barry meister meister sorry and John Marshall oh no madly you neither I 'm a thank you very much we appreciate the opportunity to submit to you and a good opportunity to follow on from for a mission grant because much of what they were saying we are saying perhaps in a different language in a different tone but philosophically we are absolutely in support of the submission that they have made because I just introduced myself very most of the chair of multi-purpose arena trust we have a group of Trustees many of which are here tonight Jeff Saunders Stuart Mitchell Natalie Thane milk and Hudson David Kennedy and Tom Craig who is our advisor and that group is a group of passionate vibrant cantab Ian 's who have said about the task of establishing that we work with central government and local government to help develop a major event strategy for Christchurch which includes as its core component the multi-purpose arena which we 're focused on we envisage as you 've already indicated a high-tech care facility a the East frame of Christchurch incorporating several elements which we see you will determine needed for the city we have a wide range of local stakeholders who have either approached or have come to us we do not represent them here tonight but we are the group de facto that they have come to us and indicated strong support and that includes sports groups hospitality sector facility management groups cultural groups commercial interests and the like all of whom have been in touch with our group to indicate support for what we 're doing we 'll make this submission tonight with a mixture of anxiety and in optimism anxiety in the thought that the temporary stadium might outlive its temporary life before we have a multi-purpose arena in place leaving our city without a major events facility and that means being left behind which concerns us but we 're optimistic in the sense that the recent announcement about the pre-feasibility study together with the published comment from the council that you will look at moving this up timeline forward we our trust is already met with the key leaders of our sharing of what we have the context that we have built up so that it 's a seamless operation we 're right behind the work that they do and I want to be seen to be supporting it we appreciate that you as a council have had lots of different needs over the last six years and you 've prioritized those and we respect that and we understand that fully but we also want you to understand that the timeframe to build this facility as we understand it would be perhaps four or five four to five years from go to completion would be four to five years and that takes us out to 2021 at the earliest before we could even have this multi-purpose facility and that is very likely that by that stage the temporary facility will have outlived its temporary life and so there is a potential for that period of time when we don 't have a facility and while as a cost of building there 's also a cost of not having a facility for Christchurch you will have read as I have about week attracting 70 to 80 thousand people over a two night gig we want to ensure that Christchurch is the major event capital of the South Island if not New Zealand we are fortunate we believe that we have a piece of purchased inspired piece of land purchased by the government in the East frame which sits logically waiting for development to occur I in my work work with major events groups in New Zealand major events in New Zealand so I can look around the country and I can see cities that are investing significantly in their major event strategies and we surely as Christchurch and as Canterbury as a region want to ensure that we are part of that major event strategy which is growing momentum as people are seeing increasingly the value of major events for their cities and we are keen to contribute to that we would like to show you a brief video that video this video was put together prior to the feasibility study being commissioned and it was very much put forward as a concept as a thought provoker as a catalyst generator video are neither costed nor researched we didn 't intend to do that it is not our role but we wanted to start a conversation with Christchurch people which you may be able to you will use in your in your discussion process to say hey these things are possible they may not be the priorities for the city and therefore they may be abandoned but there are things in here that we think will stimulate discussion as a catalyst for what we 're about would like to now show the video to you and Natalie Natalie will talk through the video and outline some of the features of it as we go through thank you thank you [Music] tweet them the lights christchurch is in the unique and exciting position of delivering a truly urban community multi-purpose hub a people place a place that goes beyond a singular sport centric iconic build to one that literally and metaphorically engages with all the people of Christchurch on the South Island to be truly multi-purpose the engagement should incorporate corporate and social spaces that can be utilized seven days a week sport related events providing vibrant and active gathering spaces [Music] a mixed-use development has the opportunity to influence the city 's thinking at both a macro and micro level addressing architecture urban planning landscape and transformed a design specifically with the local community and mind to introduce commercial and entertainment benefits a world-class venue will help improve the competitive position of Canterbury and the northern South Island when attracting major events to the city both sporting and non sporting [Music] a carnival atmosphere before and after live events [Applause] [Music] [Music] exhibition spaces can easily be converted for markets food stands fanzones margin dye stores a place with family and friends together planning for a truly multi-purpose arena will give Christchurch the opportunity to revive and becoming as an exciting amalgam of engagement dialogue planning that sets a benchmark for understanding and delivering a unique and iconic statement for the city thank you could I say that the video was produced through our own fundraising not through any other sponsorship and we understand it it 's well known that stadia per se in themselves don 't generate income but what that if you took a number of those catalyst ideas up there and thought they fitted with the long term plan for the city that could become closer to a break-even Enterprise we have no evidence of that but we 're putting the ideas up which need to be investigated in the next stage which is what we intend to do so in conclusion we we want to make ask you three things or ask for a council think three things first of all we would like a philosophical and a funding commitment to a multi-purpose arena for Christchurch the second one we would like is an appreciation that this facility needs to be started as soon as possible because of the timeline that 's referred to and the costs to the city of not having a major events facility for a period of time if we don 't start immediately and the third one is an understanding that our trust will continue to work as a group of passionate enthusiasts at Canterbury uns to promote ideas to share what we have to work with those who are making the put those ideas into the mix so that we can ensure that Christchurch remains the event capital for the South Island at least if not New Zealand thanks very much thank you I will ask him but I just want to highlight one thing in your submission paragraph 12 and the original cost share agreement the council committed to half the cost of the new stadium 253 million central government have committed the same there isn 't accurate central government had not committed 253 million dollars to the stadium they 've committed to provide the land should we not be in a position meet the business case which is yet to be done of meeting their requirements over a closed stadium so and we haven 't committed to half the cost our costs are kept at 253 if the first option is chosen which is the covered one so I just remind people I think and that 's what worries me is is that people 's expectations have been put way up here and we 're now left with the really hard decisions we can only bring it forward on the long-term plan process but and that 's the purpose of the proposed the work that the stadium trusts are doing in terms of the pre-feasibility which is to look at those options how can we make this pay for itself so that we can achieve the objective without going across across that line or even getting underneath that line would be my personal preference leaning Thank You Barry just to be Badcock for a minute I note so the big day arrives aligns to a as rare as hen 's teeth the Crusaders have a covered stadium no rather the Highlanders have a covered stadium but they end up with a match of the Highlanders vers lions we have a temporary stadium we have Crusaders vs. Lions there 's no guarantee that we could end up with the big matches as there in just because we have a covered Stadium absolutely not and it 's not for me to make that judgement anyway but if you go to England all the test matches seem to be played a token them so they don 't spread them around the country future but surely our task is Kent Aryans is to position give ourselves the best chance of major events including rugby tests I don 't know whether we would stand up if we had a thirty thirty five thousand stadia where that would be sufficient I don 't know the answer to that but it gives yourself a shot of being in there I suggest that our current stadium does not do that okay you know I haven 't seen and I 'm sure the trust will come up with it I haven 't actually seen any specifics over the deterioration of the current stadium I could take it at face value I can see rust and research purse the paper I can 't find the paper I can find the Dunedin study done by that company they can 't find the paper and also note the sample is an even a thousand people so I want a bigger sample just to give it greater you know validity is in terms of a survey but so what would you survey your friend this is the survey that 's four that yeah yeah so I mean obviously since that survey was instigated and the establishment of our trust which has only formally taken place at the beginning of this year we 've built up quite a wide number of stakeholders and we 'll continue to grow that and that will certainly be a vehicle I think going forward that will be useful for the council okay Wednesday good David we 've heard from the mayor the position on on funding 253 million Zaire cap and in any of your preliminary work in you talked earlier of interest from a number of groups is there any sort of indication of investment private investment that may come forward out of those discussions no we haven 't_''_856.06 we haven 't put that proposition to people we haven 't been working with them on that basis we 've been establishing a need establishing a need but in that sort of conversation do you get the feeling that there is a willingness of some groups to perhaps invest absolutely absolutely and from outside interests in overseas interests given thank you and I say that we also we do actually understand that post post our submission we don 't understand their position ya know that thank you very much thank you thank you Sam _"

here is it all right yeah no that 's absolutely fine I 'm just councillors you may not have noticed but on the hub give the board of the annual claim documents an hour under annual plan for 17 days so we 've actually set up I think it was a request from the weekend that everything go on to hunt in one page and that all the air now I can 't find anything what 's today 22nd 31 23rd today hey principal right okay let 's provide open the wrong one far away thank you and thank you for the opportunity to address the council we understand that the submission we have made has been read so we don 't wish to go through it in any detail in the priests as well this is super sort of it now that there 's a couple of comments perhaps we could could make at the beginning of was made nearly a month ago and since then of course there has been the commitment to the pre-feasibility study for a multi-purpose arena and it 's an important step and our submission finishes with the plea to get the business case underway well clearly events have moved positively from our perspective in that space Christchurch has had an outdoor arena for well over a hundred years and that was Lancaster park Lancaster park was of course a multi-purpose venue in its own right and the history of Lancaster Park is a very storied one and had an extrordinary array of community events over its life it was insured it was damaged through no fault of anybody 's in the earthquakes but insurance claim has been settled employment has been made so excuse me for just you know laughing a little but but right I mean the single munters is that is it not no it 's not comparable to the amount it was insured for indeed not yet but but has been settled in and my point is that of the things there have been legitimate issues and impediments gone and my point really was of the insurance claim has been settled for better or for worse Lancaster Park has been deemed irreparable and therefore we are now at the point where the future outdoor arena for the city is legitimately and needs to be decided we 'd also like to make the point that we do sit here and in a sense representing a very big silent majority and while a number of people Express account of view the research that we conducted showed ninety-four percent of the citizens of the city I think it is important for christchurch to host a variety of large-scale national and international events 94 percent so you can argue about a margin of error and how many people were spoken to etcetera etc but as councillors I 'm sure you understand that 's a very big number that supports a facility 91 percent believe Christchurch needs a modern mix juice outdoor event center it is true that 61% of wanted a new venue and 28 would have preferred Lancaster Park to be repaired but that issue has has been dealt with so city who who want this meta dealt with we would also like to emphasize that our support is and has always been for a multi-purpose arena just as Lancaster Park hosted a wide array of community events our supporters for a multi-purpose arena and we will be but one user hopefully an anchor tenant paying an aggrieved commercial rental but only one of many users I just like to conclude these very brief comments in support of our submission to also emphasize our offer to support so any part of the process around the feasibility work around design around Hera lease and operating arrangements might work into the future we stand ready to work with decision makers like the council to help make that process go well thank you your worship if I may just add one that one or two comments and Imus has already stated it but we 've been very public in our in our stunts I suppose that we 'll do everything that we can as an organization that is Crusaders as a as a rugby organization to do what we can to help and support that will work well for our city there 's no question that the Crusaders brand the crusaders rugby team does its but to help jail the city and help jail the supporters of our region we 're sure that in the future we 'll continue to make the team work well do what it can to continue to actually get people to come along to whatever multi-purpose arena or ground they 're playing and we 've been really grateful for what we 've had with the temporary stadium but we all know how difficult it is to live in a temporary environment for too long without starting to have issues inside your business we 've got a really healthy future we 've that we 've made some changes in our organization to hopefully have a brighter future for the Crusaders and the supporters that we have out there a new multi-purpose arena some time planned in the future will give us a bit of surety that we can continue to keep developing our business as well as our rugby team to an able us to continue that support to widen people of Christchurch that we have something to look forward to and the Crusaders have been helping that I think in the last four or five years and as I say really grateful for what we 've had like really looking forward to working with the council and the government and whoever can help us with regard to a Arina for our team to play in thank you um my question really goes back to the cost-sharing agreement arrangements because the thing that kind of worries me always is that as the level of expectation that 's been built in the public mind I mean I could get a 95 percent result on a on a on a survey if I didn 't tell people that it would cost them X Mountain rates or X Mountain capital and it would have an impact on the rates fall and their children 's rates fall and their children 's children 's rights bill but so these things are not they don 't come without a price sure and I guess that was my little chip on the insurance is that we were able to obtain but there were a number of challenging issues not least of which the fact that land had been allocated for a stadium to be built elsewhere when you 're trying to negotiate over technical issues such as still strain yeah so the thing that worries me is that there 's an expectation that the 253 million dollars that we have on our books will be sufficient to meet what people believe will be a 35,000 seat and or enclosed arena when in fact the cost-sharing agreement shows that that 's not possible to be achieved for 253 million there 's an expectation that a sum of money will come in from the private sector so that 's why the pre-feasibility isn 't so much about the nth degree business case it 's about how do you make this not a burden on the people of Christchurch for even ever yeah and and and literally we understand that statement it makes perfectly good sense to us what what what we believe I guess been stuck if that 's the right word has been that that conversation has been in this is this is not needed or this is not any serie or this is extravagant or you can do without it or look what you 've got out there hearing a and just pushing the whole thing away I think it 's entirely legitimate to have a proper conversation about what in what cost and what it looks like and what other things should be in there to help the financial model work but we 're really open about that conversation rather than tucking all that away inside the sort of pushing the project out of the way is no soap so we are we get yet we give and and what that will do is that because we 've pushed it out an hour LTP it will be an LTP conversation to bring it forward yeah and that will enable us to have that conversation with the people of Christchurch in a very explicit way if and we will know what those costs really are yeah yep yep Jonnie then tongue thank you and thank you for the submission I was going to ask about when your for the city rather than just the stadium but I think the mayor 's already touched a little bit on that so um I guess at a high level the government was supposed to do the business case so that 's beyond our control there was what was in the cost year they haven 't done it no that 's because we pushed it as nothing Jonnie as I understand that was stopping the government from doing that work we pushed it out 30th of June 2016 we do pushed it out on 2015 so anyway we oh yeah we would we were told we would get briefings we never got briefings yeah things have happened but I can 't see what stops us having the conversation now and I guess I was interested to know in terms of the future of professional sports which does seem to be the kind of bigger issue in terms of a city and in terms of the right path where do you see professional sports going with sort of declining attendance declining TV you know there 's already and raising so TV for we 've but but do you want me to predict 30 or 50 years time I don 't know quite how to do that what I do know is that sport in general and professional sport is only one little piece of sport so it 's the tip of the iceberg if you like is still a very very important part of many people 's lives and I foresee that it will continue to be so and that 's just the sport and if you look if you think about a multi-purpose arena that might attract concerts and exhibitions and other community events and I 'd urge you perhaps to read the history of Lancaster Park and it isn 't just about sport it 's about a community gathering place of a size there attracts particular Venus that otherwise wouldn 't be there and so the future of sport I think is secure in our psyche whether it is between one sport and another whether you have lean years and then great years all of that is probably true but none of it can be celebrated property if you haven was really around like this seems to be an increasing demand on ratepayers to subsidize professional sports we 're getting into betting Ward 's with other cities around New Zealand and it doesn 't seem very sustainable from a financial point of view now maybe those things that you 've said are true but the reality for us as you know the public purse as we seem to be getting increased requests for funding to subsidize professional sports yeah I don 't know if there 's Swami 's promoters we want the All Blacks to play here at cost you know like a pep set costs at the moment because because we 've got a temporary little stadium no no no no but the bidding war that goes on between different venues so we 'll be in competition with Dunedin yeah we 'll be in they 've must out too but you know in terms of in terms of the cost and professional sport and it 's not just rugby union rugby league 's the same I mean professional sports and they get us to bid against each other as I get stadiums because otherwise they won 't come and it just seems to me that there 's a really fundamental question around the sustainability with a financial model of professional sports which is why we want this pre-feasibility to kind of address a number of these issues I heard the minister say very explicitly that he does not want to see this as the the former minister as a burden on the ratepayers of Christchurch of one mind with the minister on that because I do not want to go out and promote a burden on the ratepayers of Christchurch and I think around the world there are some fantastic models where arenas or stadia have other facilities attached to them their help with with the financial model and and you can just look just google it and there 's just anything you can think of that 's attached to the stadia build hotels hotels shopping in retail hospitality that 's just so-so in our submission we 've said that 's rightly in my view that the council should be deciding that part of the city most needs in that with an arena build and get the benefits of that to mitigate the costs that would otherwise fly that 's what we 're asking the yeah the trust today at 10 I think it 's just a very simple question as you guys are clients or users of the temporary stadium because I see it from the other side what do you think that 's life spinners as it is because we know the cost of rising etc look to be absolutely honest I don 't think I can sit in the council chamber and answer that question I don 't know I 'm not an engineer I don 't know what works already being done on that we hear all the same things in the community that I 'm sure you all hear as you move around and all sorts of dates get quoted quite merrily I don 't know what is true what we do know is that the maintenance costs on an exponential curve upwards and as you would expect with the temporary facility and starting to cost a lot to keep it open more ways we 've done just to add to that for you for your two terms that we have we 've said that will work as close as we can with the current stadium trust to help make the the business for them in terms that temporary stadium work and work for us so we 're going to we 're on a temporary arrangement within but we 're going to look at look to put in place a more a more commercial arrangement going forward that ensures that we can do our bit to help mitigate that cost going forward in the interim while the business case and then maybe plan the new arena I put and play so we don 't want there to fall over it 's critical for our business as well it 's critical for our community to have it and we 'll do our bit to make sure we keep it going we can do it in and that 's why that pre feasible is so important Debbie all the parties absolutely cool I think you can will commit and if the Crusaders keep paying away that all weekend yeah exit or abroad okay well thank you very much that 's much appreciated okay _"

    "text": "so get this okay this very short so curate and counsel I 'm Sophie and I 'm a resident from the North Richmond area it will rate payer there as well and my submission purely relates to the rebuild of the shirley community center which if you probably read my submission we received a leaflet last year in November that it was going to be rebuilt in Emily because the official I got and probably possibly wrong and I did contact CCC I was encouraged to to be involved in the process and because I got in contact with CCC staff leader the email address that was provided I then subsequently received in April an email that explained that the rebuild had moved from the annual plan to the long-term plan and I was quite surprised a because I hadn 't heard anything about this from any other beings and so my primary concern was that if I had made contact the CCC and asked to be kept informed the majority of the communities in the area would not have a clue that that rebuilt had moved from the annual years or who knows when my second concern was that there was no explanation given to why our rebuild was being moved so I pretend I believe the community board the poppin or unis Community Award I don 't believe Paulina 's councillor Cotter is a member of possibly could have explained an engaged community of it more about this this issue and yeah I 'm sure you heard that they are my food my third question is if the if the move of that community to rebuild was due to trying to cap rate rises are there other areas in the annual plan which could be potentially seen as a lower prior than the rebuild of a community center and in my submission I referred to for example the renewal of Park was a call to Park Park surfaces yeah so for exactly that 's my example where I can 't see how a community center could not be prioritized over an year of park surfaces for their current year and purely because the benefit to that local community that has waited quite a while for the center to grass yeah you know we had a very strong submission from the community board and support of what you 're saying a poor dumb thanks for coming in Sophie we 're aware of the proposal that the crossface church had to to partner with the council on that site there was one reference to it in the email from the cccc staff member who didn 't explain about what it was so I feel bit more explanation might have been you I apologize as a lack of communication and partly because a lot of the users who used the old center to stand and of course Dennis 's passed on so he was the one keeping people together but that there was a program a project that was some got to a certain point and then it became untenable for council it didn 't stack up so we were going to provide the land and they were going to do the center and there was quite a couple of but well attended public meetings about that so we 're kind of like pretty much starting from scratch again now so the st. Albans Community Center we 'll set up a working group with some community board members on and reps from the community and we neon out what what we need for that site and in what 's going to be served the community and then the design and how we 'll do it so that 's why it has been pushed out of it because that takes time so unfortunately we lost a lot of time and engaging the crossways Church so it 's pretty much what 's happened there so it 's kind of starting Sookie you know if you want to keep involved it would be fabulous but I can see that so in the next three next three years and your plans that 's predicted to have zero to not occur in 2019 18 19 19 20 so we 're looking at 19 2022 then you 'd like some development money I thought at least I could see it being brought forward substantially yeah and I think that possibly reference to the LTP as that is a process that begins we actually immediately after the senior which is a three year operational plan but a 10 year horizon from 2018 to 2028 but we will be going out with a similar consultation document and all the other documents sitting and behind it in late January early for probably probably February next year and that will then go through and we actually want to develop a better process of engaging communities and their local issues so that we can sort of almost streamline this process so that we 're workshopping within the community board areas and then bringing that together and making an overarching plan for the city so but you know I think that others have represented exactly what you have which is a concern about the need to replace what is an important and valuable asset I 'm looking forward to seeing what the community board submitted on this proposal as well great without you online thank you yep I thank you very much the x is to submit early mike is the other community board for the area right um do you live in Shirley I live in North Richmond which is part was actually because obviously we 're doing the st. Albans one at the moment which is tracking along on on schedule and it 's in that community I guess we 've got community groups that actually driving it as well and we found with surely one when we started to do some consultation and engagement we didn 't have that same same Drive which is really interesting and so if you 're a resident is we could to get someone to actually help driver with the community board as well to try and see what we really need because it is needed and cherlene obviously we 're doing some stuff in around McFarland Park and but it 's the other side of Shirley but we don 't want to run ahead and build a two and a half million dollar community center when we don 't actually know what that need is completely I 'm so be really good to get people from the community to engage with us so we can get it right yeah so I 've been connecting up with is a Facebook group for the area and that I 've been added to so if it 's time to make contacts in the area and talk about this issue more so I 've also been thinking about the same thing yeah just just to enter that there is 321 yeah three hundred and twenty thousand dollars over the next two financial years for to develop a robust business case and work with community boards wanting to file sites and locations and stuff so that is a mingle plan yes yeah but the LTP process will enable it to be brought forward so the fact that it 's sitting further out the LTP process can bring it forward but I really ask you to he book what both Mike and Pauling is saying is that if there is a strong community network that 's able to advocate and and also look at future use I mean you know we have on our agenda the restoration of buildings for example or what we 're going to do with them once they 're open is actually a big part of making the decision about the priority that we attach to Engagement is so inviting so vital because the last one was run by a trust in very successfully so in if you can find something as similar models that you want to develop from the community we 're all ears yeah yeah all right hmm is the challenge back to you okay look thank you very much and it 's an extremely positive waiter in the day of submission so thank you very much much appreciate _"

hope we succeed in developing him I could net angle plan the attack expresses the strength that a group has when it works together rather than as single individuals and I think that 's a very important consequence it comes to city we represent car Cantabria which is a group of various parties organizations and individuals who support the retention of those assets left in public or collective ownership you may have noticed as at council meetings at some time quietly and respectfully holding our sense the failing and failed neoliberal policy of throwing away all collectively owned and controlled assets still has some adherents but they 're quickly falling the claimed benefits or strengthen the resilience to face a future that may hold many uncertainties our greatest asset is our democracy and neoliberalism is simply an attack on democracy I think that this is the first time I 've spoken to you since the local body elections so I congratulate you on your success and persuading the people of Christchurch that you 're the best fit to be kopaka party I remember sitting in the Capitol Cathedral during the campaign and hearing Leanne clearly say read my lips then commit to holding those assets that we 've been campaigning to retain so congratulations to the council for supporting lian and meeting at least in part that pitch to keep assets congratulations you know I was there we also we 're also pleased that Lian has committed to renegotiating the cost share agreement in a transparent way there are two elephants in the room with plenty in Christchurch and I 'm not just simply referring to Gerry Brownlee there the two are the cost of the gusher agreement and the restriction and it 's restrictions on effective local democracy and on to our main main concerns City care should be immediately restored to the street teacher asset list our preferences for City care to be brought back and housed in Council as a works department with the non grata Christchurch sectors of its empire building placed in CC a cello or another lb ta until the people can be consulted on possible use one of the few sensible things in the Cameron report was the stated need to ensure the council Lyon Council owned assets aligned with the interests of the people of Christchurch the best method of doing this as a works department we don 't need Delta filtering Hogan taking profits from the work that should be done by our works both Department it was quite interesting listening to that previous lady show you where Delta and some of those other contractors are failing during the campaign and said that public transport should be under the control of the Christ of the Council we completely agree so red brush should also read return to the strategic asset list we 're concerned that the tendering process for services and flow of profits to a company and a reduction of service to people the need and city bus was a very good example we support pedestrian and cycle use of the public roads and people Christchurch on the roads not the local businesses or property owners there are good examples overseas of cities that have decided prioritize cycling and walking to complement public transport we also encourage further work on the public rail passenger service from Amberleigh Ricardo field and Littleton investment in public rail is a much better option than the large spend on roading such as a northern expressway you said I 'm aware that that is a transit issue but we you know it 's all public money going into a dying technology basically the council should include provision for the immediate implementation of a living wage for other people employed either directly or indirectly to do council work along with secure hours of work where possible and the face of the crisis of for low-income tenants and families the council needs to immediately increase the number of council housing units to number two the number of more land transfers to the development development Christchurch lizard limited as a substance or a subsidiary of CHL the council has recently could for submissions on the lens transported DC l1 is curious as to whether what effect this has on that traffic plan and also how much more lend it is proposing to transfer and how it intends to see that development is actually achieved rather than lend just being Lane banked and the life of these Christians a consideration of a rate on underdeveloped urban land to encourage action rather than just land holding by speculator to be very useful thank you for listening and hopefully considering what we 've had to say thank you and just a question if City care was to be taken back into Council as a Works Department what would happen to all the employees who work and contracts that they 've won an Auckland and Wellington well that 's that 's why I said the non the non Greater Christchurch which should be placed in a separate unit and consultation of the people gross ditch as to what to do with that companies are split all the time merged and emerged and so you wouldn 't oppose us selling the parts of city care that have contracts and others we are more concerned with the public assets that research what the people I would say to in a consultation process about the rest of it I don 't know so we 're agnostic about that to a certain extent then behind rule we prefer to see public ownership of most things yes but Christchurch Christchurch Christchurch receives the benefit of yes it does and that offers receive I 've been of the whole company and that you 're suggesting that we would divide the company and then consult on selling the component that has caused a lot of maintenance not not selling but what to do with the other other components Delta 's taking profits out of Christchurch for the meat Dunedin City Council well Christchurch is taking profits out of Auckland realized and Wellington is we need to consult to find out what people would think about that we 've never waved the flag for the whole empire building of city we certainly do not wait with a flag at all the building I think it 's survival and we certainly don 't wave a flag for the CEO of City care getting 600,000 bucks a year or whatever he gets and that will find no support from us for that that started off as a simple good old message City Council Works Department that 's what we say the city needs not this other corporate stuff we realize that that is following a model imposed from central government in the lead exactly but nonetheless we say that Christchurch has made a stand before in opposition to the dictates of central government hence the whole much maligned phrase the People 's Republic of Cross used for example and that so we don 't wave any flags for them sort of empire building all around the country or a grand icing huge bloody each salaries and further interesting pointers as that and the reason it was established was because you actually couldn 't get NZTA funding right for well transit funding in the day but NZTA funding today for not putting your stopped having a contracting company of our own we would get no contracts for any of our roadworks because we wouldn 't get funding from NZ ta we really put at risk 40% or 50% of the funding that we would get for our I think I think we got to compare that risk that lien with the risk to our democracy when local work isn 't controlled and developed and run and the interests of the local people with a local democracy backing it and yes um that 's why I mentioned neoliberalism we 're aware that neoliberalism uses all sorts of dirty tricks to bend people smaller councils arms of their backs to achieve a market structure that is failing yeah but but that may well be the case but are you saying that that it would be better for us to you know sort of I 'm saying that so I 'll pretend against the tide and to end to take the Department take City care beckon as a department of Christchurch and not get any funding from NZ ta for Road contract I 'm not I 's good it might be it might be better to to challenge the central government enforcing neoliberal ideas on us well in the future so state at which case a city care works would be much better you guys will get a chance to do that later in the year and we 're also note with concern the proposal for the council to give away the Milton Street Depot of city cared of DCL this we think that makes that that much harder for any city here ever come back as a whoops Department our city care has another site and it actually suits them very that they would continue these documents on the document says I 've expressed an intention to move well it 's all rather vague yeah mode and once Milton streets gone no no that that that they are perfectly happy with the but the proposal that sat out for out for a separate Nagar arm consultation there any other questions so sorry sorry enough and but I 'd like to say something could be on about um about cycleways Canterbury University has a very good at about social ways at places like Copenhagen which has a policy of lowering roads to deteriorate while they do at the cycle ways of footpaths and then that keeps people out of cars because it 's so much more pleasant to ride a cycle over oh yeah you have to be brave very good look thank you very much for your time and consideration it 's much appreciated thank you very much Cheers _"

supervisor we just finished planting 800 trees in clear water above the groins like right that 's nice on that note I think that 's the annual plan have three side to it and the first one is doing the community amenities as centers an old stone house and all of that and I really support of that I really enjoy going up to the son of the Kiwi and having coffee after that was opened so that 's great second one is all the infrastructure of water I think nobody will oppose unless you do it for the testing level of failing carmela back there and you 're not going that way so I think that 's good as well and the last thing is the cycle waste which I 'm supporting of and I think there was a lot of opposition for cycle ways from business and from economy we get a car for each one cyclists death will be even cheaper I think the question we need to ask yourself is different is not who will it 's actually who we 're building it for those sake ways and I think you actually billing it for yourself I ride a bike doesn 't matter I ride Lincoln Road I run Rome I don 't care about the side of the road I even write pages Road but if you think about the time you are spending every week in a car and I would say probably most of you spend about 12 hours a week in a car if you commute and between places how much money will you willing to pay to get five or ten percent of the row of the cars next to you disappear that 's what the cycle ways are about no those are all this cycle it just to make your life easier I think we had quite an interesting opportunity for five years ago when we had a funding document called share an idea the share an idea was written by nicely that 's people want to more cycleways more sure path even on the extent of removing car parks and I know a lot of businesses are on your neck about don 't remove the car parked or remove the carpet but when you go to the actually document that 's what people have crutches ask you to do so if you do build those sucker ways and I hope you do make sure you do it up to standard that 's people will be encouraged to use them if you 're going to put them understand that they 're not going to attract people and your problem not going to be solved thank you for the time well we opened the Feast of the major cycle routes on the 30 yeah firstly open Billy to River Walk yeah and I 'll tell you I mean we were we were waiting for the minister to turn up and so there were a number of people who were already using it and it was just like thumbs up and it is a beautifully designed one I have to say because it you 're not on Lincoln Road at that point and connects to the park into the city and then also connects out to the to the route that runs alongside the motorway I just think it 's fantastic I agree with you myself I write Lincoln Orry it 's faster and I that 's also a firm it 's not an issue but if you get more people to use that then your commute will be easier I see they 're exactly that at the opening the more people who cycle the safer it is for cyclists yeah yeah yeah and it 's easier for you to commute to work yeah yeah yeah so I 've been doing a bit of research around around cycle lanes and businesses and just transport network it off as a whole and one of the interesting things that I 've just I haven 't quite done er a conclusive research on it but I 've got a friend of mine who in the United States there 's a transport planner and when they initially put a lot of cycling lines in the city and a decline of cars they actually got to decline to the public transport network and so locally argument that we 've got this carver cyclist thing is actually starting to drive me up the wall because actually what we 're seeing this to public transport and Christchurch is actually going down so are we actually getting people off the cars out of cars or are we getting them off the buses so I think we actually are missing the missing the boat here actually not including public transport into our conversation so I think this is a really it 's a good point that you 've raised but I think we need to be very careful we actually include public transport because otherwise we 're not going to we 're going to miss the boat and actually just keep this tension alive I understand I think that public transport in Christchurch is managed by you can and they have done a big shift of how they run the public transport and I think that 's one of the reason why you see a big decline because people who used to sold by changing will be heaven come through yes but that will be with again and Phil just a quick question when you go to say to an events and you 're taking your bike do you think we perhaps need more infrastructure MSI having the cycle stands in places for people to park their bikes that 'll be easier um what I know in the USA coming back to there a lot of places hit post cyclists way once I start to see the benefit actually a shop owner come and ask people to remove Park car park and have bicycles then because they understand that 's when you ride a bike you actually stop on the way and do more shoppings and when you 're in a car because in a car you have an idea I go one two and three and you don 't look in between where am i bike you can stop thank you for your time it 's good thank you very much appreciate you coming on Nick _"

    "text": "right Joe jozu boss welcome 1082 sorry edits I 'm just telling counselors what page to turn to 1082 so I 'm just I 'm just repeating the scale of submissions that we have um was there a slideshow or have you seen one through yeah yeah here someone 's coming to help well while we 're waiting I 'm Joe everyone we these are the answers here I 'm usually talking about Paul 's today I 'm talking about roads what do I need to do can I get my order this way what am i doing anyway right to the end this one 's on are so go back to the one okay that one year it 'll go through each one okay cool radios I 've printed off some of these pictures just in case this didn 't go through what I want to get across is we need to actually get some more funding for looking after the east side of town you 've heard all morning about all these other submissions and I fully support everything that they 're talking about that we 've got it not coming up full screen how do I do that sorry if five about the bottom one down to the bottom one down to slight you know the slideshow button is that now over the other side how about go to view at the top slideshow no it 's quite new screen looks great excellent thank you so back before Christmas I actually organized a petition to get YouTube action on pages Road there 's so many times I 've driven down that road in seeing disabled people when mobility scooters trying to negotiate the footpath the roads is really dangerous my son started biking to high school in 2011 two or anui and after the earthquakes he had to give up walk into school was just far too dangerous and too many roadworks too many potholes etc etc I clicked at 427 signatures not after a few hours in a few days of collecting signatures I gave up and I thought this is ridiculous 99% of the people I asked if they were interested in signing said of course it 's atrocious as a disgrace it should have to express a I 've been watching them like saying about the businesses and how pages road was down to one lane and the businesses suffered this area of pages road between the bridge and Anzac Drive has to be repaired again it 's going to be shut again the businesses in your Brighton are going to suffer again it 's just not on this is the footpath during Samaras or a family walking down to the beach there 's about three mums then two adult men for kids on scooters now the mums HED Prem 's the kids on scooters trying to negotiate down the year New Zealanders disabled people trying to get along the Earth 's actually really Sydney well here 's one of the pieces where the people buy for long of course now this here is gay his rope bridge that 's in the red zone and there 's there nice cycle weighing everything through the red zone again this is gay his row through the red zone why can 't we had that go into New Brighton that 's a red zone then and I pages rate because that section is read zoned very of carpark this is just like a dumping ground for bits and pieces if you see this but here there 's a road cone here and I 've been going through pass this for months and months and months and nothing 's been done even to pull the road cone out I felt like getting other car myself and actually pulling the road cone out of the hole but I think it 's a good illustration about the neglect on your roads Thea now these two votes pages wrote in your Brighton Road are the main roads em to New Brighton and out of New Brighton if there 's an emergency a tsunami anything we need to get out in a hurry we 've got to go through with us and this really gets really really overgrown along this area and last week I went along here and that actually mowed it and for some reason I don 't know why but they only mode sections of it so it 's like they stopped at one place and then they started been fixed there 's new writing on this side where the mouse is pointing and then they leave the old stuff in your Brighton Road has pictures of us going for needs of the road and it 's like why isn 't the whole lot being done at once everywhere where there 's a new piece of road that meets the old piece of road every time it rains or floods that is where the water is pulling this is in Zac Drive roundabout there are two roundabouts and Anzac Drive which is the Ring Road this here the main one in Brighton Road for some reason three of the four corners have been left the other corner has been looked after in groomed it has a long cut and yet the other corners are just overgrown misses and they have all the curbs are broken and everything here 's the sign pointing to in your Brighton and you can see the grass this is actually a few weeks ago it 's actually over the top of the sign this week and the lawn has been mowed over the other middle but this has been neglected this is the road that continues on to New Brighton and just where I 'm pointing with the maths is where the road has been repaired in folks but for some reason this but hasn 't been done leaning into it this is the new road which has been put your Brighton here and Hawk Street as where my mouse is pointing and just ran the corner all of this has been replaces of brie new guttering and you can see how it 's all going all green and moldy and it 's full of global so it 's maintenance and I don 't know whether this is a temporary fix this piece of road or whether it 's permanent but um it 's not a good look and it 's actually quite disheartening when you 're a resident going through these places all the time is that Keys Road no this is New Brighton Road then you 're right around about is right at the end and that 's Hawk Street there zero for now that round yet it 's been open for go into New Brighton Road from the roundabout no this is one way only goes towards New Brighton so they haven 't made decisions about what 's happening there so and this it looks disgusting yes actually all moldy and it rain I 'm sure it 's temporary I 'm sure it 's temporary now this here is another section of the redesign this is by choose reach a the side drive bikers reach Parma 's Road this section here is not read zone there 's housing all the way down here and it 's an excellent missed all the guttering and the rise and the footpath this is the only Green Zone photo I have very cerritos your Brighton Road I thought this 100 straits it quite well every day when I take my son to Julie boys high school down the road I go past here and I thought I 'm going to stop and take a photo with us one day you can see the cones and rubbish the loop and bush hasn 't been touched pages and this is Avondale Road another section through the red Road and Paige 's road should be treated equivalently to these roads that do go through the red signs finally here 's more red zone Anzac Drive I know it 's a Ring Road it 's important but new Porsche and Road and pages rotor are really important as well goes through a majority of the red zone with its NZTA road yeah yeah and foster out is it council NCTA frost road is the road that goes beside qe2 apart and it got repaired relatively quickly and it 's just another example of what we should be having with the rest of our roads that 's the end of those um thinking I mean well we 've come to the end of okay sorry no but you think thank you very much Oakley it may do we point out that you do do they so thank you for that thank you _"

    "text": "what we have the South button residents Association page team 77 welcome hi you must all be falling asleep by the stage not falling asleep but with some coffee anyway Kyoto I 'm Kirsten kiri and I 'm speaking as a representative of the South bright and residents association I 'll be referring to the Burwood Coast Awards specifically New Brighton and south near Brighton I have loved and worked in this area for 23 years and I believe I understand the needs of the community particularly health and all that supports health having worked at New Brighton Healthcare with John Cook the food 's ons who spoke this morning and for 13 years as a public health news across many of the schools in this Ward I have three points I wish to cover this afternoon um the people of New Brighton and South Brighton need faith and hope and their future areas of South Brighton and in particular those along kipper white Street and the streets that border the history require well-engineered protection against tidal flooding damaged infrastructure and the eastern suburbs due to significant lateral movement caused to have needs to be replaced with more than just temporary stamps top banks now I appreciate you 've been hearing this all day but I 'm just going to say it all over again I 'm aware of the stock bank extension that has planned south of Bridge Street this construction is to take place later in the year and is expected to take one month a month it seems a short amount of time to create a stock bank that will offer any true protection if one refers to the long term plan 2015 2015 it states the Aven River stop banks are temporary measures to protect the area which too pending on the development plan for the area could be abandoned raised or rebuilt elsewhere doesn 't leave much hope for us doesn 't the disparity of protection this has also been alluded to today from the tidal influence of the eastery post the earthquakes are obvious between us and our eastern neighbors one only has to drive along the ferry Mead Causeway and visit beach Ville road to see well-engineered eastery protection I am sure this for that same protection if this is not feasible and the temporary stop banks at all that we can expect please inform us and assist us to prepare for the possibility of managed retreat and some of these high-risk areas so that we are not left to see our land and our house values drop even more than they have over the last six years people have and will lose the equity that they had for future plans number two the South Brighton residents Association fully supports the council 's proposal to provide eleven point two million dollars for the wider development of the hot saltwater pools project we will take anything we do appreciate this is only part of a series of projects aiming to revitalize the area that are promised a firm budget and a timeline for this project and all such projects would give residents more confidence that something will actually happen number three we are pleased the whale pulling new brighton is due to be upgraded really really for the summer we hope this area will be will be separate from the hot saltwater pools and can just say yes thank you yes so that 's all I need to say thanks for your time but I don 't think it hurts to reiterate what has been said many times today we love our area and we wish to stay thank you absolutely green did you hear okay yes okay I thought you did oh my god just sir yeah body language in out loud but it was more like have I got this I mean there are many complex issues here we appreciation if you go but would it be fair to say that what residents are looking for is certainty yes in a difficult complex uncertain environment absolutely we want when we just want to know the reality I 've been on many different things one of them was the review of the Tonkin and Taylor report that was suggested that there would be an update around April and I know it 's only a month later but again it 's another month that we wait to hear about what is planned I listen to your reply to Seamus this morning liyan and and just there are people that are in a holding pattern thanking do we stay do we go do we leave before our properties are worth nothing and then I think you spoke to John Cook about do we do we invest and in this area and build more houses well if you want to retain people or you want people to buy the houses that are even for sale people have to know that it 's a safe place that is going to be protected so heretical as it may sound to some ears in some ways if some areas had gone red years ago that would have been better because I 'd have provided the certainty way be sure and I think you know like I think that was also said that some other areas should have gone red absolutely and at the time it was a very difficult decision and no one knew the true damage that had been done to the land but I mean there are certain areas particularly near the Easter egg and kibble White Street Falcon Street we are shame where Hugo and Emma position they don 't know what you 're doing now that actually feels like orange is if you were you know that that it feels like a man 's land it 's no man 's land and no life can you just can 't see a future for yourself okay I 'm I 'm in a great position I 'm closer to the sea but I would I would not want to be in a position that some of these people are on yep I think you know the reassurance that I was trying to cook this morning was that we have to work collaboratively with regenerate Christchurch because they are responsible for the residential red zone regeneration planning process and so but they 're all connected and they 're connected through the estuary and the river stop banks decisions that we make at the mouth of the history I mean not the mouth of the history but where the river enters the eastery where the coastal environment ends and the river begins which is further up than I thought it was yeah because it 's changed because partly because to make sure that we take all of those elements into account but we 've said that we as a city will not abandon the people of South Brighton in terms of that particular area that you have identified and we will take responsibility for the outline regeneration planning process and we will engage with the communities and we will find solutions so and I know I understand the lack of certainty and in some ways I was lucky to be rid zoned and I 've spoken to people who were Reds owned and they say that it was it was like lucky but you know for a lot of them they lost a lot of money the winners and the losers and there is a period of limbo and we we relate to it absolutely so we 're determined to get to some solutions but they 're not going to be instant but they will be very open and engaged with all of the communities that are affected I can promise you that so Phil and in Sarah thank you for your submission Kirsten because I think no having period we were part of the earlier Tonkin Taylor discussions and so my understanding is that in fact that report the review should be available by the end of this month that 's my understanding and and but when we have the perhaps the other information like the multi hazard report that staff of doing that clearly they that that information should be part of the conversations that we have with the residents of the different coastal areas okay but that 's a minor issue in that unit a glass of water sorry I 'm a little bit worried about and that multi hazard resort will be due to working with Ariel Tina this year um it certainly should be so Kirsten it sounds like that 's what you would like to that yeah that information being clear to residents yeah absolutely okay thank you thanks Sarah thank you and I 'm just gonna switch topics because the eastery stuff is just being quite well covered in the erosion of those kind of issues and I switch back to the and the way Paul and surrounding areas which will be talked about much earlier in the day was the communications around this that 's because there 's eight million dollars yeah if you look at you know millions going towards and the surf club and in is the redevelopment of the playground warm water and the weld pool and especially all of those things that are going to be happening and engagement starting really soon on the design of those do you think that 's been well communicated I mean I look at the benefits that Margaret Murphy and it says such a destination playground and the potential for that in their space and the benefits that will bring does it mental health well-being yeah those kinda I think there 's been many opportunities where people have been able to put their voice forward I haven 't seen any final plans yet I don 't know if there are final plans for the world it 's coming up that is coming up but I think that the know I think the communication with the community has been relatively good people have been able to make stood missions and influence the they feel like nothing has happened which is what hot saltwater pools where is this first stage of what the hot saltwater balls with the hot water and the whale pull those kind of things it 's on its way this year right and which one of people would realize the edge when they were asking for what they thought was the first thing well it 's definitely been in the press yep that 's what I thought I think being well communicated I don 't think that 's been poorly communicated yeah I think you 've even welcomed some information to share with the community and local newsletter successful because I 'd be through residents associations as well which we are more than happy to do but I have seen it even with the New Brighton project and I 've also seen it through so no I just heard through the submission process that actually people think that the hot saltwater pools is the first project when actually it 's like stage 2 stage 3 kind of thing you 've also got very good signage up at the right you could that one okay done much good so thank you thanks very much thank you very much it 's much appreciated _"

    "text": "and you can pop on your crush which is three group effects and you 've joined by Derek Keenan okay last moon at afternoon from the Christ Church History Association and to a certain degree our submission that most probably could be looked at as a reiteration of last year 's other than in fact that we realized the council 's constrained in its financial position but we feel that in the six years since the earthquakes the protection around up to Maine and along South Shore nothing virtually has been done to protect that from southerly storms what was the air the craft and the earthquake along South Shore had been put there by the residents that have backed onto the air and majority of it was demolished along with the houses it should have been left but was virtually a lack of supervision of the demolishes it wasn 't left but the amount of erosion that takes place this significant mode would say that with a suddenly that 's blowing out there today going to they 're a lot more silk washed away from that built-up area will tide the water will be over the top and flooding in through those sections the same along that domain which I still classes clipping point 2 minor loads being renamed as the South New Brighton reserve but around the rivers with the earthquake drop the banks away and lay slumped into the river nothing had been done in the six years since the earthquakes to reinstate the woods of the rulers to what they were before hand and the rushes and the yellow irises which well the yellow iris is a at least are a noxious weed now just spreading further and further into the river particularly around homeland draw over Navin side drive my reading of this of the annual plan is no mention of in spending to happen along there I have seen a plan of stock bank being renewed from a city virtually to Bexley and whether within that rebuilding of stock banks and topping up a stock banks or some provision being made to reinstate the bank of the river to its true status I 've not seen Cleary on so that that 's your submission no no no what that 's the plenty of time for questions so that 's all right Glenn and then Aaron thank you for your submission we 've had some conversation through the in the hearings process today over the different sides if you like of the eastery would you be able to to convey to us your understanding of the hydrodynamics on one side say that the kind of beautiful roads on the side in the south shore side what 's your understanding of wave action wind action separately together and and the effects of of that on the on the shoreline on both sides long South Shore and the domain side they take a lot heavier pounding in a southerly storm and your East lead does to Korean Humphrey Drive and rents ending point and on the weather drainage board ponds there 's not the same amount of wash action created on that side from uh Nestor Lee as there is on the sets on Brighton side or south right and side from a southerly and I 'm also I 've been a member of Pleasant point Yacht had to cancel races since we 've been in the domain last two or three seasons we 've actually had to cancel races because we couldn 't get bikes off the shore and a southerly you know a strong southerly so colleagues there are two groups these the Aven Hector is stripe history you die trust which I 'm on and then yeah yeah the Aven Heathcott ste who Todd Trust is involved in developing the ecological management plan for the Haven Heath Kadesh 3eu ty so they would probably be better placed to answer that question yep okay I 'm Aaron yeah the so my question was just around the shape of the riverbanks and we had a presentation earlier I think it was from Dave west from the Kashmir stream care group and a lot of our rivers now a kind of a lot more carved a new shape whereas their natural form of the type of rivers they were that they were a big yellow you yes yeah so what 's your position on that like I know that you say get them back to some form shape I can arbitrate more they were well round curves reach and hold us and rise I or more the shut down and then they headed belly underneath but more of a not not a vertical play is having a vertical bank and but you don 't want you curve coming right up to the top level it 's very noticeable particularly kids reach with a bank 's crashed crashed into the brother refund which tend oh no curse reach was catch you know that it was a card so the natural run of the rower which is why it 's called why known it bend in the river that the natural run of the river is what sits in by Aven side drive and hooks around to run power park year-round pirate park support praxis and the in the middle of what was the natural run of the river it was part of the meander which is why the land is so challenged in their environment they always are when when you do that and so it was cut for the rhyme yep said South sure there was a blend well filled and formally so it was never consented there was an element of that along those ends a net was really exposed after the earthquakes when that didn 't hold up and then houses were demolished as well anyway but no these there are huge ly challenging issues and that 's why I 'm saying that there has to be that 's why there is this collaborative approach between regenerate Christchurch the Christchurch City Council and the communities and those areas because this residential red zone to the north this residential red zone to the south and it has to be joined up so we 'll get that in the and them no I 've got a bit signal left we 'll just have a question you are talking about pleasant point in the end the Yacht Club and the end the exit there I mean the the distance of the word off so if you 've got the same amount of wind it 's going to cause the same amount of windage but is it just because the geological conditions on the south shore side with Excel land because of the earthquake on that part of it is that why you 're seeing more problems on the side I was there anything angling away out just four years need for protection along that edge not just since the earthquake it has it been made worse hmm is it worse though well I shouldn 't come over the top of the bank and I shudder Lee yes but what I 'm saying is a worse now than it was before I think it 's always been a problem otherwise gone thank you but thank you very much and thank you again right and good to see you both and obviously there 's quite a bit of work that we 've still yet to be doing in terms of our submission so thank you very much for putting on that effort _"

    "text": "right so next we have the Kashmir residents group rep tundle hi welcome today good afternoon everybody thank you for this opportunity to present I understand it is a one page note we see ten that 's available to you now I thought it was going to be on the screen for me to be able to see it as well we were asked for slides okay you 're asked for slides and I provided a an image for the screen I understand you give you a printed copy now like they don 't open but just by way of lead and I just want to endorse the spray-tanned neighborhood Network submission for improvement of the Barrington mall entry and exit onto Barrington Street when we were referring to traffic improvements Mosley 's Road hoping that it won 't be in any way competitive was what least heaven on Barrett and Street for safer vehicle entering access to Barrett Amal kappa that was in my hand written submission which i put on to be drawn into this process so thank you for the opportunity to speak today does it to us new counsel so congratulations to all of you with your success last October I can tell from your heads down and the relative the headlines or work as usual is proceeding in this the city 's giving you its full support and neck so I just wanted to let you to a meeting that happened in our general area on 22nd of March 2017 we representatives of we small and Crake often kashmir residents associations and we use the acronym wicker to cover that area which was really brought together as a result of the cycle park being formed in the Kashmir Valley over a year ago that kind of drew us into a conceit here in condition if you like where they would consult with us regularly and so that spurred constant communication between the association 's of the area working as a group and we have met a few times and we more recently to discuss the port Hellfire effects and response and the cities draft and your plan which we you 're considering today we come up with four resolutions by consensus on the tree addressing lobbying collectively for a community Civic facility for Westmoreland to balance the overall wicker area out for the level of service including community resilience and response capacity so no noting that there is significant council reserve land on Westmoreland Hall there 's a lot of development happening up there more and more all the time or housing wondering at what trigger level there might it might occur that council puts on any community facility there if it 's thinking of that at all it 's quite an isolated area and they do use the reserved space at the bottom of the hill for their community events but obviously that 's not all weather and all weather facility and community good organized meetings for itself if it has some kind of community facility so that 's probably new in the discussion not on the plan now but that 's just highlighting that some point in time that discussion along those lines would be appreciated because Kashmere if you like to the east of year there are church buildings for example in schools we are meetings do occur regularly and there 's a submission in favor of keeping there was these road Kashmere Odin high road intersection upgrade in the coming financial year for completion where it was initially kicked as we understand and the annual plan proposes to spread it out into the following year so that was a clear concern from local residents that the intersection upgrade was needed for safety and obviously with all the logging that 's coming on stream this year post fire the traffic intensity the year is worse and also with the cycle Park built there there 's no actual infrastructure on the road to handle it cycling traffic now or into the future so there 's a lot of enthusiasm for the cycling to be supported was good access good safe access into their Valley we 're asking that the council would please adopt a joint approach to our groups we snore on craik often Kashmir for recovery post fire and to help us build local resilience in that we have a web page on facebook.com slash weaker three is on your notes where we can be found we 're hoping the council can point of communication now the the consent condition for the cycle park has brought the groups together together on a regular basis and that 's really productive local communication that 's happening we 're hoping the council can do something similar to communicate with these groups before the intersection upgrade was flagged we requested our local community pool which was Braden Miska at the time to facilitate a meeting words that reckon Wigram board collaboratively to look at improvements for Kashmir Road we were told it would happen and it never did but the appendices upgrade isn 't the plan which probably negated the need for that meeting but still we wanting to have some communications a bit of a isolated area as I said tucked away in the corner in the stadium and we worked have some kind of recognized channel to talk with you council more often in lastly there and on our resolutions we 're asking the council please produce a vegetation plan for the hills behind our residential areas post fire that it be expert verified communicated want to know the details that planting plan in we understand that we would think it would have good fire breaks and plenty of green indigenous plants like flex that don 't burn too easily motion the great danger the recent fires presented through flammable plants in exotic species I can 't see the clock so hoping this imply Mary for Christians I think there is Tim thanks a lot right now I can answer the reason why the year with the joint meeting with the Woodrum community in the Kashmir sprayed and was because it got on the book and that 's why it was kind of keen to and I don 't maybe that wasn 't well put it out but that 's because we that 's why I thought we thought that that was what the whole solar meeting so that 's why that one was and now that you 've brought the attention with regards to the three community boards getting to give other groups maybe we can look at that I mean it 's a severe type fifty favorite so that 's not a production ministry with regards to community facilities again I hadn but every community it 's quite logical that you want a home so to speak the craft house will be up and running I know it 's not technically on the hill of very small endures but because of the financials and things like that in the short term and it basically will be an old new building I mean certainly for obvious and crafts of it negates one one of those communities quiche me has got a number of facilities that can so it really it 's only we small and that doesn 't stay in the short-term whatever that term of three five whatever years it is certainly the craft if they kind of those three communities are talking but certainly be able to to utilize that surely there be in the short term or medium term yes there 's a central point it just leaves open the question for the size of the population always more on tell what community facility might be being considered by council on the future if the developers ever mentioned anything too the community I 'm not aware there 's any communication to ask some hips that 's just you know yes oh just amongst the association 's talking no no one had any knowledge of anything like that it would only be a feat that we small in residence I would not because the kitchen across the kitchen without you that 's right and I 'm not aware they another submission was made like we agreed to make a joint one I fell on these lines in died ask them to come today if they could and they obviously could no not some pretty interesting any other questions no thank you very much and you can stay right there because you are the next submission as well thank you _"

counselors and thank you for the opportunity to make a submission I 'm joined by Nick moody and Rosalee who are supporters of the trust members of the trust and they 're actually another couple of people who are going to come along but because we 've bought the timetable for they may well turn up later and you may get this again because they are wasn 't able to contact them so very briefly I 'm going to outline what the Styx living laboratory trust is how it contributes to what the City Council is trying to do and our then conclude with our final submission which is simply to reinstate some funding that was originally set out in the plan and has since been cancelled I think it 's important to start by explaining from the sticks living laboratory trust so the question City Council 's set up late last 2040 the sticks so this is a city council initiative and there are five visions set out in that document and the trust was set up to achieve vision three and I won 't go into all the detail of that but the trust consists of a group of volunteers who are doing the work of the Christchurch City Council initiative that is vision 2000 2040 and to achieve certain outcomes for the sticks the the trust has got two parts we 've got some trustees and we 've got a Board of Management and we 're just going through a refreshment of membership of those and we 've got a lot of new members a lot of new interests and that 's all very much on track we 've gotten our participation from the community board and some local residents the trust also has memoranda of understanding with the University of Canterbury Lincoln our newer men Environment Canterbury so we 're pretty well linked in to organisations which can contribute to achieving that vision our activities are things like once a month water quality monitoring once a month bird 're just starting to plan next years so we just generally in touch with the community through those activities and that 's how we have volunteers doing the work we also make submissions on matters affecting the sticks and as more and more people live in the catchment like the Preston subdivision they are encouraging us to make submissions to again I come back and emphasize the vision well specific parts of the vision is the planting what is called restoration sites the sticks mill Conservation Reserve the Janet Stewart Reserve the redwood springs Reserve the Brooklands lagoon and smex Creek so for 20 years now there has been planting in those areas and we as volunteers contribute to that actually tomorrow there is a planting day being organized by zeelandia nurseries but this the trust provides a lot of manpower for that sort of thing so in simple terms that 's the background to it simple terms or something like 300,000 originally set out for planting that as I understand it I found it a little difficult to work through the document but as I understand it that has reinstated look do you wanna read Lucas the next generation of freshwater enthusiasts coming forward so I 'll just give Nick the opportunity to contribute oh thanks Rex pleasure to be here you might recognize me from the talk I gave from weaken my pollution prevention advisor head-on but today I 'm here and a voluntary capacity as a board member from the sticks living laboratory trust ya just to support Ric 's is saying that the sticks is healthier than the urban rivers the Aven and the health kit at moment because it 's on the edge of the city in a rural environment but as the city is growing out to envelop the sticks River we need to invest in the protection of the river now so that does not end up as polluted as the Aven and the healthcare rivers so money spent now to protect it will minimize restoration spending required in the future to clean it up like we 're experiencing on the urban rivers so it 's a spending us more amount of money now to save spending a lot of money later and funding required to achieve that Styx vision then for example the children growing up and those subdivisions out around the river that are going and they 'll have a clean healthy where they can go fishing peddling and perhaps swimming at times which is not something that they can enjoy on the city rivers but if we do it we 've always done will get what we 've always gotten so my submission is to that there 's a proposed three hundred and twenty four thousand dollar cut to the funding for existing regular planned River restoration works for those projects which are in the middle of their execution and we submit that this money should not be cut thank you thank you Pauline did you um I was interested in the comments it because I think that maybe you can just enlarge on it a bit that it 's probably easy tendency to think we 'll look that money should be prioritized to Heathkit and the Aven which you 're in such bad condition and why should it actually go to the the sticks so would you perceive perhaps over the year or do you have any idea of how it would be apportioned I think it 's not all currently I can 't do this takes that money that 's a spread across the different city rivers at present and so the sticks is just part of that so I guess I 'm putting in a boat for the other rivers as well when I say keep up your citywide River restoration our budget works and so we 're just the living laboratory keep the rest of the money from I know the deep I was going to say earnest Owen King people but carpenter unis community board I think about eight thousand a year now yeah any other sources so there are two separate things one is the running costs of the trust itself so our costs minimal willow we have a secretary who gets a small honorarium we run a student program and there are various costs so the total costs of running the trust are of the order of 15 to 20 thousand dollars a year and we get funding from the community board and that all the other well I think of as capital works we 're just supplying labor so other people provide in most cases that 's something to plant or if we 're running our summer in the city program not sure who supplied the sausage sizzle but somehow are able access sausages and yeah and that sort of thing but it it 's a pretty skinny organization but the capital expenditure funding is what comes from the city yeah I 'm Erin and then Sarah yeah that that figured that 324 to be hopefully reinstated was across the city and the Anthony was saying yesterday and in your submission Rex you 've got that the kept ahi which is yep the actual name of the river it 's has been wrongly gazetted as 96k in the sticks was 61 with the two amounts for the plantings and then up and yesterday we saw in here would Park which is where the pump station is removable works been done done for 80,000 people and crush it the drinking water comes from there 's a 25 year old planting fear of the we 'll see further down once we 're lucky enough to hopefully continue this program so in round figures then you 've got the remainder about 170,000 which would be going not on those sticks plantings but indeed on on the other rivers I believe so that kind of answers the question about what about the other rivers this is a I program you do across and it 's a plantain budget only and it 's really like your say it 's semi-rural out there so it 's a lot easier to do a lot more planting beer then you can around the egg and here to get anyway I 'm assuming but they 're great curry yeah Sarah here we go and it might just pay for us to keep some further information on this one because the the advice from staff of gotten our spreadsheets here is that the 96 in the 61 actually have been allocated to specific delivery projects one has been to project 485 sticks Mill Conservation Reserve and the other one has been allocated to a number of projects including Monday 's train and certainly is yeah not so it looks like here at there 's out Nishi the 96 and 61 has been allocated to sticks and so maybe get some clarity on that information for the group but it 's on our spreadsheets yep yeah from what Anthony said yesterday that so those budgets were there and they 've been taken off this year is that where your spreadsheets kind of saying no sis funding from these two programs has been allocated to specific delivery projects already okay so so here the funding from 3 7 8 5 3 has been allocated to project 485 so they 've both been allocated to six projects but they might be shown differently in the 30 days so we can get some clarity over there all the group because it would be great as those fundings but we 're still being tremendously but there 's the advice that 's on a spreadsheet on page 45 of 81 thank you well I may have misunderstood the document but anyway it 's a good opportunity for us to explain what the Stix living laboratory trust is and about spinning for other urban rippers their strain from if financially in nineteen onwards funding has been included in the draft lgd 's for planting and development of the reserve areas adjacent to these waterways I 'm just going to email all of the council as the the link to the Styx website because it 's fascinating it 's got a lot of the research that 's got a lot of detail about the history and geology the floor now for a Florida law floor know flora fauna I can 't do it anymore you can see that I 'm just getting tired on I said afternoon but anyway the thing is is that I 've just seeded to you it 's um it 's a really great website it just has so much information it 's very rich so and it sounds like that the the ticket or that that the community board in that area with two community boards three well with probably doing something like that again with the whole of the council because it just sounds like such an amazing truck the Jeff sausages though anyway have such a an important presentation and I hope but we can have it resolved and have our awareness raised at the same time good okay thank you very much what _"

    "text": "I catch me a stream care group damn Davies I hope you have importantly needlework with you or anything sorry Oh David he 's doesn 't hear so he doesn 't know I know of course you 'll be watching this the live stream sorry Dave sorry Dave seems we get at me yep should I go you just the area schools Yeah right thank you opportunity to talk to such a distinguished group of people so I 'm talking today on behalf of the Kashmir stream care group and their power hoe Heathkit River Network group so without further ado just sort of we support quite a few things that are happening in Christchurch some of which will stop as part of your result of your proposed plan anyway we obviously support the hansung the biodiversity of waterways streams wetlands Springs wetlands consider and rivers and Christchurch we 're actually quite impressed with the no cutting troll on the lower Nipomo Heath cut like to know whether that 's going to continuous so there 's a sort of thing that we 'd like to see more of and hear as far as we know there 's a hydrological model for the power Hoey that river we 'd like to see that see how that 's used for both good and bad so the creation of ponds wetlands swells to capture surface runoff rather than pipes and crotch which has a legacy of piped stormwater that a quite nice rivers streams into raging torrents carrying sediment and pollutants to the to the read themselves but also to the sea there 's there are some really good biodegradable chemical treatments for stabilizing soils and minimizing runoff and salt and and flocculating the salt out of ponds there 's obviously for the poor hills the pool halls are shedding a lot of sediment to the power cut in the Kashmir stream and they 'll continue to do so until people make more of an effort to keep it on the hill we obviously like notifying and consulting public and environmental groups and decisions on waterways probably we had a similar experience of one of the previous speakers on the proposed plan so much rather something more targeted like this we also support again one of the previous speakers said that that managed retreat is actually something that Christchurch just shouldn 't think about should actually be doing and implementing it 's a legacy that you 'll leave people four or five years down points hopefully they 'll thank you for so there 's good stuff well we take supporters funds being removed from the natural waterways enhancement or even just anything to do with them building right up and into the stream River channel because some examples there we can see simply and it 's still happening in some places around Christchurch the green fields area not with understanding this who had been on the freshwater ecologist probably about seven years ago I heard about all this great stuff happening in Christchurch it 's all stopped courious you know you know what 's hit me with in anymore you can 't flopped and basin really that 's like 1960s really building hard infrastructure on the riverbanks we 've here now that our bike paths are going to be stuck right beside the river so instead of leading the river do its thing up I 've talked about the poor erosion on the port hills polluting you 'll see some pictures there we could go down to the stream where it joins the power it 's good today and same things happening sewage discharge we 've got sewage to sideshow what are we still occurring which again for a you know one of New Zealand 's top cities I just find it a bit hard to stomach come the pond so we 've got lots of information with them as groups we 've done action plans etc etc out the wazoo so we 've got those here and there 's a whole lot of them you can go to our websites etc tonight there 's B over the questions Yanni oh yeah thank you I 'm given the the fires that were seen on the hills and the impact of the development my hills would you also support us looking at a sort of retreat away from building you know enabling increased development on on the hills I think it can be done if it 's done properly I think Rock Hills Dam Westmoreland stage two wasn 't done well so I think it 's not a blanket ban I think you might want to look at parts of the hill that don 't build in gullies maybe but the flat ridges I don 't and support a blanket Bamber noel can you explain your concern about having a cycle way close to a river and how we might mitigate that be well walkway yeah well they with Jesse there 's just been a really cool project looking at n Angus borning whitebait spawning in the lower power Heath got an Avon so during the floods those areas actually used by the fish and by the river itself rivers normally have a floodplain that they can get to and spread out on if you put a paved or even a path here it 's there 's no vegetation there 's nothing for anything to spawn so you 'd say separators and yeah yeah I believe any area of natural yes yep yep yep I 'm down in your submission now thanks for your submission um but it was submission you mentioned use digital elaborate a little bit about what you 're thinking and so we can have an idea of what we should do from your perspective yeah so we we try quite hard with our email lists and stuff like that to reach out to people who want to hear it for the restrains and what we do and I think um we know we 're one aspect of the community I think is I 'd like something a bit more coordinated rather than me just sending out an email to 40 people and missing people so I also think situations like this odd we want to win with dunno action plans we 've tried to have a holistic plan which represents people who are concerned about flooding as well as looking after the fish and bags in the stream so if you know if you can help us and you yourselves can be more holistic and gathering the community 's aspirations for the rivers then there will forth by digital means and Erin yeah thank you for raising the cutting of funding towards the waterway enhancement program I was unaware of of the sticks along some of the others here and of some of the work they 've been doing out there was was fantastic and I think some of the best value for money the entire city gets as our enhancement around the waterways and the replanting programs and it 's saying we should as an entire city be really proud of and the so that original program before it was trimmed do you think that was going far enough and doing enough work you know still being realistic because obviously probably something your position might say you could never spend enough but I mean I think they 're very economical ways we have been recipients of funding as well and with Eakins money and our own help and the landowners help you get a massive synergy payoff so I think in terms of cost effectiveness it 's it 's a bit of a no-brainer I think the scales we find it hard when we put our give our weakens to looking after the stream then you go down there 's a digger in the stream pulling out stuff someone a little bit of care and the red zone and re cambering the banks and stuff like that it wouldn 't actually even if you just re turned it from a u-shaped channel to a to perhaps a more natural river bank with the done you know so I don 't think it has to be expensive and I answered your question you kind of had I think you 've you 've also put up a flag to say restore that funding to what it was as well and Thanks one of your points yeah I was just looking for a while you were talking somebody posted I posted a picture of I don 't know one part I always have post pictures of streams and the river and various things Horseshoe Lake which is near where I live and this person put a post on to show concerns that she had over the other side of town at and the heath cut and then kind of said about how dreadful it was that we weren 't mowing right down to the thing and in total and input a post they 're not the non cutting trial in order to support the sporting of the yeah obviously white bait so they go and so how do we get the message across to those in the community that don 't understand that actually having pristine edges is not necessarily going to support the health of our owers I think a lot of that concerns I think there 's two aspects they consume one 's about flooding they think it 's going to flood their property and so you could actually use science the hydrological model to to counter that to show that rougher banks with grass on the you 're going to contribute that much to the flooding of their property the second one is really I don 't know that 's harder people just like flat mowed lawn so I don 't know whether that 's an education thing as well showing people that if you have that long grass and we 've started with the Walker and okay the spawning thing yeah that actually that contribute something could has value and particularly beside a river or stream yeah so yeah no I was just that was just that the message is on the board but kind of the the message was being mocked because it was kind of like we actually know what you 're really doing you 're just saving money by not not cutting the grass yeah well that could you know that probably would have helped as well like when when the end for the river and it 's actually saving your rat payers money good for the river too because we knew this yesterday Erin and Mike on the sticks that grass is the best filter for the contaminants the metal contaminants that we get off the road which is why Wheatlands are such a good way of cleaning the water from stormwater before it goes into the rubber yeah anyway thank you very much a very interesting and worthwhile submission thinking I 'll get you to monitor my Facebook page for um _"

    "text": "I 'm bigger than Neighborhood Association Peter toughly 1055 right welcome um thank you madam mayor good afternoon madam mayor and councillors and on behalf of the BNA I 'd like to thank you for this opportunity to address you and just off first of all I 'd say how much we applaud the council 's wisdom in reverting to this more focused format of consultation after last year 's well-intentioned but rather shambolic experimental um do I be I 'd be spending quite a bit of time of my time talking about one or two things that we 're particularly concerned about but I 'd like to start by highlighting the fact that we know overall we take a very positive view of this year 's annual plan and I 'd like to mention I wanted to pop particularly positive things in our view the first is we 're very happy with the overall financial strategy that the council has adopted in particular seeing how the council has responded to public concerns about sale of assets we like the way in which the burden of funding has been spread a very sensible approach and given that council borrowing comes in for some flack from time to time but we remain in very much in favor of the council 's use of the principle of intergenerational equity yet so the extent that future generations will benefit from from from expenditure that the council is incurring now so that 's one positive thing in our view something else that I would like to mention and it won 't surprise anyone who recognizes the fact that the Beckenham loop of the Heathcott River is a very defining feature of our of our neighborhood we welcome the planned expenditure of something overall about eight million dollars on things I upper half cup water storage and and bank stabilization and we we also welcome the proposed major increase in expenditure on stormwater drainage something else that that our local residents have cause to be concerned about we 'd like a bit more we 'd like to see some of the proposed expenditure on hath got wet wet water weather overflow reduction brought forward and we do see at least one opportunity for possible savings this area to that there 's quite a lot that that we welcome and we also take heart from the inclusion of the Midheaven linear parking proposed expenditure for 2018 to 19 and some of the things we 're concerned about I think at the top of our list of concerns would be the increase in resource consent management fees and deposits in the years since the the earthquakes in particular it seems to us that Christchurch has to some extent become a bit of a gravy train for the benefit of consultants advisers self-promoting of experts and ologists of numerous kinds some of which are necessary but maybe not all and the view we take of the proposed increased charges and deposits together with the fact that they 've been explicitly attributed to increased professional apps outsourcing seems to us to be a particularly blatant example of the city becoming a bit more gravy train and applicants for resource consent including residents needing consent for very minor home alterations of whom there may well be many in Beckenham because of the new character area rules all these applicants being at public expense less controlled over costs and in our view this isn 't on we think you know if the council has a problem processing resource consent applications then the way to go is to develop more in-house capacity and use outsourcing as a last resource on cycleways most if not all present will probably have noticed a letter in today 's press about the proliferation of cycleways in disregard of the impact on residents of lots of on street parking outside their houses and we would add we would echo that concern but we would add a concern about the impact on small retail businesses of loss of parking outside the front of their shops businesses of the kind that are we see as an essential part of the life of local communities we 're not anti cyclists but when we recall that in in its early days the bicycle was known as a velocipede we see something of a danger of cycleways policy being driven by what one could call overzealous velocipede o files and possibly possibly we would suggest a reduction in expenditure on cycleway provision for the relatively slight additional Expenditure we 're requesting one other thing I 'd like to hark back to and that is about ten years ago some a bit over 10 years ago the council undertook a review of its policy on working relationships with local residence groups its it convened a reference group of residence groups representatives from around the city and there was a lot of discussion and a lot of people gave up quite a lot of time for that and then all of a sudden it was shelved and it seems quite clear in hindsight that this was because or probably because the council bureaucracy didn 't like the direction in which the discussion was heading we would like to see that review revived and completed we think that would be timely after 10 years in conclusion again I 'd like to say that although I 've expressed some reservations on VNA 's behalf our overall view of the council of this year 's draft angle plan is is very positive it 's the most pleasing draft annual plan that most of us around I count it would seem that when one looks at back over the recent years you and your council colleagues have made a difference thank you very much gosh look feeling quite overwhelmed thank you it 's the nicest thing you 've ever seen thank you thank you for those lovely comments that 's great hey just on your own comments about the residents associations policy review you see where it was heating can you we wasn 't heating on this good position into the ether there was a proposal from the staff who was serving who was servicing this exercise the residents associations who concern themselves with community matters and engage in dialogue with the council over over about community matters and now sometimes a bit critical of the council about matters they concerned about should be treated as being no different from hobby groups cat fanciers stamp collectors knitting circles throwing groups you know it 's lengthy Anika and there was and there was considerable resistance manifest resistance to this proposal from the residence groups representatives concerned that they said no you know our function is different we serve a pushback against it against this proposal and surprise surprise the next thing we heard was that the whole exercise had been shelved that explains it thank you no no the board that 's not not helpful to have a debate about it right now but we will have a discussion about it but thank you very much Peter no it really is genuinely a pleasure to see you you always come and as valuable always a contribution to our consideration of the annual plan so thank you very much thank you for those kind words many more just lost a brownie point with it Kashmir Street _"

    "text": "um right so we now have Gary more community housing I 'll tear or welcome mister extinguished mere it was a brave move I went to I went to see yes Prime Minister last night so I 'm just going to say that was a very courageous statement counselor counselor swigs it is true that one day I shall retire retire but it is too far away for me to even predict at this moment right there I must say that counselor swings mathematics are pretty appalling met emir and counselors and not for you Gary of all people and staff I am a member of the New Zealand consulate housing at Iran our briefers to work and represent the community housing sector as a New Zealand Council we were particularly impressed with the City Council housing policy and so as an executive we asked I 'm sitting here at the end of the table saying we would like to apply for a grant of 15,000 towards the work of collaboration which we will meet dollar for dollar it 's really important that the community agencies involved in housing and the government sale of two and a half thousand state houses is dividing the community sector and quite an unpleasant way it 's a cloak and dagger and Consultants dripping all over each other at the moment and playing community groups off against each other and it is really important if we are to address the issue of housing which is a fundamental right in our society and the housing needs to go from those who without homes to those who need rental homes to those who wish to purchase their own homes within an affordable market it 's really important that they all work together with central and local government so um our submission is to say to the council we wish to implement a part of your housing strategy and we would like some assistance and trying to do that and I might say that I think it 's really important that you point out how you could save some money to pay for your submission and I thought a left hand sign at the end of the Barrington mall saying left and only which would cost about by the traffic engineers so there you go I 've paid for my submission thank you very much so anyway that 's I 'm happy to answer questions thank you very much young fellow first I 'll ignore the Pavia at the side and Barrington anyway Gary and thank you for coming out like a good idea to be your new close to the engineers Phil I 'd start me um so look thanks for know what your group of doing to work collaborative with others scary there was a submission earlier today which actually indicated that for a small proportion of our rate money that we take that in fact we could build a large number or support a large number of social of social housing units and I 'm just wondering how that suggestion might work in with the work that you 're group Zha do I think we 've got to I mean this is better aside from the submission but I think as a culture we 've actually got to look at new ways of addressing housing and I think that there is a a very we 're too high and the fungal nuit we both said you can 't have kaitiakitanga and ownership and the status created a whole new legal status of that land there 's absolutely nothing for central government and local government to actually take land right out of the mix and supply that for affordable housing it 's still in the council 's books assets and then people could build on that land a whole lot cheaper than they can by having to buy the land at the moment there are a whole lot of options like that that are possible during ventures with central government and local government with your current housing stock and thus does a stack of opportunities but they only flourish in a collaborative framework and and that 's actually not happening right now but a cute new kid man it was a question I asked earlier of another submitter and it was really focused on trying to get more residential development towards you Brighton but that land on the north side of pages road and Bexley in terms of if the land when sold its residential the land is is simply made available but the housing is that enables people to enter into the property market without as you say the cost of the land what would your group be interested in something like that yeah well some of us came up with a suggestion for the South Brighton camping ground where what we 've what we as a society have to address is the issue of measured retreat from the code and so I think the redzone gives us a wonderful opportunity to experiment so that if you look at say polled houses built on poles across the land where the weather is no the only intrusion on the land of the poles and so all of the services are off the ground and that gives people an opportunity to experiment with lifestyles with building styles that would be an amazing opportunity for our society and that 's the sort of thing that the council and community said that could actually be working on together yeah I think I 'll takes here and then Vicky thank you and it 's um with housing being such that over the last week and and other times there 's so many different groups now trying to make progress in the space but the figure that you 're talking about 15,000 it 's quite a different size bigger than most of the stuff that we get in the annual plan submissions and I 'm wondering we 've got some staff advice here that potentially the discretionary response fund strengthening communities might be the best place for that request have you applied for those through the through the process no we haven 't because we thought it was important to come along here and address the whole council and say hey this is an issue we 're in together where it comes from we don 't look at one 's open at the moment yeah so where it comes from we don 't mind but it 's really important that this is step one and actually ask saying hey we 're really attracted to your housing strategy list is our policy let 's do something about it together yeah okay Vicky 's questioners asked an answer to match so Pauline the in the red zone perhaps and it 's a good idea I 'm sure we could accommodate a lot of infrastructure above ground but how about the challenge of the roading infrastructure that could actually that you can tree house wouldn 't go near you say so you I mean a lot of the writings theory still but if people if houses are built on it then part of the no impact on the land as your car doesn 't go there either okay and so though I 've I 've visited communities like this in Asia where they 've got 50 families and I and I in a row and housing and they 're off the land and their own poles and we 've got as a society you know we 've got to address the fact the coast is going to actually eat up the coast of our the the sea rather is going to eat up the coast of our country and we need to actually start thinking about that and what the mayor 's question is about the experiment of using that red zone land have to make sure that our public transport infrastructure was made available to do it was so are you familiar with that far no project up north where they had several families got together in purpose-built a house to accommodate three or four families together specific um yeah and so they all shared the costs and mortgage payments which actually came out far cheaper than than paying rent with a good model is it yeah the trust I work for we 're about to build three units and bottle a road and wynonie and the units will be around about 300 thousand each and that 's using a piece of land that was had one house on and it 's an old quarter acre section so those are the sort of experiments we actually have to do and and we 're putting into housing families who never thought that owned their own homes and those are the sort of things we want to do together all right all right you 've got 16 second okay how do you get around the deposit situation deposit deposit yeah that people have to around there well that 's I can I say that I think the current a government policy on housing is not very comprehensive to put it politely and I think that the election campaign will I 'm involved nationally and talking to all the political parties and I suspect there 'll be some significant changes in housing as a result of the election process and things like deposits will be the sort of things and this I 'm talking about the the land if the people don 't need to find the land they 've got often got lots of money and they 're KiwiSaver but that would be enough all I had to do is build the building it 's just ten ten thousand for a new home and 20 for existing one those are their grounds ten percent yes sorry yeah but that 's not that apart from the grass with my understanding that you have to still have a lump sum of money look our society hasn 't had a sensible discussion on housing it needs to and that 's really the role of an organization like advocate for those that are sitting on the sidelines watching at the moment I 'm happy to continue the debate but I think the media finger or not I have got my funding cousin I was about to press their cheek down quite a similar finger many thank you very much thank you very much um now used for different _"

sensitivity is involved and have some great ideas the initiative to fund ECL without adversely affecting the rep has as something else that we applaud as well once again thank you we appreciate the lead the need to be here today because of legal issues that needed to be completed we have been we have submitted and been consulted to death now now through your actions we can see that crisis can have a seaside leisure resort a tourist resort and a facility to be proud of we feel that this facility is not just for New Brighton there will be a greater Christchurch slash Canterbury benefit it has the potential to be a sister complex to him now and Lincoln with walking in cycles citywide maybe we can even persuade some businesses to stay an extra day in Christchurch rather than go for your time and thank you for the commitment you 've been given you brush and the thank you yes Yanni thank you via submission and thank you for the work that you 've done on the on the pier and the fortune I just counsel we 've heard a lot about New Brighton feeling neglected yet counsel prior to the earthquake has spent huge amounts of money on the library the road in and contributing to the pier so what I 'm really trying to understand is why do you think the hot saltwater pools I got to change what 's happening in New Brighton it 's it 's hard to understand their request for huge amounts of spending when we 've done that previously and it hasn 't worked so what is it about the hot saltwater pools that you think is going to make the difference for New Brighton and why people I guess so excited about that as been something that 's going to save will deal with the concerns that have been raised well first starter I don 't just see it as a benefit as a whole the S fear-based fear as per the benefits is a can you Brighton I don 't think it can hear it and your Brighton Pier has been a positive for this for the site we you only have to look at the number of people that use that facility now we already had a library the fact that the library was already there as it was at a council decision to move it there I don 't think that we are asking for or anything more than what any other suburb will be waiting for apart from the sort salt would have pulled what what else can it do for Brighton I think it can help lift the whole profile of the eastern seaboard its little increments that is what we 're looking for in relation to the hot saltwater pools I see that it was a proposal in 1999 and do you know why that felt followed so I got healthy on our own okay thanks I 'm Erin yeah we 've had a lot of submissions from Brighton today and they 've been very well ask any questions and but but I will so because you only started it the the hot salt water pulse feels to me like it 's a catalyst whether it was them or something else that Brighton felt like it needed a canvas because people seem to be really really hanging on the concept of those polls even though there 's another aquatic facility going in at the old qe2 site so I don 't think it 's just the fact of a pull but of something that says we 're as special as anywhere else in the city and I think the fact that your library already has probably got the best view on the country you don 't even need books you just go there and just take in the view you know purchases a thousand words well that 's a short book the the because the other one there 's been other things that have been suggested suggested with Brighton being on the coast like a Kelly Tarleton style aquarium slash facility that works with the ocean and especially the there 's and seems to be a the planet monitor what we 're doing to it and so that potential relationship taking place at Brighton as a catalyst subject what would your thoughts beyond that as a Kelly Tarleton and starves them or something and you know in that vein may it may have the University of yours on that one no thought okay I would be a net personally I 've been auntie Xue person and there that 's personally but we haven 't considered a cousin considered that I don 't yeah yeah well it 's that not necessarily a zoo but you know you know a giant perspex tube we were walking down inside the ocean or they were quite deferral hey than usual and we 're open to ideas yeah yeah okay just um DCL should should come and talk to you of meat no ironically Kelly Collins was funded through him discovering lots of gold on an island somewhere so yeah that 's an interesting story in itself well just and that 's giving it no thought but we 'll we 'll leave it there all that is you bet yeah no number of submissions today and and the other day too and I 'm sure we 'll hear more on Monday night so you know obviously we have to identified we 've got a legal obligation we 're putting a lot more on budget for the Legacy Project then was there before and we have to ask the people of Christchurch if they agree with it and the interesting thing as I said to some others earlier which you went here for was that when we subtract all of the New Brighton submissions the majority of submitters on this from the balance of Christchurch have said yes they support the project the investment so thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "dude could I vote Sonia hotter from spreadin neighborhood network which is 41 and we 're going to be introduced to something called scream sounds very exciting welcome thank you so supposin neighborhood network wish to thank you for hearing us today and we 're very grateful to this sprayed and kashmir community board for listing the seshu as the first priority for funding and for their area and 2017 aiding and your plan we wish to emphasize the comparison we have made in our submission to uncontrolled traffic flow around other km malls on feedin arterial roads Sint Maartens shopping centre does not have an entrance onto the busy Wilson 's Road and halls or shopping center does allow the traffic right turning traffic onto halls or Road but it has a considerably wider struck and the middle median strip in the middle of the road that we do not have in Barrington strange congestion at peak times 30 to 00 p.m. and in the morning as well the buses traveling west and has to squeeze between parked cars and cars waiting in the center to TuneIn to the removing the right tuning traffic turning out of the mall would reduce this and this problem and the bus stop on the other side there 's a similar issue the mall has agreed the right turning traffic turning West is dangerous and has verbally agreed to it being removed so that was a stumbling block when we were first approaching this issue this Braeden Heathcott community bought a ginger on the 9th of March 2004 stated the original consent for them all included a condition that the performance of the Barrington Street access be monitored annually to ensure the access continues to operate safely and effectively and it has no no longer an in your view unfortunately but we wish to challenge you to consider if the design of traffic flow at this entrance exit would be acceptable if the proposal for a new shopping hub was being put before you today the mall has increased in size and has the traffic as his the traffic and increased immensely since then with Barrington Street a real arterial road so thank you and Dennis will now conclude yes thank you summer secretary Sonia hotter for all who hard work in preparation of our submissions good afternoon councilors I 'm here to ask you to please prevent vehicles tuning right out of Barrington mall in to Barrington Street because it 's dangerous and there 's danger for different groups the footpath uses between the library and the pharmacy the four road users passing through the area going to other destinations for the slow and vulnerable people who run the gauntlet of walking down that stretch of footpath between the library and the pharmacy they also suffer from time to time as I 've personally witnessed abuse of motorists you forget there 's a legal footpath and they toot medley or yell out and that is not good enough in a civilized society the pedestrian island which is in the middle of Barrington Street between the library and the south side of Barrington Street is extremely helpful but to get there from the Southside once again is very precarious because vehicles turning right out of the mall they look for a gap and they suddenly shoot across and people can easily be caught neighborhood network has the eyes with a succession of council engineers over the years unfortunately they keep changing on us because they 're all very good and very helpful and we have no disagreement with them about the danger or about the necessity of closing this turn now the estimates of the cost for alterations from traffic engineers formerly attached to this issue that have now been moved on is about two hundred thousand dollars and there is a painful contrast for us sprayed in people with the council own company about to spend fifty six million for facilities for cruise ship passengers at our port spray tonights and others visit our mall by car on foot hundreds and even thousands of times in their lifetime I 've lived in the area for 28 years now cruise ship passengers will be safe because of planned facilities and they 'll only use them two or three times in their lives the fabric of our city gets more value from local mall users than casual visitors to the port and of course we pay our rates for safety as well sprayed in not just to be safe in the mall but the approaches to the mall and this mall is the social and commercial heart of our suburb but we need a safe road to get there not only for mall users but for people passing through there been many accidents in the last 10 to 12 years and some have resulted in serious injury and you know that accidents ripple like tidal waves is the emotional and financial hurt for the families and according to emergency services one fatal costs over a million dollars throughout the whole community and country the right-hand turn into Barrington Street represents a strong likelihood of a fatal with more people living in the area and more with housing intensification it 'll soon be too late for the council to do alterations before someone gets killed on that stretcher footpath or in a car smash a question to you will will further neglect see the council presiding over a fatality thank you yeah we 've received submissions on us from others so thank you very much for your impassioned plea pauling q I 'm just not map there 's a pedestrian refuge is closely aligned to the will you come out of them or is it right that 's what you think about the pedestrian refuge that 's the in our is quite close to with it right hand tunas yes it is that so we 're close right in front of the library and what is the solution that 's been proposes it 's extending their I lived only yeah yeah yes what they want Owen DeLong yes and it was prevent them turning right now and that 's two hundred thousand to do it well that 's what they 're only that 's the estimate okay thank you yeah but thank you very much I mean as I say this is not the first time we 've hit the socio in I 'm hoping that it will be market time that you have to come a-near became for big thank you very much _"

    "text": "now we have Peter Paul he is that I 'm not pronouncing your name correctly probably or if you 've got something to distribute then staff can come staff can come down and do that for you can you help me out with the pronunciation of your surname this is 103 five and your submissions thank you first you ever think the council 's the opportunity to make the submission I take it there 's no point in reading my submission because it would for is you 've been reared could that be correct yes the notes that I have here the estuary East Bank shoreline flood protection [Music] there is a big omission the s jury has protective stopping along the West Bank and South Bank but there 's nothing along the east bank which is really an omission the counselor put full stop banking and erosion protection along the full length of the West Bank mainly to protect counsel lien and the oxidation ponds is also full erosion protections and correct levels along the South Bank so perhaps if I could just quickly read I 've there a works the these are the Dudley Creek and rails program Knights drain stage one limit canal in class boots Road South Belle 's Creek Miska bank stabilization and Wigram East retention Basin all very good projects and I support them the absence of estuary stop banks along low areas of South right and south of Bridge Street and most of South Shore as a major omission by the Council which has mentioned that most subdivision will be fully aware of the previous surface flooding and the increasing risk of storm surge flooding from climate change which is independent of ocean level rise the rock wall and gabion protection along the separating the main frontage South OBT Street have not been repaired after is quite damaged resulting in extensive erosion and loss of Parsons Park and eventual loss that parts of the waterfront walkway low-level storm surge flooding of concrete slab foundation houses from unprotected from the unprotected history he spanked would cause damage costing millions of dollars the level of flooding I 'm talking about would be something like a foot depth of water which is quite feasible and it will conservative average value of 50,000 or even six inches of water across a concrete slab foundation necessitates removing in the jib board throughout the house to the first wing complete wreck redecoration of the house and also most probably complete new floor coverings so that fifty thousand is a very conservative estimate the cost of the kilometers of stop banks and associated erosion protection along both banks of the avon river that is from bridge street right up to bill wood and along the west and south banks of the estuary has apparently not been a problem these banks have all been in place many years likewise the cost of the estuary is being stopped tanking and erosion protection should not be a problem especially in view of the nearby properties pain rates for the provision and maintenance of the Waimakariri River stock mix which are mostly for the protection of Western Christchurch so Environment Canterbury rates are levied on all the houses in Christchurch for the various risk categories but a lot of the properties in South Brighton could be 60 70 years old so they 've been mercury stop being for a long time the present risk of flooding due to the absence of East Bank eastery stop being as little to do with ocean a little rise the Littleton tide gauge data think Google indicates only 165 millimetres rise in the last 18 years they have these study periods blocks of 19 years sorry and that period evidently is enough to accommodate all the various extremes and together genuine indication of ocean level rise look I 'm sorry but you 've come to the end of the five minutes so if you could just make the key points that you really want to get across okay oh yes the last paragraph yep is the City Council going to be reactive rather than proactive and wait for millions of dollars of property damage from low-level storm surge flooding all for the sake of a 1 meter high stopping and erosion along the south right and South Shore frontages that could also incorporate a walkway and there 's only four cubic meters of material per one meter run of bank with a city meter 30 degree battery to thing and then the item to the location of the proposed hog water pools I 'm my opinion is that there is another white elephant coming here if it 's not located in the correct places the proposed location on the exposed foreshore reserved north of the pier would not use any of the redundant vacant land and the new brighton mall such as the vacant McCormick 's hotel site which as well as being sheltered would have adjacent street parking and Beresford Street unlike the exposed foreshore where the closest parking would be the countdown car park so there 's very little car parking anywhere near the proposed tall rotation look thank you very much for your time and I just repeat something that I 've said to a couple of the other submitters that that the issues confronting South Shore and South Brighton in terms of its location on the estuary and the relationship with the residential red zone stop banks and all of those issues are being addressed but in a collaborative way between Christchurch City Council and regenerate Christchurch because of those connections and and will is not something that 's going to be quickly resolved it 's a very dynamic environment it is also a number of complexities relating to the to the relationship with the eastery the desire within the eastery Association to to seek ramscar REMSA status for the for the ester e so there are a number of issues that all come together and there are going to be many discussions about how we resolve those issues but the City Council is not going to leave the community engagement process with the South Brighton community because that was not read zoned but regenerate christchurch has to be involved because of the connection with the rest of the river and the stop banks system and the ester e which as a system has to be dealt with together so it is going to be addressed but it isn 't just a simple matter of saying stop banks are the solution in every place but there are temporary stop banks going in at the moment and they will take over on the south side to provide that protection back from the eastery to those part of the history leading onto the river thank you there 's just one sentence and reply to that reading it here a program of estuary East Bank stop banking should not be delayed for any future study on predicted ocean level rise no no it 's not it 's not being delayed for that purpose it is the residential red zone requires the regeneration planning to be led by regenerate Christchurch all I 'm saying to you is that we are working and collaboration with regenerate Christchurch to make sure that South Shore South Brighton and it 's connection to the river through the history is all respected and valued and considered in the context of what is a very dynamic environment so do thank you _"

    "text": "five yes I know humming oh yeah we 're running ahead of time as they 're rocking wonderful it 's most unlike us but we started earlier after lunch so well you probably know who I am by now we do we don 't even sugar me action I wouldn 't even Eva Eva sucker found hearing to get my glasses I know I 've been on about this three year now but em what are mainly submitting now is that you in the annual plan this year decided to actually fund the earthquake 's training for the mcdougal and I 've been in touch with your staff and discussed it with them and position seems to be that the present cost which is in the long-term plan is the figure of 23 million which is unfunded but I 'm advised that that was really only a very loose estimate that was originally calculated on the basis of some quantity surveying figures which would involve earthquake strengthening the building but apparently it doesn 't_''_83.7 if it may not need to be earthquake strengthened at all though I mean no depends it and it may be that it could only cost 10 million and my submission is that you find the cheapest way of doing it and get on with it and get the gallery reopened for the reasons that I 've mentioned in my submission which I 've been going on about for a year honoring my event in terms of my grandfather 's gift the and to help the Christ Ruggeri with the storage problems it 's display problems and normal recently of course has been discussion about its it 's some visitor numbers and the MacDougal of course can tap into the into the here 's quickly booming tourist industry and Botanical Gardens whatever just wanted to mention today and I can do it all within five minutes is two things firstly the museum project and then the actual terms of my grandfather 's gift in 1928 the decision by the 2003 council to discontinue the use of the mcdougal as a public at Gary for the city and to allow the museum to use it for their purposes as for the mcdougal being an absolute disaster for for 14 years with at least another five years to go on on the pathway that is on at the moment with the mcdougal over the museum which is a total of 19 years and it wasn 't even go merged in the earthquakes but it 'll be longer than this because the museum project remains unfounded and unconsented I mean really it 's got to a point where I don 't think I 'm exaggerating if I use the word scandalous often just lovely building and it 's an awfully long time for a building that wasn 't damaged in the earthquakes to be lift like this I 'd be mentioned in my submission about the repairs that are being done there and I 'm very grateful for those and of course that 's got they 've got behind so to some extent has also been neglected but I don 't want to grill on that what I want to say is that the in the minutes that were recently published for the latest museum trust board meeting which was hold on the 8th of May it was stated the museum project 180 million with 62 million having to come from the government 51 million from you 4 million from the other councils and 57 million from their own fundraising the government has not approved the 62 million and the people who are advising me say that it 's unlikely to approve such a huge amount apparently the highest amount that has been approved for a museum development in New Zealand was for the large Auckland Museum development by the clerk government event was a figure of 26 million the Christchurch art gallery got six and a half million when it was bought your venue approved a total of nineteen point eight in the long term plan plus according to your staff another five point six which has already been advanced to them back in 2002 so there 's a total mayor of twenty five point four million which you are committed to every other committed or going to be committed or mayor 's funded the gloves I found that that right now penny for the project and they want 51 million from you so it 's only half any fundraising by the museum to date which has raised any of their own fifty seven million but I don 't know anything about that but you 'll know about that I don 't but I certainly I think if something had been done you would have read about it in the papers so the approach act appears completely unfunded and of course it 's and so unconsented meanwhile mcdougal has packed up waiting for the museum 's project to be completed and it could be welcomed forever this truly cannot be allowed to continue so the council has to put a stop to it and get it strengthened so it can be adding to the public the most also discuss the museum 's plans to exhibit their collections and the Raven sky House Museum from which construction was prone to commence only next year and well it could be built and open before the McDougall is even reopened to the public most of the wonderful gift of the museum as it is a purpose-built for their use it is both an art gallery and museum whereas the rebuilding is used by the museum for their app collection acne this gift to them to the museum together with the gift of the adjacent site by the council gives the museum tour the facility in which to display some of their art as well as their decorative that connection it means it does not have the same meat for the mcdougal now I I know the Wakefield 's were mutually planning to display their own collection and the Ravens go I am not sure I mean that the the the minutes of the Museum meeting they talked quite openly about using it and using it quite extensively so I can only assume that they really are going to use it and quite a lot of the museum collection will end up being displayed there and the other point is the terms of my grandfather 's gift in 1928 now this is something I haven 't raised in the letters I 've sent you and my submission last year it was a very important aspect to it and it 's this his gift was actually not to the council even though he them the money to build the gallery it was to the citizens of Christchurch and this is very well documented in the publicity at the time so the role of the council was to act as a custodian as a guardian and safe keeper that 's what the word custodian means to hold the building and to operate it for the benefit of the citizens of Christchurch for the purpose of holding in displaying the city 's collection which was also being established at that time from the donations of the CSA and the Jameson family all the paintings in the early collection were given to the city by individual donors it is for this reason that the council of today does not have the moral authority in my opinion to lease the gallery to another institution for their purposes and as I 've already told you my grandfather is also on public record in the press and saying he did not want the gallery to be associated in any way with the museum he wanted it to be built away from the museum he didn 't get the site site he had wanted and we wouldn 't be here having this discussion because the idea of the museum being of the MacDougall being used by the museum wouldn 't have arisen he wanted it to be built away from the museum and to stand out as a public gallery in its own right this is the problem he did won 't give it to the citizens of Christchurch for the council of 2017 do whatever they like with it this is why if Alisa signed with the museum the terms of his gift would be Dishonored the gift of the mcdougal and the works which founded the city 's collection were the largest ever given to the city to the citizens of Cratchit 's that is to my knowledge and the Google should be retained by the council as a place where these donors can be respected and can be remembered that within five minutes just yeah that 's little bit thank thank you very much but it 's better than last you know it 's done well it the thing is is that it is you know a means to you and how much it means to the people of Christchurch it 's the most glorious building and every day I walk by it I mean I walk by it every day but every time that I do you know you can 't help but you know remember the the wonderful collections that have been there that isn 't born a Mesa collection I remember going to many years ago it 's it 's really had some extraordinary collections throughout and it would be wonderful to see it restored to you so I mean well obviously we 're working through a lot of complex issues at the moment we 're very challenged by the what the earthquake has done and obviously the museum 's got some serious restoration not only restoration but actually upgrading facilities in order to provide protection to what is also a very important collection not only to the city but to the region so thank you very much for making the effort to come back and to clarify that issue around the gift and we 'll obviously be taking advice on what happens next you for listening to it thank you _"

    "text": "Marjorie come on come forward Marjorie thank you for coming in early this is a 1050 1050 page 1050 hi welcome yes just cold out there it 's nice to just be warming up my hands were like ice blocks when I got in um it 's a weather change okay oh it 's it 's on its frigid I guess yeah here was it was alien it was cold and miserable when I got up it was beautiful when I walked in the door and I thought I 'm losing between a full day let 's go work Thank You peg yeah we 're using up our time talking about the weather there 's a couple of points that I just want to highlight and what we put in and there 's one to add so the first one just took spline what was in the introductory summary of how we went about doing the submission and I just wanted to emphasize that for something like this the Victoria Neighborhood Association which is the group that I 'm representing would usually consult with about 150 to 160 people in bit consultation wary at the moment having been really involved in the district plan the ongoing work on the local alcohol policy and several other things happening we just had lost our puffs so what we did instead and it 's reflected in the people 's names who are on the last page is that we did have a discussion after attending a meeting with our council representatives and decided that what we would do was to comment on topics that we know we have talked about enough that we thought we had a mandate there were a few other things that came into that discussion that we ended up saying nope we haven 't talked enough with other people that 's a personal opinion put that one in yourself which I hope some people have done so I do feel that I can confirm that this is reflective of a big group certainly not all of them in our area but it is not some specific consultation and the things that I wanted to highlight that I 've been asked to highlight actually under levels of service just the want to emphasize again that quite often red tape is there to protect residents or citizens there has to have been a reason why the tape got there in the first place and we we know of several examples and there 's probably many more that when some of the tape is cut or relaxed things that are not to the benefit of residents such as ourselves can occur so I guess we 're just saying don 't get carried away and don 't just listen to the ones that want the tape cut for other reasons under transport the comment that I 'd like to make is that there really really is from support and we absolutely know that for all five points that we made under transport we didn 't even have to think about that one because we have talked about it so much with such a big group of people people jump up and down whenever anybody mentions the yellow bus or the possibility of bringing back something like that we all just go into raptures because we were such users of that cycle and pedestrian say on behalf of just them they love the electric vehicle initiatives evidently you have a pool that sits down on harridan montreal getting plugged in and and they just really think that 's an initiative is it right yeah I don 't know that one myself watch the space watch this face so the encouragement was yes wonderful and proud of that kind of thing proconsul today under operational matters there 's very specific issues to us covered there I won 't go into them but at some point we 'll probably pop back up and say how can we do some of these things lastly the one that we suddenly realized we had completely left out probably because for us it 's the overall thing that ties everything together is the things that can be done and things that we think should not be done in order to protect and enhance residential the residential environment in the central city so that neighborhoods like ours can flourish and that more can come in and enjoy such a wonderful place to live I won 't go into all of those things much more than just the annual plan but the point that I wanted to make is that almost every decision made particularly at this time impacts on central city residential we were surprised how many when we got involved in the district plan and given how strong many of the central city residents groups are there is a pool of people willing able and eager to be involved in things other than having to feel like you come along to complain or submission after submission we were really pleased that we have been asked to have a formal voice on a on the consultation group that 's going to be looking at how whether and when to do things with the Victoria Street development so that has already come through to us and and we 'll probably have to fight for who gets to be on that so the last thing I just want to say man to all of you really and I think this is just a perfect example one of us said well I think it was me that said it that everybody agreed I said things that you have to grapple with and look at this I know I was going to say and this can 't_''_420.4 be all of them because it starts you know and I think that 's overwhelming and what I and all the people really that I 'm representing today would hate to think that we make your job harder by being involved but you asked us okay well we mean it and know that it is incredibly appreciated and I have to say I I hit this little joke where where people go on have a good weekend I go what 's a weekend doesn 't doesn 't week actually end you know if I 'm Downton Abbey you can 't take that oh really well help me watch down today two people gonna have good ideas okay Smith said it no I don 't mind if it was Maggie Smith you know it no I think I 've taken my time but I did see a hand up no no you haven 't_''_482.46 reached the end of Aziz but I just I kind of wanted to just pick I think you 're saying there that you 'd like to be again formal representation on any discussions and you 're suggesting that we actually kind of would get the project 's done that I 've been done and get them done much more quickly and just get them out of the way but then have a look at the rest of the projects and see whether they 're necessary to see whether they 're required to see how the how the patterns of movement have changed yes because of what we 've done again I can decide what we do next exactly because when you think Durham Street living where we live yeah Durham Street and Columbus two minutes our streets and we automatically start going down them if when we 're in a car and then we go why did we come on down Street or not and so then you hop over to Colombo and you got aa sort of tried Manchester yeah it 's not what its gonna be I mean it means East is not big no so so then I get on my bike that that I think David chambers made at the meeting that some of us were at that you could say massive might be different but you could start trying to fix something before we know even what the situation is actually we were trying to say you know that 's great I 'm a fill issue for you already kind comments there and just two years around accessible study that the ends alluded to when is it in discussion so far your group seem to be supporting Salisbury Street becoming two-way again it 's one thing and the other one did yes yeah okay that 's helping because we had some suggestions of the other way but that will be further discussion on that no data this begins not a go in the ditch to do it immediately those what we were trying to to say but but they yes when that whole one way to way thing was going it was a unanimous most of the other things were on transaction but it was a very strong mandate that they thought that would be good thanks Marjorie the other bus being reinstated and include the all of the forever news just perhaps a comment from you on about that one it was almost the for revenues and it will north-south anyway when they 've had to go too much further it stopped at the casino we live I mean you 'd have to look at the the new residential patterns but seen it every day and how many new apartments like on be liev 's all those new apartments with 2412 37 whatever they are there will be you know quite a few people up at that end that weren 't there before it is a wonderful way of getting inner city residents around the inner city because unlike if you 're in the suburb you really can 't take a bus easily into the inner city if you live in any city and yet sometimes there 's a reason why you don 't want to walk yeah so the joint the joint Greater Christchurch public transport committees looking at the so sure at the moment oh and several people said we 'd be happy to give a gold it was free yeah you know as long as it stayed reasonable just yet very good alright well I think I 'm flashing yeah but thank you very much very much thank you then thank you for coming and early as well that 's fine _"

    "text": "okay so you are not Margery because I can see Marjorie sitting there so you do want to go further you are Catherine Morris Turek so 103 9 everyone if you could start up the livestream again we 'll get get underway again and inviting and welcome Catherine Morrison thank you for coming on a wee bit earlier we 're just trying to reschedule some people have changed their order of speaking and everything so we 're very grateful to you for coming uh nearly okay so that 's you thank you very much for the opportunity good afternoon my submission is to alert the council to the urgent need for protection of South Shore from inundation from the history I 'm a long-term resident I 've been there for over 40 years so and in South Shore and I keep cared deeply about the area I don 't know if you know exactly where it is but it 's south of South New Brighton the main road is rocking horse road it it has the C on one side and the Esther E on the other it 's a close at hand but we don 't want it so close that we are having the Esther E flood the area the land adjacent to the Esther II moved during the quakes and is more vulnerable to a nun Dacian all sections were Reds owned and houses demolished along the ester edge the people living there had previously maintained their Esther walls and therefore protected the area the Esther edge is now disgrace and an eyesore with no maintenance and the damage done by demolitions we are threatened by flooding storm conditions coinciding with high tide mean that the area is liable to be badly flooded sea level rise will make the matter worse some form of protection is urgently required a comprehensive Court has been prepared for the South Shore residents Association by Gary tear of us all console consultants New Zealand Limited and there was a previous speaker who sent you copies of the year the recomm this recommends a firm running along the estuary shoreline this has been designed to protect us from flooding and enhance the fabulous area along the s3 with an elevated walkway cycle not wish to be bullied by insurance companies that insurance companies expect the council to protect us from flooding otherwise we could lose insurance on our houses there are at least 500 houses in South Shore many of which are expensive rebuilds from the earthquakes the council cannot allow that and then leave the esteridge to keep eroding away and potentially flood the grasp red zone area adjacent to the estuary is now a great recreational asset for locals and for everyone it must not be allowed to erode but be protected by a Bund which will also protect flooding of the streets and houses thank you thank you questions as Sara thank you and I completely agree with you about and about syllable rise and the impact that that 's going to have especially on its really low-lying areas and we 've heard several submissions today from people who have said the same thing there 's another group who I haven 't seen a submission from here who whose opinion is different and so they they 're questioning the science and the sea level rise and also say that so I 'm wondering how that sits with with you well the ester II land has changed for the earthquake the estrecho that 's right walking along there last week they 'll just the ester is coming in onto the grass area a small fund raised area put in on the Saraland it 's now starting to wake it make its way to the top in certain areas that the situation is getting worse I can see it happening because I walk there every day yeah we have this group of people be telling us not to hurry along and do things because sea level rise isn 't really happening and we need to hear so I 'm not this isn 't see that I 'm not unload you 're so changing apart it 's happening now I don 't know what 's on it but it is happening you can see because there 's remnants if you 're not that high tide but those remnants left and what 's been washed in yeah I think one of the things that we 're seeking to address as we can collaboratively strip of residential red zone which is where I thought that the Bund was proposed to be built so that actually has to be led by a regeneration planned process but the consulting that the local community have done has been incredibly extensive so you know I think that in terms of the consultation there will have to be obviously assessments and things like that and then how it relates to the history because I 'm you know to be honest that that there was a notice sheet you reflect on the wall on the other side on beach ville road but there was already a stone wall there and it had to be repaired and actually once you put in a stone wall would actually limit your options we aren 't go back to a natural environment it 's it 's the end of the road as it were so so it 's not an easy comparison because of the ecosystem of the of the whole of the estuary and a desire to get REMSA status for the ester itself South New Brighton you know there 's an area the Christchurch City Council really does have to lead a bit of work with the local community about stock banks but then the stop banks leads straight back into the residential red zone which brings back regenerate Christchurch so we 're trying to think of this strategically I know it 's hard for residents particularly yourself who do happen to live in one of the most glorious parts of the city we share it but it 's yes but it 's but all I 'm saying is that that the issue has been really well canvassed and the community have been very clear about what they want to achieve and what the outcome is we 'll have to go through a process that involves regenerate Christchurch and our city planners and land drainage and all of the different components are working together in a collaboration yeah I really like that I just wanted to make sure that we alerted to you people because you have sway over everyone else and the comparison with Red Cliffs was merely just to say preempt you saying or there isn 't enough money and no it 's not a question of of money versus it 's a question of that as an incredibly precious complex changing dynamic coastal environment yeah on our history side so there 's a lot of work to be done but you 're absolutely right to bring it to the attention of the governance of the city and it has changed even in the last couple of weeks yeah a storm I know I know and it will continually change yeah but thank you very much for Cle and and making your views known and I did seem _"

    "text": "thank you I 'd like to see the meeting open again we 've got a number of submitters who have agreed to come in a wee bit earlier so we 're ready to get underway and I 'd like to invite Miriam Powell to come forward and thank you very much for coming in early please take a seat at the front of the table and this is 103 1 page 103 1 it 's I 'm welcome my request is for lights at the intersection of gardeners and he word and brings Road and to say the junction was not earmarked for an upgrade as there has not been any major injuries or deaths there I think it 's an appalling and shocking statement to say the least and I hope that that is not the criteria and deciding where the lights be installed at any intersection in christchurch let alone the here word intersection and for the reasons the lights to be installed here are the dangerous challenges for the Breen 's and gardeners road traffic to cross over here Wood Road where there is five traffic lanes in the middle and believe it just about be equivalent to eight lanes the neighbors tell it all that they 're in the fifty years they have lived in the area they have seen many accidents ah 's and near misses at this intersection and cannot understand why lights have not been installed pride the saw his arms and gardeners Road intersection which has only four lanes that the sixteen hundred and fifty nine sixty nine signatures shows the hard evidence in a big concern for the area lights would help all traffic pedestrians cyclists crossing safely over all lanes and it would eliminate the accident rate and I would eliminate the traffic congestions on other roads which causes false readings and statistics and I note the mere he has stated there is 93 intersections in Christ routes considered more dangerous than the one identified by QM and quote and presume letters councillor queuing I didn 't say queue and though that 's the media do that I would never refer to accounts I read it in the minutes and sorry I wouldn 't never refer to a counselor by could show you the information that under Section list has been quoted here includes intersections already with lights roundabouts and roads already under construction and I question shouldn 't it be comparing lights with light bike with like separating those named roads intersections out and believe it would place here when Road dairy high on that list in Christchurch I have set at this intersection and observed the speed of vehicles up and down here Wood Road the vehicles accelerating to cross over the Gardiners to bring the road and vice-versa to get to the other side quickly other vehicles change in direction when they front the intersection and seeing how dangerous it is put the blinker on and turn left I have spoken to the people on the corner of gardeners and Breen 's Road and they avoid this corner as much as possible and they keep turning left then do you ease or they tune the road before way out of their way from the direction of where they want to go something no-one is proud of but to have had this personal experience at this theory intersection very challenging experience on the day it 's a bit like the chicken crossing the road will I go or will I stay and eventually making a dive for it and getting run over in the end I stopped at that compulsory stop that day and all I could see was a van coming up on my left a long haired road but not yet at the intersection but what I did not see was a small truck coming along peril which is obscured by the van until I got half way across to here wood road which was then too late lights would have provided a safe crossing for me that day reading the comment again the junction was not Emmer for an upgrade as there has not been any major injuries or deaths there I put it to you all just how serious of it excellence do have to be before lights are installed how are they measured and my mind boggles and do we have to wait for another fatality and how much evidence do we need together and what is the criteria to install a set measured by too costly to install is it measured not enough accidents or is it measured because of the low traffic or is it measured lights against life or is it the other way around life against lights or is the criteria that is being used today out of date in conclusion excellence cost the country millions of dollars to repair the human body hospital stays ACC and insurance to name a few major costs and it is councils job to provide safe roads to our city and as that council gives can serious consideration for the installation of lights where points raised and the hard evidence obviously shows that there is a major concern surrounding here Wood Road intersection and that Council look at the criteria of installing lights and ask the question is about a date with the year 2017 and I was I wonder court Mr P is there that I was talking to a woman on that corner that intersection and has some happen to be a traffic engineer not with this capsule and she told me the judge that they judge lights on intersection on traffic that is avoiding the intersection thank you for that questions have you read the the new council page on intersectionality here um sorry have you read the new then have you read the new council page on intersection safety that we put on as part of the annual plan consideration no I haven 't had time to read it I 'll just sit here before to read it and okay I will send you the link and well presume we 've got your email address so we 'll send you the link to it because I think that will answer some of the questions that you had thank you very much and dissection no it 's on intersection safe I only have in how you judge what you do with I think I did and brilliant brain offline years I 'll do yes okay thank you very much didn 't answer my questions I 'm relating to this one that 's right thank you _"

    "text": "which is Robyn Greg representing the Clearwater residents owners as society I 'm Cherie not here hmm sure we know who I just said that she 's not coming and we 've submitted a sorry she asked for a written one to be a situation that 's been circulated now so that we 're on to page 100 1018 welcome thank you madam mayor councillors thank you for the opportunity to speak you received two submissions from Clearwater resident owners Society one from myself Robin Gregg and one from gain camera unfortunately Jane has to be an auction this weekend so you 've got me and I 'm a member of the management committee I also have a number of years experience as chairman of one of the Achaeans River rating districts so this is when it comes to talking rivers I 'm aware that I 've only got ten minutes so I 'll be under the whip to use the racing phrase so let 's get on the race what we our concern is with the otic kokino stream which is blocked up so I 've got a pointer the screen anyway to your mid rights you can see the lakes and so forth of the groins so it 's just that yeah it 's just up there now it is they 're not thank you you have the groins here this is a very old aerial photo the clear water development is in here why I 've used this is this area headstone along the waterways is we the blockage is occurring from here which is the so that one here with the clear water evany comes through from here up along to here 600 meters the river has blocked it 's been a secular research for me to find out who is responsible for that area it eventually comes back to City Council being responsible as signatories to the waterway management caring for the otic kokino it 's an unusual agreement now I 'll grant you but there it is the problem is that the stream is choking up here you 're looking at the main stem of the stream with the Willows that are fallen into it which has now been added to with gray willow here you crack willow is the one above which has had the effect of flooding the walkway you will owe to kokino walkway this is one of the pigs over it runs along through this swamp or swampy area the swampy area is also filling up with the gray willow which is a quite a significant weed I 've included on the back of the submission papers on both old man 's beard and gray willow to bring up to speed with them also old man 's beard as I mentioned we have struck that in the Ashman River raiding district which I 'm chairman of it 's costing us tens of thousands of dollars a year to clear it has the habit of smothering any trees that it gets ahold of this is in the stretch of the OD kokino above the groins this will move into the groins if it 's not dealt with and then you 'll virtually be into clearance regime of mostly the areas and on the outer kokino in the groins that 's their right to speak on and so that 's the flooding kokino tract is effectively severed now by that flooded section there is an informal detour in place at the moment through the clear waters on a residential area using a private way in a private bridge that obviously cannot continue too long because we run the risk that particularly cyclists are likely to have a painful interaction with cars if we 're not careful so as I said the responsibility eventually sheets back to the City Council under the terms of this water waste management caring for the otic Aquino proposed solution and we would ask that for this year 's budget the council should set aside funding to catch up with the maintenance requirements the council has under that agreement provision should also be made for a share in the cost of unblocking the o2 kokino stream and it would be very much in the council 's interest to clear the small infestations of old man 's beard in the otic aquino stream before they become intractable so the recruited action is that provision be made to the council 's annual plan to fund maintenance as part of its made to fund the control for old man 's beard and yoda kokino and then we come on and this will not be in this year 's plan but obviously needs to be put into the longer term plan is funding to sort out this flooding due to the Willows having blocked the oder kokino stream that 's my presentation hopefully it 's left time for questions when the clear water maintenance obligation stopped what year do you remember 2007 words when it finally vested it in the City Council okay thank you thank you would you be open to a partnership on this and I 'm thinking this regard to the Horseshoe Lake area there 's a group there that clears old man 's beard other yusin 's as well on a monthly basis I think and here 's some support from the council there 's some good links in there is that something you 'd you know you 'd be supportable I 'm not trying to know we have away from council responsibility but no I certainly we do have a tradition at Clearwater of turning out and at the moment to develop what to form up a reserve within the residential area so yep we are in the habit of it googling at the same time trying to find that actual thing and what I found is a story dating back to 2016 one of Christchurch 's last remaining wetlands the o2 kokino near Belfast has been restored to a self-sustaining ecosystem thanks to two hundred and twelve thousand dollars of funding from the crash H West Melton 's own committee and I just wonder whether it 's a it 's a waterways Council thing like so it 's might be both the zone committee end the council I don 't know but but but look at you 've raised you know obviously some issues that we need to get to the bottom of the zone commission would do the help with the willow removal yeah not sure about the weeds though so you 're what this was dealing with what I removal in the yeah means beard yeah yeah using the funding from Environment Canterbury some idiots to expression that 's what I 'm just thinking but but look that that 's not to say that it 's not entirely our responsibility so we will get some advice from staff on it and certainly report back to you Aaron yeah so we can follow it up at community board level as well and we 've got it groins user group meeting coming up within the month and so we can raise it with the Rangers and kind of get on top of it then will you be attending that meeting I 'm not aware of that meeting I 'll make sure an invite goes out to the residence Association oh it 's hosted by Arthur Edie cot normally it yeah he 's quoted in this article so I mean it just it does sound like that there 's possibly a wider group of netwo network that we could hook you into but you know we will certainly respond on terms of the submission that you 've made thank you madam chairman chillin yes recently as Thursday we had an informal meeting with Paxton Ric which is where I got some of the details as to who something to bring it to a government level we need I mean it 's fantastic that you have and give my personal regards to Jane Cameron as well thank you quite well thank you human ser cleanest waterway so it 's a real gem it 's a cleanest waterway the otic Akina yeah beautiful yet beautiful area thank you very much _"

    "text": "our Paul de Latour madam mayor councillors thank you for this opportunity to present to you today I 'd just like to introduce Gordon box 'll who is our trustee to the Eclair Community Trust I made the submission on behalf of the echo a Community Trust I am chairman of the fundraising committee now I just like to summarize the submission I made in support of the submission now the area hospital was destroyed by the earthquake in 2010 in 2011 from that negotiations with the CD HB commenced in 2011 and after a number of potential models and unconditional agreement was signed with the CD HB in October 2016 the CD HB would build and fund the facility the community would contribute towards the non health component mainly the residential facility for a fixed price of 2.5 million plus the community would need to pay for set-up cost estimated at 500,000 to create structures systems Emperor possess processes required to run the new integrated health center now the community has four years from date of commitments of construction to raise this contribution now fundraising to date funds raised other areas that we did look at to get our contribution was to rate a levy of one hundred and ten dollars plus years two per property per year for four years would provide a contribution of 1.3 million dollars the community therefore needs to raise a further 800,000 from other sources to complete the contribution of a total of 2,000 our sorry three million affinity is approved it is confident that we can achieve this particularly now there is more certainty about the building going ahead now the context of the rate levy there are approximately 1,900 people registered as permanent address residents in the arid district commit our area now this area is the old echo our County area which a lot of you people remember before amalgamation with little why we amount Herbert and then eventually amalgamation into Christchurch and these residents have direct access to the facility of Middleton services provided now in the holiday season the population is estimated to increase to between seven to ten thousand people now this is very hard to actually get a good figure on this as there 's no figures so while the community is meeting the significant cost of this facility it recognizes that the cost will provide a benefit for tourism and visitors to the area in the holiday season and these tourists and visitors provide other benefits to the community by their presence everyone in the community will Belet our benefit from the cell facility and it will provide and will be provided because of the geological isolation of Banks Peninsula particularly in the winter that service from cradle to grave the CDHP crotchet study council via the bank 's monitor community board and midis social services all recognize the need for an integrated health center and a chorale and it 's right and proper that the community contributes to for the community 's benefit now I 'll just leave it there and I know Gordon would like to make a few comments to finish up our submission thank you just sort of be helpful to a bit of the progress because things are happening quite quickly now and for a long time the communities considered what structure needs to be in place to run the seed ehb and other authorities in the area because we want this to be really integrated so that it 's not just about health although there 's a health focus but it 's about well-being and other services and perhaps social services even as well and so we 've at the trust informed trustees appointed and I 'm privileged to be one of those trustees and we 're currently you may have seen in the press recently we 're currently recruiting directors so they 'll be directors in place over the next few weeks so we can then progress things we 're very confident and with their conversations with the CDHP where they 're at and they were now in the process of doing all the planning stuff for the the build itself so there 's a real head of steam and people in place now to carry that work forward the planning is well advanced between trustees and CDHP it 's not just about the building but it 's also about the model of care and how we 're going to transition from where we are now with the be transitioned to somewhere else while the build goes on etc so we do believe that once resource resource consents if everything goes relatively smoothly there and it should do from the information I 've got and then the build should start later this year optimistic but we think later in 2017 and the trustees in the fundraising committee of the Accra Community Trust believes it 's in the best interest of the community that such a rate be struck to assist with the fundraising that 's required we mix brilliant work that Paul and fundraising committee have done and achieved to get us so far this would give a level of security and I 've never been to a council meeting before where I 'm asking you to increase my rates but it fills from conversations that we 've had around the community that people understand that this is something that 's a good thing and that is a I mean you 'll do your own testing I 'm sure but in the sense of what we know is the people on and you know really opposed to this and then I think with the head of steam that this would also provide to get the extra and amount 800,000 or so will be confident that we can we can do that and we have four years as Paul said to pay the district health board back for the contribution they 're making which is the sort of non health component and the reason for that the passion for that in the community is because people want to have the choice to remain in a koroa not just at the end of their life but don 't through that through various stages so that we can offer residents um residential services as well as people get older and frailer and and then there will be the hospital level beds as well so it just gives more choice for people to live and stay within the community and with dignity so thank you for your time welcome any questions at all Thank You Andrea thank you and thank thank you for the work that you 're doing in this program on this project it 's great to see a project in terms of the funds raised but in terms of the effort that people like yourselves are putting into this project my question relates to timing as you 'll be aware the the targeted rate proposal would require to be consulted with the community and we haven 't done that as part of this annual plan consultation and clearly there are two stages one which you need certainty around that proposal and the other of which where you 'd be needing the the funds that were raised what timings are you working to there when would you need a decision as to whether this targeted rate was able to go ahead or not and when would you want to see the first financial contribution as a result of it thank you and well there 's a jeep wrote we realized there 's a due process and we 've in a sense it would have been if we were here a year ago that would have been that would have been better because then you could have you know we ideally from this year with the idea if that 's that what we have is a confidence that we 've got the backup from the community and the commitment of the DHB so if there 's a need if we need to slip a bit of time we believe we can because the DHB affronting the vast majority of this and the community 's already raised funds that is some of which is available for some of the working capital that we 're going to need as we go through the the coming months so all the only response I think I can make is that if it 's as as soon as is practicable given the due process that you have to go through we believe we 've got the confidence of the community and the sort of leverage with the DHB to be able to time things if we need to in terms of any any delays and because we 're also having starting those negotiations with the DHB and that 's the you know that was they 're always going to be the main commitment the main barrier was the DHB coming up with the capital to fund through that critical phase thank you thank you very much it 's that much appreciated you know again it 's a community that 's done a lot of work and seeking an additional amount of support in a different sort of way so really appreciate your submission this morning thank you for coming over thank you thank you _"

submission to the draft annual plan and realized that we had made a serious error so we quickly have put together a lot of material that we had planned the submission is to the to counsel for his community multiplex facility and be for fresh water decontamination wastewater unit research and decision-making the submission is the outcome of funding facilitated by the akaroa whitey were community board and provided by Christchurch City Council in 2004 14 which resulted in a working party that was Praveen and lodged before council this is the document that they generated the little blue level right here Community Trust has continued to support the Working Party which is now closed down we now feel that we have a responsibility to carry forward the good work and the effort that was put into creating this document three key outcomes that the community has expressed very clearly a desire for our improved amenities and infrastructure for the village settlement center a business area requests to modernize the wastewater disposal system were presented to a banks peninsula District Council in 1997 at that stage there were some changes to council I 'd shortly after that of course we suffered those horrendous earthquakes so everything went on the back burner a medical facility is also requested and required by the people who live in the district and a health and fitness facility now the Community Trust is currently forwarding a project on behalf of council the burdens flat Community Hall many of you will be aware of that and some of you I believe have already visited it the trust is overseeing the completion of the hall to fire eight the patio tomato hibiku on behalf of the buildings flat community and Christchurch City Council it was first proposed in 2008 and carried forward by members of the community Christchurch City Council staff and the trust and the build is now nearing completion the final the now I 'm going to go back a slide there I 'm afraid the building is nearing completion now and the previous two sides that I had there which I seem to have lost were showing the actual site itself and the construction phases that have view and the decking was completed there is just the ballast trades to finish and some inter interior detailing in the kitchen and it is due to be opened on the 27th of June 2017 the community of getting very excited about it they have although they 're a small community put an enormous amount of effort into putting together committees starting to run with ideas planning how they 're going to utilize the building planning how they 're going to continue to support council with the use of that building now the document that I just waved in the air is the outcome of the working party and that was a community plan for live a river and cook town concept being for a combined community facility incorporating gymnasium dojo and consulting rooms has evolved from this and go to the next slide there where do I click there we are the growth of the concept the plan came out of the idea came out of this the people have put statements in there and of intent on the papers that they lodged with us so a recent small presentation was heard from the Lincoln Envirothon group and the following idea emerged if similar amenities have been long needed in Little River and they have as you see since 1997 and if the settlement village center needs refreshing and is continuing to grow which it is then why not incorporate the propositions into the upgrading of the area to do this we need to ensure that it was on the agenda for the Christchurch City Council annual plan we got to work we have looked at the aerial view of Little River we have outlined the areas of council land which are delineated by the yellow lines on this slide and the grayish area that you see running across from left to right about the center of the field state highway 75 the business area and behind that the gray area year of gravel which is an unruly and unfinished area having looked at that and having decided and found that there were some public rights-of-way and easements we thought about the way in which we might possibly develop this further an architect in our area and Rob who of the trust and put together this initial concept that there would be a village center square perhaps with some form of water feature close to the end of the rather lovely well chalk railway area and the cycleway the cycleway finish is just close to it it would be a wonderful area for people to socialise and finish your journey on the left-hand lower left-hand side you 'll see a red blob that is the existing old recycling center to be converted to a multi function community facility the one that we 're talking about with which would include medical facilities some tourist facilities and various other things but at the moment it is all very embryonic if we go to the next slide you will see if you look at Little River that oh no we jumped one I 'm afraid I 'm sorry ladies and gentlemen I 've got a giant go back to if I can now we 've gone through we 're only going forward slide shows been ended for me somebody I can put it back no it 's all right I can just little bit of luck thank you sure why didn 't_''_501.8 I know that say you just yeah that 's alright that 's fine thank you sorry about the delay there the existing vehicle ingress off state highway 75 is shown in the upper layer of photographs that you see there the lower layer of photograph shows the view of the vacant land of the rear of the business area which is the area that we would like to see refreshed and enhanced if we can do that then it will make the area look a lot better for the incoming tourists people that will be visiting the area and I notice I can flick around now sorry about that the village center square would be in the area to the left as you can see it looks very disused an additional and landscaping car parking area would be in the set of photograph and the one on the right shows the recycling shed which is far down at the end of that picture the next picture shows the proposed means of controlling vehicle speed through Little River this is something Christchurch City Council has sympathetically listened and acted on the request of the community in regard to lowering a speed limit to 60 h that sign is an artifact at the moment it is still currently 70 but I 've anticipated a little bit there I 'm assured that it will be gazetted later this year so thank you to castle for that support it was a battle CCC is now aware of their need of our needs a respect of the settlement village centre enhancement we have drawn together ideas that have come from Japan from China from India the gentlemen that have helped to put this together on the top left-hand side of chancre parking space which is easy maintenance low maintenance free draining and would enhance our area fit with our area top right-hand side a slightly humorous concept but one which could in reality work very well behind Little River there 's a steep slope when we have heavy rain the water runs off that slope when the ground saturated and that contributes towards the flooding the idea there would be to put in a long area which overseas visitors would be only too pleased to have a look at the lower one is a concept for a village square an idea so our request is that seed funding to assist the initial concept design and location of a community multiplex facility and a waste water water decontamination unit for Little River be considered to be included in the Christchurch City Council 's annual plan we the trust have worked with the council before we enjoy working with the castle we 've got a very strong team that have developed in Little River I thank you for listening to me CN thank you it 's the the time allocated for the submission but I know that we are always it 's just such a pleasure to hear a community come and ask what we could do together with support from Council but with the community leading the way it 's just fantastic so thank you very much thank you madam mayor it was 8 8 minutes 35 seconds originally planned so I miss time differently you 've done very well thank you _"

    "text": "I 'm Dyana propped up good morning everybody your the advantage of standing back just a little was there get them amplification yeah okay thank you right when I first came to reside in Ely Street in 1990 I had a wee idea a special vision and it was to work towards the creation of a pocket park on the derelict sections adjacent to my property at number 38 evey Street this land had been acquired for a planned motorway through the Central City which didn 't eventuate after six years of hard work mower reserve was created and it 's a special loved place by our community well used by residents and local workers alike and children we hold regular barbecues there to foster community interaction and well-being now I have another way idea another vision for which I ask your support Ealy Street really needs to be fully renewed and here 's my vision become a living Street because it 's already full of beautiful trees and it has character however as you can see from my written submission the roadway pathways and parking areas are all in that and I quote the planned reseal will just be a new surface over the top of the existing with some minor works before to ensure the road cross fall is repaired to avoid the current ponding and to direct water to kerbin channel as intended end of quote this will be very localized we 're needed and it 's only planned for 2018-19 financial year October next year at the earliest there is a grand opportunity to do better here to solve roading pedestrian and parking issues in one coordinated plan and to invite parks and reserves to participate with our community in renewing the entrance to mer reserve where the entry posters just this week protecting the street trees are have been damaged and they 're rotting as well and then to tastefully replant the four large Street gardens in the lane exiting on to sorceress tree the history of the street could be told with interesting signage and in the future guided walks incorporating Barbados Street symmetry the Mari Paul and the bricks could be organized to feature our area and to link into the a van as a volunteer in this area so as a start may I request that outside number 36 and number 38 80 Street the 80 percent dead unsightly tree be removed and the patchy hot medics loose gravel and mud be properly tarmacked most of the street has been properly tarmac for the parking because developers have been required by the council to reseal but they haven 't followed their own practice outside my property and my neighbours so it 's very easy to slip over and it 's messy and could we please instruct the parking enforcement unit not to turn a blind eye to vehicles parking across the footpath as by their own admission they have been doing residents are using the center of the roadway because because of this and it 's dangerous and I spoke to a young woman pushing a buggy with two little boys in it as she wheeled around the corner and I pointed out to her the risk to sum up the neglected area of the eastern frame this Denis neglected area has got great potential we 're asking for thousands more people four avenues but they won 't come F X in the state it is presently or at least our part so please share my vision because you have the power to foster and implement it thank you thank you thank you for having a vision and thank you for sharing us and also turning it into a reality I used to live on the corner of Eli and um yes yes so love their son loves their area but are there any questions about time Dion so this tells us there 's some extra maintenance issues that need to be done so so maybe if you could come email the community for those specific maintenance issues we can give them actions like the tree and stuff like that we 'll get the arborist to have a look at that and the other stuff as a chancer the arborist has been out oh and it is the counsel of the community board contracted an arborist to come out and it is his report that says it 80% dead and and could be removed under general maintenance and i would really like difference small thing but a big difference to us and then that surface to be resealed yes i 'll take that back you know yes please do Vicki don 't have you got pictures that you 've developed of your concept of this living Street well I know but having said that and some years ago a different council we had 250,000 dollars allocated for undergrounding and that money the council changed and that money was taken away so we did have a lovely vision with axel Wilkie transport he he put forward a PowerPoint who lives nearby yeah yeah so there there are these some existing pictures yes there are okay that 'd be really helpful fix them um on T run run the I 'm thinking ruling council sorry what were you saying before outside that I 'm just just saying that 's the community around the reserve and well guys it 's a good so I know you push no Pauline was telling me off for not sticking to time way I hate you I haven 't taken it personally don 't worry um _"

    "text": "bless in there some good morning and welcome good morning your readily lessoning for your glasses okay I 'll have to box on without them sorry Thanks bear with me ah that 's all I have I 'm just about get there I thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak today I 'd like to make a submission on the Hagley oval delivery package which comes in at 1 million one hundred and ninety thousand dollars for this year and I basically like to ask two questions about it the first question being what is the money for I would imagine that good governance means that the council should know exactly where the money 's going they just don 't hand over lump sums and I 'm puzzled as to what this this is actually for but as a clue we have last year left over from the 1 million and fifty five thousand dollar spend on Hagley oval were a couple of items the first item was embankment reshaping to win to optimize capacity and save money by not having to hire temporary seating and cricket and and if it is why aren 't they paying for it and or does counsel pay for the temporary seating and if so why the second item would be foundations for camera towers and other structures and I once again you have to say what are these other structures and in what foundations shouldn 't this be clearly spelled out the foundations for camera towers apparently will save time and money for sky TV doesn 't seem to be a priority for crotchets ratepayers to save money for Sky TV and I 'm sure that lots of local community groups would find a better use for the money I think you 've got a cure them here this morning that the sounds of parade dozens of others they would all find that there 's much better use for that million dollars than helping Sky TV the second question that I would ask is why are we spending the money and it might be a more important question if you compare how tell wrong is very successful International Bay oval cricket stadium there is funded the Toronto City Council maintain the entire Blake Park complex of twenty two wickets to a what do they call it a local level of service and the local credit trust the bay oval trust spend the rest of the money to bring it up to international standard now if it seems to me tear along the City Council have got it probably about right and in Christchurch rate payers are paying way over the odds for what we 've got there 's a lot of money gerra generated at the oval but city councils are paying all the bills I I would have thought that had the guardians of Hagley being established by now and that 's two council votes one CEOs report if they 'd been established by now they might have had a comment to make about this but it hasn 't happened which I suppose is good news for those who favor continued and unnecessary spending of rate payers money on the oval and having regard to the way how long and many to fund an international cricket oval comparing its how we 're doing it III I think it of the City Council they can well afford to run their own show thank you thank you any questions Jonnie thank you for your submission if we 'd had this in our draft annual plan last year as an easily identified project would you have made a submission to it very likely on a regular visitor is this then we 've submitted on so many things and it just keeps rolling along yeah and have have you had an explanation from staff or from Council over what 's happening with the guardians of Hagley Park group although you know whatever it may be called no that 's we 've it 's it seems to fallen into a bit of a black hole and and it 's and so you can get some and this is not just hands-off Hadley all or anything this is to get an independent group there with decent qualifications as in landscape architecture and itaya who 's in there get the big picture for Hagley Park then you 'll get some really qualified advice and free advice and you 'll have an oversight which we hopefully do favor this approach and I think the foal clear water your committee 's been looking at this evidence and pulling now cheers it but I 'm basically like the tomb as we 'll see before to Martin the tomb Guardians has legal connotation for a start so we need to look at that recently as everyone 's aware the park staff have been flat out on Port Hills fire recovery work and that 's probably the major reason that since the last request hasn 't been done but I guess it 's also to ensure that in fact groups who might like work be like an advisory group to the park in fact they would work in a collaborative way to get the best for the park that was the basis of the request might was my understanding so I think that the work is ongoing but it did get diverted because of the requirement to have our Parks and Rec staff involved and an establishing that so we would be probably going back to the next committee meeting yes yours new yeah I thought it would be awesome didn 't we I think we 've changed the terms of reference but perhaps with you okay should I vote we will sort out whatever does I 'm not stressing a matter o maintainer and int and and progressed it but seriously the Port Hills Fire has diverted a lot of attention away from the development of that project but councillors are absolutely committed to it it 's a much better way to go thank you very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "Shaima so I krump that lady mayor councillors thank you for the opportunity we among our submissions was a letter which we sent on February the 14th so that 's almost three months ago most of the detailed points that we have to make are addressed in that letter but unfortunately we haven 't_''_39.239 received any reply so those are the detailed points we 'd like to concentrate on the the overarching things you 've been listening to submissions on the eastern suburbs probably for most of the morning so I 'm sure you had the same responses from many many people again and again the feedback that we get from our members and from local residents is that the decision on the hot water pools is hugely supportive and something that everyone in the eastern suburbs would be very very glad to see because basically as you 've heard again this morning very little has been done over the last six years and if you look at the projects that are planned for the following year you have approximately 20 projects at a cost of what is it five for the eastern suburbs and one of them the qe2 center would be servicing a lot bigger area so that 's one of the things we 'd like to say on the overall the bigger picture here is that there seems to be forgive me for saying it a systemic policy of discrimination against the East and you can see that in what people have been saying this morning the condition of the roads the condition of housing the removal of infrastructure the total contrast between what you see in Sumner and what you see across the bridge when you went to Brighton and that the Brighton Peninsula so we would like to see a lot more funds allocated to during what should have been done in 2012 and 2013 there 's a very small amount has been devoted to drainage and flood protection which would be the the biggest priority in our particular area and we had Margaret of a lustrum from the Uni SDR here several years ago a point she made was that one of the biggest threats for cities over the next 100 years will be this we had this in 2014 with the flopped in basin and with the the area wide flooding we had there we have very high tidal groundwater in the eastern suburbs no one has addressed this problem we have stopped banks which are temporary which has been there since 2011 nothing has been done to basically strengthen them we have mixed messages from the council saying that the stop banks may be raised which would increase the risk to residents because if they collapse then you have flash flooding they could be relocated so somewhere else or they could be abandoned so what people need to know is what the council actually plans to do we have them raised these points again and again we 've had no response from the council we hear what is going to happen a post hoc when signs are put up at the end of the stop bank areas telling us that so many trees are going to be removed and they 're going to be strengthened and strengthened we need to know clearly and definitively what the plan is for the eastern areas would ask you to consider that in the allocation of funding for the next year as I said most of the detailed information is in the letter that we sent three months ago we 've had no response to any of the points we made and it 's not the first time we 've raised these questions lady mare as you know we have a total vacuum of information coming from you what is the long-term plan what is the strategy what are you going to do about very very difficult issues that people are living with of course everyone from Brighton is very excited that the prospect of having hot water salt pools and a repair to the boardwalk where people can there are great things in the area which we love but we need a long-term plan to ensure that people can still live there because the problem of urban flooding isn 't going to go away no one has really addressed it and if people cannot have long term security for their future then they will move out the area is becoming a slum as it is have as is properties that are being sold because they have been settled on a cash settlement basis by insurance companies they 're being bought up by properly speculators the area is becoming a giant slum and this is largely the responsibility of the earthquake authority 's Council EQC and central government so we see the area going down and down and down and no effort to to stop the progress of cinema fication so this really needs to be addressed as a major issue for the following year and for the long term plan and we need clarity and concrete statements as to what is going to be done to to stop this process thank you thank you very much and we will be responding to your submission but also the specific letter is I 've posted on Facebook a couple times it has been hugely challenging a number of the questions that you 've asked have actually already been answered in correspondence and a number of the meetings that we 've already held but actually the issues that you raised far deeper than that and the point that need a strategic approach to the entire area in terms of stop banks it 's not just the area of South Brighton that 's actually the question around South Shore it 's also the question of further up the river catchment and these are all those areas of all residential redzone and how they connect and how we relate to engaging with the community about the future of those areas and how they are protected and how they well I mean mitigated because the total protection as you 've just said is not possible in the future environment so how we resolve all those issues have to go through a process of engaging very directly with our communities and that process is underway so that is this is what we heard in 2012 and 2013 and 2014 and 2015 that 's right that 's right we still have no clear picture of what the regenerate about a greater christchurch regeneration Act wasn 't passed until last year I 'm saying to you that South Shore and South Brighton a strategic approach will be worked out between regenerate Christchurch and the responsibility and we are not handing over the responsibility for engaging with our communities to regenerate Christchurch in the South Brighton area which was not redzone there are people who could argue quite legitimately in my view that there are elements of that area that should have been Reds owned but it wasn 't so we actually have to find a way of working with our communities in resolving these issues together I 've explained the difficulties that I 've had with responding to your leader elements have been responded to I 've done a lot of research personally and to it so that I am able to give a very full response and provide all of the documentation that supports all of the information that it 's based on but you know I 'm one person I 've got a relatively challenging roll and versus landed finally in the week of their annual plan but you put the letter into the annual planned process and I 'm undertaking that you will get a fulsome reply as soon as I 'm able to do so could I draw attention to you 've gone well over time okay I feel that that 's that 's sufficient if you want to follow up with just a quick email to the Secretariat explaining what their particular element that you want to draw people 's attention then they will circulate that to counselors mmm it 's already there it 's the tectonic the shallow movement yes pitches them up yeah they will respond so thank you very much for your time and give Kevin and Eleanor Bahji yep _"

    "text": "how good morning and welcome right Europe my name is Azaria and I 'm 15 I 'm year 11 at Kashmir high school and I do debating there and I 'm also an executive member of the Christchurch Youth Council but all of the opinions I say are my own so this is my first submission to the City Council I have done one to a select committee in Parliament so yeah thanks so much for giving me the opportunity to be able to speak to you guys today my first thought is on the policy of free swimming for those who find costs a barrier and I believe that this policy will help out our community I think it 's a good way to ensure everyone has a bit of fun in the community and I 'm aware that the Wellington City Council added that spectators could attend pools for free and I believe was considering free lessons for under fives I think there 's something Christchurch could also consider doing and it 's a great idea and will get more people active in our community but I will but still will be beneficial another policy I would want Council to implement would be a city council bus to school plan and this plan would subsidize buses to and from schools personally mum drives me to school every day which I understand is detrimental to our air quality and overall Christchurch environment not to mention the fact that the Christchurch air quality is very bad already taking the bus will be too expensive every day with the current cost but with this bus to schools plan I will be using public transport to get to school and I 'm sure many others would too also if council are willing to subsidize swimming costs then they should be able to put some money to buses because some people have to bus to work in school but you don 't really have to go swimming it 's not a necessary thing so this would favor the environment and of the community and more people would use our public transport system which will decrease the Christchurch carbon footprint this money could come from an econ budget from donations grants changing the council important such as the swimming costs I recently went to the Environment Canterbury Youth Summit and the young people there agreed with this plan and it would be great to see this happen also New Zealand is seen as a clean green place for people so let 's make this happen and implement this policy since the recent Port Hills fires our city also hasn 't been as beautiful I live in Westmoreland and it had to be evacuated for the fires and I really think we should rebuild the Christchurch City Adventure Park it got more people excited about Christchurch and there were more things to do here people from outside of closure to travel here to use the park it was a successful community project and if we rebuild the park eventually it will get a big profit for our city and even more people will come here to experience it natural disasters have ensured that there 's not a whole lot to do in our city anymore and if we fund these sorts of projects for our community and that will definitely be more people excited about called the youth action plan for Christchurch where young people like me got to say what policies and projects we would want to see in Christchurch and I came up with three main ones that I believe would benefit our community my first idea would be a place in the central city where young people could get information about job opportunities and also get support for mental health and well-being I believe it should be near the bus exchange in the central city so that it would be easy for young people to get to there could be a notice board about upcoming jobs classes and things to improve well-being as well as tips on stress with exams and similar things it would help out the young people in our community because we sometimes feel scared to talk about things like that there could be people hired to talk about to talk to the people who show up there to give them career advice and mental health support that hopefully doesn 't sound too controversial does it but my next idea could be though it 's to have blank walls street art this idea would be the right thing to do as a council to mitigate graffiti problems in the city why because vandalism is a problem if it is in places it shouldn 't be um such as on the sides of businesses in the city then it needs to be gone with these walls designed for art people would stop doing graffiti in places it shouldn 't be sure this would not end all vandalism completely but it definitely is a step in the right direction the walls could be repainted white as often as needed by workers employed by the council we could even hold competitions and I believe adding these walls will make our city more vibrant as well as mitigating the issue of vandalism in Christchurch almost no one would want to do that art in places it shouldn 't be since they will have legal and supportive places to do it the only people who would continue to vandalize would be people who want to break the laws but sometimes these people just want to practice their art which shouldn 't be a crime it in a legal way will mitigate the problem substantially the third plan I came up with was to have a community vegetable and fruit garden in the city Christchurch is known as the Garden City and we should stay true to this the garden could be included in the Botanical Gardens in the city and will promote healthy eating it really wouldn 't cost too much to get this going and donations would definitely be welcomed healthy eating is the right way to go as a city the vegetables and fruits that are not picked can be given to local soup kitchens city missions and homeless shelters the project that I would put off for now would be the hot saltwater pools project in New Brighton and also the parking building in favour of buses and public transports oh now I 'm not saying I disagree with the idea but I think that the money could be used in a better way um yeah that 's near the end of my submission now so thank you so much for your time it 's really great to be able to any questions and I 'm also sorry that I went over times yeah well that 's probably not a good reason to have questions but just but but to say to you that there is an otaku orchard community garden and food hub which I think we need to connect you up to so alright because it sounds like you 're thinking exactly on the same lines and I 'm sure that you would love to involved in and help that be delivered so yeah all right good right we 're going to adjourn for morning tea and it thank you very much for your submission and so we 're going to we 're going to June Feb morning tea we 're just this running just a slightly over so if we could be back here at 11 o 'clock live in a clock it 's a food out go through TR the back we 'll see out front _"

    "text": "David close welcome the council staff member to take the papers well good morning thank you for having me here as I sit in my written submission well done on the annual plan you 've not the capital program into shape which means that the council finances on so much better footing and well done too on all those numerous policies you have which resists the trend towards inequality which is so apparent in New Zealand society but what I really want to say this morning is that you have a huge opportunity in this council to take a much bigger step to address that shocking trend to inequality it 's an increasing into opportunity that you have in housing interest rates are at an historic low and what 's more we have a very vigorous booming industry which is beginning to show some surplus capacity in the combat a combination of historically low interest rates and the developing capacity in the building industry and the development new texts and techniques and systems for building I think gives you the opportunity to make a real contribution to housing in Christchurch that turned around housing in Christchurch for low income people and as a New Zealand citizen I 've got to say I 'm ashamed that we have homelessness in our city when I was a trial our society was much less wealthy than it is today and now in the midst of our wealth we have homelessness and I find that quite shocking I think God that the City Council 's still there with its social housing which is at arm 's length these days but in the last year also have been able to get a couple of people who are sleeping rough a New Brighton into City Council housing so thank you for that my proposition this morning is very simple just let me get it it 's based on the muffin principle here I have a small nation ' muffin on my left which costs me 81 cents and the big muffin on my right which costs 2 50 my proposition is simply this if ratepayers in Christchurch contributed each week the equivalent of one muffin either a small muffin if you have a small house or they improve it contribute the equivalent of that that would produce 9 million dollars a year from 174 thousand rating properties and that 9 million dollars a year would be sufficient to fund the development of 1,500 one and two-bedroom units over six years I 've put those facts out simply in this little model which is come round you 've got it now and you can see on the first page the assumptions which I make about this building program one in two bedroom flats 90 percent occupancy 185 dollars a week rent design and build contracts to counselled specifications design and build as much cheaper than one-off systems use major builders to achieve economies of scale cost per unit 200,000 if as in the case of berm strict you already own the land up to 300,000 if you 've got to buy the land at say an average of 250 thousand if you think that 's unrealistic let me tell you that major builders are building 100 square meter houses ensuite and all the rest of it for two hundred and sixty thousand that 's about 200 that 'd have to ramp it up to about say three thousand three hundred per square meter for smaller units but it 's certainly achievable with the techniques which they have in the economies of scale which they get from a continuous program of building loan servicing I 've allowed five point five perceived for interest and repayment sigh think the council is paying a bit less than that present probably about 52.2% but interest rates are going up a bit so about five point five from the root of one hundred and eighty five dollars a week I 'm suggesting one hundred and twenty to go towards loan servicing that may be a fraction low over the next page you can see a simple model of how this would work the first line the capital cost you spend sixty two point five million each year to build two hundred and fifty units at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and you notice the next line the cumulative borrowing it goes up to three hundred and seventy five million by the end of year six the number of units bought two completion and fifteen hundred by year six Loan Servicing three point four eight million year one rising to a maximum of twenty point six million in year six how do you fund that loan servicing well contribution from rates 120 dollars a week and that starts at one point five million a year two and rises to just over 10 million by year seven and then the rate contribution the muffin per week from a muffin per root from each rate payer on average nine million dollars a year there 's the bottom line which shows you the outcome for each particular year as I said before the contribution from from rates at one hundred and twenty dollars a week is a bit light I think it probably to up four hundred one hundred and thirty and I think that would make the whole program more viable into the future and mean that the the Muslim contribution to go into other units as I said before I think I think this is a huge opportunity I think this council has got the courage and the ability to seize that opportunity too big and it 's too difficult let me tell you that the Citizens Council which was run in the city in the years before immediately before I was elected launched onto a huge building program and they built about two or three hundred units a year for about four years it took we bit longer than I 'd originally planned because they bought up a lot of the end of it it it did take about maybe about five years but they were building at about 200 a year I see no reason why we couldn 't achieve that same sort of thing again I believe this is something which would enable this council really to make its mark not only here in Christchurch but in New Zealand as a whole this model is a very simple model I kept that simple hadn 't got too much sophistication at bi think it 's fundamentally sound and I urge you to give it very serious consideration ratepayers don 't respond very readily to rate increases but I think there would be hardly a rate payer in Christchurch who wouldn 't week you 'd raise it on the general rate which means that a person in a small house would pay for a snow muffin and a person in a very big house would pay for a big muffin I think it 's perfectly fair and reasonable and if the council spends money as I said in my my submission written submission on things like golf tournaments which help economic development or on heritage buildings or symphony office with or whatever then I see no reason why there shouldn 't be a modest contribution from rights in this way thank you thank you thank you and sorry that 's the that 's the allocated time but thank you very much for the submission I mean we 've got yeah we we do here to keep moving so I 'm I 'm saying I understand some constraints perhaps I might have a chance to speak to the Housing Committee sometime I think that would be a very good idea because I suspect that some of the submissions that we 're receiving will be more better consider than the context of the long year I fully recognize that madam chair but I do think we have to recognize that we we are in an unprecedented situation in you dealing with our housing crisis and it really needs action pretty promptly and I would think a special consultative procedure on a proposal like this might be quite reasonable and it may well be that that is the case but you know in terms of the annual plan process we are making adjustments to them to the 2017-18 annual plan and it may well be that a special consultant procedure would precipitate something like this it would certainly be required but then that could potentially wrap itself into the LTP process which is the equivalent but anyway thank you very much and you 've obviously given a considerable thought to so thank you very much good to see you _"

    "text": "thank you for the opportunity to be here and die in France a longtime resident of Red Cliffs and communication coordinator for the bill moral Lane Association and the purpose of my submission is to ensure that the footpath is reinstated on the muratov side of Main Road Red Cliffs to provide safe access for pedestrians moving to and from route cliffs to McCormick 's Bay Balmoral Hill areas the safety that will be provided by the replacement must also be considered in the context of the current danger to pedestrians crossing the uncontrolled and marked junction of the causeway McCormick 's Bay Beach Ville and Main Roads the Nereo area identified in Section four main road passed mayor cave and the Littleton to city corridor a draft plan on the reinstatement of the footpath beside the mower cave the draft plan states the road has been returned to the previous layout improving safety for cyclists and drivers the road has not been returned to the previous layout a more than 80 year old footpath on the markov side of main road has not been reinstated without the footpath pedestrian footpath on the opposite side and they have to cross on the causeway side of mower cave since presenting our first submission to the ferry me Community Board in July 2016 the pedestrian safety in this area has not improved I would venture to say it has deteriorated the corner of McCormick 's Bay Road Beach Ville road and the causeway remains unsafe for crossing in complex for assessing movement of traffic we know that this corner will need to be fully reviewed when ricklefs school returns to ricklefs park in about 18 months or two years time in the meantime a senior counsel engineer told me that the issue of safety will be reviewed when someone is killed this approach is unacceptable residents are currently minimizing the risk of fertility by driving their children through this into a section at least twice a day elderly can regularly be seen walking towards the oncoming traffic on the roadway alongside the new remark numeric a fence the right frisk is too great to consider crossing at the junction especially if you can 't run safety of pedestrians that must cross main because there is no footpath on the commemorative side of the road has also become more precarious through confusing and potentially finish cycle dangerous signage the recently added speed limit cites signs past my archive area never limit traffic to 30 kilometres an hour a driver needs skill and experience on the Sun and even road and to track safely past mower cave however it seems that this has not been enforced to 30 speed limit since the signs went up imagine following a load of portaloos through the air at 50 kilometres an hour and they were bouncing in different directions and likely to fall on any pedestrians or following cars also the limited speed exit signs from the mower cave area now permit vehicles to speed up to 50 kilometres an hour as they approach the pedestrian crossing at the school unbelievably the signs indicate that traffic can increase speed to 50 meters an hour we 're moving on to the causeway at the junction where pedestrians can cross the road utilizing the safety island this also increases the risk of vehicle accidents at the intersections and I at pages 1 2 you will see the issues that I have raised there they were taken on one day last week after is an article in the paper so they are not posed for those in the safety Islands are small almost impossible for those with buggies or bikes my 12 year old grandchildren described the safety islands as terrifying when the large tracts and buses raced through prostitute close to where they 're standing a weight is necessary as it is rare to find gaps in the traffic on both halves of the road concurrently there is has however been progress and environmental and geotechnical decisions that support the reinstatement of the footpath a second quote from the draft pan is not now current and may 2017 it stated now the containers are gone permanent security fences have been put in place to prevent people accessing areas where there is still risk from rock fall and cliff clips the piece on May the 13th just last week reports that our memo to Dave Adamson city services general manager indicates that the following geotechnical that following geotechnical advice a now possible this is the wording of the newspaper the possible risk to life has now been reduced following the completion of the adjacent risk mitigation project a press reader familiar with section 4 of the Littleton city corridor will be astonished that the priest further reports however it will require no stopping on both sides of the road which would affect three residential properties and two council owned properties you 'll note furtive the photos on paragraph on page three demonstrate that there are existing yellow lines for no parking through this area they have been in existence for many years they filled the roadway without parking and footpath would indeed be returned to the previous layout as stated in the plan the report also states the bus stop would need to move the photographs applied showed that the bus stop is on a wider portion of Road and not on the area being considered this submission requests that on current writing budget for safely that on the current writing budget for safety the footpath passed Millar cave is reinstated that the road surface is realigned and sealed to made to the safety islands at the junction awaiting full assessment and budgeting for the long term traffic needs illness caller also that the temporary 30 to 50 kilometer and now speed signs are immediately changed to ensure greater safety for pedestrians it both recommended crossing points I submit that the section for per port portion of the little tinta City corridor pass mower cave and the entrance and exit to the causeway requires urgent funding and detention for safety please do not wait for the inevitable infertility to investigate it thank you very much that 's a very detailed submission and you 've covered I thank all of the points that need to be raised obviously you know it 's a technical submission as well so I will certainly take advice on it and considering the context of the pain thank you very much thank you thank you _"

out of town so he seems his apology he is going to he promised that he would watch a replay because it 's all been live streaming yes the codeword pineapple Dave if it gets that well we 've actually turned up completely I 'm appeared we 're just going to speak from the hip yep yeah we 've we came to Brighton 16 years ago we invested our family we invested our money we invested our business and we 're 100% committed to our community we we understand process we understand that this is part of the you know what we have to do to get another punch in the guts and Hounds and we with when we entered into new bride and 16 years ago was so the business living years ago we thought that was rock bottom and we 've seen a progressive downward slope and just to give you a bit of insight information that when when skirt shut pages road made it one way that actually was the worst thing that could have happened to the business of the business district that fit with us dramatically and and we still haven 't come back from that so I don 't it 's not your responsibility our to skirt isn 't it was it was a joint responsibility but no I mean that I think that the coordination between skirt and how it operated and its impact mmm we we should have had a high level of oversight that was the biggest damage yet it it didn 't a new product from my opinion and and and it changed people 's behaviors yet and they haven 't come back so now 's the time more than ever that 's yes it 's never up to enough talking about it this connection unless it 's actually does it seems to me that this is this is the opportunity the opportunity for me is that okay you just said that a better better journey got disrupted and it 's really hard to bring people big yeah right so but just turn your mind to the new journey that will be created from the city to the sea which is the redevelopment regeneration of the residential red zone that the sea where you meet the sea there 's new brighter it is so it becomes this awesome destination and it 's got a new new reason to be I mean essa does that smoke your tires little well it does but it 's proper still wedding I mean what no no but the development of that journey is not yet complete but there is a temporary of a transitional trail going on it 's going to bring it all to Negroes I mean man biking in some the last one and I drove past this beautiful Boulevard I don 't want to start thank you no 'm going to talk about I 'm going to talk about the necessity of that route as a redundancy or a bore a route to support the porter blood alternate which is not a tunnel you know it 's a you know things might look like they 're being done to support residents Barry had been done for other reasons as well so yeah the city is a very complex place but anyway carry on yeah no that 's that 's what my main point I want to make across was actually the damage that that shutting that road did to us over the last Christmas was phenomenal it was probably the biggest punch in the cat 's we were ahead yeah Glen do you it 's like changing technology the other councillors may not be aware of the other businesses you own in and feast and run of which they partake in the city I just wondered I what I want to say is its I want to have a conversation that it 's two-way traffic so you 're not you know you 're giving a lot to the here we do but Brighton 's were others that is actually we started yeah it 's we now employ 50 people we pay over a million dollars in wages a year and we supply we support a lot of families and we 're working to ass off and and we 'd still feel like Brighton the that 's been one of our biggest challenges is actually starting a business out of Brighton and having the stigma attached to it and we 've had to work our asses off and prove that that that we 're not yeah and yeah you know Paul Anka G down the saying there 's a whole lot of cool building companies and businesses and it is about the businesses are about people what you were just saying I just wanna know is there any things that we can do really quickly to actually help support those businesses and our supporting families oh I 'll give you a em yeah action that 's it action Brighton is you know we we might look a little bit calm and Placid but we would if something goes wrong a big stink that 's on the street it 's just a reality and with we 're we 're really fraction so that 's that 's the thing that has to happen we understand process you understand consultation but actually here we 're really you were innocent process but just yet we 've got a see some action yes when you see action and and you know development and other areas and stuff and you sort of think oh you know me people do come out to Brighton like people speaking before you know and sort of think rocky you know what 's been happening it here it 's like wow yeah not heaps yeah and you do kind of just forget about the try and forget about the roads and things yeah I just think those big projects you know to get some of those across the line and then yes tidy up all those other bits and pieces that she was talking about would be great but yet to get make it more of a destination mmm because there 's a lot of people out here obviously you know that don 't you yeah yeah so um yeah Tim did yeah just that your comment with regards to pages right I think absolutely right with regards to the rebuilding what 's still happening with accessible said it 's suture I don 't think any of the agencies to enough work with regards to the ongoing effects and the effects of businesses which are crucial irrelevant where they are and Christchurch whether it 's the east or the north or south of the West I don 't think we 've got that analysis no you know so I 'm just say your thank you for that for cooking it I 'll let you guys just leave me alone other areas in Christchurch where you 've got businesses are they are they affected by other roadworks and that have you seen that across the city was it just even not to that extent not to and we had a meeting with all parties and including the skirt and one comment that this lady made accounting rename was we actually don 't have to consult you to do this we can needs to be done but actually yeah I think no one anticipated that the harm of actually that making one open it 's quite symbolic one way out of broaden yeah so I don 't know what the answer is but there needs to be some limits from that it does need to be some learnings and I think the lessons learned from our experience have got to really fully appreciate those wider and past but thank you both very much for coming that is appreciated do love your coffee Jennifer _"

Jeanette and Angus MacDonald oh go on right and so my name is Janet MacDonald Janet like Janet Jackson and I grew up and on a farm and ygq Valley and spent most of my childhood wandering over tussock covered Hills which i think is why I love Brighton we now live right beside the beach and South Brighton with our three children but my mother grew up an ich bitten in the 1950s and even then as a child she knew that East Christchurch was certainly a place you did not want to live that stigma is well and truly alive today when I suggested twenty of our dreams that they should substitute there that they should look at buying a family home bitten near the beach she replied that I would never live on that side of town as if it 's a commonly known hazard and we 'd miss that but near Christchurch and we weren 't indoctrinated and this intergenerational prejudice that exists toward the East when moving to Christchurch we just saw the beautiful stunning wild and magnificent beach that makes the east side the best side we 're not the only ones many of the parents at South New Brighton school are English Spanish German American and Canadian they can 't believe that they can live right on the beach in New Zealand we all choose to live there because we can walk on the beach or the dunes for miles and our children have an almost endless playground friends and family from even haired rolleston springsteen southland comment it 's as if you cross a line everything 's nice the roads the roadsides the council landscaping and then you cross an invisible line and you know you 've arrived on the east side I love where we live and I don 't have a chip on my shoulder it 's other people from other parts of Christchurch in New Zealand are asking me why does the East look like this we 're so excited about the possibility in Brighton we 're disillusion once again why was the one and only specific question on the submission form asking ratepayers whether they agreed or disagreed with money being spent and Brighton it felt like you were looking for an out that sometimes feels that their intergenerational prejudiced against the East might be prison and some of the councillors so many people native to Christchurch can tell you the mindset I don 't understand why the prejudice exists 82% of people in South Brighton have formal qualifications twenty percent of us have degrees our friends in South Brighton are teachers accountants engineers artists quantity surveyors architects doctors business owners researchers at the University and some work here at the council we 're not all unemployed and uneducated but what is true is that Brighton does not like some of the homogenous suburbs that thrive in the city it 's diverse it 's like any small town in New Zealand and it 's a diversity that 's enriching and we don 't want to love anna ploy stood suburban bubble a christchurch man came to marine parade not so long ago cross that invisible line I hope he got his vaccinations first his comments were along the lines of wow you live right on the beach what a beautiful house what a great spot it 's so beautiful I 've never really been out here this is from someone who lived in Christchurch for years how many people have lived in Christchurch for years and never wandered down that wild beautiful beach create something amazing and brighten the hot saltwater pools but could become an amazing asset for all of Christchurch it will be a place that will encourage people to cross the envers or mine I think it 's the way to get people living and Brighton as to get them visiting Brighton and realizing what an amazing place it is before we move on to you because you 're a secret submission you get another five minutes I just want to say the reason we asked the question about New Brighton was that we put five million dollars on budget for the Legacy Project which was to be the hot salt would oppose after talking to the community about that would be sufficient to catalyze other investment and it wasn 't to change the LTP we have to ask that all the people of Christchurch if we can put more money on budget that 's why we 're asking about it and the amazing thing about the process is that I our staff to take out all of the submissions from New Brighton and tell me did the majority of submissions favour putting more money on budget for Brighton and the answer to that question is yes that 's great so I just I 'm just it wasn 't here it wasn 't there that 's what I 'm saying has to change it wasn 't it but it 's a it was a it was a legal process that we 're required to do in order to change the LTP so I just want to reassure you that it wasn 't for any motive and it 's had a really good result in terms of how we do know those are little things that are happening and you know there are a little there 's progress being made wider Christchurch mindset and you 're using the European all of the submissions that we 've heard so far have also reinforced to me how important it is to actually tell the people and the East how much we 've already spent underground and pump stations and community facilities and what 's coming because I think it would help to understand just just the extent of the earthquake damage and the facilities that have needed to be replaced and also this is a legacy project for for New Brighton but also as you say for the city _"

Mariner who used to come round and in in no I 'm sorry yes did you want to share some photos mr. Lanson privately so good morning mayor in classes and thank you for the opportunity to make my request to the council I ask the council to protect the south shore suburb from inundation from the high potential high tide flooding from the estuary my wife and I 've lived in the South Shore suburb for 37 years this is our home in our community here we 've brought up a family and with all council consents have extended our home three times and since the earthquakes the demolition of the red Sun houses along the area front has seriously weakened the protection of the land and homes as the demolition work lowered the level of the land the extra edge is now a neglected in a degraded site to be developed along the s3 front as is recommended in the by the Oh sale report which you have seen up believes somebody and this will provide both some protection for the area edge which is being eroded by the southerly winds and waves at high tide we will also provide protection for the 500 homes of residents and the roads and infrastructure which the council has invested in over the years such a levira berm will also provide an elevated in fact a very excited elevated walkway and cycleway for all citizens of christchurch to use and enjoy especially to enable people to observe the bird life of the estuary for example the god wits and thereby caused no disturbance to the birds you will know that the ethereal residents association commissioned the OC report at a subsequently carried out a survey of residents 98.5 percent of respondents approve the design by the OU cell report or third Galatea coastal engineer he estimated the cost of the berm along the South Shore estuary shoreline on a meter equivalency basis to be about a third of the cost paid zone adjacent so there is an area adjacent to the s3 front is a valuable grassed area for residents and visitors presently enjoyed by many City white walking groups it needs to be protected from erosion the proposed berm will do just that as well as give protection to the residents and their properties I understand the council has a responsibility to protect all its citizens so please give immediate consideration to this urgent need of the residents of one suburb thanks thank you and that the land that the the proposal was to build it on the red zone Lane doesn 't it I believe it 's actually it would be built on council land which I think there 's a paper road that goes to wall all the way down and that would be on the STI side obviously of the of the red zone land but I mean it would be wherever it 's going to be most feasible I would think I thought it was actually on the on the lane so that it simply looked as a like a mound you know there 's a basically discount it was just a very interim arrangement and the idea that Galatea has put forward is much more much more substantial firm that would to provide more protection it is why I thought it came on to the reads I need that the reason I 'm saying us is that is that we can 't proceed with any work on the red zone area without the regeneration planning work haven 't_''_281.04 been undertaken but not just to give you a sense of reassurance of where we 're up to the regenerate Christchurch have got a South Shore South Brighton regeneration strategic approach or strategy on their work program the South Brighton component of it which is that north of Bridge Street probably south of Britta Street as well but particularly north of bread Street there 's an interconnection of course also with the eastery environment as well which has an s3 coastal planning arrangement attached as well but the council is taking responsibility for the regeneration planning in the in the South Brighton area because it 's not read zoned but it is connected to red zone further and that being the history with South Shore which is why council and regenerate Christchurch are working very collaboratively together but at some point we need to absolutely engage the community and a conversation about what it is that will be done so in there are two different processes the regenerate christchurch will lead at South Shore but Christchurch City Council will lead and self Brighton they 're hugely challenging issues but we 're very aware of this project and and I know that regenerate Christchurch have received a presentation on it as well just making my point pleased that the where I live to god Bridge Street the the end of the rock wall that was built to protect history Road the SI li the except I 'd read the extension that 's actually ends just before God bridge Street and so there 's a funnel where the water will will come in there and that could be quite devastating for South Shore should there be a very severe inundation one day because it would be the weakest point and of the of the spit yeah and the water to do and I 'm very aware of it but thank you very much for your submission thank you much much appreciate it at _"

provide you with an opinion that was number one for you to have written material and to listen and thirdly to go away cogitate and come back with a well thought through response so in that basis I 'd like to give you the opportunity to ask my opinion but before I do that I just like to tell you my role that I have had for the last 40 years in the New Brighton area and surrounding suburb and I 've been witnessed to the dissolution of a thriving community the commercial hub until somewhat derelict and unkempt precinct in its less savory social consequences my role is general practitioner for the medical services in the area is to connect people to the appropriate services at all levels whether it 's a connection to a food bank to an appropriate hospital or secondary service a connection to social workers a connection to wins connectivity and the ability to connect to a rewarding experience or solution is incredibly important for the support of self esteem and the maintenance of mental and physical well-being this especially applies to our youth and the development of any socially acceptable and sports based activity is to be encouraged and it 's on this basis that I strongly support the allotment of the funding from the draft plan into the annual plan and saying this I 'm also acutely aware of the increasing need to maintain connectivity for our older population in activities which encourage maintenance of family contact peer contact increased mobility and fitness there is no doubt that maintaining connectivity improves the quality of life and decreases the dependency on supportive activity by allied health care professionals and the state in my discussions with individual councillors I am heartened by the positivity and the understanding of the requirements of our city to have a uniqueness to provide a cosmopolitan element to the city itself this is this enriches the experience for them for not only those people who are domiciled in the city but also those people economic functionality of individual suburbs and the flow-on effect to the people within those individual areas is in itself reinforcing and rewarding those of us who work in the area of health care and disease management in poorer suburbs are very aware of the social consequences of poverty and that the addition of this pull complex to the New Brighton area can only be regarded as an extremely positive outcome for this very earthquake damage zone the Legacy Project combined with the exciting developments that the crisis the Council has proposed and is in the process of endorsing and conjunction with DCL is very uplifting for our area we look forward to the rapid development of our survey that includes walkways promenade will be cycleways linking through the salmon theory meet in the Eau de Caro vision linked play and adventure playgrounds for children on the spit with sheltered picnic areas barbecues and washroom facilities maybe an aerodrome for model aircraft may be a model yacht lake who knows this is what we need to enthuse there rangatahi in outdoor activities well done and thank you counselors I thank you area in which my wife Sally and I have lived for 4550 years and our family have resided for over 100 years thank you thank you we just came to the dot of five miles okay it was perfectly timed I don 't clean is going to tell no I wonder could you ask a question I mean I could ask one but I mean you know the area well it 's really the question I was asking before because depopulation isn 't usher in terms of providing services and an area like New Brighton it is you know the the damage hasn 't just been done by the earthquakes itself not the physical damage the people damage has been done by what 's happened after the earthquakes and you know I guess that I 'm still looking for different ways that we can because I just know that some of the thinking that 's going on is how do we get more people living in the area different ways of living in the area and exciting different opportunities in the area I mean I remember standing at the end road the slow road I remember standing there at the opening of the slow road and saying if anyone thinks this is the end of a project that will revitalize new brush nothing it was back then then they 're dreaming because it 's what happens in the area that matters in a piece of hardware infrastructure on a road ain 't going to solve the problem everyone thought that the problem should be solved from the other end working back but here we got it right this time that we start at the at the beach and connect to the to the central core of New Brighton it would be nice to think that we can provide warm new affordable homes in the area and there is land in the area which we could address as leading to a new part of the suburb to buy an old batch and knock it over and put up a warm home actually is beyond most people sadly I 'm also thinking that the red zone even on the other side of pages Road you know over the bridge elements of there that are light on the land that enable people perhaps to get into the and to their own home but not necessarily own the land you know I mean I think that we should be open to maybe thinking about different ways of living and wouldn 't you Brighton be the best place to trial something like that I think you 'd find a fair bit of enthusiasm amongst the New Brighton folks to explore exciting and new options all right well thank you very much for your time much appreciated of the _"

    "text": "keen as a king cult cult calling Colin sorry keen on I 'm not pronouncing your surname correctly calling calling just oh just one thing I was allocated 10 minutes I 've just a bit oh good Jeff things I 'm sorry that you know that these timeframes are not ideal I think that in future we 're going to look for a more of a work shopping around issues and then hearings that that are more focused I think we 're just working out how we go yeah as we go right and beside me here is pool crops who 's another member of the christchurch 360 trail committee morning Paul has his interests in tourism I 'd say thanks very much for the opportunity to reacquaint you with the christchurch 360 trail the committee is very appreciative of the assistance that you have given us over the last few years the Bulova trail was launched in October 2015 bye-bye councillor Vicky back there 's still a lot to be done there 's there 's a lot to be done to get it to a well formed uniform standard encircles christchurch 147 h emphasis to that it goes through Brighton that you 've just been talking about now the the trial showcases landscapes the biodiversity the history and the culture of Christchurch but in addition to that it has tremendous unrealized tourist potential it 's in as early days and that respect but local local national international tourists it offers a really interesting activity for them in that respect the committee spent a lot of time during the last year in contacting service providers around the route and we 've built a database and we 've given them some information the map and they and booklets for example and and we and we 're hoping that 's going to lead to greater knowledge and interest in the tourism respect we 've made our submissions in the last three years and 2014 and 2015 we were allocated whether the project was allocated 50,000 at which included staff time but with the remainder we were able to produce booklets markers for the track signage the poster that you have there and t-shirts for marketing purposes some very appreciative of that support ongoing commitment that it 's needed from Council to sustain this 360 trial at a 2016 and 2017 we presented information on a lower-cost option for the history project which I 'll talk about a little bit in a moment but I must emphasize in the last couple of years we didn 't request any specific funding for the project this year we are requesting some funding now in the this annual plan and budget there 's two projects that directly relate to the 360 trail was the estuary edge project four thousand and twenty five dollars for the four thousand sorry four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars was allocated for construction during 2018 and 2019 with planning and design happening this year we 're very pleased to see that project in their annual planning budget it 'll make a tremendous difference to the pathway through it 'll mean we 'll be able to abandon the labyrinthine route at present goes through ferry Mead Linwood and Bexley and we 'll be able to use the much better much more scenic much better for a wildlife point-of-view pathway between the margin revegetation project there 's twenty three thousand dollars allocated 2018 2019 and twenty four in 2019 2020 we strongly support that project that will enhance the the pathway tremendously what we 're asking for with those two projects is that elements of the lower cost option that we presented in the last annual plan be reconsidered just to see there was a view to reduce the cost somewhat of the eastery edge project secondly with both those projects because we 're a key stakeholder representing several many of the users the potential users we would ask that we be consulted during the design and the and the concept formations phase this year we 're also requesting a that a specific Christchurch 360 trail line item in the annual planning budget be established we 're asking for a project manager who will be able to coordinate the within Council the trail and we are asking for a modest budget as well there 's a large volunteer effort involved in the trial particularly rotary who are doing the maintenance for which we 're very appreciative but in addition there are as running there 's publications to keep up to date there as we maintain a website some direct costs associated and negotiations and in addition to that particularly out the Northwest out beyond the airport there are improvements that are needed for the flaws of trail some earthworks and fencing for example around Fulton Hogan 's worried regular spraying along Ryan 's Road and pounds road would be very beneficial there 's a some signage for the road crossing it 's needed out there and styles on christchurch international airport leased land but with the project manager it would be very beneficial to have somebody who could coordinate between council teams someone who could be our prime point of contact in the council and could alert the committee to other projects in the annual planning budget that are of relevance to the trial so so in conclusion I just like to say that not only does the trail showcase landscape biodiversity culture and history of Christchurch but also has tremendous potential as a tourist asset and this aspect of it is just in its infancy so I would ask you to together and I thank you for your support Tim den Becky and thanks Kim um the council 's ornithologist I think said there 's a 136 species of bird comes to the Christchurch Erie because of its makeup and with regards to tourism a 360-degree walkway really if you go anywhere agogo fee hikes or walks there 's different types of beauty etc but this that this is kind of 136 species it 's totally unique to the South Island having that number and some are totally unique to the South I so they don 't go north and the migrations that citralekha across so with that in mind I just notice how much focus are you putting in on that because all of Ornithology is a huge recreation and a big tourism so I 'm just wondering as it 's almost kind of mentioned as an aside rather than the trick itself I was just well if we 're looking at as a tourist opportunity to the city as a whole rather than and it 's obviously the recreational for the locals I 'm just wondering what the focuses ornithology but the track provides connectivity so I see it as connecting areas of biodiversity interest in particular birds very much a part of that and as you said councillor in Birds wetland Birds very much part of the scene in Christchurch and there 's been a real effort made to to pass through all those areas in particular all the way along the coastline and the ornithology is an important aspect it 's probably fair to say haven 't developed it specifically but it 's a very important aspect yeah Vicki do you want to ask the project manager that you would like within the council would that be somebody who 's here already that you just want as a point of contact yes well if money was allocated to a project then we have assumed that a project manager would be appointed to look after that you know that you want somebody here that you go to for all of the projects around as the first point of contact please write look think think can you store all of the t-shirts thank you for the teachers yes going is a great logo yeah doesn 't use yeah no I really like it look thank you very much for your time it 's much appreciated and we 'll obviously give that meter consideration as we 're looking at the annual plane thank you thank you very much okay _"

petition leaders because they 're representing that the entire petition that you you you are taking 15 minutes to present to us and respond to questions lovey thank you doesn 't_''_40.43 for just use the arrow game so that 's just bad luck sorry yeah it 's a player program the media are tamari a Kurata Coto good morning and thank you all met Amir counselors thank you for hosting us here in the chambers today my name is Easter period with me today are Rebecca McAlister Kathy Baker Rob you agent we 're here to speak on behalf of these people we 're here because you asked us a question you asked us did we support the Christchurch City Council fiscally supporting the hot saltwater pool project and you Brighton I 'm sure you 've all had to read what the people had to say both from the coastal ward in across the city yes they support not only the pools but anything that regenerates and repairs the vibrant coastal suburb that is New Brighton it 's been said that a picture paints a thousand words so here 's a snapshot of the many many diverse and activated community members who 'd like to thank you in advance for your support thank you very much and thank you for listening to us today I was one of the people who are cost of people at the market on Saturdays to see if they would be interested in filling in the submissions and what really hit home to me with a number of people who came from outside the coastal area to visit the market on a Saturday and who were in support of the pause we had people from Ralston and Humby and SOT boom Burnside Wesley spear Kashmir 's Martens Warren 's Shirley and I go to the market regularly but of course I 've never really sort of stopped and said hey we were you wrong and so with this and they 'd say well we 're not from your area and city and they said yes we think it 's a great idea and so probably a good quarter to a third of these are from people outside the area New Brighton area so I think that 's really quite an important point another interesting thing was I was talking to a lady who regularly goes up to Henman for because she has rheumatoid arthritis and she sits in the pools and she can only manage to get up there once a month and I hadn 't actually thought of the therapeutic value of having the hot saltwater pools in our area and she said if they were in Brighton she would be able to get there at least once a week because she felt that just sitting in the pools and hanmer really really helped her and helped her pain level and so it 's not just going to be a recreational thing I think it will be a therapeutic one as well I think that 's probably all I need to say thank you to dr. tena koe your tokoto code kata core Rebecca oho core South bright and I spend most of my time with sleep deprived mums apparently under fires and I just want to say what a sort of inspiring community I 'm involved in and I was really lucky to be involved in the link project last year and the we 've learnt of Easter through the link project and and the support that we 've been given and we can see happening in the future and as really tells us you know that you know bright and can only continue to get better and better and so Matt 's a hoodie hoodie cardd tomahto and with feathers the bird will flourish and we 're surrounded by loads of inspiring people who serve I think act like catalysts um and if I can speak from a science teacher specific doesn 't say that a catalyst is a and substance that increases the rate of reaction if it 's not changed by the reaction and we 're all human beings so there 's lots of people here who really increase the rate of this reaction I think but being part of Christchurch we 've all been has been changed by what 's happened but in a positive way I think things like this and the link projects and other things that happen help the catalyst in our community look after themselves so we can keep on contributing to the community and then we feel that benefit that comes back from you guys so I said thank you for everything you 've done hey guys Robbie Bajan and looked and Bryden fir coming on 20 years some bit of an outsider to some there but it 's when I shifted here and looked around where I wanted to live I looked at bright and it 's a seaside suburb it 's a stunning area moved in there and couldn 't believe the attitude that came from elsewhere and then the lack of and put into the area then the earthquakes happened and it got decimated a lot of us work really hard over there to try and pull the sea area up community is very very tight they work together and there 's a lot of different attitudes and a lot of different walks of life and is that it hasn 't met it from what walk of life people are open they want something to happen and that 's where this has come about and the hot pools is the start of something happening at something that the whole community has come together and said hey let 's get this place going let 's get it started and looking at the aspect that if we can get something that 's going to bring the people then there 'll be others to come and to keep the people there Brighton needs this now you know we 've all worked hard we different events Ronnie and Esther does first of all we do rockabilly you 've got kite Day brings all these people in they come in they stay for a couple hours they stay for a day then they all disappear what we want to do is get these people coming and saying hey let 's stay longer this place is awesome these hot pools are the start of that it 's not the be-all and end-all for Brighton but it gets a kick started it gets things moving everybody then sees that hey something 's going to happen here this place is going to be fantastic again and such an amazing area I 'm actually really grateful that nothing much has happened in the Brighton area if I think if something had really been done in the 80s the area would have been ruined but now we 've got this environmental jewel as part of our city and I think it 's something that really needs to be there need we 've got the salt marshes we have the Trevis wetlands where I 've been told there are foods that don 't exist or all of anywhere else in the city we 've got the eastery of course which is absolutely beautiful and then of course we 've got the amazing coastline and I 've just got a new neighbor who 's come down from Napier and she runs a 60 beard hostel and Napier and her husband is and fiber optics and so he 's working down here with all the new wealthy voyagers I don 't understand it but so they 've moved down thinking of staying and she cannot get over how beautiful the beaches she said it as absolutely stunning and I said but you 've got a beautiful beach up and maybe she has nothing like this it 's nothing like this and I thought well they 've only been here a month and she really really appreciates it to the point that she 's thinking that they might actually put a hostel and New Brighton so I just think that 's fantastic yeah so I don 't know how much time we 've got left but I know that we need to let you guys ask us some stuff yep yep so what have you got well Godzilla get six minutes so I 'm Pauline gee that is exciting stuff and I love Brighton you 've got a doll as far as I 'm concerned what do you think would be an acceptable entry fee for these poles what do you think the locals would pay to go well we don 't_''_598.25 I suppose the thing is were at the point where we don 't know what the poles are we going to have you know 325 meter poles and some outdoor stuff we don 't know so I think we need the seed funding from you guys to get this to start hitting and then of course it 's going to have to be a business model laid out over it whether or not there 's going to be a private equity partner who wants to come in we don 't know so because of it it 's really hard to determine I mean I think it 's great that you know down in your Brighton we 've got the that a fattie school who do the 1 pool or as a 2 pool this summer you know if we 've only got a tiny hot sort of pulled in maybe we can 't charge much for it but if we 've got a complex like him now well then we 're talking about something different I think probably for me one of the biggest things that I think about is I really really want it to be covered so I think that will put the cost up because if we are coming from as if we have a very large high capital cost project and the entry fee may to exclude your bright and local people and I 'm but worried about that if I knew that takes an attitude that a lot of people have got that you brightens very low decile I don 't mean that at all but I mean that people from out of town and tourists could come and it might be preclude the whole exclude the whole questions you know I think there 's enormous that you can do like and hood a know it capsule we are if you can prove that you 're a right pair you get cheaper admission to the hem Nepal 's this is ways it means I have that we can work around making it a community resources you know you can sit aside certain times for communities everything 's cost relative it 's not just about new bright and locals it 's about Christchurch it 's about the South Island North Island our overseas visitors dragging everybody into our area it 's not just about map and letting him grow from that point and gleaned in ceará you 're a team just a questioner over the what this would mean for the area so I 'm trying to ask a question about what do you think that the kind of impact on community well-being might be so you and I will know what you know the area has been through so what do you think economic studies one thing it 's fine words like that but what about the actual social well-being what do you I think we 'll get the most enormous lift you know the people who live there they 've had a sense of disenfranchisement and being left and so I think that by by the council doing this project people will feel that yes we 're actually included in the city not excluded so thank you and can I just say but an amazing community brightness I mean we 've heard from the community board you know there 's 150 different community groups in the area the cannibal presentation of the day showed us that the great number of events and a month to the pier those kind of things so each league is a lot of really good stuff that you guys do out there which is absolutely excellent and really cool to see that this wasn 't just a petition but just the whole palace signatures with one thing at the top and the people had the space to write in it and that many of them took up took up the opportunity one thing that I did notice was there through that in Robbie 's coming to as well about council not doing anything in the area which was really interesting I 'm just wondering if council communicates to the community particularly well over things like qe2 and the eight million dollars that 's already working towards doing the whole waterfront up with the good playground that he 's a Peter Boyle pole and splash pad and the new playground all those free things that bring people in and where the people are actually aware that their work is actually happening because it seems to me that people think that this is the first thing the hot pops 's has been I mean the the playground and the way offal was signed off years and years ago hmm and nothing happened in you know when we started this petition it was only around that time that some signage went up about the playground actually starting to happen and and some of that attributed to DCL coming in and starting to get going that it has been a hell of a long time frame for anything seeing you know talked about and then actually being enacted I think there 's also sorry just to add to that um there 's a sense of inequity when it comes to Hannah Bryan 's treated and personally I 'm a real hater of the suburb versus suburb thing me too I don 't think it helps because anything that 's good for another community I 'm going to support whether I live there or not but it 's not actually very hard to look from one side of the eastery to the other and see the work that 's been done around the causeway it 's not hard to drive through another not hard to drive through other suburbs and see that there is no rubbish on their streets and the rubbish bins are emptied so um there is there is a reality that something is wrong and New Brighton and I 'm not sure if it 's due to a lack of council spending or how they that spending is allocated but um I would love the councillor to take you around you brighten any day of the week we can go in another there 's some vent hissed and coffee places but if you and I took a walk around your ward and then took a walk around my ward you would see differences um absolutely and it 's probably really what it comes down to okay follow up quickly whoa yeah it 's others that want question yeah Phil and I just want to ask you for state I Love New Brighton to my grandchildren lived there and it 's a very important place for me on Thursday we had a submitter who said look what do we put on a New Brighton please make sure that you have it 's Council we haven 't got one of them yet and out someone becoming we 're just wondering would you agree with that but in fact we have to make sure that in fact things are done right in New Brighton what kind of reports are you talking about I mean there 's been educating consultation for a very long shore you wanting so sort of so I guess like we 're very soon going to get Eve I guess that the finished report if you like or the review of the Tonkin and Taylor coastal hazard report there 's also a council staff are preparing a multi flooding report okay and that and I understand it knew where for example preparing it 's not far off as a report on tsunami so I 'm just but they 're the kind of I guess and coastal reports yeah thank you so um there 's a couple of aspects sort of course we have to have all the information but there 's also the fact that you know as a council you have a statutory obligation to provide for the level rises no one here is a denier but we know that that will happen in the next fifty seventy five hundred years there are those of us who are going to live out the rest of our lives in Brighton in statutorily you guys are required to give us facilities for look at the recreation and play and enjoyment of our community so maybe in you Brighton won 't be there for my great-great-great grandchildren but I sort of doubt it because I 've also been to university and learnt about coastal landforms and I know that we live on an accreting beach I know that our sin dunes are built because of the fact that why Meck continues to dump sediment on our Shore so yes absolutely there is challenges but there are challenges in every area look at flocked and basin you can mitigate that if there 's challenges to sea-level rise then you know there 's been a lot of work done in other areas perhaps over the other side of the history you know we 're just asking for equity yeah I think some of underground and yeah we know these we serve as you know say go down I can 't remember the actual cost of the pump station down Paige 's road because I didn 't go to the opening of it it 's not so exciting category burn on a pump station as it is on the other community seem to it is also just down the road you know I mean the the extent of the damage that 's been done on our city it is going to take time but I think that I think what you 're receiving from an indication in terms of the consultation document is that we put money on budget for a Legacy Project for New Brighton it wasn 't enough and so what we 're asking the people of Christchurch is can we put on more and that 's we hope you 'll say yes so thank you very much for coming on today and for we 're all were actually very grateful that you 've come as community leaders to present the whole petition on behalf of the community but we do have be heard as well so we 're going to invite them to come forward here and I thank Easter 's _"

    "text": "these two lemon yep I 'll try not to crush the system photos here to show you an afternoon or afternoon and I just wanted to talk to you about the Chevy stage at French farm you will recall it the freedom camping experiment at French farm came to an abrupt end last March March of last year when it was found that the public toilets have been discharging hundreds of thousands of litres of untreated waste into the bay and the areas remain closed to all camping since then the council upgraded this toilet block in 2008 to provide accessibility and it installed a campervan waste dump also at that time building consent conditions for that work required that the septic tank and disposal lives were to be checked for their suitability and continue to be monitored at two monthly intervals but it seems that in pursuing the that was worthy goal of accessibility council actually lost sight of the bigger picture and in response to my questions to the council I 've been advised that for the past five years the tank was emptied twice yearly it 's inspections of the system have ever been carried out it 's clear that the system was never fit for the task being asked of it in the condition of the disposal pipes was never checked not even post-quake the council has never apologized to the community for this negligence or taking any steps to rehabilitate the area and I 've had meetings with Andrew from traffic Andrew Hensley that is Kate from parks and reserves and Andrew tuna and to discuss a few simple things that might be done in the area but there 's been no results so if you look at the first photo and the second one that 's what happens every time there 's a little bit of rain so it would be nice if the hollows could be filled in so that doesn 't happen the signage there 's a proliferation of all sorts of signage there there 's a lot of commercial signage gone up on the corner opposite and the sign in the background they 're the original French farmer information sign as in a very shabby State so actually if you look the background just how it 's quite rotten and decayed and it would be good if we could have a new French farmer information sign for local businesses to use so that all that other signage that unpermitted signage that 's around the place could be removed and this picture was to show the camping signage that 's remained in place it 's become rather misleading in fact the direction they 're arrow that you can see at the bottom there the direction at that points which there 's no camping is actually you can actually camp in self-contained vehicles in that direction it 's the other direction that all Camping 's prohibited so that signs very out of date the NICS I 'm sorry that 's not a very clear photo but the arrow actually points in one direction whereas in fact camping is prohibited in both directions along that strip of the foreshore and the third one I 'd call spot the sign and that 's the sign advising that the area is closed for all camping but it 's actually pretty hard to find this burnt big to placate Clarkin quite some time ago you assured me you 'd get it fixed that 's from I don 't know people cocking their or something it 's pretty scruffy and there 's our accessible toilet block the doors are now shut with the couple of bits of scrappy plywood that was put in there after and following break-ins unto the toilet to keep the doors closed and certainly the portaloos that we have were at the moment they don 't provide accessibility for all users so the future we 'd like to know what the future is for that toilet block I spoke to our Hardy just a few days ago and he said that you 're expecting a report from Becker this week on the on the all of the toilet the similar facilities around Banks Peninsula to see what other problems might be lurking and just once they finally place plaid a few trees along the floor sure and I 'm sure that the local community would take responsibility for nurturing those does anyone have any questions Danny um thank you you 're the second person Betty made us aware of the ongoing maintenance issues um I just wanted to make you aware that we are getting a report into the maintenance it 's not just the peninsula there 's actually a citywide issue and we are trying to get it addressed but just in terms of the budget would you support us putting additional funding on so that these basic maintenance type things can get done well yes I mean I thought I 'd come and talk to you about this specific issue as an example of what we 're hearing in the media about the much the Union is obviously a lot of concern about the general state of maintenance from the city and Ecker are in everywhere generally I mean I took asked and asked and asked to get that you can get the area mode before Christmas last year the grass was about this high yeah so it something 's not the systems not really working yeah well I mean I realized that reinstating those toilets is not a not an easy fix I don 't know if you 'd be able money that they 've just announced try it 's not going to go very far when you 're trying to put in disposal waste disposal in rural areas it 's not easy I mean that the irony is and I mean this was the direct opposite of saying before that I you know say that I represent the city and the peninsula but if you were still the banks peninsula District Council you would have more access to that fund then as part of crushing silly so anyway that 's all right well it will face don 't forget that there is a community willing to help no meanness win I do feel that we can 't do not need to talk about all the different people that you talk to about all the different issues and I just think you should have a relationship with one person and and your purse and really yes I know and Andrew doesn 't let it roll you know but we did he 's got a perfect he 's got the is the only sort of kind of blood that their councils that cover such a wide area he does a tremendous job sorry and related I 'll let you take one and it 's just a request rather than a question actually and just following on from your dot and award which is bigger than the rest of the city put together represent which I normally use Jan can I ask you to forward to me by email those photographs that you 've shown this afternoon because there are some issues there that I 've raised before and that I know work is in trying to resolve and I know you refer to that from some of your conversations with staff as well and some of them are you know requests for service issues rather than annual plan issues despite I know what you 're raising is an overall maintenance issue which is an issue for the annual plan or long term plan but if there are some of those things that we can get sorted a lot faster than dealing with the Mo 's annual plan issue I 'd love to be able to do that yeah well I just thought its absolutely without of the fam so and we really appreciate the time that you 've given us thank you very much thank you for the perfect you know we 've had good feedback on it sir _"

    "text": "Jeffrey Holland um thank you that 's actually quite interesting to see this tuner that sort of shows that you at least due respect to the presenters which is more than you can say when you look at parliamentary TV for the people who look and maybe enjoy thank you for your time here I 'm I 'm here for two probably relatively small issues I want to keep it simple the two of them are the provincial council chambers and the old municipal buildings and the delay that 's been put upon the repairing of those and the other is the proposed sort of pull a New Brighton which yeah well speak there so basically really if you build a house it 's just a house it only becomes a home when you put people in so this is about people and it 's the very reason why buildings exist if it wasn 't for people you wouldn 't leave this place so I 've told my little tale about my involvement with these two buildings and I 'm sure there are hundreds of other citizens who have their fabric of Christchurch and have been for mmm longer than anybody here oh it 's not strongly suggest they are both visually stunning buildings well they could be if they will repair that it 's sad at the moment they have a rural history they have a real association with Christchurch and that old architects of the early eras and as I said in my submission they provide a wonderful counterpoint from the stunningly modern buildings that were getting now to where we came from that in the area that is very heavily populated by our citizens and by our tourists with the square the arts into the museum the gardens and we have these two really said hold structures in the middle I 'm saying please don 't delay the repair of these buildings give them back their people that they were built to house give them back their life ok that 's what I 'll say all right now the second one is the pool now notice when I was doing digging in your website for these sorts of things you do actually ask for suggestions about how will cost money have I got the money for you it 's sitting down on the third waiting to be turned into a saltwater pool at New Brighton I do have an attachment to New Brighton LeAnn knows very well what my attachment to New Brighton is okay I 'm Paul my neighbor and you 're not an idiot I 'm an SS but as a kid I was always at the beach I remember climbing over the old pier that used to be a New Brighton what well it was a skeleton of the old pier when I was a kid they 're always the beats both Nicky and I are old surf clubs we belong to the opposition from mr. East here but that 's right what he 'll be pleased to hear now that we 're living here we are his beaches near our most convenient Beach so we are his he um and prior to the earthquake event we did live in Bexley for some year so I do feel an association with the eastern suburbs we loved it in Bexley we fitted in the hospital was the lovely wee area but as now looking it really said we 've got friends and South Shore every time it 's raining and the tide comes in their garage floods you don 't need to look very hard on the internet to find maps of flood risk of tsunami risk of what will happen when the sea level rises it 's quite a disturbing picture that gets painted I know it a certain person and America will disagree with me but global warming is real sea levels will rise I find him quite disturbing the actual Detailers and this is what he keeps grasping as oral bed sciences that world we don 't know how much by wind yeah that 's a very complex system we don 't know but it will happen now my concern is that have we spend a number of millions of dollars on the facility and you brighten but we 'll have a I don 't know 50-year hundred year seventy and live spin kill two part was pushing 15 it was looking pretty good we need to I 'm asking you people a good look at we only Eastern Suburbs be twenty years fifty years perhaps even a hundred years and then where could we locate a facility that really does require quite a large catchment population to make it viable and then make the decision once you 've gone through that reasoning process of just what all the demands be for the lifespan of that facility yeah I 'm not saying don 't do it I 'm saying yes please do it but let 's make a fully informed decision and as I said money that we might save here in the short-term could certainly be spent just down the road there in the short-term so thank you very much thank you Jeff and I appreciate your time I just want repeat something I said earlier in relation to the the heritage buildings the provincial council chambers city municipal chambers our city audit are here sitting as another building and this category as well so the provincial council chambers is governed by statute so the city actually only is the the owner of it by dint of an act of parliament back to the early 1900s the there is a management process that sets in place under the statute and the land is owned by the Department of Conservation and of course it 's a it 's a category one heritage building nationally as well because it is the last one nationally yes but it 's not a city building the provincial building it belongs to the region so in terms of the additional funding that 's required to get it fully restored it seems to me that there is a far wider reach that we need to have in terms of of how we can pay for that over a longer period of time we 've had a submission earlier on today to say to focus on the wooden parts of the building which which I agree that that once you 've got the wooden parts up and running then you can move on I 've been talking to central government to Heritage New Zealand and others about the possibility of changing the legislation so that we can actually have a trust in place for some reason when a trust and we have had an approach where I 've had an approach from some private developers who who want us to who want to look at what the repair strategies and considerations around our city are as well and so council staff are sharing that information I mean it 's public information so that they can consider a proposition that they might put to us but we haven 't decided to go down this track I 'm just saying that we 've actually got to be smart about approaching some of these restoration projects they are very expensive but they also need wider public buy and they 're a great opportunity for telling the story of a great you know great elements of our history and you 're so right that you know that a building a house doesn 't make a home that 's the people that do and it 's the same with these buildings they don 't they don 't they don 't respect our history and this they 've got a current use so what we use them for today will be important so so that that it 's on the radar but we 're looking at other ways that we can we can fund their restoration rather than looking for another project to diminish just doesn 't election year so they might be possibilities Lee berries I thank you very much and look very good to see you you know and I can assure you that all the works being done on you Groton capacity and longevity and everything else too sure about the election we 've done okay yeah Jason to come here I see no really I don 't want to open an intersession around it today but thank you very much and thank you all very much because as a result of everyone 's attention we have finished on time and and so I 'm therefore going to adjourn the meeting until Saturday morning at 00 a.m. so Saturday morning 00 a.m. for another round of submissions a full day thank you thank you _"

    "text": "next is some Philip hey Thorne 's way good evening madam man um I put this submission in to you and may ladies and gentlemen with regard to the issue of our lovely city 's bus system and the work that we have to do to continue transferring people to it now the reason why you have the suggested list in front of you is because if you go round most of them you have a bus shelter on one side of the road such as say on North Haven Road but immediately opposite it at Delta there is a bus stop but there is no shelter going in the for the bus route in the opposite direction one thing has been proved to us time and again that the moment you have a shelter matching it on the opposite side of the road so that both sides of the road have a shelter servicing it the number of people using both bus stops goes up dramatically because what you have at the moment say using the one North Haven Road Delta as an example is that people say they shelter but if I come down from say marshland road to visit Delta and then go across the road there 's nothing to service me going back so it automatically encourages people to think otherwise and this is why you 've got most of these including for instance same number that the one listed has asked at marshland Road opposite um the council 's library on marshland Road there is one outside the library considering that people might go south but what about the residents to the north they have to cross the road and yet they can still be hit by the storm and have nothing to protect them and the same outside a lot of the education areas like educates and even Christchurch boys high school I 've been on the bus and said thank goodness when I 've seen the rate rain come down on them on both sides and I do feel it is about time to match them up where you have currently got one on the other side of the road classic proof of this has been when you put the one in in the Z garage the moment the one going in the opposite direction on the orange Route went in the use of both of them wisdom because people knew they had it going in both directions and this is where the fundamental of this madam chair goes to and although I 've left it saying that 303 Wooster Street I am of course now thinking of Herefords Street where you move route 62 and at that way we didn 't know this under D we did not move anything we don 't we don 't control the routes as you know no you don 't control the route but you do control the road surface as to where anything and everything goes you install the bus shelters yes I know but I didn 't move the route you move the route yes that 's right no we didn 't and so therefore he can move the route was for the cycle when you you chose to put the cycle way and thank you they did not sorry I did not choose to put the cycle way Council put chose to put route from one place to the other not even you own the road surface so we think and you own the footpath so madam chair what I 'm saying to you is come on if we as people who do not drive many people who do not they 're in their wheelchairs as well are all around the city they need the shelters on the footpaths for them to make good use of the service that is provided by ek and I think it is about the time that we do have decent money 's made available every year unlike of course when I spoke to Bob Park for a number of years ago it was only six per year and it was called up to 15 now surely we can make half a million available and do this as a decent job we owned the footpaths as the ratepayers of the council and he can yes puts in the routes but ultimately we surely pay for where these bus shelters go and it 's about time we got on and did the job to make it better for the of course who have a disability as well and that fundamentally madam is where this comes from the whole of this submission and while I am speaking to you just one thing would someone please sort the door out on the metro lounge in the going south in the accessible toilet in the metro and natural lounge that you own in the interchange yes no Rick Otton Road I 'm talking about oh right it 's an inward opening door into an accessible toilet how the hell are you to get to anybody if they were to fall and have a heart attack or out of their wheelchair against an inward opening door it 's totally illegal under the building acts as well I agree idiot chose to put that door in okay well I will take full responsibility I 'm a complete idiot and I 'm sorry so that 's the or time up I 'm sorry thank you thank you Jeffrey hot _"

    "text": "thank you hmm no no of me I just with with the changes to the inner city perhaps the performing arts precinct would be a bit of location for the specimen size we had black Commerce Mike what Google showed me was that a new public speakers corner opened in June 2013 which was on a corner foots jewelry band fury road which the thing is the thing is that that I think the idea the speaker 's corner came about when the wizard was you know at full fly and and he was a tourist attraction I mean so and I think it sends a bad message that you sort of shutting down speakers corner but on the other hand if it 's not policed and it 's not if it 's not actually delivering for the purpose that it was designed for then maybe we need to rethink whether Cathedral Square is actually the appropriate place I know that the great right okay I don 't know who you 're talking about so that 's fortunate for me now the next one is Lindsey Carse wall three one teacher and my subject some specialist we 're in economics and accounting so I have a Bachelor of Commerce degree from University of Canterbury I want to speak today about the council 's expenditure on HEC the Oval I 'm going to go back in time a little bit first of all I want to talk about a Memorandum of Understanding prior to the release of the blueprint July 2012 staff at Sarah produced a report for the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister entitled Cricket World Cup 2015 this is attachment 1 which I touched that 's not the full report its first three pages which are quite extreme part which reads point 12 is recognised the member end of Understanding between the City Council and cannery cricket the council has agreed to fund the development of the help field cricket block embankment and practice facilities this is now expected to cost three million dollars there is an inconsistency between Sarah staff reports in council staff advice council staff have advised me at an email dated 30 fact over 2015 memorandum understating between the council and Canterbury cricket was considered in this however this memorandum understanding was never executed and the Hagley oval development was included in the long term council community plan 2009 19 instead in a more recent email dated 10th May as previous of boys no Memorandum of Understanding exists between the council and the trust council expenditure at the meeting of the council 's Community Services Committee from 00 to the cember 2013 the committee resolved that they sought an urgent memorandum memo from staff on the financial costs of the Hagley oval development both capital and operating and that the committee seeks information from the acting chief executive on why the project has been approved without funding confirmation of the lights cetera cetera in response John Cazale recreation and sports unit manager provided information on the cost of the Haggerty development and this is intention to the full reports there but an extract from which is set up for low costs the expected capital cost the council of development including the repair and renewal of supporting infrastructure is three point six four million dollars this has been provided for through funds Council the set aside for more but first two there were an over an annual plan or in the long term community plan etc but there was another Mount Seir Avenue that 's seven hundred fifty nine thousand in his three hundred thousand capital governance Court and it all came to that figure deal three billion six hundred and sixty six thousand so on and it goes on the side the net operating costs to council his budget at the three hundred thousand per annum currently we are tracking to budget however the actual capital costs was four point eight six one million and the operating costs from 2014-15 year were five hundred nineteen thousand seven hundred eighty nine dollars catchment three I got for my McDonough request in 2015 although the cost in 2009 19 LT CCP plan and the 2012 2013 annual plan a clearly shown in the respective plans the other costs are buried deep in the accounts in a manner that makes both for counselors and public scrutiny impossible furthermore at the council meeting on 29th of August 2013 the resolution regarding the lease of Hagley Park enter the Kempe Cricket no further funds from the Christchurch City Council would be sought yet the council continues to spend rate payer money on Hague the able year after year an annual plan for 2017-18 tortured said it has proposed Hagley will delivery package 1.1 nine million dollars no information provided as to what is included in the celebrity package instead I have had to read the start of the 20th century from 2070 and to find a breakdown of the costs and there they are listed only problem is it 's a different figure it 's 1.5 million but also notice and that list is a sight screen which tender document from the council from attachment 4 and it 's dated closing date of 2015 2016 with some of these costs the expenditure has been completed in a prior financial period are those prior period costs they 'll to be retrospectively approved I 'd like to know that can council expenditure include an angle plan long-term plan and approved by the council but which is one displayed in the manner that does not allow for public scrutiny and to not disguised or with 29th of August 2013 Council resolution be considered have to be lawfully approved I recently wrote to the office of the Auditor General and asked the same questions a copy of the letter and her reply are attached as a testing 5 the recommendation I 'm going to make to you is that the council suspend all expenditure and agreeable both capital and operating until an independent inquiry has been held to determine a whether the expenditure to date has been lawfully approved and B whether a contractual relationship exists between the Christchurch City Council and the canopy cricket which provides the authority for the council 's ongoing expenditure on Hagley oval there are some items here we are not under than the lease or anything like that but I would like to have an inquiry into this that is my submission thank you thank you thank you Johnny you 've obviously done a lot of detailed research and nothing thank you for putting it all in and writing I think it might be useful if you could email a copy to the Secretariat so that we 've got write a full copy plus your document no no no oh it will actually if you 're emailing it shouldn 't be any cost to to run off the copy yep and your submission the this submission because this is not what you this is not what you see in turn you seem to just a short phrase this has got lots of detailed information yeah and we will certainly investigate these meters okay thank you very much thank you _"

on earlier so thank you for doing that so it 's three to six yes but I put her into the yes or no I 'm I 'll come back to I 'll go back into order three to six thank you thank you marry me he didn 't quite have the time to catch up because I was literally somewhere else when I got the call however thank you for hearing me if you don 't mind I 'm going to read read because otherwise you get it wrong and you go too long so I 've just got four issues I want to bring up please I know it 's most probably passed nevertheless I 'd like to say that I I do not support the retention of City care overall I think Christchurch City Holdings has been a great strategic advantage to our city in my opinion for such an importance long term for the city I did a count City care as any one of these strategic values that other enterprises have I recall because I was there at the debate when it was when it was formed and although it seems obvious that it should be lived to private enterprise I would like to recall for you what was said at the time and the words was were we must have City care to keep them private enterprise honest I don 't think that I would hope those attitudes are slightly different towards when printer prizes that 's an opinion about a man have one item of CC HL the next one was the defer of the arts precinct the detail of this precinct is is no doubt being altered as debates are clarified as to the results and timetable of the particular building and requirements are more become are becoming more understood however as its very existence will have great benefits and multiple advantages for the inner city 's return to a vibrant atmosphere I do hope that at no stage the council does be resolved as a reality in the inner city it needs full support of council after the earthquake earthquakes I will remember the joy literally joy and tears that I saw amongst other art veterans and concert goers as the verse enterprises the court theatre Orchestra and many others opened the arts and all their forms are critical to the spirit and individuality in the future of our city so I accept their a deferral debates you 're having but I 'm here to argue for the absolute singular importance of the Arts to the inner city this is about the community boards and I was very much there almost at the beginning and it has been a sad day as I watched over the past councils past councils not this one of course but past councils history that to support for the work of the community boards in my opinion has diminished I was there almost from the beginning when they had real work to do and a genuine local involvement with additional outcomes reflected the when additional outcomes reflected their interests it also had funding to backers and they really did genuinely excellent work there was always a desire to take them over by the inner city term street it was called in but I think that the local as in local is a very important part of the city I asked the question why his pepper nary Road Merrivale Prince prefer Avenue Road the Maryvale precinct society project work so disintegrated and in that little part they spent a lot of time and money a few years ago to make it attractive and they had trees and put the whole thing as a junkyard it 's full of weeds nobody 's attended to it so I don 't know who takes ownership for that very strong community project but those are the sorts of things that areas took up to make their part of the city better and I totally support hopefully that you 're your own council support for them is there and so I have just puffed up the stairs um no where 's the other fits the arts precinct Marcus 's place lower stick-up no success I 'm going to read this one and sorry every year I know I know I come every year because you it 's not done and it 's not done anyway it experiences I come for my son who lives this I 'm visiting out there and I see the land around it he 's not going to come with such persistence as me but that doesn 't take away from the really terrible problem it exists at ESI let me write great readers it is frequently flooding it 's just flooded all over again all his land and his rose roadway when we had their Easter the Easter storms and heightened flow events the six river you address with my son 's property I don 't know it 's there 's 44 it 's 62 B Turner 's Road there is a constant number of issues relating to the inundation and vegetation along the river banks including the impact of the collapsed and dead Willett willows your your mantra trampled our boat goes along it just goes narrow down the center it doesn 't look to left or right to see just how bad it is and have acknowledged post earthquake issues with the sticks River catchment with much of the land within its catchment subsiding which has considerably increased the flood risks risk to the adjacent properties and I talked for all the properties when I say this it has also been identified that the bank of the river are the banks of the river are densely covered with weeds and collapsed dead trees which restrict the draining of the waters leaving the ground boggy with a very unpleasant smell the weed and the broken matter requires far greater regular maintenance and renewal to allow the water to drain it 's not just to accept the report that the dredger has done his job maybe once a year possibly twice here it 's far more than that and it needs looking at and the poor residents face this over and over again and look how good the upper up sticks is so why can 't the lowest it get a similar service and one last thing community would defer I said all that up spit all for him now yes you hear okay all right is the fire just beyond but look Thank You Barbara and I 'm pretty sure that will look for some or certainly some feedback on on the property down there at the lowest rates because I mean I have ever heard you make this plea and and you 've spoken very positively about the ability to come along and make the plea so I think this time it should be well I think you find it i 'm just doing for everybody i know you because they don 't necessarily know the system that

    "text": "the next is I 've got the next is Diana McCoy is Diana here oh thank you come forward Robin Robinson was no longer wishes to be heard so page three one four okay my name is Diana McCoy and I have lived in the Barrington Street Mall area for over ten years and I have become increasingly concerned during that time for the safety of the pedestrians and the cyclists and the people who are disabled or have slow walkers trying to get into them all the pedestrians when they better explain the spray-tan library is right next door to the exit onto Barrington Street and when the people leave their library which is very popular and try to get across the area where the mall exit and entrances they have to go about eight meters across a turning in Lane and a straighter here to tuning out Lane now combined with them trying to get across to the safety pod or barrier in the middle of this space they have to keep an eye behind them for traffic turning sharp left into the mall plus looked right to plus keep an eye on the traffic that are turning right in front of them and going across the traffic to go west towards town it 's really difficult they have to really scurry across to the safety area in the middle of this space then once they get there they 've got a further five meters to get across to the other side of the footpath we 're left turning traffic is coming out trucks tuning into the mall have a very difficult job as well because of the way the footpath is made there is a light standard right at the edge of the footpath and that means they 've got to make a 45-degree tune into the mall and of course most delivery trucks are small but there 's someone some of them have a longer double of what slew truck trailer and they have to because of the sharp tuned slide sometimes over into the right-hand exit lane trying to get enough space to get around cyclists also have great difficulty with this particular exit and entrance because for some unknown reason to me anyway the stops just below the library and they have to merge into the traffic and at the peak time when the traffickers nose-to-tail they have to navigate between them and the car parks on the side of the road where they have the danger of car doors opening and then when they get to this exit and entrance they have to watch for both cars turning sharp left into the mall and then the traffic turning right across it because there are actually four movements of traffic in this particular area and I cannot see the point of it you 've got to N you 've got left tuning in from the same side right tuning in across the road you 've got right tuning out across the traffic to go the opposite way and left tuning out of the traffic as well disabled people won 't use it I have a friend who is disabled and she refuses to go up that side of the road should run far rather go up cross 40 junctions on the opposite side of the road to get to a pedestrian light controlled crossing the orbiter has a very popular form of transport for many of the our local people and they also have to negotiate these three lanes of traffic whilst looking at four worklists because their bus stop is literally out after the exit and entrance section of the road and once they have dropped their passengers off and then try to pull out into the traffic again they have to again and negotiate this lift turning traffic on the street ahead traffic and they have to squeeze between them and the traffic waiting in the middle of the road to turn right so what I 'm asking you is do we have to have an accidental death or an injury before the simple matter can be straightened out it only takes two my common seats way of looking at it to say stop turning right out of the mall and I cannot understand why you haven 't put something and this year 's plan to allow this to happen so I 'm asking you please can you find some money to fix this before someone is killed look not only did with a very direct and clear explanation of the issues that you 're challenged with I have to say Phil clear water raises it constantly yeah but thank you very much for taking the time to make the submission it does make a difference so we 're glad you 're turned up you 've turned up you 've reinforced something that has been raised with us and certainly the community boards very aware of it as well and I know the area very well and it 's a dreadful dreadful right hand too and so I wouldn 't I would never attempt it I would always go around the back of the mall well I feel very sorry for the large proportion of our populations and his elderly people and they just in Antonelli cannot walk fast yes and mothers with prams have the most horrendous job getting across their dentist 's section from the library yeah no it 's a really strong point so thank you very clear your time thank you and _"

    "text": "Canterbury swim school Jennifer Jones and who am Makara welcome welcome good evening counter in good evening you read the owners of carries from school a private pool which is also open to the public and it 's in the home beyond the old host area operating since 2013 we 'd like to save I start by saying that water safety is an important issue and we welcome the council 's desire to address it we 've got several concerns regarding the draft however firstly the free swimming lessons for those who find costs a barrier how will counsel determine who these people are secondly and we find the quoted figure of the drop and revenue of 50,000 to be quite extraordinary the numbers of council learned to swim customers is not provided so we 've had to make a best guess east of it based on our own industry knowledge assuming that a thousand children per week er at each of councils three main pools this would generate one point five three six million dollars in revenue so even if the attendance numbers are in curry council charges twelve accurate it equates just ninety eight children per two or four thousand lessons annually so the media hype surrounding this aspect of the draft proposal appears to us to be something of a PR stunt which will benefit very few children annually if this figure which has been widely circulated in the media is indeed misleading or inaccurate then the submission process would have to recommence with the correct figures being published thirdly Christchurch City Council was largest supplier of Linda 's WOM reasons in the city it has a huge market share and advantage ever implemented this process would see council establishing itself with an unfair commercial advantage over other service providers under this proposal council has said it would levy ratepayers rates are not an avenue available to other businesses so it would create an unequal playing field with competitors have got no opportunity or power to match that private providers have been we 've invested substantial funds into our operations we provide a valuable service to the local community employee significant numbers of staff and our livelihoods would be at risk we 're ratepayers too and would be paying rates towards funding the scheme and again by being placed at a commercially unfair disadvantage buyer the proposal we think contravenes the Commerce Act which states large businesses cannot take advantage of their market power to prevent others from competing effectively the Act also states businesses cannot enter under contracts that have and the effect have an effect of substantially listening competition in the market in an opinion piece and the priests on April the 11th might yeardley refers to the plethora of non council run pools which includes apart from ourselves Dalton 's equation many swim McMillen 's bumblebees kings and for anui and ask the question is the council trying to drive them out of business our understanding is that councils current aquatic facilities combined annual operating losses cost the ratepayer eight point five seven million dollars councils plans to build the new brighton saltwater pools a horn beep all of then would pull the new qe2 pool come at a cost of 99.1 million dollars on top of this as a mammoth cost of the metro sports facility these are huge costs and why would with this draft proposal as business owners we have to ask who is the fiscal responsibility the question also needs to be asked what is counsel trying to achieve with this proposal in its future proposed projects the stated aims seem to be in two parts one the council wants to make its recreation facilities more accessible and two to improve access to those who find costs a barrier the first would indicate that council might not be satisfied whether its current level of patronage and given the plans to build all these new facilities one would naturally be led to the assumption that they 're being built supposedly to meet an increasing demand as the existing facilities are full to bursting but if the current facilities are running at a loss surely this can 't_''_310.46 be the case if the numbers are us insufficient wise counsel contemplating building more or running programs guaranteed to run at a loss based on the available information the draft proposal means to lose a further nine hundred and twenty six and a half thousand dollars on top of its already eight point five if however the true goal is the second part and it 's to encourage lower-income Christchurch ratepayers to learn to swim then it should be no of no consequence where such services are excess there 's no reason why private providers couldn 't be included and allow the ratepayers choice this may also be a way to overcome any commerce act that shows as it would offer a level playing field to all providers the broadening would alleviate any concerns of potential damage to businesses and the livelihoods of some school owners employees contractors suppliers and those providing other services to the industry lastly if council is really serious about addressing water safety offering free swim entry and 2.00 family days really won 't cut it we 've run free swim and discount bays ourselves and our experiences that they just simply played on there 's no water safety message or teaching of skills involved but we believe there 's some really good opportunity is already suggested counsel could include private pool providers and the same manners as it provided provides for itself subsidize them and thus reach more children is how to target those genuinely needing assistance with the cost of lessons and wanting to learn to swim as opposed to those that are just looking for a freebie simply because they can and without any desire to learn to swim we believe that the council has a viable solution already in place with the Kiwi sport program the Kiwi sport program is a funding program which subsidizes school lessons based on the distance of local primary schools from the nearest service provider the scheme is run by water safety New Zealand in conjunction with a number of other flat part funding partners including Council and as administered local by councils lender swim arm currently this program targets disel one to six schools in students in years three to six students receive funding between 12 and 36 dollars for a block of ten lessons councils budget of 50,000 would be better spent by expanding this program to include years 1 to 8 targeting the lower decile schools as a most obvious way to assess children genuinely in need providers chargeable right to schools of less than half the cost many children is the current draft proposal council would then be addressing the huge disparity and swimming ability and water conference that experience shows us exists right across the board between the higher and the lower decile schools we would strongly recommend that council consider the merits of expending the Kiwi sport program and that we 've given you a handout the other latest information that 's been provided by council is here for you to read some of the dates in the school years have had to be altered to reflect the current funding below that was last handed out to us 2015 so I 've done a bit of a Twinkie out and put 2017 thank you thank you that is that 's incredibly helpful I have to say that I hadn 't realized that we were funding Kiwi sport already before he 's your submission so that it 's an incredibly helpful submission so thank you for that I 'm Sarah thank you and I think I 'm Dallas from Zidane 's mentioned it was the funding that they get the two week the two week box 's submission area from Sandeen school so 110 students that they have they only have three who have swimming lessons externally currently and of the year seven eight students I think there is it about a three hit with life jackets and when they weaned I like on at school came from those kind of things so I don 't think that having extra exists for those children would be in competition to you because they currently can 't access through your services anyway I was just wondering if if there was a way if you could think of a way that your services or others in the area could be provided for longer than those two weeks and we have this capacity in those private providers at the moment for doing that kind of thing my impression so far the ones are the Lynwood area is that they are still almost at capacity for their swimming lessons so we 're not a capacitor we do to have some schools that come to us for more than the fortnight blocks of swimming lessons and it 's up to the school the lower decile schools do and there 's some they do other funding themselves and they may choose to come for more than one block of ten lessons Delos was saying that it costs than 300 a day just to get the bus plus the extra time that 's taken out of the schools learning the the children 's learning cause it takes a half-day agh listen to bustin their weight do the listening pass beg well the Kiwi support funding it so on like recede on the nearest service provider so if then they can choose with it it 's a council run facility or a private facility and if they choose to go past the nearest service provider to another facility because they may prefer it then they still only get the funding to the nearest service provider I mean we have a school that walks across the road to us and they get 12 a child for the block of lessons just for walking across the road and so others through hip to higher the buses and there is the expense do you also see and the go on a while I know you do yeah yeah it 's been a there 's one last quick girls don 't are soft on you yeah I know other people have gone over ten minutes no no yeah he 's gonna give me a sweat down a fought it yours but it 's true okay my Yanni yes and it doesn 't mean I 'm good the benefit you the benefit and that learning to get used to water and be familiar with water prior to swimming lessons or the formal sort of water safety stuff is their benefit on that as well the recreational type swimming in the being familiar with that in practicing your skills as you 're learning absolutely because children all ended up different rate and you can 't teach someone to learn to swim that 's not really to learn to swim and so part some of the children that we do get they 're coming and they 're not ready to learn to swim so we have to do that and another other ways to introduce them to that so there is some about over here is that you provided some additional information on your oral submission then what you provided in your Britain and would it be possible to email what you have seed through to the Secretariat so that we could get a copy of it on and to our submissions pack yeah of course over there okay yeah that would be very helpful Thank you very if that 's easy just leave a hardcopy here and we can get it and put onto the hub I was with paperless you know thank you to you yeah that 's great thank you very much _"

    "text": "there 's my community housing trust Braley Cain and Rodney Rutledge oh you 're not Rodney no Ginny she is connected I know we 're even isn 't like Rodney apologizes I 'm really pain this this submission will be short because it really is very much connected to the submission that was made of beta fatty Roy matter it 's the same area it 's the same material what 's specific about the separate submission is that it 's drills down into the housing issue and I just want to and I think in some ways the solutions are the same but so the letter mer Community Housing Trust for those of you that don 't know is a very small housing project that 's looking to build housing for low-income people and the and we have land and Barbados Street that we 're trying to do that on it started off it it 's in some ways a response to the loss of the beads that houses and the inner city East and it 's been supported by the council through the community capital endowment fund and very recently we 've started to work with to Puni Kokiri who were looking at some specific solutions for the very large number of rough sleeping Maori men in our community we estimate there 's around seventy to eighty at any time so and we see that as an aspect of the whole issue of affordable and low cost housing not just an area but very particularly in the inner city East and we do want to distinguish that from the proliferation of social housing that is also happening in the area because we see this also as a complicating thing it looks like there is a housing response and the inner city East button the people living in those complexes have come through the sousing the social housing pathway and are not from the area so it 's not housing for the area the other thing about that that is something of an issue that while the people are welcome and the regeneration is welcome the services have not followed them so it 's adding to the load for social services in the area what we want to say about to be a more holistic viewing and solution to this and I think perhaps it 's embedded and what 's been suggested that the community our community work with hopefully Council and taking some leadership on that and getting a bigger viewing of the housing issue not just the street people not just the new housing but it 's all part of a continuum and a complexity the homeless community are attracted to the area it 's a tradition that they come to this area historically there was availability of the cheap bid suits even though they no longer there it was an established group there that they can hang out with which means there is alcohol and drugs available and it has proximity to services of course the City Mission and Tafari Roy Mata but the support that is available is insufficient and it lacks resources so we want to see and be part of as a community and as a housing trust a more multi-agency solution to this we would like to see a drop-in facility that Ginny put into her submission where there can be some daytime of our discussions that we 're having for tabula Calgary with homeless people we submit that we we think that this would be a very effective thing for council to initiate and boats they do all the work but initiate we acknowledge that the city mission works in this area but their focus is citywide and we 're talking about this particular area we also think there needs to be a part of this discussion can be supportive the residents that have moved into the new housing areas many of whom have complex social needs and many of those not many but some of those housing complexes are already proving problematic but in their very design and for the people that live in them there 's some for example that are not properly insulated and that 's noise going between ground floor it 's creating a lot of community tension part of it of course is also the regeneration of the village that was talked about in Jenni 's submission and I 'm very heartened by the idea that there be some sort of joint effort a partnership with Council our submission is that housing is a critical part of it and that 's all for ministers beer very good and questions Andrew your own commentary on social housing is interesting and certainly the comment that you know social housing fulfills its need but brings different people into the area and new people into the area rather than necessarily catering for the people who see that area as their part of town as home as a community they 're part of do you think that means that there 's a need to look at different types of social housing or perhaps a different type of placement policy to to ensure that those needs are able to be met through social housing what we do yes we do I think you know I think both of those things could happen if at the moment it feels to us like there is a particular pathway that guides people into the social housing that 's built well so I think that could be a number a much wider look at it I do think that I wonder if we could just say that who are not on good quality housing but don 't qualify for social housing because they seem to be house and I guess the type of housing that the Latimer Community Housing Trust is promoting is quality energy efficient housing for displaced people rehousing local people which is slightly different from the emphasis of some of the social housing work that 's going on Phil tnks ready I am one group who you 've referred to as who are displaced among the people other single mean I 'm just wondering is that sort of a group who of who needs some social housing and have some special needs and maybe need to be catered for in a special way I just wonder what your views of them some of them I think it 's fair to say Phil that the work that our like Jamie and myself and others have been doing around it it 's very clear that there 's a raft of of needs and that one size fits all won 't work and we 're talking about from people who are chronic or active addiction through to it 's how you support and we were you know we 're talking sometimes about the retail kind of concept that Ray is going to run on through to truth to housing or it could be that it 's the drop-in because for some it 's a choice you know it 's that bitsa preference and we need a variety of options yeah a database yeah there was a Erin yeah I see a potential issue coming up for the whole area as there 's a bit of a gentrification coming on and there 's probably going to be a whole lot of billboards got pretty soon selling really nice apartments and buy leather masks we 're through the Eastern Bloc and often in cities as the value of the city goes up the poorer areas or the ones that perceived to be the for the ones that are next up for redevelopment and Nick close the anus idiots either the east and a city east or in and around Sydenham and it 's kind of put a lot of pressure on those places how do you see the two you can 't deal with housing without also dealing with city planner shoes and we talked we looked at some of the American tight responses we 're developments must ensure that there 's always low-cost housing a percentage of each development or that you that you make certain that that is maintained and that you also look because the reality is that a lot of low-cost housing it 's not in the interest of developers that you know they 're not going to get the cost and that 's where we do need to have other varieties of ways of responding loan money if you look at the states there 's a lot of money that 's available philanthropic type money for groups like us to be able to be part and it 's the type of thing I think New Zealand 's got to be able to begin to start looking at now we got freeing we got we get it the status getting out of providing in that way you 've been a provider of housing so have you looked to become potentially one of those models and because I saw one in San Francisco where they 've done exactly that because of those problems and the peninsula just cut its 1.1 million people and did like quarter of the size of Christchurch they have to do what you say but the men because they 're there they exist and they 've always been there and have served you look to partner like that it will become a larger provider we 've had if do I say it quite a number of years of getting to this point and it would be our long-term drain that we get one complex and then we 're able to leveraging is another complex that would you know and look at other ways I mean dear there 's some brilliant things we reviewed recently in the states are doing that would be wonderful to look at this extremely difficult to become a a charitable trust developer maybe maybe you need to look for partners is the way to go and that regard but um thank you very much for your contribution to the discussion on the annual plan much appreciated thank you _"

    "text": "Ian Lochhead I 'm sure you could have can represented an organization and given yourself ten minutes but thank you for the fire I 'm really representing myself but my engagement with the provincial council buildings goes back to 1981 when I was made the City Council 's representative on the Canterbury provincial councils building board before the various changes to the administration of the buildings I 'm sure I don 't need to remind councillors that this is one of New Zealand 's most significant heritage buildings and it 's an internationally significant example of Gothic Revival architecture but what I want to emphasize is that the timber sections of the building along our Mar Street and Durham Street and the two towers our work that can be commenced almost straightaway the design work is complete the engineering work is complete it just needs the funding to be made available and the expectation was that that was going to happen I think it 's really important that we get on particularly with those timber sections because the longer those buildings set closed up the more deterioration that will occur made watertight it 's just the damp the cold the lack of air circulating through the building is going to cause deterioration according to the press several years ago the details are in my written submission or there 's 35 million of insurance money for the provincial buildings and it would be unthinkable if the around 30 million that should still be available after the the stabilization work is not spent on those buildings additionally does two and a half million in the Prime Minister 's fund that has been sitting there for some considerable time I would suggest that the only way to make sure that that money actually comes to the buildings is to get on with the work because my investigations with the ministry of culture and heritage suggest that they are really keen to have that fun wound up but what I want to stress is that doing work on this section of the buildings will actually facilitate the fundraising for the rest of the buildings the new convention center is right across from the provincial council buildings I think it 's critical that this part center because we simply don 't know who the big international funders for the more difficult phase on the stone chamber on the Bellamy 's are going to come from and I think we want to create a situation where every visitor to the convention center has the potential to visit the provincial council buildings this may see pie in the sky in terms of a building that is undergoing restoration but this is something that is increasingly being done internationally with heritage buildings that are being restored the National Trust in the UK has just committed to the restoration of Clendon Park that was completely gutted by fire two years ago and they have stated that they 're going to have it open to visitors right throughout the restoration project at the National Trust can do it I 'm sure Christchurch can do it as well and so in essence I think it 's really important for the health of that Timbers section of the buildings to get on with that work to put the funding into next year 's budget or the coming years budget I should say in terms of generating funding for the completion of the stone chamber and the Bellamy 's I just will make one comment I mean you 're absolutely right about how much the complex was insured for but whether you can say that that is what we got for it given that we had a global settlement to the slightly different things we did receive the grant from the Ministry of Culture and heritage and the Canterbury Earthquake fund and that money is sitting available one of the things that I 've been exploring is the nature of the ownership because as you mentioned there 's a nationally significant voting it has the only provincial council chambers left in the entire country so that makes it a nationally significant building it sits on dockland of Department of Conservation land so we don 't own the land we 're responsible for the building due to statute but it is a regional it 's a provincial building with national status so and I always felt that from a fundraising point of view because there is additional funding required that it would be better that would enable them to to fundraise for it so that 's something that I 've been exploring but it does require an amendment to the Act and that has something I 've spoken to both the Heritage New Zealand and and I 've mentioned it to the government and it 's just early stages but you 're quite right that its location to the convention centre is what creates an opportunity but also the need for some impetus but every time a private-sector developer gets involved with or a private sector or a trust as developing the costs of development are much lower than they are for a council and I haven 't quite worked out why that continues to happen but it does that 's almost as if there 's a local government or central government top-up that gets added to every every tender that ever goes out so I want to be able to spend as much on that building because it 's precious not just locally but nationally as well well thank you I mean I think it would be William available if a trust was to work for it to be able to get people into the buildings and I think if you deal with the timber sections yeah that would did the trust a position to move forward form rather than setting them up with what I think would seem an almost impossible task yeah but as I say it requires a statutory response but as I say we 've got a we 've got a new Minister for Christchurch you know Greater Christchurch regeneration and it might be something that we can get on the table so thank you very much for your submission that is a precious part of our history _"

other capacity but today I 'm Clara from Stapleton 's Road I always try and make that distinction I 'm not here to ask you for more money or any monuments I don 't want sewing pool or library any of that stuff so hopefully this will be quite easy for you in previous and I throw away all the stuff I 've done because in previous years I 've done photographs and details and showing all the damage and the only thing I managed to do was get Saudi to recognize that scoot went paying for footpaths and that didn 't actually do mean he couldn 't our area anyway the latest ITU meeting had a scheduled five pages of it all from footpath in roading repairs there 's not a single entry in there for the Northwest Richmond neighborhood now I know this has put forward for you based upon work done by was nothing there in the latest annual plan luckily there 's five roads and possibly if it got passed the other day at ite six roads that have been put forward for renewal but they 've all been pushed out so far that it 's not possible for somebody like me to see them so there are three years out in the engl planted so they 're in the annual plan that they 've been pushed out so I can see will save on Road consultation last year said that we were going to have construction in February now unfortunately I have to go and see my doctor more often I wish to and he 's got it his premises on North Haven Road and every time I go he says to me what 's happening with the road and I have to say I don 't know and none of the residents know because we haven 't been told and I was invited to the pepperiness community board meeting about the annual plan and I went along and I talked about some of the we have and I saw because it didn 't say much but then I saw the cheer present to you on Tuesday night and she said here 's a neighborhood there 's lost a great deal gained very little has broken roads broken footpaths I did privation and elected members should advocate for residents and I thought that 's when I threw away all the slides I had I thought that 's great she 's saying that as a community board they 're recognizing that we 've lost a lot we 've gained little we 've got broken roads and footpaths and we have a high rate of deprivation so we 're not the East I think we 're the tweeners if you hike because we 're stuck in an area that doesn 't mean to get categorized and doesn 't get discussed when have you say came out there 's a lot of emphasis on that but we were busted at the time I actually went but very few people in area would have gone and my little bit about fixing our neighborhood probably got lost in the back of another sticky all we need regeneration we don 't even need social activity or any of those things we just want the basic infrastructure rebuilt for us I 'm going to top that off we 've got the Dudley Creek flood remediation now their original report said that the option going through our neighborhood had the highest social impact of all the options that were put forward to date there 's no obvious sign of any mitigation of that social impact there 's a huge daily impact on the people that live in our area people who can 't sell their houses because they 're blocked off and fenced off this dust noise there 's no pedestrian access you saved um Petrie Park for us but we can 't walk to the damn thing just recently Stapleton 's Road got opened and they said I will be back in eight weeks to start work on the culvert again so all of those people have all of this fencing and everything the areas while the streets left open to provide an alternative access while north parades closed and I suspect I suggest that I pick be more than eight weeks because they 've already used one of those weeks it 's got a fairly high impact on the local daycare there the sheet piling right outside and as difficulty with access and parents are already taking their children away from there my granddaughter has gone to another one and she said to me on Monday will you one have roadworks pop and I was pleased to be able to say no it won 't_''_311.15 the effect on the children is significant I personally believe that they Tia seem to may not survive this morning I hope the mere talk about compromise so I was listening um although I had my other hat on I 'd have to say so I 'm not sure with the dividing line as they 're but it 's been like that since EQ see it 's always been we 've been making compromises somewhere along the line it 's for the greater good you don 't want more money we just want you to move a bit of it into our neighborhood in a timely fashion we 've been broken want you to do is make a significant change that has absolutely no cost on it at all what it want you to consider creating our culture of care of social responsibility with the integrity and passion actually mean people not Goble at a gate on delivering something there 's no integrity and passion and barging on through to create a new desk but if you can look after the people while you build the disk that 's integrity that 's passion and it 's compassion and so that 's what I 'd like to think that you as elected members can do that you can influence the culture of the organization to do that and to put people first and actually help neighbourhoods grow and go back to where they were so all I 'm asking is for our area into some form of acceptable normal and that 's really all I 'm asking Pauline Q um I do feel for you Lily you know it 's upsetting Clarion thank you for talking to us so frankly as if you say that most of the works through the year the northern relief sewer another sewer weeks but they 've been following they just follow on and I think it 's fair to say that your area around there is not the area that will benefit from those works either it 's more of the so I can understand how you feel but those works are due to be completed in June so two years on time and on budget we just got a newsletter saying that they will start working again on the culvert in eight weeks time that goes out beyond June where 's to start this and Orban 's culvert on Stapleton 's Road so somewhere there there 's some misinformation oh that 's interesting and so I 'm sorry about that um the other thing is that when we talk to staff about communications they are very reassuring that there 's a high level of leaflet dropping and door-knocking and in communications particularly with preschool that you were talking about so I just get a bit of a disconnect on what you 're saying and what I think that 's why I asked as an organization can talk to local people and they can tell them how it 's going to be but if they 're not doing true consultation or if they 're not taking into account that the level at which some of those people operate in other words do they have the ability to fully process the information and the ramifications of what 's being put in front of them so I can go along and say the go look it 's all explained it 's wonderful but they don 't necessarily understand what that means or the ramifications of it and I think as I said I think it 's the caring part of it so what would be I mean you 've got two issues here one of them that 's that the work is going on for too long but in thank the Suburbans culvert and all respect is actually not part of the main dudley it 's actually part of the tributary that goes in so you 've got either an option of condensing the work down and getting it done and getting out or dragging it on even want do you want more community meetings a few timelines or one I think if they slowed the program down so to not hit a deadline that 's somewhat arbitrary then they could have freed up more road space and had fewer roads closed and impacted on Lisa I know we often hear about didn 't do it fast and get out but this is so big that by going and going fast it effectively shuts everything down so if Randall Street for example had been finished all the way up to North parade before they closed north parade in places like the daycare would have a Randall Street as an access but it isn 't that way and so that work on that continues while they open that one there while they close this one here while that one there 's still already closed you only have to try and drive to somewhere within that neighborhood we 've got a notice that said Stapleton 's road was open so I thought oh about the northern end I 've got three quarters of the way up to find a road just closed yeah I know that area well because if I take a car then that I usually slip round that way and down to New Brighton Road turn right at the palms and and flick em for home to Lakewood Drive but it 's not that 's not I 'm just trying to get what are the boundaries of your area sort of women North Haven Road north parade Shirley Road and Hills Road right okay I 've got up yeah so then there is a huge impact in the unit as a moveable feast isn 't every day it 's different I died really understand that but well there 's three programs of work that go on there that is the scope program it 's the land drainage recovery program it 's our own you know footpaths and street ano so look I mean with I 'm sorry but the ten minutes is it was up before you put up your hand Yanni so I 'm just not don 't mean to take that as we look and but but I mean we 'll have a good look to have a very specific communication with your area about all of the projects that are going on in the area because I think I 'm getting the sense that if it 's not one thing it 's the other and then it 's the combination of closures that effects I mean I just stay away from that area at the moment I know exactly what you 're talking about sorry losing your aspirated food okay all right thank you thank you yes we 'll get a look I think a joined up communication for that whole area would be would help us all get on the same page anyway in _"

    "text": "and the last one before a quick bright yeah we 're pretty much off back in time take sorry Roy I 'm out of trust Jenny Smith welcome we thank you for this opportunity today of coming I 'm Ginny Smith from Fadi Roy Mata and my colleague Jamie Stevenson is going to share in the presentation but I guess we 're going to say put simply we are here today to say we believe it is now time for the inner city east Lynwood neighborhoods to receive this year of regeneration attention and on this month we shall make the case for why we think this is so in how we believe this can be done we 're going to begin by giving you a snapshot of this vibrant diverse colorful supportive neighborhood it is long provided the city with important low cost housing for single people on limited incomes which is sandwiched between the central city and the suburbs and is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Christchurch dating back to the early European settlement days I 'm going to hand it over to Jamie to take us oh then I thought the couple and so I 'll stone by as Jenny said just giving a bit more background of the neighborhood starting sort of with some of the challenges that are facing the neighborhood so this is an area that regularly rates around 00 to 00 on the New Zealand social deprivation index and it also has a low level of homeownership around 19% compared to 65% citywide and as Jenny said that reflects the history of it as a place that offers low-income housing offers affordable housing for people on low incomes particularly single people it 's also an area that 's been badly affected by the earthquakes and much of that affordable housing has been lost along with businesses and the displacement of a lot of longtime community members however we know that this is a really diverse community a resourceful community and one that is connected and has strong foundations so I 'm just going to talk a little bit about in in 2000 2017 just the start of this year along with this with support from the Linwood central Heath kits commune be survey of local residents and I 'm just going to talk a little bit about some of the themes that came up and we 've also got some information we 'll hand around to you as well more information about that survey so bear with me not being a technological person myself mmm so just some what came up in the in the surveys was that this is a strong community it 's a community full of friendly people people who say hi in the street but it 's still suffering from the ongoing effects of the earthquakes there 's been a loss of a great loss of affordable housing and loss of houses with character there 's been a move towards more expensive and more dense housing with little outdoor space in an area that has fused green spaces and public parks there 's a growing feeling of neglect and growing tensions related to poverty and social inequality worries about the changing character of the area there are also lots of thoughts about businesses in the Lynwood Village area that it 's still in transition six years on from what 's sitting vacant their concerns about rubbish on the roads and in public spaces there 's also a strong motivation amongst the community it 's a unique community community of people who look after each other and care about each other and I 'm motivated to improve their area it 's a place that people love to live and we just want to say we think it 's time thank you to me so in spite of it being a high deprivation area it 's a strong commuter community where residents enjoy live anthea in whole positive views about its area it 's seen considerable in this month from social service agencies that have been there for many many years as Jamie said the quakes have done a lot of damage a lot of the affordable single housing stocks gone the shots at the Lynwood arm village in the little corner shops have also gone in as Jamie said a lot of this is largely gone under the radar of authorities and six years on the little Linwood village key service have gone no thanks no huge research no 's run by a community organization that 's heavily reliant on volunteers in several transitional projects with no guarantees of permanence the bead sets that once with ear are boarded up in is Jamie seed a growing number of people who are living rough on the streets or in dealer buildings it 's clear to us that the Marketplace on its own cannot have provide for this important community and years to come will only result in uneven development and we suspect will most likely benefit the more advantaged while there is a master plan just like there is to Sydenham it to doesn 't have the teeth to address the underlying issues that are impacting on the village or the wider andesitic east community in light of the fact that this is a strong connected neighborhood with deep roots in one of the few remaining communities where low-income people feel at home especially the older single people we believe that it 's worthy of in this month say to you that is time for the neglect of the inner city to stop just like other communities have had their city East to announce admission we put forward to you ways that we think can come about bringing change the key we believe is a bottom-up community led revitalization plan that enables key players to come to the table with the necessary resources to implement the responses that are needed in which the community has already begun to identify we also say to you we are needing the strategic purchase of land Stan will Road by the council to create a community economic hub lift on it so now real consumers that are businesses that will come will need to be citywide to be able to afford the rents and in the process local people won 't be able to shop here because they won 't be able to afford the goods or alternatively they won 't suit what they 're wanting we 're also saying that in order to be able to support the homeless community there is a strong need for a drop-in center we 're also saying that it 's timely for there to be a review of the Lynwood village master plan including looking at the additional finance for the limit sorry the limit Latimer Community Housing Trust in its desire to be able to rehouse displaced inner city East people so that 's from us a little over on that that we are also encouraging as a plea I guess for the Woolston pool for that to be supported thank you thank you and obviously the that the community board made a very powerful presentation and this regard as well but one of the things that I guess that is worthy of exploring as whether we should be seeking to engage the community directly and a former partnership so that we can and I set this to the previous speaker as well you know I 'm just looking at you I mean I 've known you for years I think you 're about the first community group I visited when I was min P for Christchurch central many years ago and it seems to me that I look at the what you said and I think of where our Inouye was 15 years ago and I think of the same level of investment and that for example leading the Community Development it just I just I feel that we wouldn 't be where we are today even with the earthquake so is that something that you 'd be interested in exploring when successfully in in an actual fact 15 years ago we began because pushing before I don 't know we 've got the regeneration we were pushing for something similar or our own process of nearness at least yeah there was the strengthening communities action funders what it was called but that actually provided a direct resource to the community not not accountable for outputs and you know sort of various so it was it was to enable facilitate and and and promote Community Development from the grassroots so and it certainly happened there and I 'm just looking at somebody that I think is very capable of delivering the same of Phil Glen thanks very much Ginny and Jane and I just wondered like some of these are the games and there 's something though we can 't ignore and what the drop-in center alone is is a big one so I 'm community development perspective I 'm impressed with but I 'm just wondering to achieve that some of there if one other of the ways that we do regeneration plans which might for example assist with some of the property aspects if some other planning or assistance from Council alongside what you 're doing might also assessing I would support there I mean I think the thing is we can 't do it it 's been much been left to the business community to do it or for the community to vow to have a go at doing it and in between counsel we need to vow to come together and for it to be lead I guess in a way upwards from the community of what we 've heard from the survey what we 're very clear what people are wanting mm-hmm thanks Judy Ben thank you just to let you know Jenny that several elected members are very conscious of this and we 're working on some of the structures over it obviously news media thinks it 's just a quick fix like that but I 'm sure you or so in the making thank you but thank you very much for that much appreciated and that according to my run sheet brings us to a short break and we 're due to start again at 25 but we could actually just take a ten minute break if you like as you come back at quarter past 15 _"

    "text": "thank you right the Sydenham quarter good afternoon hello thank you my name is Judy stack and I 'm the secretary of the Sydenham quarter which is the group that represents business and Sydenham I 'd like to thank the council for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the tsardom quarter and more importantly the Sydenham community in regards to the buckin Park playground you will all be well aware that in 2012 the Sydenham community took part in the development of the Sydenham master plan and conjunction with the council the objective of the master plans initiative was for badly damaged communities to be able to have input and to how they would like to see their community rebuilt and the Sydenham master plan said guidelines for a beautiful redevelopment of the Sydenham area sadly five years on the reality is far removed from the aspirations of the master plan the real development of Sydenham has seen a hotchpotch of rebuilds that be and no resemblance to the optimistic plans developed in 2012 empty and overgrown sections in Colombo Street edged the appearance of a said and forgotten than in the back and playground this little Heritage Park is totally neglected and this neglect will continue with no budget for improvement included in this annual plan or in the following annual plan predictions the playground only has two pieces of playground equipment of the two only one piece of rundown equipment is in working order even the swings have been removed and just the frames are left in place the landscape net landscaping needs upgrading the lawns need replanting the old rickety park benches need replacing the trees and shrubs need pruning and or removing and the rubbish and broken and abandoned signage needs removing from our perspective even though even the mowing of the park only seems to happen following a complaint there was a plan put forward to the Sydenham community by the previous community board to use a part of Buchan Park and a land swap sale arrangement to enable the Sikh community to build a temple adjacent to and using some of the buckin parkland the monies from the sale of part of Buchan park in this exchange would have paid for the park part of the park sold and the agreement lapsed it seems to us that maintenance on the park stopped at around the same time construction is currently underway on the old Sydenham school site housing development residents from this development will use the park as will people shopping at the Colombo and other surrounding sudden and businesses vacant Park is the only significant green space in the Sydenham business area bounded by Antigua Morehouse Wilson 's and Bryan streets yet in its present state the park is uninviting underused overgrown and has next to no usable play equipment in fact a child would be unable to kick a ball on the grassy area due to the length and condition of the lawns the Sydenham community urges a rethink on the annual plan we know and appreciate the time that funds are very tight but we would ask the council to take the first vital step and include a budgeted sum to upgrade and improve the park in this annual plan and subsequent plans going forward thank you okay um Phil Judy thank you very much I think cats Council we the first thing that I think is important is just whether you consider that any safety issues attached to the state of 30 the children swings and playground I have always felt that the park needed to have better facilities it certainly does have some very dark areas and and I think it it needs a really good a really good comprehensive plan undertaken for it for a complete upgrade yeah thanks Judy and my other question really is serve in relation to what you 're aware of and that is with the change of the ward boundaries there 's now a new community board the yes and I 'm just wondering have you have you had opportunity to talk yet with the new little bit spoken any formally with Deion right okay so I just hope it hope that effect there that this has progressed because what just so councils are we 're the previous community board as Judy said really did a lot of work on trying to make to actually enhance this Park and then there was a chat at the end of the tomb was there playground upgrade paper that went to your community board in July July last year that 's right my recollection is that maybe even come to Council as well yes okay it came to council action council decided not to proceed with the plan and so that 's really why is Judea said we are now in this some pretty serious yeah you know you here tonight you heard the UM previous submission yes you know is that there 's a community that 's turned an entire absolutely going around it is their community with an said none that would want to play a similar role with buck and our play got it 's it 's kind of difficult really incident because there are a number of small business owners but not that many residents at present so it 's correct how to get a buy-in from the local businesses apart from the fact when someone says we 're going to sell part of it and then any of you arrives we want to rise so it 's kind of hard to get that going but I 'm sure that we the council to an end result I think that would be a very good suggestion because I often find that you you 're never going to get a perfect result if it 's about that council doing like a great Museum you 're going to get a much better result if the community says we want to work in partnership with the councilor to achieve the objective here yeah yeah Yanni um I just want to clarify so the problem is that the money so council made the decision to defer a lot of projects around master plans yes so this one currently has money for 18 19 19 20 and because it 's been pushed out to 2021 and 21 22 it 's not shown in the draft consultation documents which i think is causing some confusion for people so the project is still going ahead it 's simply a timing thing and it wasn 't the board the board actually is still waiting for council to brief the board on what 's happening with master plans yeah so it 's really in councils course around the funding and have been repeatedly raised by the local community board in fact just the other day we had a briefing and we have been told that there are insufficient budgets to deal with the number of outstanding maintenance requests for our parks so I think it 's really I mean the question really is to say you know are you supportive of us putting extra funds on budget to do the basic maintenance or our parks and our playgrounds that that the concerns that you 've raised from the submission absolutely just you know just sorry I just want to say something just yesterday the community board we got an assurance that there will be some work done on the maintenance and stuff like that there they 're going to go and have a look at it but yeah back in Park so there is going to be some work about tidying it up yeah then it 's not the only one that 's yeah but there 's the puck and puck was broken desires that have been there for two years that are lying in the middle of you know know before Christmas the the lawns were you know work over foot I was crazy I think you 've brought home in debt that there was a report brought forward and and so I think everyone was waiting for that to be adopted and then it wasn 't so it you know you brought it back to our attention but I think that finding that community connection will be what will unlock access both to the council but also access to the community engagement and that 's heart because that that just that there 's no point having a part here if nobody is using it or nobody values and obeys responsible don 't take that guardianship role on the ground I agree but at the state same stage it 's difficult for people to go there and have their lunch of their walk wading through grass that 's a fire I totally agree so it 's where we can get that balance yes would be together I 'm David well I was involved in the last term with a lot of the discussions around the seat Church and then a bit of a dogleg in it and and there were a number of concerns expressed with children 's safety in the back part that need to be addressed but the other issue which hasn 't been raised here today and I are wonderful still exist there there were a number of quite important heritage items in that Park some of them related to the old school of some time ago I 'm not sure whether it was close boil or the Sydenham school itself but but there is quite a quite a significant heritage factor in that Park that has to be preserved as well and I 'm just interested to know does that still exist those things are there 's the the the plaques are still there um the school bell was stolen oh sure removed and the end of the sign was pushed over so there 's not only a need to retain a green space and this isn 't Sydenham area there is also some heritage but some pieces that need to be recognized as well it sounds like a classic case of the broken windows exactly right anything any of us know look thank you very much your time it 's pretty Jerry she ate thank you all for your time thank you thank you _"

    "text": "good afternoon I 'm Carol ran off on behalf of Oak Development trust and this is Anthony good afternoon worship from there and councillors thank you for the opportunity to present our proposal to the Christchurch City Council draft and your plan our proposal does not cover the entire plan but rather a Pacific issue relating to our community the provision of toilets and Harrington Park on Peveril Street in Rakuten this comes under the halls well we 'll be records and community board special projects to that end the Oak Development Trust is here today as a key stakeholder in the area committed to strengthening and building our community the proposal is that Chrysler City Council amends its annual plan to give priority to the provision of toilets and Harrington Park our strong preference is that these toilets be similar to those in Beverly Park on the corner of Stanmore Road and Avon side Drive and Gibson Street Park in Shirley we understand that these toilets are often given priority where there are sports parks however Harrington Park has become a major community hub which would be enhanced by parks nearby power reserve and chains Crescent in 2011 when the oak development trust was first established Harrington Park was an unsafe and underutilized asset in the community there was significant graffiti and safe rubbish and a number of Park Yuna users displayed intimidating behavior towards others in the area since that time s the S V our story 2011 to 2017 documentary shows so never consumed provements have occurred in the community these are relate to the core principles of strengthening and empowering local residents alongside other community leaders we have promoted a number of positive events an initiative these include sports in the park in terms one and for the annual community fun day held in October connection day for university students how to March placing a numeral on a fence in the park designed and painted by pupils from the Farah Nui primary school the community garden on people Street the upgrade of the iconic historic bulldozer which was used in Antarctica as a result we have also seen the regular usage of the basketball half court and the cricket nets by students and other community members increase in the number of families using the playground including the Flying Fox local churches using the site for events with their children and youth where we are that safety issues will need to be addressed to ensure that the toilets do not become a target of vandalism and other antisocial behavior we believe that these are easily resolved by the placement of toilets in a very visible spot appropriate lighting residents taking ownership for reporting graffiti and damage finally we envision that one to two toilets are at the Maxima needed this reflects the regular usage of the site we understand that our major events such as the October fun day would still require some additional temporary toileting Harrington Park has become a significant bumping place within the Richland West community we are proud of what has been achieved and have been pleased to see this asset developed further the provision of toilets is a practical and necessary step for the future improvement of the park as part of our shared vision of strengths and communities thank you thank you very much have you made you 've made a there any questions I think people were really excited about the video but thank you very much but for making a submission I think you know you brought a an issue to the table it 's a clear submission and we 'll take it into consideration as we take go through the annual plant and it has been supported by the community board it 's the other way around I have to be here I have been known to be able to be quiet not often but there you go who is here to answer any of the turkey Christians you might have a fest as I said it 's a straightforward very clear you 've actually tuned something that wasn 't an asset unto an asset for the whole community and congratulations on what your community is done all right thank you thank you _"

    "text": "Thanks I know yes okay the next one is Waterloo Business Park hey Monsieur Clarke everyday great well good afternoon everyone and thanks for the opportunity to make this submission on the Hamish plaque from Waterloo Business Park and I 'm the development manager and really I 'm just here to elaborate on that submission that I made online currently there is funding in the 2016 17 annual plan and that 2015 25 long-term plan for the Hallsville Junction Road link from Waterloo Road to Foreman 's Road and enough you can suck this handouts being handed out but also on the on the board there 's a yellows yellow piece of roading which are is that the right handing I guess you would say of that paper so the submission is really for that funding that is currently in the plan to remain we 're at a stage where there 's been some work done getting to this point with kiri rail and it 's taken some time but council offices are about ready to re-engage or engage with the wider community and the community board on consultation and does look like there might be some extra money is needed and it 's really a matter of having the time to go through the process so that that can be resolved to help set the scene at the other end of Waterloo Business Park in gta '_''_121.2 have been working on Town Road realignment and they should have that well finished well before the end of this year that will result in a new rail crossing through the Maine South Road from pound Road and it actually results in the closing of the batas Road intersection that if you know that one that 's quite a difficult under section to the negotiate we as a project coming to the ins we 're expected to be substantially complete by the end of this year and for the road in network this means Junction Road that link is really the last piece of the puzzle that we need to have completed so in the last 45 years of the development it 's well progressed that it actually incorporates the original requests from the City Council to realign the major roads of these and incorporating the cycle ways and in fact we 're currently engaged with council and the consultants to accommodate that major cycle route scheme so with regard to the submission we have been working closely with Council probably for the last 24 months who are also engaging with key route the projects progressing but funding is the single most biggest issue council as I say our working through this and that 's the reason we need to have that existing funding retained not all the funding is in the annual plan the 2016-17 annual plan but as I say council working through this how to bridge the gap and with us in mind our directors are also committed to a significant conditional grant to ensure the project goes ahead as planned and completed obviously as soon as possible this road connection when completed will be an integral part of the Hornby area and as such the road provides a major connection to the surrounding areas and community so it allows for that growth that was considered when those other roads were changed and realigned and widened it keeps the existing road network more efficiently it allows for an upgraded rail crossing obviously money would not be wasted on the existing cross which is you know quite quite honestly quite substandard and obviously there would be some improved benefits around safety so in summary the projects been planned for many years I think honestly it was mooted around 2006 see over 10 years it 's the last piece of the puzzle we 're working well with Council and really we just want to get that situation where hey we can resolve the issue of we don 't have all of the money or the council doesn 't have all of the money at the stage but we just want to ensure that the money that 's the air stays there and so we get to resolution thank you very much for your time happy to take any questions Aaron Jimmy yeah I 'm glad to see that intersection at Templeton 's closing oh absolutely unbelievable it 's a shocker surprise it 's not a fatality there a week it 's so bad the pound Road where it comes up net the swamp by Logan thinks it does yeah so wins is that scheduled at the same time as the other extension are they two separate projects so that that 's a NZTA lead project they 'll be completed that that they 'll be completed by the end of this year they 'll be completed well before the end of this year also that road there opens this year and that other intersection closes Creek the bat is right one in a setter that 10 section is that getting traffic lights the the NZTA work yeah yes sound of it you 'll be it myself and also on Waterloo Road right right okay cool Jimmy okay hey mister how much funding no disappear from the 2016-17 long-term plans so I believe it was four million dollars in there at the moment I guess we 're not saying it 's going to disappear we don 't want it to disappear there 's really that the key point though I was trying to make we just want time I know that there 's a lot of competing projects and really it was really to that point where we can resolution on the project so this money doesn 't disappear effectively is what we 're really after but I remember you told me there regarding this issue a couple of months ago yep told me latest I will give you a reply so whether the stock it give you any does reply or not yet ah look we 're working it 's a purse it 's quite a protracted process for there is a shortfall but it 's a process to work through that and we appreciate that okay thank you clarification is it intersection got the railway line as well so there is a railway line on both of those new pieces of writing work I see that 's the black one and only each there it 's the pieces that so the will Junction one is this yellow one at this end yep so there 's a rail crossing there 's two lines that run through here and this is the NZTA work yeah let 's go is it yep so this their main yeah yeah

was just it was totally awesome yeah oops should have bought some of our just saying no pressure I was just going to reinforce the the swimming pool in an ear nourish area I know that Linwood Buxton had been in penciled in a swimming pool in that area and just a couple of experiences with most my students and just taking the Yemenites on Camp and we heard through it we had a quarter of them they hit their life jackets just to keep them out of swimming and keep them above above water at the river that we were we were next oh and I was like what is this and just recently nobody and then also taking the rest of the school through their swimming lessons and just finding out how bad they actually were and bit of discussion with all the children it 's just that they don 't go to the pools they walk everywhere in the neighborhood they skirt around everywhere in the neighborhood the closest Paul was Pioneer for them and so when asked I think we had three people three of the students out of 110 that are getting swimming lessons and others asked who goes regularly just got next to no hints and so it just it just freaked me out of it and so I 'm just here to reinforce I sort of said well who would go if you could scooter there and Yvonne what 's a hand up as they do with the disturbing because if one else was or not I don 't know but they all see that they would love to go if they could get there and it was in scooter distance which the one in the plan was only about two K 's away and some of them scooted reinforce it the importance just ground level these children are missing out on lots of swimming sure we take them for a daily swimming experience of 30 minutes for two weeks but it just doesn 't sustain it if they don 't never use it again to the next year and they do that too big swimming session again and you know we could commit to more but we 're burning through the cash and bus bus roads to get there we get a little bit of funding for that but we don 't often in a lower D so we already get the money back again so we take a hit on money that we could be another area so there 's that constant battle sort of thing so just just wanted to reinforce the importance of one being in the nearest area would be from our perspective great yeah Pauline just on that can you tell us how much it costs you to get the kids to another pool to swim including transport how much you pay per annum to clean your swimming each each tired it was you know yeah well I could say each child but it was we got the PFA to fund 20 of it I think it weighed out at about 65 per child for the two weeks so we do ask the parents to pay and we get around about 50% pay so we pay the other 45 of the 65 the PFA didn 't pay we ask the parents to pay and if they don 't we just front up sort of things so each bus ride you get two buses at alternate or three depending on size of school whatever each bus is about hundred and fifty to go to your own back yeah and so you get two of them each day so there 's how many kids go there we did everybody of everyone in the school to go yeah well hundred teen okay so it 's a few amount of that yeah thank you yeah we had look at alternatives of stopping swimming but we really thought we couldn 't get away with it and just for it for our what the heck we take but then thanks for they tell us um you were saying that that 's your school experience right know that you talk to all the other school principals in the in the past the school principals have submitted together is that the same experience the other school so they 've did a two-week stunt that 's how the majority schools to it yeah it just works easiest yeah and then because it takes a big chunk out of the day as well from a learning cuz you 've got the bus trip theorem Beck yes my weight and well some kids are doing a Lisa nonsense it 's a we we 're way so you 're the time to get there and everything it 's a and when you get there they they rotate you so you have 30 minutes waiting one group will go straighter and the other one way and we 're obviously we get them busy reading the books and everything else and then they swap over so they have an hour the half an hour to drive us here and the other half going back so it 's for those who aren 't familiar with the current school systems where you 've got years in the studio flight from Assam and stuff you 7h is ten eleven twelve year olds yeah for mundum um all of our schools in our area have that because there 's no intermediate area thank you hi dad that 's a 300 to get your kids to a pulled and big daily for the buses here yeah it 's the transport so if you didn 't have to pay that sort of money and bus you know of course would you bring your kids into into the town for example into the museum into the art gallery would you make is it a barrier for you um we just talked about uh sort of stuff it 's probably our biggest barrier at our school because of parents the the money coming in is very hard so going on any trips we ask for a we do sort of donation we say can you pay three dollars of the whatever it costs and so they 're just help us out and we keep it say ten dollars that straight away this won 't get done and here we do limit our trips because of it yeah we don 't want to but um yeah we have got plans to go for grants and all that kind of thing to help with bus trips and we 've got their plan for next year actually thank you thank you for it Aaron so I take it st. Anne 's is taken out it 's Paul how we don 't if it for now so that 's gone because they had one when I was a kid um you know counting the creep down the bed and the other one just round the corner it 's not even born man there yeah it wasn 't excellent yeah and then the other thing is the the Bamford school do they still have their pool and you 're allowed to use it I 'm not actually sure I 'll look into that though um I suppose we 're coming up the angle of I wasn 't necessarily meaning to save us the money or anything I was actually sold for these kids there 's opportunities to develop this woman you know two weeks here there whatever and we 're still going to still going to be squishy to try and get more and even if we had a free pool I 'm just saying after school what do they do they go home that 's not what they don 't hike maybe but otherwise I 'm thinking weekends all of it the students in there who go to ask you anyway they get around by scootering and walking and I just wanted a school shared posts I know Benton 's what 300 meters or so to walk and it 's got a really big pool well they had one a lot of schools closed down their small schools that pulls and of course that that their unheated and uncovered so no no no well I learned to swim on a swimming pool your memory my memory made me a global warming it should be warmer to swim say I think I was near level but after you before you I mean before you a long time before you probably established that I 'm really old so thank you and my support of that was yet more just for pastime stuff rather than trying to save us money thanks for bringing that but no we will probably both it 's about getting access to swimming lessons but just really concerning us as a city because you know we I mean we live in an environment of water and you know kids need to like know how to swim and we are also concerned there that people young kids get a lifetime of experience of enjoying the water and enjoying the activities that go with them a swimming pool that 's more than just a place to go to learn as well yeah thank you yeah and just really quickly wanted to support um last last year the proposal came out for the Woolston revitalization or redevelopment I 'm not sure what they called it but it just looked amazing and just obviously we are right in Woolston and it 's sort of up and down you don 't know whether it 's going to pick up and become a vibrant and everyone gets all depressed because everything 's going away from Alston and bank goes and then new or comes back anyway we would just sort of it 's the sort of area that we 're hoping would pick up like the tannery has which is 500 meters down the road making things safer we also love the plan because it had a little bit of a speed reduction and since helping at the school there 's been quite a few crashes around when the children are leaving and things in it is really worried me and it sold two of our problems at once you know made the area an icy area to be in it made it a bit safer for our children some of their parents were like all thirty case now I 'll never get to work and so I sort of did the mathematics with a calculator with them and showed them look that 's 12 seconds it 'll slow you down to get to work or whatever but we had a lot of support for it and speaking on behalf of my community I else they 're all like oh this roads horrible Rotorua and that the amount of feedback I get is all just they would love to see that area just a little bit safer so from supporting property to work oh no what can I do they said similar things just any any thing to help with safety around our roads will be appreciated lovely thank you very much for your time thank you viewers appreciated next is now is it I can 't pronounce it is that Donna _"

    "text": "thank you I 'll stick smell country-club incorporators how valley good afternoon my name is Kyle Valley I 'm the executive manager of this tech small Country Club so we 're here to talk about the submission on the set of lights for the gardener 's road he would Road intersection you 've got my submission I 'm not going to read it out debating but just to sort of add some value to it so the purpose of it is really three things and it 's for us because we have quite a volume of our residents that go through that intersection especially with a lot of young families with the school 's feeding into the area and the first ones about the traffic flows that represent it the second one is about the safety and there 's another consideration around the environment impact of the air quality with the cars sitting in the intersection so the first one is around the flow and just to join your attention to this picture up here because I 'll this is sort of quite significant to part of the challenge that layout of the road firstly the cars can park quite close to the intersection on the side of the road which means cars are actually from come past the actual stop line to see where the cars are coming on either side before they can actually cross the intersection and that 's also creating a problem for the cars that are turning left have to be in come out past that car further to see that now if you 're a cyclist and if you look at that white dotted line right now you have to swing back into the flow of the traffic to get past that so we 've got significant issues around flow as firstly getting across it and turning left and right onto that intersection as well and so the submission around the set of traffic lights in that area will be able to speed up that flow and actually to be able to make traffic go a lot faster and also with the changes to the John 's right now that we are finding there 's a lot more significant higher volume of traffic use make is safety which again I touched on briefly about the flow here but just anecdotally I want to say this is the the number six row intersection that you put on your risk register right now is the intersection of soyuz arms Road and Gardens Road which is the ones intersection back now a couple of challenges here and this is around where the measurement of the data comes and then how it gets interpreted so the fatality and serious under injury index that they use to base the rating of these roads from a business perspective is you always got a flaw when you 're looking at Rick respecter for historical data and the best analogy I can use to it is it 's like driving the car looking at your rear window as you don 't because you 're looking at historical data and the latest data that they 're actually basing this information on it 's from 2005 to 2012 so any injuries or serious injuries or fatalities during that period so we 're already past that point but this intersection at the corner of gardeners set of traffic lights and if you look at the NZTA schedule around this you 're reducing that significantly by about 15 to 35 percent by putting a set of traffic lights as far as your risk assessment on it so most submissions I 've given you some good data the area some other criteria you 're looking at when you 're assessing the risk potential before an accident actually happens and this thing here takes off of about six of the team things around which you 've got poor visibility around the entering traffic from either side you 've got poor signage you 've got no traffic lights and place you 're going over double lane highway so it 's quite significant and I 'll put them in the submission there which is if you actually basic around the potential risk it would actually set at number one because on all the urban intersections that you 've rated or the the council was rated above it if you see one knows here 's a set of lights okay this is the first one that doesn 't have a satellite for us to put our satellites in there be able to reduce the safety aspect of this again is quite significant and the third ones are your own equality now this good research to support this that most of the time that you actually using emissions out of the car is on the stop start when the vehicle slowing down and then through heart acceleration and you need to sit in this intersection to see that this is just the prime example of where that 's actually happening where cars are stopping and then the creeping in and the accelerating heart out of it and also to some cars are actually diverting left and right and actually taking a much longer path to get to where they want to as well so there are some environmental impacts and advantages in actually putting the satellites in this intersection as well so that 's my key points is just around the fact that a we can improve the flow safety and the quality and just one little story the furniture so I 've got a son who 's four years old so see of an intersection at the corner of Soyuz arms and gardeners road on his own with the satellites he can push the button he understands green here would go across it I challenge any of you at the 4-yard son to let your son across that road Thanks when you 're driving down the road just to grab your analogy you do keep your eye on the road ahead but you also keep your eye on the rear-vision mirror so what 's happened in the past is also really important to looking at what happens in the future and the Christchurch City Council staff do not use the past data alone they 've always got their eye on the road ahead as well and they take into account a wide range of factors in determining risk I 'd really like to put you up against a street that or an intersection that already has a set of traffic lights but an uneven kink and rekelen Road and that 's at the eylem Road corner worth Middleton so and that 's much higher risk in terms of the accidents that pick on the intersection piece is interesting and this is around the analysis in the darkness it 's in there as well because the NZTA actually ranks that number 87 this but we don 't we use that as a basis we don 't use that as our final criteria so I understand there and what I 'm saying here is that if you just use the risk analysis of the potential future risk rather than just the fatality and serious injury and X which is what I can understand is the base the majority of the decision-making on this intersection has a potential problem and I 'm just taking this photo this was just today and I see this every single day I don 't see that in that Middleton Road intersection no you don 't see that you see people not knowing that they can 't turn right in front of a car tuning right the other way yeah look I know it 's a difficult people get killed at traffic control traffic light controlled intersections than they do it uncontrolled intersections and again it 's about seeing as well put a set of traffic lights you improve the safety factor the safety factors more improved with the traffic lights either not but this is more about just a safety this is about the flow as well it 's about setting priorities yep and yannis I just quickly um in terms of a non traffic light solution have you thought of things like roundabouts or any other sort of solutions that we could put that possibly weren 't as expensive in the short term yeah look and you only got to go down to the Farrington Street big roundabout down there you can see that that flow of traffic and the safety improves from there um and look from our perspective as we just want to see it improved and we just want it brought up and I think the assessment of it as to where that risk sets is higher than probably what it deserves on that list but yes potentially a roundabout on there if it 's able to be done it would improve the safety or improve the flow and it would improve the emissions for your time thank you much appreciated _"

    "text": "I move on to Aiden here Aiden field Christian school and Rakim the son so good afternoon mid el0 counselors my name is Andrew Henderson I 'm presently the chair of the board of trustees of Aidan field Christian school and first I wish to record an apology on behalf of our principal mr. Mark Richardson who can 't be here today due to some PD commitments and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today in support of our submission pitch by way of a bit a little bit of background for those of you who may not be familiar with us I didn 't feel Christians the school was formerly Kings Christian College and Nash Road was renamed in about 2007 where state integrated special character school with a roll of currently 325 students in the similar vein to the previous speaker we currently have about 27 different nationalities at our school so it 's representative of the but if a diversity we have not only in halls will but in white at Christchurch it 's full wave a brief background school has been seeking for issues around traffic management along Hayden field Drive in particular and safety issues for our children and we are very grateful for the recent meetings have had with council Galloway and staff to progress the matter of concerns or our issues really a set out in a written submission I won 't read it I 'll assume that you 've read it and I 'm only going to reiterate very briefly some of those points today firstly we 're very supportive of the works that are presently underway and Aiden field drive to create a safe crossing place in a refuge through the currents while on the eastern side of nice Road Road intersects with Haddonfield Drive we understand this is the only place that complies with all relevant codes of practice in relation to sight distances etc and we are grateful it 's been constructed and we also understand that refugee status and the school zones rely very or related very closely to the school science or school zone signs that go up around the roads around the streets of Christchurch to alert drivers to the presence of the very supportive of the council 's ongoing commitment to funding these science throughout the city we understand they are expensive and we understand that there must be priority given to various schools and our conversations we understand that additional funding has been made available such that our school can be done this financial year and again we 're very grateful we appreciate us not it 's not an easy task to prioritize schools who all who have very similar needs in terms of safety for their children our principal concern really relates to aid and field drive itself Edenfield Drive was constructed sometime ago obviously it complies with the various codes and rules and engineering standards for carriageway weather etc but it was constructed sometime before the the recent expansion in the halls and Wigram areas as your weird Wigram skies and the various areas around have exploded with reasonable development and we also have the new development coming at the end of 8th and field drive that 's been promoted I think by the Danny Morra or the various outfits there there is going to significantly increase the traffic Drive those of you who are familiar with it and perhaps have either dropped kids or been passed there during school day will know that it 's it is busy when parents are trying to park either at the side of the road they will quite often pull up on the grass verge when there is a bus come in the opposite direction that 's a terrifying place to be as a parent not only as a child and so we are concerned that increasing traffic pressure in the area will put increasing pressure on the road and in turn will increase the safety concerns that we hear for our kids we understand that in the future there 's there may well be a cycle path created down Aidan field Drive and again we just really want to raise with the council our concerns about that that putting a cycle lane down that down Aidan field drive with the competing interests we hear for traffic already will exacerbate an existing situation and result in further safety concerns we do have a potential solution that we have raised monitor ratings with happy to engage with council to try and reach a solution the school does want to be a good neighbor we don 't want to annoy our our residential neighbors by parking on grass verges and tearing up the grass but sometimes there is no option at present there is a large reserve area outside the school that separates the score for Aidan field Drive and we dislike to indicate that we would be interested in talking and engaging with counsel about the use of that either as an option to widen the carriageway to provide a safer and wider road for people to traverse whether they 're cycling whether in cars or whether they 're in buses and the other option that we 'd like to explore potentially the long term would be the ability to use that reserved area as a driver and drive out to take cars off the road with the dropping kids off if they can 't fit in the school car park just to create an overall safer situation that is really all that we wanted to raise I 'm sure we understand and our school they 're common to most schools throughout the country but we do think perhaps the reserve area offers a unique situation not only to school but to council to create a safer passage past the school I have your answer any questions but thank you very much for your time FL thank you for your submission and I just want to ask you about the cycle path like we seem to be really saying it was insufficient space on that that road Aden field Drive for a cycle way as well so if in fact somehow it was it was widened and a safer cycle lane would for them could be fitted in is that something that that would be helpful would certainly support it we do have have children that cycle as a parent I don 't encourage mine to just because I 've seen the nature of the traffic so I think providing more room for Tunip modes of transporters is always a good thing and certainly if more room was available interface it safer this won 't be a major cycle way but I am lane as safe as possible is that 's would your school so promote safe cycling to school absolutely and we already do and we have a number of kids that do cycle we have no problem with with encouraging kids to cycle or walk to school if his safe passage right thank you it in terms of the cycle lane that 's and that 's not out for consultation yet is it no it 's not no we just suddenly behave you engage with counsel with there will be a full opportunity none of the cycle ways go on without community consultation is that right this is not a major major so noise it 's not an MCL but it could be potentially power of the network and something we 've been looking yeah okay no that 's good any other questions thank you very much very much thank you a stick smell country-club incorporators how valley _"

you about speed limit outside to walk at noon or school I 'm a rabbit Rowland and I have witness speeding cars throughout my time of being a regular I failed this problem is very unsafe and should be that wolf as a big issue because other schools else are on a waiting list not just us but the whole school of us are very concerned thank you for your time tena koutou tena koe chinchilla educator you 're a thank you kyouda call Caleb took it anyway um I saw on stuff there 56,000 canterbury drivers had been caught speeding on very Road and I think that is way too many I think it is unsafe and I think if there if this but if the speed limit is reduced in it would be much safe safer and so one day I brother and we it was on a really foggy day and we had already started crossing the road and there was a car coming and they didn 't have their lights on and they were also speeding and we had to throw my brother back to the path and yes think it 's really unsafe thank you for my time thank you your dad corrugator good Engler aho I was sorry over 56,000 canterbury drivers have broken the school speed limit it is putting a price on both children and adults lives it 's not fair that we have to wait for the speed limit to change I feel safe I feel strong because we are standing up for other schools I 'm not just speaking for myself I am speaking for other schools too I want everyone to feel safe when crossing the crossing thank you for my time Corella took it in water hard um so I 'm just just check pretend you 're just talking to make on you talk to Pauline not calling is really nice you got the you piss never give up fire come have a strong view about the speed limit down fury road don 't you yes yeah what who are you Maya nice to meet you ten um I don 't know do you think it 's a bit dangerous by your school um yes any other leading questions mess excellent and what would you like us to do with the speed limit outside your school lower it okay I 'm I 'm going to do LS for called a lot accruing or I have witnessed someone being hit because the speed limit was too high also Isiah motor mater mum does not let his son walk to school anymore because of this incident we feel it is very unsafe I also feel unsafe walking to school too and I feel like when the road patrollers try and put this sign out it it is hurt because they can 't or because of the speeding cars well no wonder she was going to have difficulty saying that because it 's pretty sad and for anyone to have to see somebody being hurt you know you 're very brave for tuning up for coming along and your message has really been heard so thank you for being part of the group yeah she 's George yep Kuroko day and I 'm speaking on behalf of Jeanine who 's the principal at Walker in our school and janina 's also the lead principal of the community of schools in the Linwood Austin area and she 's asked me today to speak in 3 minutes and 10 seconds regarding the Lynnwood Washington pull as you may or may not recall the the schools in the area have made submissions in the last couple of years in support of the facility coming into the limit Austin area and we noted in this draft in your plan for 2017-18 that there are funds set aside for planning and capital works over the next three years and we certainly endorse that but we 're also aware that some questions have been raised and in local media and have come around the council table in terms of the overall spins and pressures on spending and Christians around aquatic facilities in the city and why perhaps 5 million dollars Paul has a price tag of around 19 million so there 's a couple of key points I 'd like to make to that and I 'm going to put my glasses on in order to do it successfully the why the facility in that community I think of the the things that we just want to indoors that there was a feasibility study done by the council back in around 2006 that identified the need for a facility such as that in the wider Lynwood Walston area and that was at a time when qe2 and Centennial were both operational so there 's there 's been a need that 's been established there for some time as the first point would want to make I think that one of the primary attributes of the community is disadvantage and deprivation its second to none that 's not a particularly good phrase to say but it 's second to none in terms of the level of disadvantage across the city and you can see that in your own City Council snapshots and profiles on some of the key attributes around income on you can see it in the deprivation index steps you 'll see it in police information around crime and anti-social behaviour in the area that there 's a crying need for positive social outcomes and positive social facilities community facilities and I don 't think anyone around the table disagrees with that we want to emphasize that and the nature of that need is seen in schools every day you know I 've been the disks the principle of a dis old Tanner primary school when I was it a disorder in primary school I may have seen Child Youth and Family once twice a year and some years I wouldn 't have seen them at all but as a desire to principal in the Lynwood area I saw them every week I saw them several times a week around significant issues around care and protection welfare issues for children and significant disruptions and families approximately 60 to 70 percent of six-year-old children after the first year at school are still below the national expectations for their age in our schools in the Lynwood Woolston area the level of and those kids do make these marvelous children showed positive responses to the support that they get and the community will do that but it needs extraordinary levels of response and that 's why that sort of five million dollars versus nineteen million dollars has to be put in the context of the extent of need and the significant height of the climb that has to be made to see those positive social outcomes come and the last very quick point we 'd like to make is that you will recently launched multicultural strategy sits beautifully alongside providing support and communities such as limiting Woolston because sixty to seventy percent of the children that come into our schools are from non European backgrounds 30 percent marry 20 25 percent Pacific significant numbers of Filipino Indian Fiji Union and others ensure those cultures are represented across the city but nowhere to the extent that they are in that part of town so the aspirations we have for inclusion and trying to meet the needs of multicultural communities there 's nowhere better to do it than in Lynwood and Wilson and you the CBD for a whole lot of reasons around deprivation just does not address the needs of children and young people in those areas here we go thank you thank you all very much and think thanks again to the students for coming along and reinforcing that submission and I 'll just say that you know I the first time I ever did us public speaking and I was older than the group of you I was 14 years old I got stage fright I just about passed out I couldn 't remember the first line of the speech that I had committed the first line to memory so didn 't write it down and it was cigarette smoking is considered now to be the greatest single theoretically removable cause of death in society I remember it now but I couldn 't remember it then and I just about fell over so and now I 'm the mirror Christchurch see there you go I think I 'm looking at a future mayor so thank you all very much for coming and thank you for your submission and thank you for and we 'll now move on to _"

    "text": "States thank you thanks councilors so I 'd like to invite the Central City Business Association to present Thank You right by members of an executive committee in their manager mr. Goodman thank you for the opportunity to present our submission to you we cover issues that impact on the central city 's future and our submission that today we would like to discuss three key points with you that relate to the future of our organization while I 'm speaking there are pictures that are playing in the background and please show a number of our members of our organization the Christchurch central community in hopefully this demonstrates the diversity of our membership the first point we make is that we 're a diverse representative organization prior to the earthquakes our organization numbered over 500 today we are around 220 members in retail hospitality professional services property Leisure Arts accommodation and education sectors most are independent operators a narrow elected Executive Committee well reflects those spread of sectors we believe our membership also reflects the diversity of interests in the central city not just property in retail and hospitality we want this fantastic new central city of ours to succeed the second point a need remains for an organization like ours after the earthquakes we head to grow organized organization back from scratch and focus on what have been the priorities for the pioneers coming back into the central city advocacy and promotional activity and details of this are in paragraph 12 of our submission which also notes that some months ago we realize we are at a crossroads the level of commercial activity in the Central City has increased significantly in places gathering we are an organization of modest resources we are moving from a recovery phase and looking forward to one of regeneration so we 've asked a number of questions of ourselves our members and our partners what are the current priorities for business and in the Central City where do we want to be hitting and as there 's still a role for an organization like ours and if so who should we be partnering with and how should we be resourced we 've asked these questions by engaging with our members and partners through are in paragraph 20 of our submission it 's been a successful and I think satisfying process and it 's incorporate a range of positive engagement enthusiasm from all those involved and short we 've had an affirmation that there remains a need for the an independent organization like ours to promote and coordinate a central city rather than a council or a government agency doing so a coordinated body as needed rather than leaving it to individual businesses to work alone our role of advocacy is essential and there needs to be a business voice contributing to how the central city is promoted in the future in the past week we 've finalized our strategic plan which you have a copy of and we are confident that we have a strong platform from which to take our organization in the Central City forward we think the plan is a strong representation of priorities not just for the CCPA but for the central city from this plan we 've identified a number of priorities for the 2017 18 year these are detailed in paragraph 23 of our submission we 're point we have a plan to obtain financial independence but in the meantime we still need some funding support from Christchurch City Council paragraph 15 of our submission outlines our current funding situation immediately prior to the earthquakes we 'd invested considerable effort in working with our members and the City Council to achieve financial independence through a targeted rate on properties in the Central City the CCPA is committed to achieving financial independence this will need to include the establishment of a Business Improvement District program and the introduction of the target of rate to fund ongoing work on behalf of Central City businesses right now however that is still too soon for a bid to be established property owners are still looking for tenants and many business operators are just getting established funding from the City Council was reduced in the 2014-15 year to 100,000 per annum and this has not been sufficient to operate the CCPA with just one part-time employee we have used up we have used cash reserves generated in the pre equate period to continue to provide the services we believe the central city reserves have now been significantly reduced further reducing our funding to sixty thousand dollars for the 2017 18 year as it 's currently proposed will simply mean we can no longer operate past the coming year we would need to significantly scale back what we can provide including our participation and simplicity engagement processes where a business perspective is essential element it would fully use our reserves and we would not be able to continue to operate past June 2018 our strategic plan sets out a pathway to moving to an independent model to generate resources required for the CCB a steps include investigating an affordable membership fee in preparing a good poll so in short near Dalzell and councilors the CCPA is still needed to promote and advocate for a strong business heart in christchurch city we are an independent diverse business voice with an important role to play to help maintain the momentum of the central cities growth in to ensure that its potential is fully realized we have a plan to become more financially independent but we need time to implement it we 're therefore seeking funding annual plan of a total of 100,000 this includes an additional forty thousand dollars above the sixty thousand dollars which is already being budgeted for in the current long-term plan in the draft 2017 18 clean thank you thank you do people have any questions Yanni Andrew thank you and thank you for taking the time to come in today and make your submission I just I 'm just it helped me understand a little bit more about your membership structure in terms of how much income you generate from membership there is no membership fee so so currently and members do not have to pay anything to become a member or be promoted on our website and social media in question was just in terms of the Central City is there a map of the area that you represent yes there is it 's actually a website and the about and contact section but um really we start and after the earthquakes we started with the core of the rock plan and we 've expanded slightly so in short our boundaries now kill more Street Montreal st. Asaph we well so it 's really the core or the heart of the city I should say just in terms of the membership fee we 've been very much aware that most of our members who are small independent operators coming into the city and starting up a business and a recovering city has been pretty tough for them and so we haven 't wanted to investigate that membership fee until this point question angry yes thank you I certainly appreciate the consideration around the establishment of a Business Improvement District and obviously wanting to wait till you 've got a critical mass of well-established businesses before you do that I haven 't had a chance to have a look at the strategic plan as yet but is there any thinking around when the right time to do that will be yes that 's it out and under a resourcing and the organisation part of the plan so the third would fit establishment poll would be in the 2019 2020 yeah and that 's the point at which you would expect to achieve full financial sustainability or would you still at financial support from council at that point we hope we wouldn 't need ongoing further support from the council so just in that section there it talks about exploring a membership fee and the current needs are talking to our members we would also look at sponsorship opportunities and the bed as well so we 're looking at a package if you if you like of revenue streams including the results of a third poll but of course there 's no guarantee at the stage that a bid poll would be successful we don 't know yet whether time the business community would fully support the establishment of a bed no nor nor whether it would be necessarily be universal across the whole area we had a submission earlier of from spokes and they raised an accessible city and they you know reference the need for all groups to be able to come together and consider the different components of it especially when adjustments being made and reference some of the specific design issues that are being revisited in some of the streets they answered this question in the affirmative in progress or being reviewed leaving aside their projects that that haven 't been started under the accessible city chapter would you support you know putting the whole of the document on hold and having a conversation with both yourselves obviously but also their wider community around around what we intended you know what was intended five years ago when it was written and whether given the changes that have been made and some of the lessons that we 've learned from those and some of the experiences would it be better to you know put this on hold could we revisit some of the designs more but if we want to go beyond the designs then I think we have to think about the legislation because the it 's the Central City recovery plan it would require a regeneration plan or an amendment to the legislation to change it but would you be willing to participate in such a process yes yes we 're certainly open to constructive engagement on the accessible city issues any but you like the idea of bringing in other interests as well active transport all access banking and a membership reflects that as well and what does excellent thank you very much okay and thank you very much for your time it 's much appreciated thanking viewing us thank you _"

    "text": "it 's absolutely the right way to go Christchurch Civic trust Chris coastline this is a team hello welcome Thank You Lian counselors for this opportunity and the question christopher Kisling has been introduced on the chair of the crisis if ik trust crisis Civic Trust made submissions on the draft annual plan in three areas the first of those was the nurses memorial chapel the second was on the botanic gardens and the third was on Hagee oval now in terms of the nurses memorial chapel the main thrust of our submission on that topic was to assure that the budget provisions it 's made for the restoration to proceed and the project to be completed within the 2017-18 period in completion in time for the 1918 commemorations and it 's nice to have heard that the administer of error has been corrected and this is now back on track so we want to say that we are fully support the council proceeding to make sure the restoration of this heritage gym is completed expeditiously thank you very much on that school on the botanic gardens at a recent spatial plan for the Botanic Gardens we were asked at that time if we would be making a submission on the draft annual plan and we have the thrust of our submission is that the council makes adequate budget provision to reestablish the former high maintenance and presentation standards of the Botanic Gardens as as the highest priority for spending rate payer money on this very important public facility to ensure that it receives many visitors who praise it we have our tenant gardens containing many important species however the presentation standards have declined when compared with the past and importantly when compared with other world-class Botanic Gardens we asked for but we have not received the information the levels of employment in various categories necessary to achieve the primary objective of looking after what is already in the place in the Botanic Gardens before embarking on the various projects that might further enhance the Botanic Gardens some projects we say are not necessary such as upgrading the children 's played facilities given that now the new Margaret Mae family playground has been built in the Central City we do when looking at the draft annual plan we find it difficult to get indication and what provision is made for personnel for the Botanic Gardens funds for capital works like access bridges is one thing but it takes more than physical structures to make the Botanic Gardens a must-see place so really asking the question by what measures does the City Council propose to monitor the adequacy of funding for the people skills needed to ensure the maintenance of world-class Botanic Gardens in Christchurch certainly we do not expect to see weed infestations or rose gardens with rampant black spot in the public domain in this garden city and then the third item Hagley oval and I 'm aware that there are others also presenting on this later today who will contain a lot more detailed information I 'm providing we wonder whether there is a contractual undertaking for the expenditure being made and continuing to be made on Hagee able especially as assurances were made by Canterbury cricket that it would not be asking for more money the ground had to be developed of the Cricket World Cup now of foundations for camera towers what 's next ID number three for three to eight in the council draft annual plan shows this specific facility gobbles up nearly double the amount to be allocated for other activities some receiving nothing which hardly seems fair or reasonable commercial cricket at this arena generates significant income but that income appears to vanish elsewhere and does not make a substantive contribution to the enhancement of the grounds and surrounds all the upkeep which has left for the ratepayer to cover it appears to us that a sweetheart deal for Canterbury cricket in New Zealand cricket when compared with the financial arrangements entered into by other councils in New Zealand such as the Bay Oval at Mount Maunganui the Christchurch City Council would appear to be exceedingly generous with rate payer incomes monies it is time for greater transparency regarding the funding relationship between the City Council and the benefices beneficiaries of the facilities at Hagley oval and the Civic trust endorses the information that 's going to be presented to you by Lindsey Carse or later today thank you questioners clean okay thank to see so if you 're looking at the council 's accounts can you tell me what you can see about Hagley I know how can i I 'm just trying to find another way to say it or ask it I mean do those figures are they easily define easily access accessible and they 're no the short answer no okay but some homeworks been done by others and they 've dug and found okay but it 's not easy well general citizens wouldn 't find it very easy okay thank you all right yeah okay thank you very much and obviously there 's some work to be done in terms of the Botanic Gardens but I thank this general view around the table that we need to make sure that we have a world-class facility it 's you know the heart of our city really keeps me belong we 've saved three and a half minutes okay thank you very much well that 's very ideal because they 're due to break for afternoon tea and I 'm not sure if the next submitter is here yet are oh okay sorry I thought they weren 't here well that means we 've only got five minutes chained sorry because we 've got to be back here at 20 and it is 19 so _"

    "text": "um living-wage Christchurch what 's your name again our chairs come forward I feel like I was coming home I know welcome Ben thank you welcome home thank you lady mayor and councillors my name 's what did you just call me a lady madam I was gonna say me an but I didn 't think you don 't know I would much rather you see the angel okay and he meet your worship that I do know graciousness I 'll do liam 's I 'll do Leanne because I 'm more comfortable with that you will have read our submissions so I won 't go through the the entire submission with you but I 'll draw your attention to some salient aspects first of all the living wage movement is non-political it is comprised of faith-based groups secular community groups and unions 76 organizations across New Zealand the living wage figure is independently assessed by the New Zealand facility center of Social Policy Union so unit so it 's it is researched it 's not just thrown out of a hat now we are aware that Christchurch City Council and the need to have social housing that helps to address this many organizations and individuals look to the council to help protect some of the most vulnerable members of our society through services that they provide and this is commended however it is when some of those very people who work for firms that are contracted by the council and undertake services either for the city council or crisis City Holdings are living in poverty good contractors know the current system of tenders based purely on lowest price has led to an unsustainable race to the bottom and is delivered increased poverty City Council and crisis City Holdings should look to create and implement responsible contracting practices as part of its procurement policy to encourage these good contractors and to ensure that the City Council continues to be a leader in fighting poverty within our region the current rates of nineteen eighty per hour is moving to 2020 on the 1st of July we know that a very large number of council employees currently earn above that rate and that is a very good thing however there are still there at by a long way you will remember councillors one of the recent submissions that we delivered before you are we invited a cleaner in crisis City Airport working nights she worked nights and lived in very cold damp house her and her four children lived in one room that that was the only room that they could for to heat and they had lines in that room to dry their wet washing she told you that the only time that they could afford vegetables was on payday the rest of the days until payday came again it was fill-in food and he said bread and rice just to fill their tummies this can 't_''_284.99 be a reality of workers in our city today when we asked Molly what being paid the living wage would mean to her she said it would mean that I could go to the shops like normal people Molly was so poor in her mind she was abnormal and she is employed as a cleaner on lights in Christchurch City Airport the living wage steering group does understand that the the council has ongoing wage was not even mentioned in the in the 2015 long-term plans shortly after that presentation and we are very disappointed that it doesn 't doesn 't it does not appear to be included but in the 2017 plan the living wage strongly believes that the City Council should be working towards becoming a living wage employer much in the same way as Wellington is and Auckland City Council 's are working towards becoming this would mean a commitment for the inclusion of the living wage in the 2018 and 2020 8 long term plan work would need to be done prior to this and we strongly urge the Christchurch City Council to undertake this as a priority we have full recommendations and al are still Ian to explain to you thank you I 'm happy to be supporting the living wages submission because I work with a social service agency and as we 're all aware child poverty has been intractable in New Zealand for quite a long time regardless of who was in government but we 're seeing a new thing in recent years where a fifth of that 's our our large concern in this area we have the recommendations that the term that chair said I I wonder at some point if it would be better for us to hear recommendations from the council because I know you 've you 've passed resolutions around the living wage numerous times and and so I 'm not sure where the blockages are but it might be more helpful for the living wage to hear from you and in coming days to find out where those blockages are but at the moment we 're after now we 're asking that the Christchurch City Council undertake a report to identify just how many directly paid employees below the living wage rate that the City Council obtained reports from those contractors that deliver services on a regular and ongoing basis to find out how many of their employees are paid below the balloon wage rate these reports be completed by December 2017 to enable that information to lead the discussion about the inclusion of the living wage in the 2018 to 28 long term plan and that inclusion would be in and that the council creates an implements responsible contractor practices as part of their procurement strategy so happy to answer any questions if there are any I think the reports are almost completed so it won 't it won 't be long that we 'll be in a position to consider those and they may have to be updated but the new rate but work has been going on for quite some time there are a number of issues that are raised obviously around direct employment and around contractors especially where you can 't influence what contractors pay their staff and other places although there is a mechanism for potentially resolving that as well but that 's through procurement policy and of course as you know there are Auditor General guidelines that we have to follow so obviously that will lead to a conversation with the Auditor General as well so we 're taking it very seriously but there 's a lot of work going on in the background the one question that I asked the other day and I 'll ask again as I 'll ask it to the you know the 10% of an elephant 10% of a mouse you know if you 're on a percentage wage increase then obviously you get a hell of a lot more cash in your hand if you 're on a higher salary so other unions now looking at being a little bit more flexible around receiving more on a percentage basis for the people at the bottom and lease on a percentage basis for the people at the top I can answer that because I wear two hats and I can speak from a union perspective as well it 's fair to say that the union is passionate about addressing the unions are passionate about addressing poverty we 're looking at it 's several ways I understand that in recent collective employment bargaining with the council there were bigger percentage increases for those on lower rates than they were for those on higher rates I personally am engaged in collective employment bargaining with big food sites and I look at addressing that by giving a proposal of a dollar increase as opposed to a percentage increase that does invite education understand the bigger picture about the need to take people out of poverty I think you picked up on the way that the management of the organization has responded to our desire to get things done ahead of any formal decision so the approach is one that I think has the ability to get to the result but without being a cost on the ratepayers of Christchurch because I think the biggest fear that people have is that Christchurch City Council pays this higher rate of minimum wage and the people who don 't get a higher rate of minimum wage have to pay higher rates if it can be done in a way that 's kind of almost like a fiscal envelope then you get the benefit of the lower being brought up but you don 't get the ratcheting whether they call the escalation clauses of the relative volatilities absolutely here we were totally aware of this we 've been engaging on living wage bargaining 's for many years now and it 's a common issue that 's brought to us how do we how do we address looking at doing it yet you know bigger increases for those at the bottom either by a fixed dollar which is easier to deliver to a ratification meeting or get worker buy-in so that the people at the top say actually I don 't need the money as much as they did so we go about two ways yeah I 'm Andrew and then on I 'm afraid with the anise touched on a number of the things that I was going to question but I do have one further question and thanks for the presentation this afternoon it 's certainly clear that you 've recognized some of the the challenges that we have in terms of identifying who might be paid below the living wage and not only within this organisation but with our contractors and through CC HL and so on so reasonably complex set of relationships in terms of the council family if you like presumably that means that you 're open to what you might think of as a stepped approach as we go through that some of which is around procurement policy some of which HL and subsidiaries to to follow once we 've done there absolutely Andrew that 's that 's very very very much the way that we 're achieving the results that we are achieving sometimes to expect these things to happen overnight is non realistic but a commitment towards a journey to is is very very welcome because some things can 't_''_811.05 be cracked straight away but they can be achieved over a period of time but but thank you all very much for coming today it 's much appreciated thank you _"

    "text": "right ikurou district promotions Polly Hollander and Andrew Dalgleish hi welcome thank you nice to see you afternoon million councilors I 'd like to introduce us I 'm Holly Hollander I 'm the executive officer of acara district promotions and this is Andrew Douglas he is our current board chair our district promotions or ADP we have a very big job to do in our corolla we do the marketing and promotions for our town we also do events and we 've also been working with the cruise industry and they 're just a few of the things that we are busy with over there one of our main objectives is to get people like yourselves Cantabria nz and other visitors over that big hill to come and enjoy our area up around the bays to come and stay in to come and spend money over there so we support the businesses but we are the link in the vital link between tourism end community we have certainly appreciated the funding support that we have received from city council over the years with your grants you 're strengthening communities grant the help and support that we have received from the council so thank you so much for that we have also very much appreciated the support that we 've received financially from Christchurch and Canterbury tourism and we 've received good funding from them over the last year 's we are now sitting in a very insecure position with the new entity and Andrew will speak about this as well but we really need to find some cure secured funding from the new entity and I know Andrews working you 're working with the new CEO there so that we can have it an MoU in place and we really ask for councils Court for moving forward for us and and our funding we feel in a Corolla that we are often the squeaky wheel complaining a lot don 't forget us we 're over here we 're over here we are part of Christchurch remember we feel that when it suits the City Council we are the jewel in the crown and when it doesn 't suit we 've forgotten and we 're sorry about that but we will lobby and we will continue to get our voice heard and I know some of the community board people have voiced their frustration as well at our ATP board meeting last night some of them and said that they feel that they feel powerless they don 't feel supported and it 's really unfortunate when you hear people from your community board saying that around the table as well so ongoing issues we have you need to look at in the annual plan boring I know toilets have any of you been to the recreation ground toilets and I throw up antiquated that here 's an old pool flush thing you know we 're a tourist town is this how we like to have our toilets always leaking water coming out of the floor dark no lights in there you name it it 's totally integrated so please seriously can you look at the toilets in akaroa and the annual plan the other thing is the rubbish bins boring again I know always complaining we are there always overflowing the contractors aren 't empty and the response from council was didn 't it not quite the right solution to emptying rubbish bins as well will remove them Victoria spoke on Tuesday a new submission about the sea walls there are gaping big holes along the footpath at the moment and we urgently asked you to look please if the sea will walls into the main pedestrian walkways and occur along along the waterfront yes so interview them talk about their representing today okay think sorry after the treated wastewater project with Chikara is currently working through the council 's working through for eka right the main Wharf is a next biggest ticket item there 's I could live in million that 's been flagged and therefore that and we would just like to encourage the council to come and talk to us and the stakeholders so that we get something that 's fit for purpose the Civic trust will tell you we need something that goes back to the 1950s it 's been added on to and added on to and added on to but it 's not a single commercial entity like the port its multi-use a lot of the engineers and the other people who are working on that just so that we get something that meets what we need going forward and routing has often said that we need to just wait until the crews birth announcement is made and then we see what is needed to go into that space I guess so that announcement has been made so we 'd now like to be part of that process going forward to discuss how it comes about counter with more of that or oh that 's pretty much really yeah just as Holly said our funding over the years has been rather ad-hoc from our CCT and the City Council we greatly appreciate it but the activities that ADP has done to date tend to follow successful funding grounds that sort of stop go stop go we 're really proud of what we 've achieved as a second biggest point of entry for overseas visitors Christchurch and Canterbury and we now know that we need a strategic outlook going forward rather than just a piecemeal one we look forward to creating a new partnership with the lump sum funding rather than just piecemeal nature we 've had we do need strong support from Christchurch in Zed and the City Council as we adapt to a new business environment post the cruise ship announcement and entertain has been busy astok and keen to help us build a more productive relationship with their community board and the City Council when we look forward to growing this anything else so view any questions bees yeah let 's start with tongue oh thank you it 's just the visitor strategy nice Thank You Edie and all this kind of thing that 's got a we 've also served at the Beast rebuild infrastructure but obviously it seems that that that 's not been included in a Corral at the other stage have you looked through the visitor strategy and seen very robust I think this journey in itself is extremely disappointing it 's very Christchurch focused and there were a lot of submissions around that for Bates punch I just say hey what about us I mean we are one of the second biggest gateways to Christchurch being the cruise airport the visitor strategy so yeah I think again the the lack of akaroa content in there and recognizing it for its value I guesses but what was your question well I guess technically you only like at the moment you at one of the big gateways because it the the limit ins technically close but it is one of the key destinations for visitors when they come here so it 's not a gateway just per se but it is a very important visitor center so therefore that you would have thought that those key points would have been in there so I was just asking had you looked open what we thought about that so here 's the draft one that came out I think there 's possibly three sentences and 36 pages with something that referred to a car I mean we were pretty disappointed I mean that the comments are attributed on change and tech we 've ever the comments attributed to the meet with cruise ship announcement that a chorale will be relieved now that Cruise is going back to Christchurch I mean or to about us you know we do need to advocate better for sure I could quote you the whole quote different everything I see no as I see it attributed but from where we come from it was just seen as a lot of people who advocated getting rid of them and it was really hard to and what I said was that aquarelle would continue to be a destination for issues because there are boutique cruise liners that will never want to go to Littleton they 'll always want to go to a garage so so our I will always be there but I am a bit concerned about the the French fest because and also just about your general you know yeah well it your idea about almost re-engaging at the level of share an idea to engage the community and professional and ideas to help rebuild the city 's cultural and recreational offerings but with an ogre or lens you know and I I mean I 've taken to describing my role as the as the mere further for the city in for the peninsula you know because part of Christchurch City you 're part of crush it City Council boundaries and the language doesn 't work it 's we are a district and a city that has been joined together where this is also you know Christchurch visitor strategy I mean where is the inclusion of Banks Peninsula and that yeah because that 's the price shifts that he counts this is and that 's why but and and the visitor strategy does need to go deeper then then that but the point that I 'm making is is that are you sort of saying that I mean really there 's two to two things that you 're asking for one is for a relationship agreement really with the with the city so that you are able to be funded on a you know on a three-year basis so that you 've got security and peace of mind in that regard you actually don 't want as volunteers within your community to take back the responsibility for French fest what you want is for that to be very much a part of our our understanding and memory-foam isn 't an event just for the people of our odds an event for our city and our region well I just we 're a village and we 're under is almost as far as you know you know we 're trying our best to find funding for that person to help coordinate French festival when we should really be focusing on other things yeah yeah I 'm clean Thank You Holly and Andrew just aside from any council funding over the cruise ships has there been any work carried out over a cruise ship income and its ability to contribute towards local visitor infrastructure well council don 't do jam-jar accounting as you know so there 's been a lot of you know people in the village saying well they we need a cruise levy you know five dollars a cruise passenger put it into the infrastructure but they 're always the answer to that is we don 't do council don 't you jimjo County I 'm just thinking Beck 's Peninsula I mean you 'll know from open public conversations over-representation review develop contribution conversations also that have alluded to this to banks peninsula still sits apart in a way so if it 's gems are accounting that suggests to me a BAU approach so maybe we need to look at what 's actually going to work I mean it if we 're just using the approach we use for the rest of the city and don 't do something different I mean you 're only two places where cruise ships can go yeah is that there is obviously some other questions but we 've come to the end of the time and I 'm actually going to suggest that that we will have a bit of a conversation at there other questions that we could forward to you we 'll do that through Andrew because obviously you 've got a good working relationship with your local councillor and you know we want to make sure that that dialogue is maintained and we 'll obviously be talking to staff also about the mo UC Davis because I think that 's a very good way of getting us back onto a good footing it 's what we want yes yes okay thank you _"

Farmers submission on the city 's draft annual plan for 2017-18 my name is Nick Clark I 'm a Christchurch based policy manager with federated Farmers of New Zealand with me is pam richardson a banks peninsula farmer and a member of federated farmers and someone who probably doesn 't need a lot of introduction to people we ground here i assume that councillors have read our submissions so i won 't spend too much of your precious time and the time we have available restating what it says a lot of it will be familiar to people from past versions we 've made what we would like to do though is focus on a couple of specific issues of our submission federated farmers and individual farmers have been heavily involved in the district plan review by all accounts has been an exhausting process i 'll let Pam talk about this process but we 're keen to ensure that the reviews completion and implementation is adequately funded and within less we request the council to consider a contestable fund for bicycle by diversity protection and management just as a number of other territorial authorities and regional councils have done in new zealand recent times farmers are also concerned about the state of rural roads on the peninsula and we are keen to ensure the council looks at its road spending and its road activities on the parentheses ensure that the roads are kept up to scratch it you know let Pam talk more about this and I 'll now hand over the pen for her perspectives on these issues I 'm sorry I 've got so many hits but today I need to talk about the significant ecological sites and the issues around that I talked about it last year if you remember last year I think I might have year showing that we had 150 hectares with two sites identified in our property I just really want to reinforce that we need to actually finish the district plan process that has been ongoing for many years for us on being potentially we 've been involved with this since 1983 when she Wilson started as walk walk across banks peninsula and then you fall over in front of you you can either throw it away you can cut it up and use for a note paper or you can read it and understand the issues and I 've given you a free folder to use to keep all that information all together so it 's about recycle and use so this was this is the route of of of all the work that 's been done on banks peninsula and continues I 've just given you a page of it one of the other pages in that document there talks about nature and farming is another one and the Richardson family element and also the the gentleman that 's written this document has written this this article that I put by 2050 now if there are encourages read it it 's about how we all as a community can look after our heritage and our indigenous vegetation and how we get involved so I am looking forward to hearing and I think there might be something in the pipeline I hope that there is a contestable fund underway there is considerable work that 's going to be continued with landowners I 'm aware and we are part off pigeon Bay and port levy a part of a pilot project that 's going on at the moment during a farm plan a farm environment plant and curating a biodiversity management plan so we are working with the City Council team plus beef and lamb new zealand and the landowners of pigeon Bay and Payerne port levy to go forward with that we 've had our first meeting and we 've got another meeting at the end of the month so I just you know welcome that support that 's being given to us and I hope that there is some funding to support that process by identifying significant indigenous vegetation or to other areas on beings peninsula doing the same sort of thing with landowners and so that we 're all on the same ear in the same room at the same time learning about our significant indigenous vegetation and out light and and surrounding lines around those properties and working with an ecologist that the council has some that 's going to continue working with us over the next time frame so I won 't say much more about that I 'll let you ask me some questions I 'd like to because some I know that you 've raised this before but it just occurred to me because you know there is that sort of you know really apparent line you know that 's drawn along the sort of side of our natural landscape that divides so and from criteria so I mean is there any point and actually doing this collaboratively with the Selwyn District Council well this is Christchurch City Council statutory responsibility and I stand there but in terms of understanding our environment in these areas of significance significance yes would it be would it be and it just seemed to me that the dividing line between the two the city and the district does not you know it 's you know you don 't spot as you 're crossing with as it crosses the no definitely not you know there would be probably an advantage in that we already have done that with the Canterbury regional biodiversity strategy that was done a number of years ago and that was across the whole of the whole of the districts in Canterbury so that has already been done but there 's not a huge area an hour in the Christchurch City Council area though that 's our main tools I actually would have thought it would have been worthwhile to reach out to our neighboring districts and maybe it is a Canterbury approach that would be worthwhile but I mean I understand the funders as definitely our responsibility and as is the responsibility under our district plan I do get there but I just wonder sometimes I mean we have responsibility for the coastal deserts chapter for example also in our district plan but working collaboratively across might like to think how share of it as unique but it 's not we do have an in network but Environment Canterbury is leading so there is a network there already in place mmm that 's contributing to knowledge and things but we just want to see the project completed on banks financial now we 've been involved with it while they were identified in 19 between 1983 and 1990 through this this document was produced in 1992 yeah the district plan came out in 1997 with a lot of our ApS on it that farmers weren 't aware of and then since then we 've actually been in and out of court or resolving it in some sort of ways so we just want to see it completed it 's a challenging task there 's over 600 sites on banks Peninsula ya know and if you can protect heritage you know homes you can certainly help us it along way too well that was a big of unmet sentence but here are their homes are there any other questions are there any questions on the other aspects of the roads on banks financial have had a very hard time over the years there 's still the old roads that were put on the early 1900s and we need to look at the structure of those and start looking after them a bit more soundly than what has been in the past that is something that begins statutory that 's it that 's a very much a regional priority we 're they such and in terms of the I 'm going to say the wrong name of the one strategy the GPS and the in the regional land transport program or whatever someone help me out here these are our rural roads state highway roads yes I understand that but to get funding from NZTA it has to meet a certain criteria for priority 43 53 percent or something like that or 40 something to say yeah yeah I 'm Sarah thank you on a slightly different topic quite a bit of the submission here and talks about rates and the rates increase and and 3.2 that you can hear it to the CPI in the local government cost were still in that recovery regeneration phase it 's a fair comparison with other councils and things when there 's still so much damage and so much needs doing yeah that 's a good question and I think over the over a longer period ten years the amount of rate the rates revenue from the council has doubled in that period and part of that was pre if quake a lot of that 's been poster with quake and certainly looking at the the forecast the increased rates increases are going to continue at a more than CPI rate and totally totally accept and understand that with the rebuild and regeneration there is going to be a higher than CPI or higher than even L GCI rates increase but I guess from a ratepayers perspective while we obviously welcome that work we just we just need to make sure that it all meets serve al you for money tests and things like that any other no all right up down I 'll give you an extra 45 seconds so I 've got a little cheeky question actually would federated Farmers mean you were looking at in your submission you are sort of saying that you might not want that and maybe look at sponsorship opportunities and if in federated Farmers be open to their I wish I wish we had that sort of money available honestly it 's not that I 'm not being flood idea not we 're not for probably I think that what you were saying is is that when we when we want to do discretionary spending we should actually not just look to our rating base is that we should look to external sponsorship partnership opportunities you know and often you know naming rights and things like that can reduce operational cost so that they would think a ways of operations there and I think that was a very sensible you know suggestion to make around some of these things because I think there are businesses who would like to see our kids get access to swimming work differently thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "was in salt boat safety at naval point once it makes me again calliní boots jibiji gugu and accounts us thank you very much for allowing us to sum up today and introduce our group which is Roger rock from Oso and even husband I 'm Roger Allen part of this group the purpose of this project is to establish a safe environment for people of it from a greater Christchurch area taking part in aquatic activities on lyttelton harbour this must include safe access to and from the water than all river and sea conditions a phone survey of five thousand twenty five people was conducted to establish the extent of public support for this project all participants gave their support the percentage of participants residing in the various wards is as follows and this is a percentage of across th ratepayers Echo Arena this is what the old board boundaries because it was done for their port recovery plan we were Pegasus and you can see there the list of the various groups note that there 's only fourteen percent of the users of this facility outside of conducted by Eric banks in question city councillors initiated on the 28th of April and runs through two other thirty of the May so will let results comes out we 're going to look at any things that 's raised with that and we will deal with those accordingly it was supported by Colin lot as Commodore of the Yacht Club and possibly the Commodore we think for this year well in here in Canterbury trailer Yacht Squadron we 're preserving 150 trail yachts and what 's my who 's been the membership services person for the club neighbor pond club and also representing cya we 've also had support and fantastic support from the banks furniture community board rights with this whole project including the previous board that we had the navel point public boat ramp is extremely well used with 393 launchings over Waitangi weekend alone may add that a lot of those people that before people to a vote so that comes around to over a thousand and the often were extended family groups we Western stall is floating GT this year as a permanent fixture but a temporary option which can be relocated and accommodate any possible future relocation on the boat ramp we may consider as part of the magazine Bay a development which has been ongoing at the moment and then we just have a look back this projects been going since 1993 and so it 's gone a long time and it 's lacked funding at select support and it 's just been totally ignored and it 's really really disappointed the next slide shows separating public from the the public that use the public ramp and does also to cover it but separating away hand launch from motor launches the main safety concern there now 2013 we had the whole community board we had the counselors we had a large number of staff from the council and they totally engaged in this whole process and we had 100% support from it that hasn 't changed any of the survey we 've done since the next one shows the conditions when they deteriorate from what 's predicted in the weather and it shows how difficult it is to try and deal with and pointed out that that pictures a typical southerly so that there 's probably coming midday after after a camp start of the day retrieving a bro both on those conditions is almost impossible that without some damage and safety issues so we concern that prison Coast which has no suitable facilities to safely launch and retrieve vessels from Luton and harbor under adverse conditions and particular sail vessels which have limited power and maneuverability the boat is consumers from southerly and southwesterly storms which arrive abruptly and unpredictably in developed large seas very quickly this was in their crew who are cooled out by these conditions must seek shelter within the bays on southern side of the harbor until conditions improve this is only possible for experienced sailors with suitable vessels imposes a great three to youth sailing around the harbor and large groups and one rule vessels the existing Inner Harbor boat area near the drydock does not offer a sheltered limited use facility however has no trailer parking warranty rigging areas very limited booth egde is situated a long way from we boat trailers apart to naval point cannot accommodate the retrieval of many vessels during a storm event these ones are often damaged against the existing timber fin fin de GT alongside the public eye cream when retrieved and sadly conditions as the wind and waves push the boats into the GC in 2016 they have been to no an injury ex incidents bruising to the body and broken arm having a cue ball trying to protect boats from being pushed into the existing finger GT so the proposed facility will universe a minimum of four thousand and twenty five people from the grade of Christchurch communities so the proposal the proposed floating GTA locator on the south side of existing public Bahrain will complement the proposed water sports facility development provide an immediate low-cost improvement about safety the proposal consists of three components are fixed timber access GT a 12 meter gangway between the XS GT in the floating GT and a 20 meter times five point two five meter floating GT constructed from five existing concrete break arenas the estimated cost of the proposal is 220,000 which excludes private contributions or of approximately 100,000 which will help reduce the wave heights adjacent to the boat ramp and reduce ujj on the ramp will be easily accessed from the water over the full tide range being positioned on the south side of the ramp the DC will allow vessels to approach into the wound under suddely conditions giving them greater control once the long side pieces can be guided onto a trailer by leaching out lines from the GT and using the one to tolerate the vessels onto the trailer but GT allows vessels to booth on both sides which will greatly improve the efficiency of the boat ramp at peak usage nel our recreational boat users to recover the vessels quickly and safely in condition to come um safe from water and so this is sort of a diagram of the proposal we have a floating GT which means it 's easy to access on all tides at present the camber that current timber GT at low tide is very hard to climb up onto in and rough conditions can it can be quite dangerous trying to get up on me and this is just trailer and poor with the conditions it means you can disembark the vessel hold it with lines and then you can walk the boat onto the trailer so you have the boat and complete control the whole time making it a lot lot easier it also means at its low tide you 're at water level so it 's a lot easier Turks to some park and control your boat where you 're doing there it so there the costings so we 've done an engineer 's evaluation of the cost so that we feel the approach to the project is around two hundred twenty thousand dollars this is based on using some voluntary labor and it does include the the cost of the breakwater units which is approximately one hundred thousand dollars they 've been effectively gifted by the owners for a period of two years today the port company confirmed that we were able to use the walkway and the pontoon which is in the Inner Harbor which is used for access to the killer 's and this will be available from August and this may help conservative to the ones that are already in the harbour the qra results came out and we knew pretty well what was going to happen and we said it was going to have limited effect and the results have showed exactly what we 'd found out from those which we 've done so these are just a few photos of similar facilities around here on the Left that 's the current fury terminal at Littleton constructed from the same breakwater units so as we look very similar to this that has the answer powered in place and are very secure and top right is the gain way it 'll be similar to the gain way that used to X 's the GT from the adjacent ground now you can see here from the meetings we 've had from 1993 when the first plan was done mm and the marina development blow apart 2009 the safety group was formed due to public pressure the community wanted to see some action see some things done and we 've gone through the whole consultation process right through to where we are now and we represent the community board two staff members Joan Blackford with Kay hold on others we here to discuss the construction phase which is what we 're at at the moment and may the seventh City Council and diversity to present to the boat safety we 've also done the final placements the Casa City Council to seek funding for the construction to the project which is operational for 2017 2018 summer season and that 's what we 're hoping to do with our project and you can see there 's a number of things on the right-hand side here one to six that 's the order of what we 'd like to see them done because that 's the way we think we can fund what we 've got to do and when we get to the stage of the marina but which is in a bit of a problem at the moment cuz the Inner Harbor there 's forty percent of the people looking at vacating that and they can 't go here because there 's no protection so had we have had this repaired or some work done those and the next one 's just a number of slip ways and things I think that 's quite interesting to see how poorly represented we are and then demons can read in it you know this said this group has been lobbying since 2009 but the issue has been in previous 1993 there has been no improvement to the public boating facilities enable point the proposal has tabled an outline biocells an extremely cost effective design which will add enormous Lee to the existing launch and retrievals the retrievers facility we have talked extensively about the negative s safety aspects of the existing facilities particularly when the southerly blows up after a calm start to the day with the proposed design using the concrete pontoons generously organize buzz-buzz March from March construction with their weight and angle to the southerly will have an enormous effect on reducing the wave action that rolls on to the boat ramp making for a safer safer boat retrieval operation this design will have enormous safety benefits to the launch and retrieval of boats in summary that this will be a major safety improvement other facilities around the country and the world actually and a good cost-effective robust design that complements the existing facility improvements to the public area at navel point voting facility is long overdue this facility has the ability and does generate income through a user Pay system with improvements to the facility listen itself will attract more users right now what the community board would spaulos with mr. chairman are we went through the process for last year and it was still held up by the QRA you can see there the list of things we had total support from them and they wanted to see some introduction of the proposal so we 've got a lot of support from that and just in summary I just want to acknowledge the work that 's been done by their list there also we 've had a lot of support from Andrea wild and Amy Hart from the community board staff and also the support and by much construction and that list of people here I think it 's been fantastic we 're only seeking 218,000 we 're not looking at a absolutely feud 's to the community wondering I don 't use it even Rob don 't use it either we were asked by the community to try and come up with a proposal and thanks to a cell on a very good work I 've done with design we 've been able to come up with that and just in summary here the project to date has been supported by the venture industry community board due to the major safety beenit 's from benefits from the community and ratepayers we know that the investigation is going on now but the date for that is the 30th of May when that will be finalized so we 'll have the information on that if there 's any changes needed we will look at that with their engineers the quality of risk we 've covered that the project had full support from counselors at the last presentation we did and we think that was fantastic we thank them very much for that and just in summary there we all think that the council counselors will support this project as a high priority low for 1718 annual plan this year and were happy to answer any questions I don 't know that you 've left time for questions where are we I 'm afraid not so I 'm really sorry about that but we have to share the time you know with what submitters as as we 've indicated and it 's ten minutes for groups I do try to ask people to leave a little bit of time for questions but thank you I mean you 've been presented to many of us before and I will certainly take your concerns and to into account as we consider the annual fee and I think the last time we had a really serious look at this was the long term plan and may well be that that 's the appropriate timeframe for this as well given the work that 's going on at natal point but but but we will we 'll work on that and certainly let you know how we go okay thank you very much thank you very much the mayor and councillors _"

writing and training and racing for the past several years we 've been rated as New Zealand 's premier downhill and a geomap boat club by writers and independent organisations members range from 10 to 57 with the current membership of 380 Plus approximately 50 volunteer workers and people helping the club caters for male and female writers with a significant amount of Club committee being women and one female member embarking on the World Cup circuit as we speak I suppose you could say that our home base is Victoria Park where we enjoy very close long-established relationship with your CCC Park Rangers as stated in our submission we 're a nonprofit organization registered with the Charities Commission and pump 100% of our expenditure can be broken down into the following areas training we pay elite riders to train young and old riders giving skills with it otherwise be learnt the hard way by clogging up the emergency wards at hospital touchwood our accident rate has improved dramatically since we 've initiated these courses we also actively follow the mountain bike New Zealand guidelines for concussion awareness in conjunction with all our club activities and encourage all riders to be mindful of these dangers shuttle days the club owns its own fleet of bike trailers to shuttle riders outside race days and husbands to offer members of manage days writing without the need to have car loads of private vehicles on dice Pass Road congesting it track building in conjunction with the victoria park ranger station we combine workdays regularly with the park to maintain rebuild tracks after a summer race season manpower food are provided by the club tools directions supplied by the rangers for up to 30 volunteers at a time must be remembered that whilst we endeavour to maintain tracks with the crush park rangers it 's not only for to all of these tracks as well post-earthquake 2011 were forced to move away from the city tracks and living springs track to Methvin where we collaborated with bike Methvin and to this day continue to support one another this partnership culminated in us running the 2014 Oceania mountain bike championships a tier 2 category UCI international event with us raising over 60,000 in private sponsorship for two small clubs this was no mean feat sponsorship gravity prides itself on being financially stable enough to assist riders nationally and internationally at events promoting their own personal development and reduces a financial burden on parents to get them there a funding lines are limited however through various foundations and donations along with our our own internal race day proceeds we managed to do a lot about gravity Canterbury in the draft annual plan I assume I can move this sorry doesn 't matter that 's okay more accessible recreation gravity would like to see christchurch city council invest and building more mountain bike tracks on the port hills as a named item in the current draft annual plan are things as space program to add new trails and trails to cater to all levels we see the expansion of the mountain bike trail network as supporting councils approach to making its recreation facilities more accessible we encourage the construction of more trails for beginner intermediate and advanced riders we also encourage new purpose-built one-way trails for climbing and one-way trails for specific downhill riding this will help to avoid conflict between users and walkers mountain biking has the following benefits it 's very accessible from a recreation point of view it gets people out appreciating the environment it will contribute to lifting the general health of residents in Christchurch Christchurch as a destination for mountain biking an extensive trail network in conjunction with the Christchurch Adventure Park when rebuilt will help to make Christchurch a destination for people and is likely to contribute to the economy Queenstown rotary or our national examples of places where people travel to nationally and internationally to mountain bike tourism is to make tourism New Zealand sorry estimates one hundred and seventy one thousand visitors participated in some form of cycling in 2016 Christ church needs I think the Christchurch Adventure Park is a good example for the short term that it did run as to what 's happening it 's been evident from the initial success of the Adventure Park that it 's a viable investment although many who have used the facilities of wooden beyond their capabilities having facilities available for all levels outside the c.a.p will help to mitigate some of the accident we 've all been exposed to in the media through a well-defined beginners trials less pressure on other users to push their own limits and leisurely writing in an open environment with an excellent emergency access your range of next single Turner 's stated to me that currently the Victoria Park tracks have been loved to death and state the state of them being hammered in this way is dangerous it 's necessary for the council to open up new portions of the port hills to take pressure away from overused areas and a good example of this is the recent opening of the Montgomery spur track which has proven extremely popular mountain biking is not a shrinking sport it to the needs of tourists and our local people resilient facilities and resilient communities following the Port Hills fire we understand that the existing trail network did act as a natural firebreak either physicals either by physical separation eg bench tracking preventing spirit of flame or due to the sides of the trails having less flammable vegetation this is also an opportunity to plant native species improved biodiversity and sediment control an extensive trail network facility also benefits the people of Christchurch by making more a more livable city for the estimated 9% of the population that mountain bikes there is plenty of opportunity to tap into the volunteer spirit especially for especially following the fires and closure of c.a.p for both trail building and vegetation planting if maintained professionally the park and City ranges could could make funding go a long way with these volunteers and our help as a club we will undertake to make our own budget for an annual minimum spend of approximately 5,000 plus grants that we receive this may be a drop in the ocean for what 's required up there but we 're therefore Garrett gravity Canterbury would like the counts to support the development of more mountain bike trails in the port hills by contributing a named dollar amount to the line item in the current draft annual plan and the future long term plan specifically for the construction of new mountain bike trails supporting the groups of volunteer trail builders and maintained errs by providing materials tools and native plants I thank you for your time valuable time thank you very much and thank you for yours um Phil thank you and you mentioned that spirit of volunteerism and the work that 's being done on on Montgomery spirit yes so I 'm just wondering how in terms of that working with the Rangers was that something your club were involved with too and I 'm just sort of wondering what sort of how much time would your members have to you actually be able to assist with building tricks like happen and got on one currently they 're so keen without the lack of writing from CIP that build anything but a lot of that came from the Canterbury single so there 's a number of other organizations apart from ourselves we 're just here to help promote the good for all really not just downhilling not just in zero for everybody but yes every weekend we could turn out 30 volunteers hmm any other questions no thank you very much thank you for making your time available to us thank you um next _"

    "text": "right now we have the Christchurch Yacht Club Tuva kind some page 168 thank you you get up noon on Trevor kite with me is Layton Martin also a member of the club the history and understand is that underpin our submission has been well documented in previous submissions reports to the community board and to the City Council and all of them are reflect that a close cooperation between Council and the club towards common goal of establishing a proper walkway between monks Bay and Sumner rather than reiterate the previous cases I just like to summarize CY think ro streets Yacht Club intends to rebuild its boat shed and ramps and monks Bay and also incorporate a four meter wide section of the coastal pathway within the Yacht Club says start occupancy area of the history this will allow the council to widen the vehicle carriageway to the full legal Road boundary and also to have a separate pedestrian a walkway and cycle way outside the road reserve well without this arrangement the Coastal pathway concept cannot proceed Eastwood passed monks babe in addition cyc intends to build is accessible from both ends cyc first raise funds for this project in 2008 in a sense raise more than half the funds needed to complete to the finish specs deck stage the funders are now pushing for commencement of the project this year or return of the funds cyc has resolved the engineering issues completed the design obtained the resource consent in the building consent furnished attend to process and selected a contractor we 're now ready to commence building there 's a mismatch between the coastal pathway and cyc is timing in which the coastal paths were he has offered to correct by bringing forward a future approved funds to pay for the full meter wide section of the walk and we 're very grateful of their offer and asked the council to authorize our first request was to bring forward allocated funding to achieve this with regard to our second request for a capital grant of children 40 thousand dollars it would appear that completing a pathway from family to summer is only one stage of the coastal pathway concept and that there will be even greater resting and activity areas that will turn the pathway into a true community experience this boat shed digs and ramps will by default be one of those experiences in fact of all the resting and congregating areas on the coastal pathway this location is the only one that can be guaranteed to be out of the full force of the easterly wind it will also provide a precious intimacy with monks Bay and its waterborne activities for pathway users add on the large sticks and ligatures to the beach and water and the community will have a net access to unique facility when completed the post the curve way will significantly increase the number of people moving around the club and transiting the area and speeding type amongst bay already the club is experiencing significant conflicts of use for a car park and the single public launching ramp near the coab rooms it is not uncommon for cars jet boats ski jet skis yachts paddle boards and even swimmers to be competing for the limited amount of facilities in the area all at the same time part of the rationale the beach was to help to reduce these conflicts and the inherent risks that posed to people on foot in an overcrowded environment another part was a desire to make the entire length of the beach accessible to the community when designing the structure for limited unlimited public usage the clubbers face much higher costs than it would normally incur if it were to rebuild on it to a private standard on the original site these costs include higher structural loading requirements Council longevity requirements position did Xperia C were to provide for coastal pathway and in repositioning further seaward again to meet councils additional requests to place the walkway outside the road reserve the club has raised a significant amount of money and is now leading financial is now meeting funding resistance to a project still ahead of the club l the cost of its boat shed and its new club rooms all of us these reasons the club has made the secondary crease to the council for capital grant of children forty thousand dollars for the shared public use of the deck and ramps this is very close structure for multiple use in this location has not been easy and required that all structural components work together to support each other we can talk the walkway and we can talk of a deck and ramp section but in reality all sections are seamlessly integrated visually structurally and as a public utility only by fully funding the structure at least to the finish deck stage can it proceed and for this reason we ask that the council take on board now reasons and a rationale for a joint funding of the deck and ramp us we ask the council approved a second request of 240,000 construction because the in commenced almost immediately thank you any questions yeah Kara um just a quick one is this the best location for this to go back to where it was do you think under the circumstances it 's the best place to put a bit where we put it back or could it be no no is it the best place to put it so I just mr. good would it be the best place no well not at all because the primary objective was to achieve a walkway for the resonance around past the growing city was only 1 meter wide section of dirt track and to put it back there would mean that that 's what you would have here was accepted citizens were here and do you think bringing the forward the funding that 's allocated on project ID nine one four six do you think there would be any cost savings to the council if we brought forward the funding well and did the project were through so well within the cost we 've got at the moment I don 't see any bit of course it always the facial arrests there 's a lot of steel in the structure there 's always exchange rate risk of the steel okay so it 's just wondering if you 've been able to quantify some of those additional costs that you 've incurred due to the council 's requests to push it out further into the estuary so I know that it 's head you had to provide an extra four meters out for the coastal path when it meant and in the road reserve as well and I just wondering how much more expensive it is to build further into the eastery rather than back on your original site um it we 've found this quite hard to quantify in the sense that in order to in order to get this cost we 'd have to create a duplicate design and it seemed like it was an experience we didn 't need to do when it was always been our intention for the last eight years to achieve somewhere or other a three meter pathway envisioned it was a three meter pathway person and so to go to spend money creating that design would was really wasting your own resources so it 's quite difficult for us to do we know that the loadings that we could design your own structure to suite APA and the loading we 've had to design this as five kPa which is quite a significant difference that problem then I can 't answer and once this is built that will allow you to then do the raising the budget on top and then for coastal pathway behind their time it was a project was first envisioned as a boat shed for us and we 've scaled it back and are just applying all our funding to get to finish next stage and then we 'll have to start the process again of getting funds for the boat shed one of the reasons we 're quite keen on this is because once it was created we can design the club rooms without all the storage that it 's got in at the moment and then we 'll be able to design a club areas which is much more community orientated we 're in visiting that we could have areas downstairs and in public rooms upstairs and this sort of things so the end Club rooms which had been lunch Bay in the community cooked quite a different structure wants us boat storage is in place any other question thank you very much that 's um thank you very thank you making the time available to us thank you _"

date clearly there have been several higher priority milestones to achieve before we could find ourselves in this position today these have included major infrastructure projects insurance settlements and understand the true costs of repairing Lancaster Park throughout this process the temporary ami stadium has been a beacon of hope an example of what a city it 's passionate rugby community and some old fashioned Kiwi number 8 wire can achieve but that was six years ago the reality is that we now face significant operational costs to maintain what is a temporary stadium christchurch has a proud history of major rugby matches but also other high-profile concerts conferences and activities that have helped position christchurch on the world map we are particularly proud of rugby 's contribution to the red and black culture a professional lever level we seek our 9th MPC title over the past decade at amateur level we engage with 15000 registered players 1,600 coaches and thousands of volunteer administrators we also support the Christchurch City Council 's bid for all black Test matches which given the introduction of the global rugby calendar and our lack of world-class stadia continues to be a high-risk New Zealand rugby are seeking destination locations for all black Test matches and as such we can no longer rely on hardship we grow concerned that the commercial goodwill that once existed our business community is being replaced by pressure points and our sponsor portfolio the marketing research we conduct demonstrates a serious risk to our fan experience that will continue to decline our crowd attendance our submission today includes the following 5 points 1 the city has a recovery plan in place that details civic pride economic certainty business growth jobs and would hope that rather than addressing this project in isolation it is instead viewed as an extension of the cornerstone investment that has and will be made in the city over the coming years including an alignment with the convention centre and Metro facility in particular we believe that we have a role to play in connecting our extensive network of sponsors and stakeholders to corporate assets in the proposed facility precinct to ensure that the stadium has a heartbeat not just on game day but also during the working week we are committed to opening these doors and making sure that this project is sustainable in the medium to long term 3 Hagley oval has demonstrated the tangible benefits to christchurch and having a sporting venue to call home Hagley oval has attracted top international cricket matches including successfully hosting the 2015 Cricket World Cup the cultural and economic benefit to the city from Hagley oval has driven positive community sentiment and you multi-purpose arena will see opportunities for rugby rugby league football concerts and other community events and on even larger scale in Hagley ogle for a survey 2015 demonstrated that 94% of the community thought it was important for christchurch to be able to host a variety of large-scale national and international events with 91% of respondents believe in christchurch needs a modern mixed-used events venue it is also worth noting that 88 percent of respondents would accept a small rate rise in support of this project and 5 the temporary AMI Stadium in Eddington is just that temporary it has limited capacity lacks international standard corporate facilities it has become increasingly uncomfortable for patrons and difficult to access at busy times and most significantly prevents increasing presents increasing maintenance costs we understand that there will be an argument for ready to contribute to the cost of a new stadium to that point we would highlight that both the Crusaders and can be rugby currently contribute a significant tenancy fee in excess of 500,000 per year more than we did at lancaster park it is also worth noting that this fee is significantly higher than any other regular union in the country that is paying for the use of stadia in that respective city in summary our in Canterbury but in many ways we also transcend the game of rugby we believe that a contemporary future proved multi-use arena would serve the needs of all Cantabrian to achieve this vision we must come together as decision-makers and demonstrate strong leadership and we feel that time is now thanks thank you questions Jen um we 've obviously started work on this with the pre-feasibility I 'm just looking at some of the info are you I 'm convinced that we need a roof or not I 'm going to just kind of because when you 're talking concerts etc we 're talking about other vineyards and other places one of the risks we have in New Zealand is four seasons in a day which is a very different thing to say a rugby match but if you do think back and remember way way back to that previous Lions tour where we were going to activate the Cathedral Square which we did but just fortunately after the game should have the game we had one of the worst hail storms we 've ever had and it kind of thinking what are your thoughts on that we 're certainly of the view that having a roof will make it more multi-purpose that certainly for big events where there 's some risk of it being postponed because of weather and will be more attractive to promoters and tour operators and television rights people as well what to think some surety of being able to deliver the product from the stadium if it was not affected by weather and I do know for some of those large concerts as well the insurance premiums are considerably less if there 's a roof over the stadium that they can don 't have to insure against with a loss so quick second questions are presuming it 's the same for you and indeed are you at citris so for instance of that hailstorm had come in earlier and the previous Lions tour that you would be the same as any promoter that if it 's called off that you get a hit because of you 've got a refund tickets etc and you 'll be covered or you 'll be paying the same insurances 's obviously in everyone 's best interest of the river roof I just quickly follow up Trevor 's answer talk about the case study I guess in in Melbourne and the tennis stadiums and the fact that you know previously was one that was roofed and I think it 's almost three now the ability be able to bump in and bump out for the multiple events and and host other other sporting codes I think is a massive benefit we have that opportunity to future-proof the stadium now yeah great just testing you yeah obviously cost cost is a big one on developing US and state it what a venue like this and I 've seen some work done on some retractable inflatable roofs that are used overseas I quite like those they have a pretty long life and they 're North America where they get way heavier snow than will ever get so that would be one of course that would give us the ability to potentially have a real grass indoor surface which would be I think the first in the world cuz they 're all mixed us a point of difference but to make it even more attractive and put more people in the north side we could potentially have an embankment now this is my thoughts only this is not a council position but does the IRB allow for embankments now because I know that moved to a position where all major games had to be all seated have they reconsidered that in recent years given the cost of stadium around the world I 'm not aware that they have and I 'm not I 'm not aware of any stadia or arenas that have been built with standing only was part standing yeah I was only thinking about on one side I when I go to sport myself I normally stand my Adelaide Oval is probably the example that you use that has one end of the stadium that 's standing only right on and is that successful for me absolutely though the number one AFL attendance and competition I have such a bad memory of the embankment on a certain day I think it was 1986 was it when we lost oh sorry very much and appreciate your comments earlier as well I think that sometimes when we put pen to paper to write a submission on an annual plan and it gets picked up and interpreted in a particular way it was written before the pre-feasibility was announced so clearly I 've heard what you 've had to say in terms of the pre-feasibility I imagined Hamish vehicle say exactly the same thing when he arrives we 've got progress hypno it was clear that the council had to put the stadium multi-use Arena out onto out and our long-term plan if everything stacks up and we can get a good result one one for the city so that it does pay for itself and that 's the trouble you don 't want to build a stadium that 's empty every other day of the week and not full every Saturday either so we want to have a multi-use venue that is capable of hosting a range of things in Australia a lot of them are the convention centers you know that they 're not you don 't have a separate convention the facilities hotels etc so so I think that that that possibility will enable us to consider bringing it forward and the LTP but that 's a way way off but thank you very much for your submission thank you thank you _"

    "text": "Kristopher doubt me if I pronounced that correctly who welcome Thank You of Christianity and I 'm going to arc it home designer and my submissions which sir regarding the draft annual plan are as follows the first is the concerns of Robert mcdougal Art Gallery the draft annual plan includes funding to carry out whether tightness work and I fully support that work proceeding in the draft annual plan but I would further urge that the carrying out of any absolutely essential seismic strengthening work as soon as possible to enable the reopening of the gallery as one of the city 's art galleries it will be strongly supported by residents as well as tourists gallery which is gifted to the city is not gallery so continue be to be used as such and as director but in the deed of gift the lease offered to the canterbury museum some years ago should not be signed and all work in the facility including the new toilet block proposed in the draft botanic garden spatial plan must be pursued in accordance with an intention to reopen the gallery the gallery here what is essential to allow the early reopening of the gallery should be carried out and I just hope that the inner city West residents Association shortened to icon fully supports the submission I go into my second submission which concerns brie cliffs into rictus village streetscape that 's not included with any budget in the draft annual plan but it should be educated by just and carried out to complete the long-delayed main road master plan work through ricklefs including avenue tree planting on the north side of main road the masked adventurer start with infrastructure for instance underground the main road power lines the implanting large deciduous trees along the road each between parking spaces I only include this or rather detail of what might happen because these sort of things tend not to get into the master plan that we consult on from time to time I also support the provision of a footpath that Mara and cave on the south side of Main Road and I understand that may well be proceeding in any case are there any questions thank you do you know the expensive where the trees might be a couple thousand each but yeah and I don 't think the trees are the exterior issue C is probably between 2 and 1 million Pierre kilometer is that I don 't small of them yeah that the community boards got a workshop happening resolution to have a workshop getting an update on the whole undergrounding thing remember over north north open road no I have no memory of that whatsoever but that 's because I 've got quite brain so are there any questions thank you very much for your time much appreciated please look the next _"

    "text": "for thank you Christchurch school of gymnastics several welcome nice to see you yes and thank you chose are many many submissions you seem so sssay appreciate the opportunity to be here and talk to our submission enter but we 're not speaking for so many others that that 's what I was saying yeah I am can we just get this onto slideshow rather than and it 's a page 16 like this still to page 161 yes I go cool alright so um we appreciate the opportunity to be here to talk to our submission today we actually as a man see we 've been here many times before and and done with me today is Jane Clarke she 's on our building committee and also a life member of the club so she 's been a long time supporter of crash it 's called gymnastics so alright so in your draft annual plan you asked for the community in your way so you can work the council can work to deliver the facilities that our communities need so we 're a good example we we want to but it 's not fit for purpose anymore and we believe that we need support you can support the community to build the facilities you don 't need to do them yourselves sports such as domestics have specific needs that require fit for purpose facilities and it 's cheaper for the Cubs to provide staff and maintain a purpose sporting facilities then the council does so I can 't facilitate qe2 is damaged it is 62 percent of the new building code but is no longer fit for purpose is a significant participation in competition venue for it for gymnastics there are areas that are out of bounds we have floor levels that are not level anymore we have kitchen and some areas that we cannot use and most importantly a spectator mezzanine floor is restricted in numbers so it inhibits our opportunity to have people viewing our sport in in competitions as well so why support Christ ships college nurses to provide this new facility you support us because you 're investing in the physical and mental development of our children in normal circumstances we are a self-sustaining Club gymnastics and related movement opportunities to the community for 49 years next year next month we will be 21 years on qeii Park and with the only ones at the moment so we we believe it 's a big of a success story in itself we are a significant social and economic contributor the East we have for a club we 've got a large turnover also large expenses that we are making a profit just we employ lots of staff and we have bring lots of families and officials and gymnasts to Christchurch for our events so and we deliver also gymnastics class to 69 schools last year our increase in membership was 11% and our participation number over one hundred and ninety eight thousand and now that 's tuition hours that we deliver to children mainly young children but also adults as well we are the second largest club in New Zealand so council a CSG provided as I said not having ninety-eight thousand activity hours which is 1.98 million hours over ten year period and for what we 're asking the City Council to support us today the long-term plan the council investment in your Ric and sports areas I believe is 1 87 or you try to keep it under 2 22 that 's per person so this is the reach of our QE 2 venue this is where we draw our members from as you can see it 's a citywide facility and it 's very well used one the ones right down on the bottom left-hand corner is horse war where our Olympian came from Courtney McGregor so she traveled all the way to qe2 because we actually have the staff in the facility to put a where she was at the Rio Olympics last year so how can the SI council support domestics and CSG we 've been partnering with a council for 21 years okay to park the councillor can 't deliver everything but but we need your help to deliver your message to the community we can do it better then the council can but we need a commitment to a lease which is underway I 'm pleased to say but we also need a commitment to pay for the land for the building but we haven 't got the money to prepare the land that we want to build on we 've been very helpful as and also the community board and the staff and the council but we 're at the stage now we actually need a commitment so the project cost of rebuilding the the domestics facility is 8.1 million we have been paid out by insurance as I 've told this the council 's before we have 5.5 million already but we need and we 've got applications in for the rest of the funding apart from the remediation the land preparation and the fees and the consents which total 1.1 this is the concept drawing our first what sorry our fourth one I think it is grew up to and that 's where on Kure to park we 've actually applied for the lease the little blue but above the sport recreation centre is some our preferred site all right so it 's shared copper there 's some the there is a car park next to that blue rectangle and that 's where the number two will need to be refurbished so this is what we 've been doing so far we 've been partnered also the riser Foundation and the New Zealand Community Trust have already come on board and and confirmed funding and we have an opportunity to go to a community loan either race or the City Council have been talking to the cogs people here but the 1.1 million is something that we need to go further on the lotteries grant grants board is the applications in process or here shortly but we 're up against an up and away and the council 's application there for five million we 're only asking for 1.5 so we 're hopeful we 'll get some all of it but we 'll have to wait and see so our request is actually not on the current draft and your plan we have asked the community board and the council to staff to look at how this funding support can be confirmed so can go ahead we believe we 've been told by the acuity regeneration committee that there 's cost savings from the bestest removal going back into GE to park so we 're actually asking of peps this could be diverted to help pay for the remediation and the playing fields could be re-established a bit further down the track when they 're actually needed we don 't need the funds till next year as we as I said before we 've got some funds to keep us going and start the building and get roll under way but we do need a commitment so that we can actually design our building for the 8.1 million otherwise we 're going to have to cut some very necessary areas out of the facility sorry there is some on your printouts a little bit more about our some quotes throughout from our supporters and also some timelines where we 're at but in questions if you want to go back one slide but so you don 't you don 't need the funds until the beginning of the next financial year but you need to know that they 're coming and to the following financial year yes right okay thank you yeah yeah and they 've let you know John for sale David Beaty been working with yes able to that there are three possible funding scenarios there and everyone 's alluded to those and obviously working on the lease but it 's just getting this timing right you know it looks like an LTP it but we 're still hearing you need we need the commitment yes it 's an LTP but that needs a decision prior to that yeah okay like this surgery yeah you have to yeah on and on so yeah so it may well be that we don 't need to include it in this annual plan because it 's the following year but I think we should make a commitment to make a decision earlier in the piece so so that it 's not awaiting that conclusion of the annual plan next year alt painting society I think you yes Susan T so um but that 's incredibly helpful thank you okay David I think yes that 's obviously a crucial part of the equation is making a commitment to this project before we 've actually confirmed the long-term plan but certainly if we were able to would make life a little easier I just like to us a girl on the 1.1 million that is being required there was some discussion earlier about the need for CSG to demolish the existing building and whether or not as is at one point one does that include that or not no it doesn 't there 's a we had a quote for half a million in for the demolition but we believe the council are working with phantom a trust to see if they will be able to take it over as a warehouse that 's correct does not look like I just did wonder really whether that was part of the remediation and land preparation course of that budget but no that 's good because then it 's probably a an interesting aspect of the whole project is that we have a building on qe2 that for certain purposes would be quite adequate and we are working with another organized Oshin to see whether there is a potential use there which actually so it does go a long way to and that we have an existing building that we can help another organization substantially reduce their costs to council and storing equipment so there could be a win-win situation out of this hole at that fatum tuum was safe to council money yeah something like a hundred thousand dollars a year thank you got 13 seconds this VRT let 's just try to understand what um you previously have come to council and we had resolutions and I think it 's come through a committee until she 's committing levy to through the cheat committee so in terms of the idea of having some sort of overall concept for Kirito including your relocation are you aware of any planning or any anything that 's bringing all the projects together because I see you 've also mentioned should it boys high school saying that they might use it we 've also seen a presentation that are convenient what about the gem that they 're putting in their pajamas Council it 's a fitness gym right it 's yeah it 's just you know the bells and weights and things as a sort of overall kind of working group or plan which kind of utilizes all the synergies of what 's being proposed and makes sure that we 're not duplicating or wasting resource there is a qe2 regeneration council group going but that 's just a coordinator of the people on Park that are a building like the recreation and Sports Center passer schools and and in us but as far as coordinating activity we 're already there so I 'm not sure obviously we 'd like to be working with people at the polls to provide things and the schools who already work with us and I 'm I 'm aware of football groups wanting to move onto the onto the park as well but we 'll be happy to the master plan process due to start so that 's great yeah you 're already really there you 're already there looking yeah alright but um there 's just a little bit standing on the way of that so this is very much for coming much appreciated thanks for the opportunity to put it out the again okay okay _"

't_''_36.21 received any declarations of interest and if we could now move on to the hearing of verbal submissions for the draft and your plan and I 'd like to call the spokes representative director Lou welcome welcome back page 12 for those who are following the agenda on the hub the air for spokes Canterbury for effective consultation we need to agree that all community members voices are important that people are capable of listening to each other weighing the facts and changing their minds when professional support not dictate we can make good policy when all views are considered when all sides have spoken and listened we are more likely to craft solutions which work better for all up the major cycle routes online sooner to reduce disruption reflects well on council spokes also appreciates councils laudable efforts at consultation a recent incident however highlights some concerns with the process consultation on the heathcote Expressway elicited a hundred and seventy submissions 145 in support 15 opposed a review of those consultations found that just 11 were concerned with issues on Ferry Road primarily parking just prior to submissions closing Ferry Road business owners were granted an additional consultation meeting on 14 December in response council staff revisited the Ferry Road section produce a new consultation document which reoffer Dan alternate route and extended the deadline for submissions spokes represents over 1,000 cyclists in Christchurch we are told that all submissions are weighted equally spokes works hard to present our concerns to make suggestions and offer remedies yet with rare exceptions changes are not forthcoming spoke cited several specific safety concerns and our submission on the heathcote Expressway which included increasing cycling wits to comply with councils own cycle design guidelines concerns with intersection issues the need for road user education and promotion to share the road and the addressed no meetings were scheduled and no changes made spokes would like to be able to believe that council who treats submitters fairly at this time that belief is not supported by experience this needs to change if we had to build a cohesive community for all of us towards this end spokes has repeatedly requested the reinstatement of the cycle advisory panel and we have done so again in this submission to the annual plan spokes past submissions features some common themes among them the need for a cycle champion or champions to be employed at Council to work with cycle advisory panels and to audit and report on all projects projects to comply with cycle design guidelines promoting a culture change to road safety and sharing the road skills training for all road users some of this will require a joint effort from Council NZTA and police to fund education promotion and enforcement simply hoping that road users change habits to match the infrastructure provided leaves people on bicycles at risk just building infrastructure and hoping for the best is from st. a so street is a sad congestion are increasing in Christchurch and Christchurch has neither the rating base nor physical space to accommodate a transport system predominately catering to individual motorised transport cycling is experiencing a rapid resurgence people are finding that they can save money become healthier and feel less stressed by choosing to ride so long as they have appropriate infrastructure safe cycling for the interested but concern for all road users 8 to 80 years is reasonable and long overdue the cycle design guidelines must be upgraded to standards and implemented on street parking is not the best use of councils routing assets the primary use for roads is transport for all road users infrastructure for cycling and walking has been underfunded for decades this is a fairness issue with 7% of Christchurch commuters choosing to cycle at commute times and rapid uptake of the newly built cycle infrastructure people have demonstrated the pent up demand for cycling considering this and the historical underfunding for cycling it is appropriate that 10% of the transport budget supports cycling infrastructure too often cycling infrastructure even on major cycle routes is inadequate due to underfunding spoke expenditures for cycle parking improvements between for improvements in connections between major cycle routes and completing the cycle network cycle network usage monitoring equipment expansion of cycle infrastructure as usage merits it additional non capitals funding is requested for reinstatement of the cycle advisory panel a cycle champion employed to educate and promote effective cycling infrastructure to counsel staff and the public skills training for all road users promotion of cycling is a means of daily transport education and promotion of the benefits of cycling for all road users enforcement of no parking blocking of cycle infrastructure with more people able to cycle the full benefits of this investment will become clearer even to some of those who now oppose this funding our community will benefit when people are brought together to learn to understand the ramifications of transport projects their impact on rates to assess alternatives and to jointly explore and develop solutions all of us can support the Christchurch community needs to understand why over reliance on roads for cars has not worked cannot work and what the alternatives are without this the divisions within our community may burden on ratepayers thank you thank you very much this time for questions I 'd like to ask one and that is when when did we last have a cycle advisory panel it was a limited and under Gary Moore whatever year I don 't know don 't I don 't want a reference to because Amir doesn 't make a decision what 's the win was it it was a beckoned 2000 and 9 was a sword 2008 I will probably be before that probably 2006 7 2006 7 okay Ronnie Gerson yeah no that 's that 's fine and um how many people was it made up presumably you were part of it we I was not ok so but we could find out some details about it that 's fine fill and then Sarah thank you do in terms of the advisory panel to like I guess there might be ways of the council can in effect form one of their partnerships and developing the cycleways is what spoke so in fact we have it but we could potentially set up a a form of a panel that right now we can make sure that we have good ideas good rapport and good feedback from Stokes well I would say open up all the consultations for instance I heard on the 16th that there 's apparently something going on where the a review of the central downtown projects I 'm not even sure what it was in testimony from the woman from the yoga Club power Apollo Power Yoga I think it was hearing about that and knowing that folks is not involved with that not knowing who else is involved it it strikes me as well what how open and transparent how much daylight are we getting on this process and then I look back at it and I look at the disaster that is the central city accessible city transport chapter and it 's a disaster in large part because Gerry Brownlee refused to acknowledge any of the consultation documents that came his way that didn 't support what he already wanted if we 're going to keep doing that we 're going to keep having conflict in our community we whether it 's a all the voices together and I want to stress that for the cyclic Weiser panel it isn 't just people bicycle nine it has to have business representation assets everybody at the table yeah yes and maybe if you think of the underlying principles of an accessible city that that actually would be a very sensible today Sarah and so my my question was that you along those lines has there been may I know that when the MCF you know the 13 routes were initially proposed spokes was asked for some input generally about the the network if you like here prior to which sort of going out for consultation has it been any other consultations where you 've been asked for any input beforehand the fort goes up I 'm sure there have been and certainly we provide them what input we could and what I would like to see is that made again and that 's where I think body of a panel or something could make sure all the voices are heard it does seem to me that we do do that we do the business people in the room together to hear those hear each other and understand each other rather than exact coming through Council all the time would be really really useful way to go and it 's good to hear that this likely advisory panel would be made up of business people as well I would hope so yeah we 've come to the end of our time but I just would like just given what you said would you welcome or would spokes welcome a review of the rest of an accessible City chapter and to have a conversation about all of the projects that are that are still yet to be started I think that would be helpful her not just folks but the entire community yeah okay thank you very much very helpful thank you _"

submission I take evil read it as written yeah please excuse my news nervousness is the first time I 've set before this body and its basic you are my bosses no we 're not I promise we 're not thank you for that our mission is to bring city care back into the fold under the strategic assets lust I 've wrote for City care 14 years when I started Mike Moore was the mere then under ballpark area now Morty I said I notice thanking what the under Lane and City care was a great company to work with and to work for we were we were a family and we have quite quite we have close ties working with the staff within the council buildings and we still do during the earthquakes we put out everything that we head to bring our to bring our city back under function some of spec timber I made sure my children were safe and then by 6 o 'clock in the morning eyes back out on the road I was in this building fixing leaks I was at the germ Street building seeing with staff from the council seeing whether we could get that building back up and running unfortunately we couldn 't we were going back and forwards over the country and we worked hard because we 're owned by the city and we care for our city and then a 10-round and the council put us up for sale and I understand that we had financial reasons for doing that I understand why you did it I understand that the city needs the money but I don 't think you could believe the personal impact it had on our staff at City care I still have friends and workmates who are worried about the job security because they are up for sale and at any stage the council could put us up for sale again and I don 't really understand why although I understood that you needed the money I think we care for our city is far more important to this council than what the short-term gains of selling us would ever be the fact for that reason is German earthquakes after February earthquake I work with a very tight team working at the Art Gallery keeping the art gallery up and running I was spending 18 as a day there one so it was a safe place in a comfortable place for the civil defense to work out from to work in our city and to to protect the artwork that our city has been so much money and buying for the public if we hadn 't been there I don 't think you would have had as good a service I don 't think you would have had a private company putting in as many years is what we did as you just heard from the last submission you 've got private companies doing the road they 're shutting down at six o 'clock they 're going home we know I know for a fact that air guys will keep on working because we care for the city do a good work for you I know you shake ya shake your head we 're not yet the truth is you own crush at City Holdings and crush it city holdings owns us it doesn 't make us your bosses I know but really that 's what we see it is because we see ourselves as being a tight family and we see selves as workers who want to do our best for you and for our city and that 's were my with the help of our union we want to see the city care brought back under the trajecsys one so my friend our workmates can have the job security back because when they know they 've got that job security back we they know that they are stable in their job I know they work harder I know they put in that extra but and I 'd love to see that happen for them thank you so and you course the other product where you know every our submissions around the living wage which we would really like to see some recommendations that we put on 've got nothing further to add to it rather we 'll wait for Christians on it because I 'm sure you have some yeah but I just wanted to make a special case for our strategic assets for City Kia just a city care would have submitted accounts to the city for all of the work at dozen the earthquakes I mean it got paid for all of the work the company got paid for the work that you guys did I 'm sure they did yes and so easily yes did 14 Hogan as did all of the other contracting companies that worked after the earthquakes because everyone everyone worked hard after the earthquake and I 'm not taking anything away from you guys but everyone we 've had after the earthquakes but contracting or companies all got paid Jamie yeah why Lian so touched on what I wanted to say then to add to that thank you for your work that you 've done and also you 're actually our boss because we 're a council that works for you we want to get their round the right silly care on the strategic asset register and I 'm just interested to note or to get your perspective on the job security side of things so do you believe that say an employee of fortune Hogan or Downer 's or one of the other contractors has less job security than a city gear I actually believe they have more at the moment because it 's less likely that Fulton Hogan 's going to go up for sale F in the next two months this council finds that it 's only got a large dead City care because it 's not on the strategic asset list can be put out on the market and suddenly like we found last time your credit rating went up the government gave you an extra bit of money I know that the sale fell through because it wasn 't the actual pekus that you 're looking for but most of my comments believe that you actually got what you wanted by having your credit rate go up and eat your money coming in on the government I think there 's no section out there any of those in this understanding I think what makes City care workers vulnerable to losing their jobs as if we lose contracts not if we sell the company so I thought I think it 's losing contracts that 's probably the highest risk to any contract and company because you you don 't just work for Christchurch City Council City care works for Auckland City Council it works for weeks in Wellington I 've sort of Wellington loved city care sign and when I drove into Wellington one day so yeah I think I think I mean I do think I think the point is trying to make those is the vulnerability they 're feeling yes I mean whether it 's the reality of how the system works its how yeah the end and it 's what I was trying to do was to offer some reassurance that it 's not the sale that would make you vulnerable as the it is actually losing contracts that would make you honorable but the work that you 're doing I mean City cares just won a huge contract and Auckland which just recently yeah so I mean and that will really help the situation so I had was it Phil Glen thanks for your submission Karina in ball and I just want to ask you about the living wage and that one of these sort of arguments that sometimes we would hear against having a living wage for council say is how in fact it may impact on attracting new staff or retention of staff particularly if those other staff are say just on just above the living wage just wonder who like might like that it 's the same sort of argument we 've been hearing around the equal pay with us that whole issue about the relativity and people saying if we pay that age care is X or amounts of money all the new these other people are going to go into the works are not getting getting as much but in fact our arguments always be but it 's about everyone actually having dignity of living and even in the dignity to actually have an amount of money that they can actually live on and not actually an issue of relativity that needs to be looked at and professional development and qualifications that can X you that will raise the wages of those people but even the Mo 's they 're just below the living wage you 're going to will come up to the living wage and I think that the most important thing is saying is that it 's about what kind of what we 're doing and bringing money in because those people are actually struggling out there and there 's also been arguments I know that they put forward that that affects your younger people better and things like that but in reality a lot of those young kids when we talk about them are actually taking their money home to their families because their families are struggling and so that money goes to them as well and it 's it 's it 's about the dignity and when we talk to people like when the quote I put in there when we talk to a lot of our delegates at our delegates four-on-two near to holes and we just had a recent to them it 's about being able to access not just about the money because sometimes you know people think I can 't get there they gotta get a 40-hour week but they don 't get a 40-hour week a lot of these workers don 't actually work 40 hours a week especially the casual workers and all that so it 's about them actually having some security and the amount of money they 're going to receive if they only get three or four hours in that week they 're still actually giving and enable and a reasonable amount of money to subsidize what they 're already getting from that from the from the other other benefits and this the idea being Ultimates you not have to work two three four jobs to actually can 't get amount of money that they can actually exist on on your workplace so yeah clean thank you Karina just in the debate over City care as a strategic asset could you give us your view on them yeah so that so the reason why it is strongly behind putting it in a policy we hear from our workers but also it gets protection to that company I mean effect is that it does bring back returns to the council and when it 's an asset list that means that the people of Christchurch yet have a say because we 're not it 's not going to stop being under strategic list doesn 't stop it from being sold it just stops it from being sold without consultation and what we 're saying is that you should always actually enable there to be consultation and if you 're going to move it off again talking to that we can actually have those words now you have we have consultation anyway and they show me all that you 're doing constitute yes it lists and and not sorry so once it 's in a strategic blessedness it 's a much more deeper amount that has to be done to remove it off before it can actually be done and so and and that 's what we are wanting that added a bit of protection for asset that we really believe in because it 's our infrastructure in Christchurch and we should be protecting it which is why I agree that enable should have gone come back in as well because they are what actually runs in Christchurch it 's not it 's not just about the people it 's about the infrastructure underneath it and it 's where City care looks after our our pipes they look after our lands they look after our parks they look after our roads don 't what makes Christ Church Christ huge and yes we do have other contractors in and we contract out our systems and I think that 's something we need to look at seriously as why we actually continually contract out when we actually you know and look at trying to actually drive the I know it 's about getting to be still but sometimes about local procurement has to be about what 's the best associate the best social good and it 's not always bringing in places like Delta from Dunedin who actually are quite who don 't pay their workers as much and don 't get them the same respect in our procurement policy answer yeah yeah Tim um does the city care upper management talk to good briefings to staff about going near their vision and what 's because of recently you know they 've gone into construction that they 've gone there are national companies mentioned you know Delta from Dunedin but you know it we just want to conduct city kids just want to contract in Auckland so you know things have changed and you 're a national company you 're going into construction it 's not what city Kier used to be and it seems to me what you 're talking about and we 've all seen it as and years ago City Kia was sitting here it looked after our city and it 's what it did and it 's specifically targeted cottage now now it 's gone out and it 's doing other things but has it been relayed to you guys and and this all the staff and saying hey this is our vision this is where we going and this is how it 's hit me like a lot of big companies they latest contracts that you 've heard about I suspect we probably won 't hear about them until next week I actually hadn 't heard about them people ask me you know whether you go um there was a good flow of information some things we hear some things we don 't some things our bosses think your confidential don 't get speed to get speed to us as the tradies but once again we 've said it here from my perception is had to go out and get these outside contracts because a lot of the a lot of cross contracts were subbed out to outside companies from our wage some of which I know that those companies have been here to walk away with because they bartered to lie for them and couldn 't lift their wages and City care have come in and picked them up again so we are important I know from a self object and the facilities maintenance we do a lot of the residential flats there 's a lot of companies out there who don 't want to do that sort of work it floors and flats with tenants who really don 't look after the flats um but we do it because it 's part of what we do for our city and that 's the bottom line I think it can I just just focus on the living wage for a minute because that 's just one particular area I kind of feel like that there is a solution but it actually would require the unions to agree not to insist on relativities I take a flat dollar wage increase instead of a percentage increase because ten percent of Emmaus is different from ten percent of an elephant and if we could have Fleck wage increases then it wouldn 't cost the ratepayers anything it just would mean that people who whose percentage of their salary just goes on and on and on and on that would then actually pay to lift the bottom but every time that is proposed it 's the unions that say sorry I 've got to protect all my members and we want the relativity 's maintained can we have a genuine conversation about relativity 's yes that conversation with our youth within their unions and I know that in the negotiations PSA though they still repeat for speed signatures they would a tutti percentage so that the lower age has got a higher percentage and the higher age has got a lower percentage so the discussions are occurring and we are aware that the living wage we have to try and bring it in as best as possible and that is going to require that so that is occurring and that would not fair cost to the ratepayers of Christchurch yeah honestly I 'm looking it so that it bring it in as the best way possible that actually and that 's why this hit PSA put in a 2 percentage increase one higher or lower so that and it so it 's a similar to a flat rate but it worked at the same way so we are having those conversations as part of living wage steering group with the unions and we 're having the same conversation with any with our public service people who are doing it because they and we had the and swell they 're having an implementation discussions between council staff and the unions Peter that 's happening today where it 's incredibly helpful because you have to remember that a decision made by the council doesn 't automatically flow onto the rest of the city so we 'll have people paying their rates bill saying how come I 'm paying more for a living wage when I ain 't getting a living wage but if they aren 't paying more because we 've actually managed to develop it within the physical envelope as it were then that makes a lot of sense I think that was your idea about two years ago ready and it 's part of what we be working towards when we 're having these meetings you know party unions can 't retry and we 've been trying to you know cheering that to ensure and that 's what we 're working towards and it 's part of why our acquiesce we ask for their information so we can look at an implementation process that brings up the bottom and still which it keeps the hit lesser cost as the normal so excellent as suddenly unions are definitely wanting to work with extremely helpful thank you very much you 're right it doesn 't flow on straight away but it does help the living wage for a lot of our members will mean parents not having to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet and not really getting to see their kids and have a family life to them we have to let go of one of those jobs because they 're getting the wages they need out of the other and it increases the amount of money that they have it increases the family life it increases the amount of money they are able to put back into the local economy yeah I mean the back in the day they used to be national awards that actually you know enabled unions and employers to sit down and negotiate these things on an industry basis taking into account the needs of the industry and working through these issues and actually this is this is the result of the employment contracts that usually we much it 's been an incredibly enlightening one I don 't_''_1195.66 I didn 't you know mean to be sort of reflecting on it but I just you know we are very grateful for all of the work that all of our contractors did silly Kerr year is one of our companies but the work that everyone did after the earthquakes it was just extraordinary and the decision to to go to market Wasilla care wasn 't one that we made very easily but as you say the decision was made ultimately not to accept the the offer that was made as it wasn 't a compelling one so thank you very much for taking the time thank you very much and could _"

    "text": "thank you so we 're just running a little bit ahead of schedule so and your your submission is page 77 I 'm just saying this for a colleague so that they can turn to page 77 on their document thank you right well the main point of my submission relates to the so called accessible city regime my husband and I have been running a yoga studio just down the road in Herefords Street for almost four years now it 's not been easy trading conditions we lived through the demolition of buildings across the road and then land mitigation for seven months our entire building shook people relying on the floor with their heads bouncing and then the building going up I 'd show up to teach at 15 a.m. class and there 'd be 20 concrete trucks pouring concrete and we go through all that our business has grown a lot from scratch four years ago we now get through about 130 people a day every day through our studio but I know that we would not survive the accessible cities regime coming down here Fritz Street in JAL in July and we 're not saying we 're going I look at those businesses in Manchester Street and say Daiso Street in Cambridge Terrace and I think if that 's where our studio was we go under and we fought too hard to get it to where it is to have that happen to us so we 're going we 're one of the pioneers of the Central City rebuild where one of the rock stars of it and you 've driven us out so stop in the words of David longing it 's time to stop and have a cup of tea think again I you know I look at that accessible cities regime I think that anyone involved in it have any traffic engineering expertise at all where was that where was the analysis of what effect this was going to have on businesses there isn 't one I 've asked there wasn 't you can 't keep pushing ahead with it my submission is as to specifically not to do this to Victoria Street because one of the places we 're looking at going I 've loved being part of the central city I don 't want to be out there I don 't want to be even further out in suburbs but I feel like we 're not being given a choice if I go out to the suburbs then City Council on the streets are a great big free parking lot for all my students they like that they go to the one out in Mandeville Street and park for free and the streets out there they come in to my studio and say well like your yoga better but we can park for free out there and when they 're just paying for an 18 class paying 6 parking on top of it or getting a 65 parking ticket makes a big difference it makes it really hard to compete no matter how much better we are you own the streets out there just as you on the streets in the Central City you could be using both of them as a cash cow but you just do that in the Central City last year almost nine million dollars you got of the Central City economy out of the businesses other the people who might otherwise spend that money buying a cup of coffee or a glass of wine or something you need to level the playing field in that regard if you want people to come into the central city then sure it can 't_''_256.549 be entirely free parking because the people who work in here would just use up all the parks that I 've asked for the first two hours at least to be free so that people who are trying to run their businesses in the Central City doing the right thing by the entire city are not disadvantaged that 's my presentation any questions if you because you 've mentioned the funding for the Central City Business Association and I think that you know that the arguments been made is that it 's a very valuable service and the request for the funding to be reinstated at a higher level as we 'll closer to where it was before as as because it 's really a transitional position because ultimately when businesses are up and running something that the Business Association would pay for itself through well I know that 's one of the thoughts dreams but if you look at it what you 're doing with central city parking nine million dollars a year that you 're sucking out of the central city economy asking for 150,000 back it 's a drop in the bucket compared to what you 're getting in parking fees it 's basically a targeted rate you know if there was to be a Business Improvement District or whatever we are that would function through a targeted rate yeah well this is effectively a targeted rate anyway we 're just asking for a bit back and this is not I am on the Central City Business Association this is not Central City businesses associations policy this is to my thought that when you 're getting that much out of the businesses and the customers of the businesses in the Central City giving suburban businesses that an advantage by giving them free parking it 's just slightly you know getting something back to help us organize ourselves to compete against the malls going to make what you 're asking for in terms of but I mean turnover of cars is absolutely vital to the businesses as well and you know the mechanism that 's been used has been the the parking fee and the mechanism I think will get much easier to make a proportion of it free with a time limit kept on it once we 've got Epson instead of dealing with coins going into meters I think you know the modern technology that we will go to will help resolve that problem okay but your point in the meantime regarding the Business Association yeah it is transitional the the you know we 've built the membership from it was basically the restart mall a couple of years ago up to over two hundred businesses yes the businesses that are in there most of us can 't afford to pay a levy you know yeah and I don 't belong to the Chamber of Commerce because they charge a levy yeah no I probably get that I think where I was leading to was that really that the need for in terms of rather than making an individual impatient plea on an accessible city which is the chapter of the Central City recovery plan which has the waiting of law under the eye and assess a visitor management lawyer for 23 years I understand that so our us fixing something that that yes and you 're not written in stone it can be changed it can be changed but we are trying to make changes without having to go through an entire recon sille tation process which will re-engage and probably Rhian rage people on both sides of the argument so we are working with the representatives of the Central City businesses and what I 'm saying is that connecting with the people that we 're working with would actually be a helpful thing to channel your energy until in terms of dealing with us directly on an access that 's why I 'm a member of the Christ Church yes the ccda absolutely no so yarny then so thank you so just in terms of the car parking um one of the things that council has done is removed had other submitters say that we should reintroduce that do you see council should have a role in publicly owning off street car parking buildings to deal with the issues that you 've raised in terms of things like the cost the high costs from private providers that discourages people yes I do I know you can 't_''_544.23 be everything to everyone but that is something that was done before the earthquakes I don 't see a problem with carrying that on after the earthquakes I know that there the plan for the central city was that there were to be more smaller car parking buildings here and there and that is starting to be the case but if they 're all in private ownership we 'll end up you know the way it is in Sydney with it costing 70 or 80 to park a car for the day unless the City Council 's actually in there and providing a reasonable alternative and keeping you know the competitive need to keep costs down we 'll end up with off street parking that is just too expensive thank you and accessible city program and I would support us doing a complete review of that which I see is perfectly possible under the regeneration Act and and and so forth but I just wanted to understand if putting the design concerns to one side is it also the pace of work and the way in which the works being done that 's caused a lot of that I mean Manchester Street has taken a ridiculous amount of time so has um Cambridge Terrace it is taking a long time and partly that 's because there 's so much work being done that just shouldn 't be done that the narrowing of the roads I 'll tell you the other day I was trying to drive south along Colombo Street and as is usually the case the northbound traffic was basically at a standstill for three or four blocks back and an ambulance tried to drive north and so it pulled out into the southbound lane that I was too dry trying to drive up I had to back down Colombo Street I just about ran over a cyclist yeah that 's should be Colombo lane right it 's not operating as a road so a lot of the work that 's taking a long time essential government have you raised these concerns also with the ministers but this is the this was the reason that I raised about the region was the Business Association because I taco as an conversation with the City Council yeah but the attacker oh projects at the end of the day they 're doing projects on our streets so we have to we have to take ownership of it and I agree with the Arnie that an accessible city has become sort of it 's almost like a a shorthand for a whole lot of things that it is but a whole lot of things that it isn 't as well because there are things that have been done under there accessible city project which people were perfectly happy with but the things that they 're not happy with things that having well there 's there 's a multiple layers of things but one is the speed or the lack of speed and some of the with other projects as can we get contracts that work at night and on weekends and I mean I 've been shocked to see work closed down at six o 'clock on a weekday night and I 'm just there in Manchester Street they 're just nothing happened on every days on end and I know if that 's it is okaro rather than the City Council that 's perhaps nothing that yeah it 's your fault it 's not that we can it 's not a question of fault it 's a question of how do we find a resolution how do we get the things that need to be done done much more quickly and how do we review those things that haven 't been you know how do we how do we make changes that don 't necessarily over override the the underlying principles of an accessible city which actually people generally agree with which is to make the city more accessible for all I I don 't_''_775.05 I don 't think people got that when you were doing consultation I don 't think people really understood by how much of that the roading capacity was actually going to be removed and look a shot I 've gone back and looked at the images of the original consultation document and they do you just feel like there 's a lot more room in the street there 's a lot more room and lanes you know so when you 're drawing nice pictures of what it 's going to be like it didn 't really get the response no they come into my studio and they go do you see what they 've done to Durham Street yeah I can 't believe it it 's so narrow you can 't even drive a car down there you know safely and nobody really thought it was going to be like that during consultation no I agree including me Phil and then Dion thanks Margo for your submission one thing is just a wee bit puzzled about was around accessible study regarding cycling as you 've indicated to Yuri saying look it 's quite dangerous but later on you 're also supporting a bike share arrangement so I 'm just is the narrowness of the roads because for example Colombo Street the cyclists still think that they can sneak up in between the parked cars and the driving cars and there 's simply not room for that you know because the cars that are supposed to be driving aren 't moving and so the cyclists think well I 'm not waiting in line with these cars and they sneak up inside and it 's just dangerous I had a young doctor who practices with me come into my studio a couple of weeks back and she just looked ashen she rides a bike everywhere she doesn 't even own a car and she listened Sumner and works at the hospital and she came in and she said I never used to feel this unsafe on a bike but now I just I don 't want to ride my bike in the central city anymore so how would you suggest we have cycle lines in the inner city to make them safe if you had just left all of the streets the way they were before the earthquakes repairs of you as they were I liked the 30 kilometre speed limit slow the cars down the bike sharing scheme results in there being so many bikes on the road the cars can 't_''_895.77 drive any faster and all the bikes are safer you don 't need to you don 't need to have separate cycle lanes if everyone 's going nice and slow that 's just she it 's a shared space what your surgeon may do one of the one of the intentions down and then I 'll have to yeah thank you for the this for your deputation was really good to hear about those impacts because it is having quite a problem and I 'm getting it in the neck all the time from business owners around the city about these issues and I 'm afraid that if we don 't get it right that we 're not going to have an equal that actually we 're doing all this work for nothing but one of the things I wanted to ask about was I actually just on that Durham street night works out going to happen on close part of the Durham Street next you just get a lot of those intersections out of the way over the next three nights which is good but there 's no mention of public transport and so one of the things I find a bit risky about this conversation an accessible city is that it seems to be coming cars verse cyclists is a lot of that but dual uses any of your users use public transport at all and do that find it like for example I 've got a woman in her 70s who lives in Amber Lee who comes in to see me twice a week she 's not going to take a bus to take a one hour but what about the people that do live around the city I 'm just I 'm just trying to find out some do some do and they like the new bus interchange it 's kind of a timing thing when you 're only taking a class for one hour if you go to spend an hour on the bus and then an hour in the class and then if you can drive there in 10 minutes do your class and drive back that makes more sense so there 's this big convenience factor like a cool thank you look thank you very much and I mean I do encourage you to continue to work with the Business Association we 've continued to meet with them at our grow as engaged in that process and we are hopeful that we 'll get a good result out of that so thank you very much for your passion thank you thanks for you time um karinabrown _"

    "text": "it got to come forward and we didn 't have a sweepstake on your suit color today what you staff I 'm sure I would have one it 's like hello sunshine wonderful um good to news I 'm here if I goes off please just ring the bell yeah are you tired not today thank you very much now um I just there are a few points that I wanted to cover one of them is High Street which has become a very very important street for Christ Church these are very few east-west links through the center and that hair head here it 's sorry he referred Street it 's very few east-west lengths so if you think about it your nearest one you don 't casual doesn 't linked through to almost a dozen plaster doesn 't you 've got difficulties with Litchfield streets so it doesn 't mean because of the multi-purpose Stadium that we hope to see which I 'm very supportive of to and so here if its feet will actually although we don 't say it it will become a major artery for a DD and straightly you can 't go one way or the other because it 's blocked both ends would road works it has been all this year and I think that 's absolutely a pouring that has stayed that way I just can 't understand we do our paws by the way it concrete at that middle of the night we did one at three o 'clock this morning and we did another one on Saturday morning we do most of our street word stuff that works you 're up and the dead of night but somehow down was don 't see you be able to do that few people traffic is very sad and that we don 't put up with it so I wanted to talk about was here fat Street is up for a major upgrade I poured the thought of putting it off for a year or two because I think we 've still got work going on around there you 're going to have the spark building going up we 're still building they 'll don 't be putting a tarp up in the but I 'm region sin that we haven 't actually thought about what goes up and down there we have major trucks we have it 's a major bus route bus 17 is used there and hopefully you 'll see some more buses dropping down there you 're going to have the tourist deliveries happening there and we don 't have anywhere for them tourists to be dropped off with both buses I don 't believe the street is wide enough for buses trucks and cycle lanes so lanes austere strength is perfectly usable they cycle over the bridge of mind but I can 't drive my car over so I believe we should be thinking that not every street needs a cycle lane both sides in heritage streets one of those and I oppose you putting on cycle lane both ways on heritage Street totally unnecessary the the accessible city project you 've had a lot of flack about this the great thing is that although everyone said it was not able to be it was cast in stone it 's not cast as stoner was amazing okay what when faith that government might withdraw funding that actually this the stone wages fell out from around the thing we need to think again about it you 're the Cambridge Terrace and I know you 're only a party to it but actually it 's a does that disaster in the way it 's taken away a lot of parking for all those businesses they 're really helpful for me but actually not for the city as a whole I hate imagine if I 'm caught in that accident somewhere along there they 're trying to get an ambulance to me because they won 't get it there at the moment down Durham Street so we need to think really carefully about it Christchurch is one-third the size of Stockholm and yet we keep somehow here in the stock room we should be just like stock low we had 900,000 we should be I don 't have it and we should be thinking hard 80% of people take their buses there so take their cars you 'd like Adobe buses it 's not a reality I suggest if I look this room who actually took a bite today to get here for so the proportions are probably about right I just said I 'm 80% takers so you know it 's really a good indication of where the market is not that we should never forget that your New Brighton saltwater pools totally support I think poor old New Brighton needs a lot of help and I see it 's listed there and I 'm fully supportive what you 're proposing to do there and put saltwater pools instead of I don 't know why on earth with and you 're going to the qe2 Stadium and put it pull there what are the New Brighton for goodness sake it 's for actually should go but I 'm fully supportive free entry for children under five so they transform I 'd say free entry and totally transform regardless of age so if that means if I couldn 't swim I should have free entry until I can swim and I think it 's a really good initiative of Council 's I 'm changing Salisbury incurable to two ways total waste I don 't know why you 're doing it it doesn 't need it in fact save the money it 's easier to cross a one-way street that a two-way street if you 're worried about crossing roads I would not drive across a one-way street any times for one direction to lay that y 'all_''_330.33 into directions so if you 're thinking about safety once way Street is actually safer for people Central City Business Association I 'm no longer chairman of it so I can speak loudly and voice ibly about it and say for goodness sake if you don 't support the Central City Business Association then it will die and you 'll need to find something else to replace it nobody gets paid it 's it for the one executive who 's on there part-time and it 's um Lisa Goodman so really important I see it was cut back to 60,000 you won 't get anything out of 60,000 it 'll pay a wage and that 's about it we 're asking for it to go back to a hundred thousand until the centre said be a couple of years and City care shares well I can see why on earth were holding on to studied here it 's primary function these days to look after your cemeteries doesn 't get very many contracts in Christchurch I 'm sorry um I just think it 's a strategy was one it 's been taken off the BOTS don 't put it back on and see didn 't find a buyer or part of all of it and that was my submission nice and clean and simple and I 've got 300 points something minutes left you 've need and I 'll start because the Central City Business Association continued funding them you 're very clear on this that this that you see this as a transition proposition because ultimately the businesses that operate in the CBD want to pay for thus themselves yes and you can 't you haven 't got enough people in the CBD at the moment to actually do the bird propose you know Business Improvement Development is even if we put to a vote of the moment I can almost guarantee you 't want to do that no all right um well thank simply just for the Central Business Association funding like on the basis that you 've asked for it to go back to where it was I think if we take the smaller suburban business areas for example like Sydenham and Arrington would you support BM getting this kind of support as well on a proportional basis so if you look at the size of the business population and center city and compare it to Sydenham you probably find it 's less than one tenth but on a proportional basis you get agree with that proportion of you thanks sent me any other questions Karen here the changing of the one-way streets what 's the feedback been that you have had from others when you 've spoke to them about that the Kilmore in salisbury well they can 't understand why you 're wasting money on it forever they don 't fix it yeah it 's part of the accessible city it 's nice it 's it is castable this is the thing the central city recovery plan chapter that a chapter in a city plan and the Central City recovery plan that the CCD you lead council staff are involved but it was a CCD you lead process it is embedded in our district plan so anything that requires to go out to public consultation we can 't just change so what we 're working through at the moment as you know onyx on an accessible city is making changes where we don 't need to go back out to public consultation because they 're not relevant to the underlying principles of the plan the plan we 've already consulted on changing the to Street so am I right on that or am I wrong you never consulted on change or one-way streets it was imposed upon us I 'd love you to open the door the gates and see what reaction you get should we be spending money or do we not know can I just ask a question of staff in the bay Aaron do we have to consult YES on that on the one way that the two way decisions and yeah Gilmore Street hasn 't think what a lot of people might not understand about the city is that it 's been designed as a network so we have to look at streets beyond the street itself and say what feeds that where does it go how does that support the modes of transport so the city 's been designed so that each corridor has a priority for a particular mode of transport some there 's a few streets where everything goes down the street some are public transport priority others are cars some have a high story street then consulted on to go sort of no sauce which tree I think is about to go and the reports almost ready to put to council I think for Simsbury all right so yeah there 's some there 's some design changes that we want to make to that though from some of the other learnings from other projects yeah and the options for those under the consultation as for kilmore n salisbury as one of the options to keep them is one ways no because that 's embedded and accessible so good yeah yeah but-but-but work on and I mean this simply hadn 't occurred to me because I assumed it was all consulted on as part of the chapter but obviously it hasn 't been and if it hasn 't been consulted on as part of the chapter then what we need to understand is whether it is actually embedded in our district plan so is that is the one way to way is that embedded in our district plan and that 's what we need to that 's what we need to find out because if it 's not then we have got the ability to change that in the consultation process I 've got a feeling it 's only in an accessible City not the district carrier but we just need to confirm that yeah all right thank you very much Dan tonight it 's um it 's been very helpful it 's good you didn 't have to ring the bell right now that 's good no no no fell beads and right _"

    "text": "and I should just run through the rest of the list with you because we have some people you can cross off the list so the e cane this done perfect timing you can come and sit at the end of the table don 't_''_21.73 even take your breath total mr. pebbles welcome Thanks did you come by train I thought I was at 30 actually alright that 's all right um far away we 've just hit a submission on the train so that 's yes so you 're going on okay so I 'm one of the owners of the McKenzie Willis building and also the Duncans lady 's building from about one four one two one eight one High Street and so I ran upstairs yeah so we 've just completed the McKenzie Willis and building we 're getting our last tenants and operating at the moment and with the Duncans buildings we 've just inferred consent may our four and the demolition of the back retaining of the Heritage facade and building the new building so which started that some of that work now we 're the next couple of months and we 're hoping to have that finished late this year or early next year but they 're both high streets being closed for six years and part of our deal with attacker oh we had to act with haste about getting the structural temporary structure up to hold the facade to get the Road opened so we 'll be completing say in March next March and 18 for the rebuild of the Duncans buildings and I know these plans but but the tram tracks through right up to the politic but what we didn 't want to see happen is us finish that whole bit of High Street have all the heritage buildings done and new tenants in and then straight away we 're going to come in after the roads been closed for seven years by that stage close the road again with the tram traction so I guess I 'm here to ask that we instead of delaying the installation of the tram tracks train tracks we put them in bulks the road closed rather than waiting for my tenants to move well it was a perfect summary of the summary that I gave of the previous submissions has anyone got any questions for Richard Owen congratulations on what you 're doing down there by the way I mean it 's just fantastic for the city so we really really value what you 're doing well we 're really proud of it and you know once the Duncans buildings are done I think it 's got a very special part of town and especially with the trend going down there I know it 's sort of double backs back on itself there but it 's it 's going to be such a cool vibrant sort of heritage area even though we are only retaining the facade we 're using a lot of the bricks on the back no one will know that we 've actually built new buildings behind the facade and so I think you 'll look great when they finish but yeah I 'm very fond of that area because that ice my father used to work and that I 'll keep the nonprofit building across the road I really they were little for the dragon cafe and the Hong Kong cafe and all of those who are there so I 'm really looking forward to seeing what you 're doing down there well you 're your own bited next week to come down to little high eatery which opens next week there 's nine of the operators from the restart more sorry I can 't_''_219.7 say reach that container more that I 'm moving into our building beside mademou so feel free to come down and try out the little high eatery excellent down Ben yeah yeah actually I just want to say awesome work on having a car park in the facility that 's actually got 30 minutes free that 's actually very good thing to actually have in our city today Welsh I commanded the other night made 5 to package hey I 'm just Rick I 'd thank you for the submission on I 've read all three of your submissions which are pretty much exactly the same different companies but I just wanted to ask about the Central City Business Association do you think that getting into that area to have that advocacy and that those people working around there so I do businesses I do actually use I mean that 's an independent voice that that deals with that and I mean I guess lately with the you know the routing and car parking issues and it is quite important I think they have a voice for the local businesses and local property owners so I am a supporter of that group yes Jonnie similar questions the one that I asked before but if you look at the original proposal the tram was going to go down to the Polytech um and then look back around have you thought it sort of long-term in terms of that whole area it is quite congested with a whole bunch of you know buses cyclists cars it is sort of much over designed in terms of you know whatever we 're trying to achieve but in terms of the Train have you thought more about if it goes up High Street is it worth thinking about it going even further east to try and help catalyze so at the moment we 're struggling like Philips town wall street suite um possibly but I wouldn 't think it I mean that you 're right and that bit of High Street is becoming quite busy but I guess that 's where you want the trams to go you know you want them to be honest that once you get to the end of high street you know that heritage block I would question the value of taking the tram fair there 's quite a tourist thing and I 'm not sure there 's the activity or even that the items that tourists would want to visit in see you pass that point it becomes more business orientated rather than retail and touristy I guess so so here 's that would improve the other properties but I question the cost-benefit whether that would be I just don 't see how it turns around once it goes up higher straight yeah how it actually gets how it turns around and comes back well it 's just stopping and then going straight back down High Street isn 't it isn 't it I think pretty quick tip I don 't think that 's changed yeah I mean when we did that laneways and we did think about whether it could loop around until someone told us that cost per 200 meters and I think we thought about it for about three and a half seconds and then we thought no we can 't_''_414.87 do that well that was audio I understood it was already in that plan but we had a loop it shone straight but it was against the traffic I think was the point that was made before I hmm what look I put the trim gun anywhere you can take it up to my place if you like good air another yeah just since we 've got a little bit of time on well you 've got a bit of time here and feel free to not answer it if you don 't want to eat the stadium is planned for just around the corner what 's what stadium will sit outside the Maltese every feet arena arena yep going just around the corner what 's your position on of the blueprint when it first came out they stole 12 of my properties on that that sort of town and and we 've had a lot of the beliefs and election of things that you know that we just start to starting to get to a stage now I think with his momentum building and suddenly the vision is starting to come to fruition and I actually love the idea of the stadium there I was thrilled when the council when the decisions around demolish it so we 're just pretty sorry there are no promoted multi-use that arena but you know we 'd sure and I think his tickets sold out event I 've hit on the right on the way here so in about 30 seconds you know we should have had them here and we would have if we had that and imagine it walking through the McKenzie Marissa there thank about pre Adele the opening of the multi-use arena she 's going to do a whole week it 's going to see the nights in a row Adele that would be great I 've already I 'm a huge supporter of that location close to town especially the way they 've done that you know the east frame and the southern the laneways and thing I just suddenly things has started look good ticking along very good I don 't think you 've Richard I 'm sorry that the timetable doesn 't try to connect but thank you very much via submission okay I think my business partners might prefer Cassie and Chris were also down to talk but they 've seen me along so they won 't be they won 't be talking though we can cross Mike off as well as Christie knows if he 's down there I 'm not sure if he is hit Mike and yeah oh no no the people 's group or the oh yeah no I 've got I had you down for a people one eight one and Duncan 's Lane all right thank you very much thank you and now I 'd like to UM _"

    "text": "a tramway Historical Society Dharmakara page 56 good afternoon I do have some maps to share around so I 'll just look good I was hoping you were bringing in me the reason I was hoping you would bring a map was because I couldn 't quite fathom where we rose where it was where it was intended to go well on page two of the map you will see it marked and read where the rails still have to go into the ground here it 's okay yeah I 'm speaking on behalf of the president this afternoon who was unable to be here the president of the drema Historical Society anyway thank you very much for my start or this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Traymore Historical Society 's submission to this year 's and your plan on the cover of which Christchurch 's iconic tram takes pride of place we 're very glad to see that five of the six trams operating in the city are supplied and maintained by our society despite all the challenges of the rebuild the tramway marks this city is a catalyst for central city regeneration in that it links key nodes of our attractions together for our visitors and actually even has the capacity to create new focal nodes in the city the temporary closure of new Regent Street last year showed just how important the tram is to the life of businesses along its route the tramway is not a position to bring to fruition an important new node for Christchurch businesses and visitors namely that in the Litchfield poplar term and lower High Street areas now the innovation precinct contains many major concerns I won 't list them you know them smaller businesses are widely known to gravitate to such an area they also gravitate and flourish where the tramway goes otic arrows accessible city program not the City Council has recognized this in linking the existing track to that in Poplar Street they have repaved the street but in polls for overhead wires and lighting and installed traffic signals at the complex intersection of poplar Terim and high streets much to some people 's mr. vacation with the with the tram coming patrons will flock to the present terminus at Litchfield Street I have to mention in particular Richard Peebles us and Mike per cow skis IPG developments between 2m and Sunday 's of streets both these groups are presenting their own submissions in this afternoon and support of the extension of the tram toussant Asaph among other things mr. pesckow ski told me that it is a massive issue for them and not just window dressing to have the tram in lower High Street he and mr. pibbles will tell you just why this is so they see the tram as a key to the success of their developments they 're both developers will be all too aware of how businesses else will Christchurch such as in Sunday 's of Manchester and Durham streets have been knocked back a bit by protracted roadworks so it is important that the installation of tram tracks and low High Street be completed as soon as possible and for this for this purpose additional funding is required in the 2017 to 2018 and your plan once the tracks are in place businesses can clearly go ahead without the lengthy the way well we have been advised by the capital new works program that only a hundred and two thousand has been allocated for the 2017 to eighteen year seventy two thousand four 2018 19 but nothing whatsoever foreshadowed beyond that however the estimated cost of completing the line to some phase of Street is likely to be three million dollars to cover rail lane poles and overhead wires now let 's put that three million dollars in a historic perspective before the quakes Stage two of the original extension via High Street was approved and funded as far as Barbados Street this entailed a loop to enable trams to pull trailers almost to the catholic cathedral which would be another great tourist attraction I understand that Christchurch tramway limited also has made a submission which operates our trams in the city would really love to be able to reinstate trailers that would need such a loop as pushing a trailer in Reverse by tram is not permissible and interim interim loop was planned but this would have briefly gone against the one-way traffic flow in terms Street your met sixteen million dollars has been committed this year to cycleways we 're not against cycleways but we understand the situation the council is in so our for the time being prepared to do without having trams fooling trailers and to terminate in the single track absent eyes of street when the city is back on its feet this single track could ultimately be continued to complete stage two and that 's on the second page of your diagram of your map theme and that would involve the original Barbados Street loop coming around through Coventry and Williams Street and back to High Street that way meanwhile we are pushing to complete the stage one tram line into lower High Street right down to the end of it in order to do this we are asking the council for three million dollars which will help not only us but also the Peebles and Cass key developments a professional rail and tram consultant in Australia mr. Dale birth has also written a submission and report of in support of this to the council draft plan he expresses his surprise that given the and the massive expenditure on other infrastructure in Christchurch he says three million dollars is a bargain price and this is in comparison however to the cost of building one kilometre of track in Melbourne and in other Australian cities one final note in our submission currently the tramway Historical Society is struggling to restore an electric tram car which formerly ran up HEC Fulham Road in Kashmir to the sign of the targa he we were duly like financial help to rebuild further actual heritage christchurch trams christchurch trams not X buildin ones however this is a matter on which we would like to come back to you ladies and gentlemen and a further date thank you very much sounds like a precursor to the long term plan that one Pauline down yes thank you um you may not know the answer to this but the area of High Street between terminals and essa ' charlie currently the buildings are being repaired in there that 's the duncan ability yes yours runs along it are they doing any work to the road as well would it 'll be pulled right I don 't know at this stage whether the roads being pulled up for their purposes I imagine there will be some underground services which may have to be checked or or put in but that 'd be minor matters by comparison with putting and tram rails they were there before when they okay so originally way back yes not that many many years ago they are all pull pulled out okay so it seems to me that if we should look it could be timely to put that they 're going to go in they should go and calm totally agree with you we think this is this is one of the main points I was trying to make there that there 's nothing worse as other businesses in town have found then having opened up their doors and hoping to get things under way then they held back for a long time yeah okay roadworks Shiki so that the street that 's blocked off at the moment at High Street really where you 're talking about it that can be built on in the meantime while the were restored and open by do you know by the pit kaske and people 's no no I meant time but what do you know but I can ask them when they they might be I think it yeah Dion I think my question was related to that but I was just scrolling through the rebuild Christchurch Facebook page because of the yield of High Street the train tracks are only just ripped up last year I think they still were there when they did the reason as if the term ik underneath it I 'm sorry yes they were that was I was able to say was that the train stopped running a Louisville at the time ago yes I just wondered you know it could have been some foresight there but there was a yes the trouble is that things that check the old rails are brittle and and fragile and not really up to the job anymore it 's far better to put in something of the same standard as as the rest of the trailer is and to make it last of all that 's great your submission we 're staying on the topic because I 'll narrow invite Richard people was wasn 't here oh he 's away so Antony 's not here either we 're Wellwood I 'll let you all eat Yanni ask you a question then because we seem to have our submissions are running a bit late I 'm just very quickly thanks for your dedication have you considered the possibility of extending the term way further along Ferry Road yes and and what 's your kind of thoughts on you know the future of actually just connecting more into that eastern area up Terry Road well the if you look at the map that have given you on stage to the second page you 'll see marked in red the rails rails that need to go in still the new rails but beyond that you will see that is projected and look to go around it into politics some days of street are running on there as a single track on the right-hand side of some days of street so able to becoming traffic would see any train very clearly to be a dogleg there which would take it into Ferry Road but going even further eith along Erie wonderful opportunities are not very released be wonderful girl who love what yeah who 's out to its environment out to Sumner seriously like that you love you know I remember traveling on that line a lot when I was a kid oh if you look at the budgets that we 've got from ride so a month and if I wouldn 't dare suggest that we go any further at this stage then the then the some days of street or terminus but I am foreshadowing we are foreshadowing the possibility of a stage to completion at some later date to take would be it would be visitors it would be above it so I may be that the Catholic cathedral might be rebuilt yeah I was more thinking from a local transport point of view yeah I think it goes somewhere like a long ferry road to ferry me door to Sumner in terms of the people actually using it getting off cars getting up not having buses but would be the thought has certainly struck my mind when I look at those terrible pilot will not pile ups but great rows of stalled cars yeah right down Ferry Road that a tramway system down there would be ideal of course oh well my question was along the same lines re just like you referred to cycling in cycle ways you can clean you there that they 're designed to be a transport option so within the stages that you 're proposing stage 1 2 would you see without taking fury road into account not the other side what is that any potential for like currently it 's like a tourist vehicle which which is nice and n attracts people and n is it could be extended I 'm just wondering is there also potential for it to be like a public transport option for local residents yes I 'm sure it would be I don 't know how the pricing would be done for passengers we can buy it you can buy years pass for suck you I don 't let 's use less than a dollar wait cheapest chaps so it can 't_''_955.19 be used taught by people who they buy that person there was some free advertising for me full of welcome aboard co-taught is it welcome aboard you believe Oh a them um well I don 't know what 's happened to the rest of our submitters that for some reason they seem to have their timing or they 're probably looking for parking that 'll be it no no they won 't because there 's a big carpark building and we 've actually provided car parking for people on this occasion yes yes damn did you want to ask a question no but like none of them are here and they 're all told to be nearly team that I could speak that a mere a little bit more about the night on beyond on their behalf sorry I haven 't heard a single word you see I 'm just joking I made a me akiza gets a reaction from me yeah is not my favorite expression but ego what would you like to raise I was just going to say that in talking difficult for pent for tenants to want to come on board for his his developments for his shops and turned that he 's developing if they don 't know what the session situation will be regarding the trend the mr. Peebles and mr. pukowski and both mentioned the tram to their potential tenants and who are very keen to know that it would actually be there so and that the rails could be in place before they actually take up their tenancy but it also make sense I think I think this is what you 're asking us to consider is that while the road is closed for the purposes of the restoration of buildings to handle the development that you might as well do that then rather than let them open yearning go back in and close it all down again that would be ideal that was the ideal and yes yeah but anyway but you 've given us some considerable food for thought thank you very much thank you right well _"

    "text": "for our civic trust thank you thank you for the opportunity of making this submission I 'm doing so on behalf of dr. John Wilson who was the author of this submission John is a heritage author and he lives at Arthur 's past so he was delighted when I volunteered to give this mission week so he can stay up in his misty area like many submissions from the Acura Civic trust this one is also about tourism and heritage obviously that the first point of the submission regarding cruise ships has altered significantly with the agreement between yourselves and the port company that wolfish be built in Littleton and that will I hope to some extent relieve the pressure on a karora the heavy number of cruise ships sometimes up to 86 a year arriving in a Corolla over the last six years has intermittently divided the community between those who see Economic Opportunity and those who see a diminution of the amenity that has been unfortunate its tended to be a seasonal thing that it has happened around Christmastime and has often been exacerbated by somebody from all the other opinions and then then it fades away again but the issue nonetheless has had an effect on the community of a Corral I I note that a karora whether or not the cruise ships continue to come in the same numbers is very much a tourism hot spot and with the projected increase in the numbers of tourists arriving in New Zealand it is likely to remain so and I know it 's I sometimes get the impression of people from a Kirara bang on about Acura an awful lot but you know really the the place deserves a significant amount of special attention simply because it is a remarkable and unique settlement for that reason only if you like it it 's the first successful planned settlement of New Zealand it 's got a Maori history that is of national significance so really the the fact that cruise ships might decrease in numbers I think is offset by the likely rise in tourism over the next few years so in the recommendations John 's submission here there are three the first really I don 't think ships into the harbor are made by the Harbormaster Jim Daly and I 've spoken to a modernist issue of restricting the number of cruise ships to one at a time and he referred me as Harper masters will to the marine transport Act of 1994 which clearly states that in order to maintain maritime safety he is obliged to accept visits from cruise ships when requested despite the fact that with we 're talking about planning and rather than mayday it seems to be the case that restricting the numbers to one at a time isn 't a realistic option the second point asking for further research into the impacts of mass tourism in a Corral is a is a bigger point you will hear as as you just have from Victoria and I believe from another submitter that there have been numerous reports on a Carrera over the years streetscape report historic area Harbor basins settlements there is a number of them and yet they never seem to actually hold water or bear fruit if I 'm going to mix metaphors we need a strategy for coping with there could even be an AK Aurora desk here in the City Council where all this information is held by somebody who 's responsible to filter it and guide other members of staff when they are making decisions especially about the historic area of a karora at the moment people are exercised about the fact that we are going to have yellow dotted corners on the streets to aid people who have disabilities as far as site is concerned well you know yes but you know this is a precinct in its own right and those sorts of incursions don 't really help so that I believe the second point in the recommendation there still holds whether or not it 's possible to raise a levy of from tourists coming in over the wolf which the City Council does have jurisdiction over it is another matter but whatever the residents of Accuro have always desired I could pro quo for the effects that tourism from cruise ships has had on their community I 'm well aware of the millions of dollars that the City Council is spending on infrastructure water imagined that they could see some sort of reflection of the fact that they are now entertaining up to 5,000 visitors a day sometimes when there are two or three cruise ships in the harbor at the same time that there is some payback for that so I think those those three I 've addressed those three points but certainly there is room for action on the second clue as for the retention of what is known as genies cottage the the recommendation or the decision sought there is that council retains that property in its ownership and that it should be used by volunteer groups I 've spoken to the Deputy Chair of the Banks Peninsula Community Board and she tells me that a report is coming back to them in June on this very issue so I think that all I can do here is to support verbally those two decisions which are sort I knew Genie very well she she was a longtime resident of acara through the 60s and 70s um she had the first tea shop there she was a Girl Guide mistress she was and involved in in everything culturally in the village and her property or that the property which she rented from Banks Peninsula District Council originally is in a very prominent place on the corner of Goodge alley which abuts the the cricket ground so as you drive into a Curragh your eye is taken by the the cricket ground there and they 're right in front of you is this cottage which fits perfectly into the built landscape of the village it needs to be raised on its foundations because it 's subject to flooding the one of the members of the Civic Trust Rodney Laredo has been in touch with a company who is prepared to do some pro bono work on raising that cottage which might be of significant help to the council if it if it is to enter into that work so those I think are the the most significant things I want to say in in in delivering this submission encouraging support for the retention of Jeannie 's cottage and looking harder at the impacts of tourism on a small community of only 650 people pauling I think Steve you might not know the answer this population of Aurora the reason it 's not the truth 650 650 yeah when they can swell to 5,000 a day oh yeah well I mean that 's a legion pick the residents stay at home they generally have a list on their fridge which tells them when the cruise ships are coming in they don 't go out no that 's very good thank you very much Steven we appreciate your presentation today and obviously we 'll be considering these measures very carefully thank you very much thank you right tremor _"

    "text": "aurilla andrews and item number four it 's on page 46 I hope you pull enhance of us is should we care to go oh just seeing who was paying attention and also well what do I do here what I was just a little bugger I 'd like to know he 's state I 'd like to thank you for allowing me to present my submission today and for reinstating the formal hearing process my submission will be very very brief if I can get the computer to line up here maybe I can do it off sorry maybe not ah as I 've said before and previous submissions in my view some departments within Christchurch City Council remained entrenched in their silo mentalities which makes it very difficult for rate payers to get answers to questions or to effect change I have seen councils come and go along with hundreds of staff while we as ratepayers remain in place it often appears that little notice is taken of our comments or submissions as we repeat the same point over and over again I use customer service the email four or five attempts I 'm starting to really give up all hope even though I serve on the acro issues working party which has made progress on some issues to date this is not it earlier okay accuracy walls offer limited protection to a large segment of the business community and I 've reported holes many times in the same area for more than five years concrete is sometimes used to fill in the holes but erosion and wave activity quickly removes it while also eating away at what remains of the sea walls sorry I 'm having trouble here with this computer red cones dominate the waterfront area which is used by tens of thousands of visitors as well as ratepayers pardon I don 't know okay thank you mass tourism threatens to destroy the character and beauty of the town as well as his lovely harbor side setting there 's a general lack of maintenance and the town appears overgrown with weeds and uncollected debris contracts are not properly monitored or checked sorry it 's just not well that 's not the slide I want okay I counsel super as I said counts contracts are not properly monitored or checked if council supervisors are not capable of overseeing contracts in a Corolla and around Banks Peninsula they should be retrained or replaced by someone who can do the job sorry this is mask I 'm sorry this is seems to be a bit of a problem main Wharf area becomes the exclusive domain of cruise ships and tourism operators to the detriment of others including local fishermen and anyone wishing to enjoy a walk to the end of the wharf I would like the council 's assurance that large cruise ships will be instructed to return to Littleton once the new turtle terminal is built since I have been informed that many in shrimp 's ships intend to visit Borough of the following day the council controls the use of the surface of the wharf and it can deny access to large cruise ships that may wish to use a Corolla as a cost-saving measure since fees are considerably less than the port of Littleton I also ask that the council impose a five-dollar passenger charge to which is used by cruise ship passengers because it is considerably cheaper than going to the doctor on board mass tourism clogs a Corollas narrow streets and footpaths the situation will worsen as international visitors are projected to reach 4.5 million in 7 years a long-term option to traffic congestion would be to instigate a Park and Ride system to transport visitors to the town from November through March if a crow is to remain viable with a successful business community and resident population then the council must work with ratepayers to find solutions to these problems remembering that what works in Christchurch does not always apply to a Corolla and Banks Peninsula thank you [Music] right questions Annie I 'm just trying to understand at the heart of the maintenance issue this has been a common issue that people have raised in your opinion is it the lack of responsiveness to the complaints that are made or is it the lack of resources and funding that 's going into it or maybe a combination of I think it 's probably a combination and I think a Corolla is a it requires driving back and forth from the city and it would be greatly helpful I think to our community if we had a management structure closer to where we actually live I think too often the managers in the city are overwhelmed by work here and we tend to get shoved to the bottom very simply I take photographs of the drains and gutters all along the streets and they 're totally clogged with leads if we get a torrential rain of course then the streets flood now that 's simple that should be monitored on a couple of every couple of weeks or once a month or whatever it 's not being done now if a supervisor can 't actually manage a contract to that degree there needs to be some retraining or something needs to happen in terms of a corolla the photographs of sue Stewart who fell the pavement and footpath has been like that for years the council 's known about it we did a walking tour with the community board and staff through the acro designed appearance Advisory Committee all these things were noted by the seawall I call I made four notices for service and now also big the wire mesh and the post is totally fallen into it what I 'm trying to understand is once those issues have been made aware or been put into the system are you being told that something is going to be done and that thing isn 't happening or are you just not getting even a response to say this will be done well sometimes I get a number you know you get a response number whatever they 're called on some occasions somebody will say yes we 're looking into that in terms of the waterfront I know they 've done a survey with a ultrasound and they 're going to do some kind of work what needs to be done is actually to reinforce the actual seawall itself filling the holes is not going to resolve the problem sometimes I get a response sometimes I do I get a number quite often and then it 's up to me to follow through and sometimes I just don 't bother it 's the weak difference I have seen progress on a number of areas in terms of the rubbish collection it is improved vastly during peak tourist season and yes it is making progress because of Andrew Turner 's persistence but we haven 't had a meeting now for several months and I think we 're kind of losing the bowl on that one we need to get back and press on several issues and I think we have a meeting coming up at the end of the month it has helped it involves locals more in the oversight which I think is very important yeah and I think that I mean we actually did try to get a contract specifically for a karora and couldn 't get the local you know capacity which is a shame and and perhaps building local capacity will be a stick that the working group could could help pick up because I agree with you there if the solution isn 't at hand you 're going to be waiting a long time and then something else will take a higher priority well and I think it 's local who actually can help supervise some of these things then you 'll start to see some real improvements I agree and maybe make a few penalties as well yeah you know yeah in terms of the contracts that we 've got over there that might be the way to go but thank you very much Victoria 's much appreciated as always it 's good that you make the effort to come and I 'm disappointed to hear you say that you feel like you don 't make a difference you do and we do listen and it doesn 't mean that we can deliver on everything that you raise every time I understood it it 's like you know chipping water oh no I do appreciate the news about the cruise ship terminal yeah but I would like some assurance that the ships actually will be directed back not all of the ships will they know those Bowtique ships will always want to go to Accra and will prefer it but I think in the context of Littleton reopening and looking at what we charge it at akaroa I think kind of the experts in their area about we we strike that difference because it 's much higher at Littleton as you say yeah and and what does that actually mean but your comment about ports not making money it 's not that ports don 't make money they don 't they don 't make the kind of profit that they make on their cargo to Nova I think it 's a you know that 's where the conflict arises which is why the council 's you know directed investment unto the cruise ship terminal through the port company but that isn 't something that would have stacked up in a business case for the port company alone no I appreciate that and I do understand that point very good right well I 've now taken you well over time so thank you very much yeah and Steve Lance as you could come forward on behalf of the _"

    "text": "forty-three good afternoon all yeah thank you for your time on behalf of the thin one re here at community board and I 'm pleased to be able to give you a quick summary of our submission just I 'll take the takers read I 'll just highlight two to three points obviously one that 's been a theme today is terrific outside schools and obviously a important factor obviously our Ward is significantly impacted with the Jones Road rusty Road alterations up there and how that impacts traffic in and around our Ward and that brings me to the second point which is here would Road Breen 's Road and obviously in district need of a signalized intersection also just quickly to touch on condition of our waterways obviously our Ward is the start of the open river and a collection point for a lot of the runoff and a number of our duplications to date have been highlighting the lack of flow the increased degradation of the water and we would like to see the council put some money and working closely with Akeem and our own resources fantastic very much I 'm not I 'm glad we could catch up on time very good very much no no no I 'm not letting you off the ball the regeneration of Bishop Dowell more you 're working and with development Christchurch and the urban regeneration team on issues and opportunities for the regeneration of the mall that is correct yes is it is that something that you would likely to see affected unto the hour LTP thinking for next year yes and also this as you 'll all be aware the new library which is I believe still on schedule or an opening date I 'm going to say start of August end of August in the community board is looking to have our whatever a community board meeting actually in that space and so providing that 's all on track will be up there and it will go a long way to increasing and in improving that area the more I see what I started Andrew then Vicki thank you David and the last point a new submission condition of local waterways yes and you are asking streams and rivers have you had any conversation or interaction with the Christchurch West Melton water management zone committee and has there been any discussion about access to immediate steps funding for any of those projects yes we have a community board member who is part of that committee I believe their last meeting was for maybe six weeks ago and we are actively and working with them and trying to increase or highlight a lot of those issues and put some thinking about how to improve it everybody just one thing that 's not covered and the artisan residents proposal is mona vale house down your end of mona vale what 's not what 's currently happening with that so there 's a school of thought we we and following the public interest that we would like to try and have a artist-in-residence a significant cost to the city which we 're not happy to bring to you and ask the rate payers to pay a significant cost being being a current one of the current ideas around an artist-in-residence is that it would be a paid for or based on a number of the the researchers on the artist in residence programs that happen national nationally nationwide internet and and internationally that the artists whilst may live leave behind some artwork at and would be living in the house for free in we don 't_''_272.58 we 're not comfortable with coming to the council with an idea so we 're looking at at us and an alternative we might partner with some other organizations namely the university that has some residence programs or maybe with Aurra so it has work in progress so you know there are a number of groups of artists and residents who want to pay rent for that site well I can lick staff that have been dealing with that research you know maybe like a country you just tell me what will happen in terms of the process now I say the process may be like that for weeks maybe five weeks ago we had a briefing from staff regarding the costs that would be include we 've asked them to go back to do some more number crunching in finding alternative but to do pile and to come back to us at a time to be decided for the earthquake repair and renovation to habitable standard that 's going ahead this is so and go to a commercial setting would be a significant cost no no I know I understand that so but work so it 's all all on board so when when is that when will it be finished we all at the open I 'd have to double-check but I do believe in of November started November was the timeframe that I 've been given right so that 's the timeframe that we want to be willing to in terms of a decision-making creep that Sam your community board as working on a proposal that will come back to council that won 't be a cost to council route and the way that it was disclosed in the intent of having a an artist or similar may well be that it 's like you said people would be prepared to pay rent in there and would dismember and there may be others who would like to subsidize the amount I mean there 's all sorts of operation I 'll follow up with working on that would those people just get in touch with your community film to myself wolf with me oh yeah no that 's my government since I 'm excited thanks it see we didn 't let you off the hook at all yeah it was a good question good answer that was excellent result good afternoon all yeah thank you very much all right well I think we 're now exactly on time for afternoon tea so if people would like to take a 15-minute break and we 'll start again on the dot of three o 'clock with Victoria injuries a phone and she 's coming _"

    "text": "great thanks very much thanks Linwood central Heath cut Community Board Jake McClellan page 38 I 'm firstly thank you to the council first day they 're living with central Heath cat community board wishes to thank Council for an opportunity to be heard following a submission on the draft and your plan for 2017-18 and firstly just looking at the capital works program the Linwood Wilston pull is there 's a priority that we would like to see progressed without the currently proposed delay we 're asking sorry I 've just read back from my car having lost my phone I 'm out of breath but we 're asking council to ensure the funding is set aside in the 2017-18 financial year to allow for planning and community engagement that will lead to construction work starting and 2018-19 which we would like the we would like the pole to be completed by December 2019 and still the funding being drawn out until 2020 2020 21 as proposed in the draft annual plan recent media coverage has made people question the need for more polls in Christchurch but it 's come out of thin air it 's not a case of you have one so we want one most people won 't know the background so I want to assure you all that this has a long history both and demonstrated need and in long history two promises to the community for this facility there 's a thick folder of information on the need for a pool in this area and a lot of works already been done we don 't want to wait for a new report which will just show us what we already know and we failed I 'd like to suggest that the council perhaps hold a workshop on the matter as well we 're not asking for a huge facility with Hydra slides and other bells and whistles we 're just asking for a community pool where people can connect exercise and of course learn to swim we 're asking for an investment in a community that sorely needs it but unlike other areas has little capacity to advocate for the needed facility that 's why our board sees this is such a high the over by a car and then would have partly due to a lack of visibility caused by the large number of cars along that road when rope is being played at Lynwood Park the board is in favor of funding planned for the little wooden nursery clearance and land reinstatement for the year 2018 19 to be brought forward to enable the land to be removed remediated and used as a temporary car park for Lynwood rugby league we would like the council to include and the footpath renewals and maintenance budget the reinstatement of footpath of a footpath in front of Melbourne cave and Sumner the board met with principal school principals earlier in the year and we became more aware of the local of the issues that local schools are having with Road Safety and the need for school safety zones to be in place to keep children safe run up the view that and the funding set aside for school safety fire zones sufficient for only installing three zones in a financial year isn 't as this inadequate and we request that council consider more funding to board urges council to allocate funding on all master plan projects that have been budgeted for in the long term plan to have and we 've had community consultation that these go ahead is originally planned the board supports bringing forward funding for the Christchurch coastal pathways by one year the funding in 28th 2017 2018 will enable the Christchurch Yacht Club to incorporate part of the coastal pathways in their development we further support allocation of 240,000 dollars for the Christchurch Yacht Club 's building project moving on now to sort of comment on that are on the draft annual plan consultation document and the Board considers it important that there be universal access of free swimming and swimming lessons for children and young people under 16 years of age in this board area there are a number of low decile schools that do not have says they do not have access to a local pool and the building of the Lin Woolston pool will assist but in the meantime we would like to ensure that cost is not a barrier to children accessing swimming lessons and having fun like to submit that havoc private sector contracted having the private sector contracted to manage council parking facilities hasn 't worked for their community and we submit that the council lists their parking facilities as strategic assets we 're also in favor of City care being listed as is just as a strategic asset and the board wishes to Fed Council for the draft allocation of a hundred thousand dollars for changing sheds and Sunda under the additional funding for local projects while we think it 's important to have changing shoes and sumner the Board considers that allocation has considered the allocation and submits that council reconsiders allocating thirty thousand dollars for changing it for Sumner changing sheds and the remaining seventy thousand dollars to go towards a drop-in center in the city east as detailed and 4.3 finally I wanted to talk about our community goals as part of the annual plan over the past few months the board and myself personally have become increasingly aware of some of the issues facing the inner city East area of our community board area we 've talked to community groups find out more about these issues we consider and support for this area to be revitalized and to become a priority and we 're keen to ensure that the area is not left behind in the city 's regeneration plans of concern to us are the issues that people who are homeless and all on loan and incomes continue to face the hardships that we continue to see and hear about require council shown leadership by working with other agencies and organizations to make the inner city East a great place to live we 're particularly supportive of the three projects below that all tie in together two years ago to fattier a matter started discussions with the former board on issues within the Lynwood and the city east area and the issues I 've outlined have been highlighted over the past two years to the previous board we 're in support of difficulty fatigue really matter trust being allocated funding for the community lead revitalization for a community level revitalization plan which has already been supported by the board to date and we do not want to see the currently the case and the perception is the perception of the area becoming unsafe is now starting to become a reality and and especially with street begging and drinking on Doris Lusk Reserve which you 've all no doubt heard about we came so that 's so that 's the revitalization plan the other thing is the inner city East and then would village drop-in center and as mentioned before we 're keen well we were keen for council to allocate one hundred thousand dollars towards a drop-in center for homeless straight teen operated as a drop-in center and the Cinch in this scene in the center of the city central before the earthquakes and after the earthquakes this was demolished this gap has been the get versus left has been felt over the past few years and there 's no place where homeless can meet and socialize in a safe environment that 's and that 's non-threatening to others we like the council use its power allocation of seventy thousand dollars proposed to fund the changing and changing sheets and Sumner to go towards this project instead we request for property to be rented and for a worker to be employed the third part of of these community goals is the development of six housing units at 276 Barbados Street it is important that if we are to begin addressing the acute sort acute shortage of affordable housing particularly for older single men who lived in bed sets about three hundred of which were demolished after the earthquake we support the letter mote community housing trust being allocated six hundred thousand dollars from the annual plan to meet the shortfall required for construction of these six units we would like to acknowledge the previous support given by counsel and we would like to see counsel continue to support this or continue their commitment to this investment and I 'm happy to take the rest of it as reads and have some further questions can I just ask you about Eli Street partners you know side effect that I used to live there that 's I see the numbers there you 've gone from 33 residences to a hundred and six apartments townhouses and separate occupancies and rooms to rent original Street and that 's a that is the impact of the new central city planning requirements that don 't require parking and the same numbers as they did before so it 's the same as wreckage on so has the community board actually come up with any ideas as to how we might reduce pressures on on streets like this because I mean I think providing parking and the streets if you 've got tiny little cottages up against townhouses and rooms to rent it 's just not possible to soul on the street yeah I mean it 's a it 's a good topic of discussion and probably around this table more so than Ayres but yeah our focus has really been on on this street and also just the bad stated sin as well as having a lack of on street parking and but you know I totally agree but it won 't be solved by on street parking as what I 'm saying because there isn 't enough room on the street yeah yeah so I guess that 's something that we should pick up but other ways of providing parking and some of these really significantly but the word that I 'm looking for you know with intensified areas of development because this is the consequence of not providing parking like that yeah airball doesn 't have any suggestions but it 's a discussion for the stable it 's very good thinking and Phil Thank You Jake for your board submission and especially the important matters that you brought to our attention I 'm referring to the the need for the of the homeless and the year you 've described and also that whole revitalizing revitalization plan what I want to ask you about is would you envisage that work being done or the strategic part of it in conjunction with council and possibly the social and Community Development Committee and like I guess the drop-in center concept might be an example where clearly I would understand there would be like a place for homeless people to go during the day but there 's other parameters and other agencies that you referred to so would you see that being caught one yeah Town Council involved but Tafari really matter the the perfect partner for I 'm not sure they want to run the drop-in center themselves but that we 're we 're wanting yeah that would be the trust in which we would want to see and to see a resourcing go and a plan come from there so you 'll see the trustee like a lead lead leading sort of agency with with this plan okay the other aspect I want to ask you about was your point about the Linwood Paul and just that you 've probably heard Jada this some concern that with a number of Paul was around the city that future optics costs must be taken to account so in probably particularly with the Metro Sports pork being taken now into consideration that there also be like an aquatic facilities review so presumably that there is also information which would help inform the planning of future Paul at Linwood and yeah so what 's what 's the question is the question--my Nia 's in asking for the Paul for your ward area it 's really just to really let you known in fact I understand that because the operations cost costs altogether of future portals in making sure that they pay for example and your view and aquatics facilities review so we make sure that a lot of different costs of the pools across the the our lineup I understand the future optics cause for council about about these new facilities as of you know huge concern but I guess what I would go back to is the fact that this pool is needed and in the area where Metro Sports isn 't isn 't going to serve those communities it 's been a long stablish need and there 's a bit of a community expectation for it as well which wish I think also needs to be considered and yeah thanks Jay my thanks Jack I just want to ask you a question around the pools as well and it 's good to see that I 'm obviously this Paul 's going to be focused on being a community Paul that obviously meets the needs in that area yeah I mean we obviously understand there is need there obviously you think there 's a possibility of reducing it to meet those needs and yeah I don 't know yet each means five million yes so it 's obviously when we look at each beer it 's going to have a loon as Paul 25-meter pool but obviously it 's not going to be completely covered and all year round to pull back the Lunas pools cover and understand it and then would you obviously would like to have a covered pool which is fair enough but if we 're looking at five million dollars for something a new tree like that if we 're going up twenty million dollars there 's a lot of money for a community pool sure I mean I 'm certainly not going to advocate for a downscaling of the project but um but yeah it yeah it 's a question that could probably be better asked and consultation with the project planners and and and around the board table where we discuss what we want from the community facility that we 're advocating for here yeah I just wanted to make a mention for see that happen and I think we can bring it together some really good planning tools to make that happen with the community but just on the the funding side of it for the revitalization plan I just want to bring it to the attention that in the last finance and performance report there was an seventeen point 0.2 to the transitional city projects in the central city and suburban centers there 's a hundred and thirty thousand dollar under spend there with the comment being that there 's 80 thousand dollars allocated to community support our support to spend in suburban Christchurch that hasn 't been pursued and they 're looking for ways to spin that so I think that needs to be tied into this there actually is some funding there potentially to actually start to kick that process off without having to go into those in your plan process so I just want to make sure that that has been captured that may well be too but also and I did notice that the comment at the end of your submission concerned about the amount of time fund and it may well be that reaching out to Joe Farley roy marty motor and association with that partnership farmer was becoming back to council for decision-making around the criteria soon Mary Richardson just looking at you oh she really reading something important yet that the community resilience partnership fund you becoming back with criteria very soon and I was just saying that per tent in some possible proposals and I think the the submissions and representations that have been made in relation to revitalization wish we could say regeneration that it 's all on the same page for with authority Roy Mata they may make one of the ideal partners that we would be looking for in that and that respect but we don 't want to open up a fund to applications we actually want it to be quiet an engaged process for forming real partnerships so it isn 't about you apply as a supplicant applicant to that council to do things that 's actually what can we do collaboratively together as a City Council with various communities within the cap within the Council 's area a whole lot of people in this room working on this and so yeah it 's not an easily area but I don 't know it wasn 't a knee the area when they started but they started about 15 years ago which makes a huge difference in terms of where they 've got to today yeah so thank you very much Jay Horace I 'm thank you very worthwhile and the last of the community boards as Pendleton why Mari here would David Cartwright page _"

    "text": "the next one is the bank 's blood-sugar community board and that 's page 30 teacher Li I got after Dana thank you for the opportunity to be here this afternoon and care point I 'm just like to start off with a sound that the board really appreciate the inclusion of Boston it 's pointless own Penelope the equation of those four Community Board proposals that and my draft Daniel plain and these two that relate to dive in Harbor community and were thrilled about that and the Dove and have a community too because they 've really worked hard on the village plane so I think the collaboration trend Council in community really as important here so once again thank you um it 's not to see you I 've been clocked different what 's on the story it 's any here the other one was a reserve management and planes um scrapes and these management committees really important to the be exponential our here huge amount of volunteer labor that goes into looking after the reserves the acai I once again although it 's a good way study for the potable water I felt maturely important because we have a lot of young families Lebanon okaying space I be good to see something cookie sort of at the earth apparently they are moving to accounts by because of the low rents and once again my staff was having to buy fresh water from the shops which doesn 't always help your sequence tenses and today we 'd like to just put the forward additional projects and show you the piece is a Little River tennis courts and coronation library which is theater the community of Little River they 've obviously been out of action sorts the earthquakes Ange they 've he 'd significant David damage done to them due to the flooding just speaking to community members in also to a board member from the and they are much lower facilities and they really would like to say something put towards and some flood mitigation week and I really think that would help keep them encouraged was the rather Big Ideas project so it 's another proposal that we 'd liked her and had considered here so our prior to the earthquakes the coronation library was used is the toy librarian also was the office for the local MP show and so obviously it has been used and it was Philistine Lee perk obviously which is an app Aurora in that he 's done in use so wit was to go ahead what 's the park between staff in the management received committee and but the fundings being pulled so at the moment the zero and the badge are attained and we just really would like to see if it becomes that that the family be reinstated once again it 's really important to us on the financial of the we really keep here management committees encouraged we have like a say a huge amount of volunteer labor that chemistry these end they get easily discouraged and frustrated like everybody but I think if they can be considered once again it would be good if not we just really want to fig how important neat project does Iker our infrastructure the public community see the Tollison need really need a bit of an upgrade one of their need to bus tourists down to the other entity aunties tallit Stanley because I think so overloaded just a general tidy up I think will really help was the facilitator Nicaragua I mean it 's great that the cruise ships kept returning to little town but also they will continue to go to echo our and I think it 's just really important that that infrastructures up to screech so the border of Christine 15,000 for the infrastructure planning to you so echo and present show warm and welcoming face to its many visitors final one as the winery wastewater treatment plant which is a bit of a hot topic and Israel concerns here and with the agency at 10th and Kim contamination that 's falling out to the rivers India our harbor with after heavy rains thus as well the project was just we started 2008 hang has been delayed to 2023 I think we 're going to have really absolute people over there I know II something 's not done so obviously any waste water issues I can 't inch us as we just um dealt with recently be considered so it was that really take any questions Christian 's Andrew Thank You Christine the Stanley Park renewal funds I appreciate the frustration of the reserve management committee not been advised that those funds were being pushed back or taken out are you aware that the reserve or are you aware whether the reserve management committee have got a work program to use all of those funds in the in the year concerned as of aware that there is a case and that they were ready to and you know who start with the work or stuff so they could spend all of that money as it was previously before the change it seemed like a huge amount of money for a new steps and a sign I mean really fifty five grand it 's positive does the states I think there 's a lot of animal oh yeah um so there 's you know quite a huge development with plantains and is obviously the steeps in just a whole you know development of their area once again I think it 's quad cane area for a Corolla just thought that it did seem like a lot of money you know like I mean I mean I guess that what might be useful would be to know from the reserved management committee you know what what would be required to to do the basics you know sure in the meantime but anyway we can talk to staff about that Yanni I was on those daily part management plan hearings and help develop it with the hearings panel so my understanding was that there was quite a significant amount put on budget that was pared back because there were other reserves on the peninsula that needed funding and the management committee was okay with that but I guess it 's a bit like a question that 's been just asked are you aware of in terms of the management plan what funds have been done in the last four years know familiar with all of that and work that 's been done through my understanding when I when we did the site visit that there was some pretty basic health and safety stuff like the steps that really were done or not yeah I cannot speak to Big Bob you know Lou doesn 't look like up from the photo I just know that there was a bit of that seat and aimed because I think network was ready to take place and also they have consultation that the budget was going to be reduce without consultation so um there 's one other points that we really needed to make today so was one a program or is that Anna was the board not aware that this was the case all right number that 's that thank you for that thank you are there any other questions that no but thank you very much much of a bunch appreciative this quite a number of submissions from Agora so will will pick up on some of the issues that you raised there with with other submitters as well but thanks to the community board for covering extensively right across your boards to think here you we 're doing it award it ran the whole lot everyone you 're the only one with one ward but many parts great thanks _"

to introduce sorry it 's better you didn 't call me met Amir for once you said not be no it 's much appreciated oh thank you I didn 't realize it was a problem but in your rate will never happen again excellent just like to introduce a room on my deputy Allen Broughton and Ross mcFarland so we got somebody from each about three wards at the table I won 't go too much into the preamble other than to say of course that that post-earthquake the southwest area Christchurch is done is increasing rapidly with expansion and development and it was always planned under the UDS industry and the southwest area plan that it was going to be any area for for growth and of course that 's been shunted down at a rapid rate of knots so we err we 're we 're very very busy and our would but met at this this term is we identified the following things as their main priorities to protect to maintain their high-quality potable untreated water supply and that and the fifth point there is compliance and monitoring of conceits particularly associated with quiring and activities and its effects so those two sort of things go really really hand-in-hand_``_115.619 we want to protect our water into the future and we 've got to be very very careful about what what 's happening to the west of our city with quarrys and particularly what goes into those holes in the ground dough 's traitors once the quarrying activities finished so ram that moves on into the next matter that we really want to touch on in this the board cannot stress enough the importance of ensuring that the council has through it through this plan the capacity and the resources allocated so the high standards of monitoring and compliance of associated concedes conditions are in place and capable of being maintained so that 's that 's and that 's an issue it 's not only for our community board but we do want their toolbox as a city to to monitor and and have compliance with with resource can see it 's in their conditions otherwise we 're running around in reactive mode trying to get things to be the way they should and it takes a lot of time and energy so we just like to emphasize that fact the capital program expenditure and I won 't read through all of those but just to say that we 're very very happy to see those and those items in error in our budget a lot of issues there to do with them with them stormwater retention detention and drainage issues and we cannot cannot try and cut budgets in that area because we do have basins and our many awards in low-lying areas and we do have the headwaters of the Heathcote and the Aven rivers as well and our Ward and the horse will River as well so everything flows from our part of the town so we 've got to make sure that we don 't make things too uncomfortable for the people downstream from us either the Kashmir and board that 's a bordering issue with there room where there dear friends from UM from from cache miss Braden and of course in light and what 's happened with the with the fires recently on the port Hills is there 's going to be a lot of logging over the next few months and perhaps even up to a year to actually clear a lot of that land away now and and re-plot and I 'm really really pleased to know that the replied is going to be going headed in in that area very very soon the nurses Memorial Chapel we 're really really pleased to see that brought back forward again and Bradshaw Terrace is something that our community board have been on about for quite a long time and we just the curve in channel renewal was in suit from overheads of their previous and boards and submission did a lot of that old truth disenchant and dis urban channel in Aaron and their Ward as well that was getting past its use-by date pre-earthquake and it 's still still an issue we 're um another horville Junction Road which is going to be a key and Road linkage through the immortally Business Park in in and north and Seth and has come to come up against a bit of a hiccup of the budget shortfall to actually progress that and the heavy heavy vehicle numbers going through this area really making a mess of the residential areas and do we actually spend money on fixing up those residential streets that have been torn to pieces with the damage from the heavy vehicles or do we actually go ahead and fix the budget shortfall so that we can get the Hallsville junction road to be a smooth flow through to poundin and out to the towards the airport and moving on then we we really need to stress that the provision of the forty kilometers per hour speed zones outside schools and really appreciate the fact that all all the boards that have submitted so far a sign that that is a key a key things that we 're just dressing that if we can find money in a budget please put it into those school and that 's what the community asking is for and really there 's some road safety issues there 's a string of them in a year I don 't need to go and do any great detail just to say that these the things that we 're going to have to work on in the southwest across church and pre-earthquake we had to cross the creek study that some of us may remember Christ youit 's Wollaston environments transport study and I think it 's really really time that we reviewed that study now with the development that 's happened and Rolleston into the in-demand selwyn district and we really need to work together with NZTA and in neighboring authorities to get a new transport study done so that we could all work from there the other issue is to do with them rates I think goal um I 'll leave to them to Helen and to Ross and answer any questions from any of us Helen do you want to see yes thank you look we are aware that you brought the resident residential rate down to 4.2 yeah just going forward we 've tabled the cost on a 970 dollar house which i think is where the hoot is coming higher level enjoy be 170,000 so I think that 's where the rates are impacting particularly on people who have fixed income so I think you 've done well to get it at 4.2 I think just going forward if you can be very aware of those people on above medium level houses because normally in the media it quotes the rate increase per year and for a median house it sounds fairly minor but at those other ends it 's getting harder and harder for those on fixed incomes so that 's all I 've got there and Ross had something on we 're all right are the council be fully aware of the number of submissions for the last annual plan regarding the point called the remote rural rebate this is a twenty five percent rebate applied to true rural properties and there is ongoing just consumed in the award because of the application or the inequitable application of that right and I 'll explain this is great to get the equitability across the whole city that they started in the southwest area and they 're slowly moving around the city eventually getting to be exponential well that effectively means that people who are on or not getting that rate in the southwest area a plant are being paying it two years ahead of other areas in the city but that in equitable application of that that way that needs to be revisited the whole are how would you say mythology of the rate is very very confusing it 's I would call 49 shades of grey there is that many different views by staff on how to actually apply that right we 've just gone through a full district plan review thinkest on we go back towards the next three-year long term plan and really assess the basis of our capital valuation and the resultant application of that to our rates database we know what 's residential we know what 's rule we know what 's business we have business rate we have rural rate we have residential rate where you live and the capital up your rate account at the moment we have staff who visit properties and check whether they 're truly rural as their horse grazing is there rating undertaken if that property of the changes to another use there is no mythology to get that changed through the rating system keep it simple business rural residential so that 's where we need to look to for the next rate any questions next Alice said we got a little bit of time I just like to just a point of the accessible recreation and support other boards as well and having a close look at that to make sure that it 's affordable and very affordable and accessible for for the members of our community especially young people so we just want to make sure that we spend a lot of money building facilities community facilities for sport and recreation we just want to make sure that they 're available and accessible but I 've got a question from Jami channel she you suggest the 40 kilometer per hour school on you know the increase from the particle from three to six a monopoly suggests the parties up to the 500k pop it 's a 10 school per year so to you agree or not but your is a six body before sat here how long I 'm not gonna disagree I 'm gonna agree with them these are forgetting that if we can get a bigger slice of the cherry into that safety throughout the city okay it would would certainly not be opposed to that for our board would be nodding nodding no thank you David under the subheading New Brighton saltwater pools you expressing a preference for the wider development aspects of this project to be considered by the council next long-term plan can you elaborate what you would make sloping do it up looking wider development a Spectre look over here just at all even less than that we actually had quite a long debate about it but we had a range of views and in the end we came down on top just as a kind of trying to find a middle ground that we would argue that it go forward in the long term plan we strongly people have been advocating for it so I think we 've just let this lie and and we aren 't pushing it it was just getting a compromise from the people in the room at that time appreciate gasping that created appreciate the absence of Helens giving yeah I mean it 's it 's actually been quite a good process because it has meant that people want the other parts of the city have actually responded extremely positively to the idea of investing more and you brighten as their destination so it 's actually been a good crazy we 're very compassionate is enabling people I 'm sure I 'm sure there 's a so-so in fact I 'm sure there 's a heavy heavy response to that around the table but like thank you very much much appreciate your time thank you thank you _"

    "text": "the next is the coastal Burwood community board and that 's our page 20 begins on page 20 become money and Landis George I think oh and Tim centers as well I think Linda you chaired the submissions panel on this one [Music] good afternoon councilors lien and staff and community firstly I just like to introduce I 'm come money on the chair of the board and with me today we have Linda Stewart who 's the chair of our submissions committee we have Tim centers whose Deputy Chair enjoy where 's our board Governance Manager thank you for the opportunity to present today on our hand on to Linda okay in a nutshell what we 're trying to do with this annual plan submission is get the best outcome we can for because we know that with the redzone issues that have still to be resolved we can 't_''_98.34 put a lot on to the western north side of the Burwood water that all and so with a lot of thought we 've come up with a plan that looks at how we can get the best out for now to set the scene for our annual plan submission i would like to refresh your memories on an analogy most of you have heard me use before that points out how the coastal board ward has potential to add real value to the entire city the analogy we are all the family living in a lovely house called the city but unfortunately two rooms require serious renovation the first room the kitchen the hub the central part of the house actually requires a complete rebuild which is going to take a very long time but will be amazing the other room is the largest living room with sunning panoramic views and has potential for outdoor living and entertainment the family that 's you got together and decided that this living room once renovated had huge potential to add real value to the house that this living room once renovated could be enjoyed by the whole family while waiting for the kitchen hub to be rebuilt that this living room would also be enjoyed by all the visitors who came to the house so the living room costal burl entire city just like to look at slide number two just for a few of those points this analogy requires a shift in our thinking across the city from equality to equity and we all know that must reflect when it comes to the slicing of the pie we are very encouraged to see that that shift has begun and may it continue under the capital program the board 's recognizes and supports the program of capital projects identified for our ward in particular hot saltwater pools phase 1 suburban master plans the New Brighton and the New Brighton master plan Street scapes these work together hand-in-hand I must mention at this point the awesome effort by the community around the submission numbers approximately I think 828 about 60% of the submissions to the annual plan thank you everybody for doing it that was just awesome development Christchurch limited DCL has been engaged by council to lead a regeneration project a New Brighton our board is working with them and us on this and support the work they are doing along with regenerate Christchurch limited the hot saltwater pools are the New Brighton regeneration plan securing this budget will signal to our community that our regeneration has finally begun and restore some hope the investment and the living room adds real value to the city and our citizens the speech of the Metropolitan beach the closest to many areas of our city to quote from Peter Townsend article and the press on the 28th of April 17 quote it is therefore timely to consider the unique points of difference that will make Christchurch the most livable city in praat and New Zealand our city of the future will be defined by the experiences of its residents and its visitors in quote the hot start would oppose will be a unique Metropolitan visitor attraction and it has strong community support therefore we support the provision of the 11.2 million in this annual plan I 'm talking to the queue to slide see there 's a great big thank you there and we mean it from the bottom of our hearts the ward has going to get its heart back and so we 've been a whether asked for the 21,000 to with no holdups and the other aspect that we 're looking at with q2 Park is a master plan board has acknowledged that the community 's level of interest is extremely high and that is mainly because it 's right in the heart of the ward right in the middle of both wards it has great public transport routes and it 's going to have the two high schools so we 'll be the beating heart of the ward again when the board would like a leadership role in the master planning to maximize the investment of so many key stakeholders other capital projects that would like to highlight of Thompson Park and Paige 's road came to address these concerns and issues raised by a community you see there up on the slide there 's pages right there the main entry and thoroughfare into New Brighton needs to be uncoupled from the bridge budget this repair is urgent operational maintenance levels of service when you brighten the board supports increasing the level of service to match the increasing use of the area for net national city wide and local events for example coast to coast New Zealand Surf Life Saving Championships the railway troop festival of surfing guy fourth plate day buskers just to name a few and approximately 10,000 visitors we get to the pier each month operational budgets need to support that this increased use of the area together with a high level of maintenance so we 're saying pre and post events on public holidays and hot days for example mowing the long grass before the ends at day service think of it as a spring clean for the living room and now this slide here looks at Parma 's road in bro Mont Street Brahman Streeters and even dialects on the edge of the residential red zone these two areas have fallen through the cracks and the street manuals literally no sorry sorry I said literally falling through the cracks yes I like that that was funny it just took a long time to get to me no no I think it went under the long-term plan but the area is pretty as devastated and very similar to what Ali was talking about and the 's Road there 's a lot of elderly people there 's people with disabilities and there 's a social housing it 's got the old fashioned guttering I forgot much cool at the app but thank you and yeah it 's it 's pretty soul-destroying to look at the place so we 're asking if those can be brought forward as a priority it 's at the end of the street is red sign doesn 't it I mean it that these both right on yeah usually yeah literally Larijani okay yeah right no no me no me no no I 'm sorry bro Mont Street is on the edge of the red zone not Pam is right but Pam is Road has got red zone enough at the very end a beam down by the river yeah yeah we 've got to find out why this hasn 't been done thanks des right we 're looking at the slide and yet this is the second time you 've seen it we have to say the work that has been done in conjunction with the pepperiness board has been really a lot of community led input so that 's cut saved on that on the costs and really all it needs an hour 's water to make it go fifty thousand I 'd be great no that 's that 's a bit small know that South hasn 't up here that 's down south okay and Kiwi Abel look this has been a really good project that it has worked for a number of years and since the earthquakes it 's it 's kind of falling down through the cracks and doesn 't didn 't have a priority and partly because we didn 't have the poles to meet the needs of people there is a lot of bit of blurring of the lines here initially kiri Abel was for disabled people it was a form that your doctor and consult consultation with patient would sign off and then they could get out there and use the poles and they could do a well watch outing other things like that and it was really aimed at getting people with disabilities out in the community and and reduce that social isolation people with disabilities then you 've got your community services card was which does almost the same things and it 's a good good process as well and then of course you got the the gold card and I 'm just a wee bit concerned that if we don 't keep Kiwi able for disabled people and up the ante so that we were catching up and giving them the incentive to get out again then the lines become a little bit blurred and people really don 't know what 's going on Kelly Abel was always flowing under the radar really it was only when people knew that you had a clearly able card and I do have one that they went out there and got one themselves so what would really like to seize some thought go into that one right feedback on consultation process would just like to highlight this a little bit protect details and the annual plan consultation summary for each ward contain acronyms and lack of detail which makes it difficult for board members especially newbies like me and members of the public to creating an inclusive democratic process the board would like to see project names simplified and a short project summary available online for each project and an annual plan long term plan and we 're just showing up there stuff I found something that seep in part reservoir replacement is a real good example on fact so we 'll leave that one with you really know that stuff will open to there anyway I just like to highlight here and note as you are aware the eastery edge and flood protection is a very high priority for our board and our community we are continuing to pursue a resolution with the relevant authorities and finally the coastal board community board would like to formally and respectfully request the council ratify our 1718 area plan budget so thank you again for the opportunity to present with your help we look forward to getting hot saltwater pools and our regeneration started thank you thank you missions are done what a thanks for the great presentation just got a couple of questions around the level of service is that do you think there would gap of amount of staff in the area is it a budget thing that we need more money for I think that 's probably a question that probably needs to be taken to staff so yeah I 'm not sure where it needs to be you know increased staff or whether it needs to be the budget but that we 're happy to sit down staff in work through that side yes sorry okay I was just looking at um Palmer 's Road and it might be something to go back but CPMs id3 367 is about their waste water mains renewal that 's budgeted for 2018-2019 there 's 1.5 million dollars and then there 's CPMs ID 2 3 8 7 7 which is about the partners Road reconstruction renewal that was tied in and think there 's 57 thousand dollars for this financial year so there has been a study on it so it might be good to find where that is actually at so that we can actually maybe tie in all that work to get done at the same time ok yeah be probably quite a they respond that I just oh sorry draw so when will the waste work waterworks be completed yeah 19 is what I 'm looking at at the moment so there 's 150,000 dollars this year 192 for next financial year and then the main bulk of the work looks like it 's not at 18 19 their understanding Elsa that doesn 't actually include that budget doesn 't really include the writing in the foot platform you also know but what he 's saying is is that then comes after that comes out of it states you 've done I mean you wouldn 't dig up the road and retook it up but well we 're having a show around some of the programs and we do need to get some on top of that yes so the question we need to ask us with yeah which in terms of the annual plan and the process that we 're trying to go through here is that I guess one of the questions that I would ask us as whether we could look at bringing forward the the underlying works in 's the question is whether the wastewater work be brought forward so but we 'll just make a note of that and and consider that in conjunction with your request Thank You Ari thank you for that yes that 's really good news thank you who else Yanni only just wanted to check in terms of the majors did you put discuss the issue with the majors I know last year you asked if we could put additional funding on budget foot to address that issue that 's causing a lot of annoyance eventually got a meeting with the property concerns and wind say oh tonight I 'm sorry forgive you yeah to address this it 's not an easy one to address but we 're going to get everybody on site and have another discussion and just relook at everything that 's been done and the possibilities going forward okay better decision Jesse you 're not asking us for any extra resource to deal with it um well not at this stage we need to talk with what sort of requirements are needed and then we 'll discuss it of time but okay well offer a quick explanatory on Brian Wood Street meetings there the residents were told to land still settling yet streets around it have been renewed somewhat for me the restaurant of the stack up pages Road that will stay like that and till the bridges replaced if we stay with the current if we don 't and that 's the question that we have been asked but we 're going to hear a report from staffs net that 's why we 've promoted detaching it from the bridge we can 't actually detach pages ropes initially from the brain our you me but anyway not thinking very much and I mean you 've raised some really good Oh shoes and and and we 'll get underneath the you know that the detailed elements of each of those requests that you 've made thank you really thank you very much thanks for Nikki right _"

    "text": "so I 'm just going to give you the right instead of giving you the the numbers I 'm going to give you the hub numbers so that you can turn to the right page so it 's page 18 welcome Ellie Jones and Emma Norris hi it 's not it 's not us we do like things mm-hmm it 's not us but we do like Banks Peninsula that 's us thank you fantastic thank you I thanks for allowing us to speak to you today I 'm Ellie Jones and my dick teacher as a menorah shhhhhh just a little bit about our community board or a rather about our ward we are a word of around forty five and a half thousand people and we are estimated to grow up to 57 or more than 47,000 people by 2043 I 'll get to the community center and Shirley Road in just a moment I just want to preface what we 're going to talk about with Shirley Road with this first our Ward 's papa Louie and Anna 's particularly in the East around Shirley in Richmond earthquakes and the intervening years and in fact have gained very little like the east of Christchurch about which I have to say we hear a great deal and that 's great there is need there as well the east of our Ward still has broken roads broken footpaths few community facilities and suffers from high deprivation as we were told at the community boards local government New Zealand conference at the weekend and as you all know we are here as community board members to advocate for our residents especially for those who otherwise are not able to do that for themselves and might be left behind our ward on the face of it seems to have or appears to have a pretty significant budget as far as spending projects go however most of that money is for essential infrastructure wastewater stormwater flooding management and other major flooding projects and we 're very grateful for that investment that an investment in our infrastructure which is so important but we would like to emphasize that the damage and deprivation in our Ward that it must be addressed as enthusiastically as same issues we 're not asking for a 20 million dollar pool complex in fact we want meeting spaces we want to restore on community frameworks and that 's what meeting places and community centers facilitate the community center on Shirley Road came off the table much to our surprise I have to say when we did meet on this earlier in the year this is a building that has been on the table and off the table like a yo-yo and I do recall Christchurch City Council 's John Phil Cell saying as a mission to the community board about a year ago the feedback from the community is just get on with it so we are arguing very strongly for this to be back on the table we have had excellent feedback and a lot of it from our community and I can certainly leave these for you these are emails and letters and feedback from the community on the need for Shirley Road for a community center there they are very keen the community in this area as we are indeed more widely very keen for this to take place as soon as possible some of the feedback from the community includes I 'm very pleased to hear that at long last we can look forward to the rebuild of this facility now that comment could have been been made any number of times over the last four years as it 's been on and off the table several times the recreational workers are surely which I run with have been meeting of the at the site for well over 20 years another person said we live close to the old centre we 're aware of its continual use to service the local community another says we notice that new community centres have been or are being built since the earthquake cg halls will Sumner Littleton and Mount Pleasant and we are surprised why those communities should have early community center builds over the population and the shulie area particularly given the severe earthquake damage that occurred in our ward there is no question in our opinion that the need to build the Shirley Community Center is a real need and an urgent need and there is nowhere else that these groups the many groups that have been in touch with us can meet and it 's very important to improve community interaction and support in this area of high deprivation I 'll hand over to Emma now who 's going to talk about another part of our ward I forgot about the slides see I can 't_''_304.909 do two things at once I used to be able to there it is there again that 's the space we 're talking about on Shirley Road for the community center and now the Redwood Plunket rooms there 's the library there over to you Emma the read wood plank it rooms are that building on the left in that small building and they were damaged in the earthquakes in Reed stickered in 2012 and the this area of north Northcutt is sort of the area behind the private rooms it 's a it 's been identified as having had a little community work done in it and there is a high need in the area and in 2014 the Belfast community network started a pilot project funded in a community worker into the area and the work she has done there since that time has been absolutely amazing but she is in need of a base in the area she 's currently operating out of and since Silas church just down the road and but they really need a base with no religious connotations to really get the community involved with what she 's doing so we are after the money just pull it and you 're in the annual plan to repair those planket rooms so that they can be used by the community the library is next door read with packs right behind that is a real hub of that community and in research that that social worker has done that has been highlighted by a lot of the residents that that 's the meeting place in the community and they really want that to happen and they need as urgent again these aren 't things that after six years really we can wait any longer for the area community pool obviously there 's a huge amount of history here and you will all be aware and I 'm not going to go through the history but it 's been sitting like that now as a site for several years what 's been really fantastic about this particular project is that it has been entirely community driven would support from the community board and some good support from staff as well so this is to be sold to the community for an amount then the Landers to be changed over as far as title goes which is underway now I understand and once that is all done the Ducks honor are in a row for the group to start raising funds they can 't do that just yet the cost of this build is around about three three point five million and there is very strong support in the edgeware community business and local schools preschools and families to support this community lead project which is a long time coming as well just one more note on that once that pool opens there will be no continuing obvious cost at all thanks Emma which is a big class of these community yeah yeah so there 's 've just said that it only costs three points among millions build you can build all our swing pools right that 's five that 's five I beg your pardon sorry I want the council to pay for the full cost of building swimming pool well no to support them that can be done as an interest-free loan it can be dicey yeah so a grant means a grant anyway sorry okay but you I don 't that was the original suggestion Xu of the community board but what you 're asking for is a we 'd like to have a conversation about what the options are we don 't want to take a grant off the table because we think that actually a pool like the servicing this area that then has no ongoing commitment and operating expenses from the council is exactly what the council should be facilitating communities to do so it 's just a conversation that we want together we would argue that the Spencer will surf lifesaving Club the water supply is a major issue here again this is a much used facility and the requesting everson their annual plan submission as well the club expensive all came about at the instigation of an earlier council to meet the toilet block at the beach which eventually became a changing shed and surf lifesaving club rooms the council and later the community board in the local area have supported this club for more than 40 years now and the club membership and use of the beach makes this a metro facility and responsibility and the board supports the community-led rebuild of the club rooms it 's an amazing achievement through club volunteers they 've raised outside funding in excess or a huge amount of outside funding as well as receiving a grant of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars from the endowment fund now the issue with the water is at the last minute a water supply problem has arisen which means that the new club can 't actually hook up to the existing council water supply and a new line needs to go in to allow that to happen and at present that is actually holding up the completion of the building and additional money completed it will include a replacement water foundation for the public and new septic tank has been put in by the club to service the council provided toilet block so again this is something that we could easily complete either Paulina 's waving at me or she 's counting some fingers yeah it 's about 50 thousand for that in order to get this this job completed or this project completed school speed zones and waving at me hopefully so school speed zones Emma Scott sits on that and this is an issue which has been brought up by members of our community as well as our school principals who we meet regularly and it 's obviously a safety issue and we would like the funds to be five hundred thousand dollars over the next each of the next two years to accelerate the program that is currently in place this currently 13 schools identified as requiring either school speed zones or eggs of warning signs plus 16 no there 's not a prioritized so we 're requesting that the funding to get these schools done is moved forward to principals in our ward regularly every quarter and road safety as an issue that is coming up constantly with them and not only in our Ward but across the wards so that is our requirement I just want all not requirement our requests we would really like to reiterate how important it is that we don 't lose the goodwill and don 't have you know people falling over an hour from fatigue and from having to deal with the major infrastructure repairs that our Ward has seen in the last four five six years particularly in the last two and around that Richmond Shirley area the infrastructure that needs enters needed replacing has been immense so the stress and pressure that that has put on an already really challenged part of our Ward as immense and I think meeting places very basic things like that we should be providing we don 't want or need 20 million dollar pool complexes with ongoing high operating expenses we need community spaces and facilities that meet the basic needs of a community that is still struggling still working and trying hard to chin mission I just don 't know we got into the Lumberton sherry door Camilla Center your particular I mentioned a community urgent need however you suggest is brought forward from the year 2020 21 two year 2018 to 19 but they actually is a from the third year of long term plan 2018 to 28 to the first year long term plan mm 18 to 28 but this in relation a long term plan rather than in relation to the next year annual plan the party so I just want to know if usually forward though Jimmy because it 's been moved out so far into the future through the long term plan that 's something that was actually on the table and due to start this year last year the year before has now been moved out so far that we have now stepped up and said no this can 't_''_801.86 be moved out we 're not suggesting that the whole lot of money needs to be moved forward if we can at least start because the consultation has not been done but we are a way down for so long so we just want to get on and put into place the same sort of system and process that we have used very successfully with the Shirley oh sorry with the señal burns community center so we can replicate that with a working party and get this project underway ASAP yeah I understand but I mean though these are funky funky Jimmy 's saying that you mean like MC 2018-19 rather than 2017-18 which is the financial year that were actually looking at in this annual fee right so this is Dino so it 's a junior I suppose at least 2017-18 I 'm sorry Jimmy I misunderstood you that 's right okay thank you um Yanni then gleen oh just on that particular one my understanding was there was a partnership going on with the church or the local churches is that no there was a partnership explored with the local church and there were several options within that negotiation and a conversation that were considered and it didn 't get the support of the community board in the end and was that was unfortunately or square one and look there 's nothing wrong with looking at options that 's the whole point but the point is get and look at the option if it doesn 't work get out and try again but we just can 't keep doing this now maybe we don 't get clarity around a report coming back to the appropriate committee or to find out now it 's been dealt with a community board Jonnie so it 's yeah it didn 't stack up so yeah Glen thank you thank you Elly any much just looking at the deprivation index number for that part of surely you 're talking about is it about an eight or nine I 'm just trying to track it down I couldn 't give you the number I would just tell you it 's high and we know that from the socio-economic work in the census work that the staff have provided us okay yeah you too if I may to community centers proposed a kind of in close proximity but which to their means and ovens and on the column yeah yeah McFarland Park not different it 's it 's a hall and look don 't get me wrong we are very appreciative of the support from the lines and it 's been fantastic as a stopgap measure but it is essentially a one-room building that the thing with Shirley is when it was there before it was a multi room multi-use building even though it was the old primary school sort of you know it was used so it 's not fit for purpose for a main Community Center that 's the difference ideal for McFarland Park and much needed there thank you it only takes about 50 to 70 people max in one room and the MacFarlane Park one yeah it 's lovely look thank you very cute on both of you and again appreciate the work that the community boards done sir would you like the feedback from the residents on Shirley Road or will that be available to you somewhere that if you if you want to leave them out it 's probably a soft copy rather than a hard copy just email it to the yes Syria yeah okay thank thank you thank you _"

    "text": "we 've got 15 minutes for each community board so what I 'm suggesting you know everyone 's read all of the submissions and so please just you know focus on highlighting what you really want to leave by way of a message with the council and leave some time for questions if you came yeah we the last three years we 've done the format of our submissions and slim capsule we 've placed at the beginning our sort of core beliefs and things on which we base the risks that they are reformed this year and they haven 't changed much year on year this year we first we 'll start off talking about the fundamental issue of water which station the obvious that we think that should be straight and obvious and bits sometimes actually a new news comes out about that expected our rivers and our lakes so we we continued for these that notwithstanding the mandate has abided the council particularly and does more repeat here we continue to believe that the captain should be placing Ultra probably priorities and we are particularly concerned now around guys the we have had a linear plan for the Vista for nine years maybe coming up to tier it 's effectively been up since the earthquake there is a hundred between one hundred and nine thousand one hundred and thirty thousand in the annual plan over the next several years not not counting this year which has been glazed like most other projects but there is this hundred nine thousand we 've never seen anything that told us what that hundred nine thousand can do and we don 't believe that 109,000 in support of the linear plan is consumable by the public and openings result being all that is that was discernible by public and the public power and our increasingly frustrated about the state in any neighbor award about stated to his that in its ongoing pollution in poor condition so we would like to we would like to in the near future revisit the linear plan now with a view to enacted one to get them in supported by the public and the Portugal 's recovery we just like to say thank you to staff we saw at the end our ward I was walking in the park with no cops come over we know what staff and their hard work and sweep we 're not just saying this we believe they 're a committed group of people who work 7 during that period and they work their hearts out opposition we 've always been opposed to the sale of council assets and we support the discounters decision against the sale of citta care we have always talked about disability access we think it 's gone to the backburner and in some ways understandably but it is it is a difficult question to support the cycle ways which we do with enormous enthusiasm and understand the limit of Finance which means that sometimes disability access has been the Forgotten area for the council in terms of getting people into transport into the infrastructure and into buildings not just to access services that to be employed but to be employed and we are constantly alert to the idea of where disability issues are going and for instance we 've continued to ask that that council documents council staff to discuss what any projects effect will be on disability access aquatic facilities we continue to believe that all children should have a memory in in the heat of the summer of being in a swimming pool and enjoying their life and enjoying an interaction with water we support both Lynwood and the Hornby 's swimming pools we know it 's a huge burden for the City Council to bear the the building of the swimming pools but we think all children should have access to swimming pools in my grandson and I there was swimming in the locals from in comas morning and the residents if they expressed a satisfaction that 's about maintenance levels and we who are elected representatives understand the council 's finances but we also understand the city ordinary residents reaction when they see maintenance that especially in the spring that 's not at the optimum and we 'd like to think that we can over the next couple of years improve the standard of ordinary things like footpaths streets and parks and the cow our board would have liked to have put 'll plan less along with every other board if the other boards had thought it was a priority we are engaging with the boards of trustees and they have all mentioned to us the difficulty about the safer routes to school that 's been their top priority and one other thing I just like to mention before I hand over to Mel the the thing that a couple of the boards have already mentioned to us is that the access to swimming pools is one thing the access to transport to the swimming pools is another and so that 's why we 've included that now submission um so a broad priority projects these are an order of importance so you know three point one is their most important one and the Barrington mall entry or unique set there 's a group of residents who basically have formed and keep coming to us about this except that 's quite unsafe for people to cross at those people that are disabled or elderly they try to go from the spray-tanned library across to the mall in people speed in an outlet the less term terms of these sorts of things that are being looked at something like a 45 or something we 've been told by the traffic engineer however as base is the biggest concern and we get a lot of people talking to us about it in it we has been estimated at about 150 to 200 thousand dollars it 's been needed to do some improvements there and particularly to get rid of the right hem tune that people can make from out of the mall out into Barrington Street so um we really like it to be considered really strongly thinks um the next one this is one of ones that Carolyn has really talked about which is the intersection of Barrington Street Lincoln Road and white Liev there 's going to be improvements that are happening there and we 've been told that there won 't be things for disability you know the pavers on the grounds that people can detect the lights because there 's a whole lot of elderly people and disabled people that live in their area it 's quite low socio-economic there considered and the plans for that upgrade their 70,000 70,000 funding for community center and hone hey we feel that it would be an advantage there to have some sort of catchment facility of people to use because it is something that puts people off there 's a car wash dishes so that we 've had a staff member come to us and Easter make that to be at about twenty thousand dollars it would be required to do that there 's absolutely nothing there at the moment and I 'll be quite a small improvement but a large well in terms of the community 's ability to use that facility and kashmir hanhae Weasley 's we 're all aware obviously about the Christchurch of inch park and the logging trucks that will be going through the intersection plus all the building it will be happening there with a 300 Wellings over the next few years so we 're just reiterating here that we would not not like to see that delays that I 'm the improvement to their intersection terms are putting in lights yeah I own a basketball 's a group of students that live around near Hill constantly on the park playing basketball pretty much every single time you were driving past year they have come to the board multiple times of putting two annual plain consultation meeting along with their parents and mothers and there was a large group of them and they are super keen on getting his light so we 're asking for forty thousand near two and put those lights in there so they can play into the evening a Manuka cottage would ya we waited a long time yeah yep so we 're just really wanting just to make sure that that keeps on progressing really and as we put last submission about Lincoln Road winding between Kilis Road and Reitz road our board doesn 't see that there is a priority or required I personally don 't think the traffic down there is either slow enough to warrant having four lanes there and it would make it yeah so um that 's something I always and support of not of delaying it on it not having it at all yeah um Collette 's road to rights right yeah any questions all right questions um Jonnie thank you um just two questions thank you for your submission the cost of the Barrington mall entrance except have you got any idea what 's the cost 150,000 yeah 50 traffic engineers have told us there is an estimate yeah um and then in regards to the Heathkit money I mean I remember that being put on budget it was for the projects that that like you 've identified those small projects as staff given you as the hot as the difficulty that staff haven 't been able to tell you the process is to access that funding or in identifying the projects this year 's funding has been delayed for a year and we it involves probably the kinds of planting that would happen anyway and we don 't the implementation of the linear plan which was written and it was policy before the earthquakes was a large project that would have made that look probably quite different in terms of the bank 's the closeness of the roads to the banks that involves 't afford and we and there is a hundred and nine thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand something like that budgeted every year from next year but we can 't see any results from there and just violent to see and funny you 've touched on the maintenance if you could do anything to improve the maintenance what would you do if you got that just as a banks to ensure that this is the general maintenance that you 've our general meant well with in terms of general maintenance we 'd probably like the strimmers not to be exercised to wipe out plants on the riverbank that 's just been planted by local volunteers and we 'd like the river banks to grow naturally in order to be able to clean help clean the streams but that 's also referring to what every other community board has mentioned about you know the service levels in terms of grass being cut or the things being maintained you know their dog being lost among the grass because as a grass or so tall as well then it 's referring take issue but I just don 't save what what you want us to do to address the issue ah we 'd like we 'd like to have support for we 're not we 're not particularly interested in saying no to the expenditure it 's just that it 's not discernible the effect of the expenditure and it 's not going to happen this year so we 're acknowledging that what we 'd like to do is written the next couple of years write a new linear plan for the his cut that was realistic and had goals the right better than the long-term plan yes yeah yeah so and we intend to write it into the LTP yeah no I think that 's a very positive reform price thanks Karen and Melanie and likely will they most the funding you 've asked for and fed all of it is this not relatively small sums and it seems to me to be indicative of a strong community development approach I just wanted to check when we could cottage my understanding is that in fact the fact the funding for Manuka and so the other part though was for Barrington mall and I had understood that in fact the Barrington more money for the entrance and exert that in fact that was available in current budgets but you saying you need it within the SyFy okay thanks for clarifying that that 's because it 's clearly a priority for the board yes thank you Jamie channel thank you on pages three lers paragraph three ponder two intersection Parenthood Street Lincoln draw in the Wylie everything this one has been put on the long term plan or not yet Barrington yeah yeah no it 's not been to more parented Street being the except is the exit isn 't in the long term plan yeah we would like to think well because it 's our top priority and our annual plan proposals and because it 's limited expenditure because it 's only a hundred and fifty four thousand we 'd like to see it in the annual plan yeah I think your mouth should be swimming about three point nine hundred which is the intersection of Barrington Street Lincoln differently it 's been told that it will not be fully disability accessible it will not be because of lack of money okay now around that area are is housing and care facilities for seriously disabled people elder care facilities for older people and another block inside the who Castle arena which M houses people in wheelchairs around that particular area yes so that 's the one that 's the intersection we would like to see fully disability accessible and the extra expenditure there is estimated by the traffic engineers here it 's seventy thousand okay thank you any other questions all timely one more coming Johnny can we just clarify um that intersection that 's been proposed to be deferred until 2019 and 2020 21 Hey working on it now so why are they working on it now I don 't know we were told that it was it the work will be starting within this next year so it 's listed as uncommitted and we 're taking 1.2 million off from this current year in next financial year and we 're putting it into the nineteen twenty twenty twenty one year it 's I I don 't_''_941.49 I think we 're talking at odds about doing different things I I think that changing the intersection but I think they 're also put on them the lights and change I think they 're changing the lights now in the coming year that 's because they talked to us about the signaling at Central so I 'm just trying to understand the project that you want us to put additional money for there 's the traffic signals not the intersection safety approvement the enzyme actually I mean I 'm I 'm at odds on this one because we 've been told by the traffic engineers that those signaling etcetera will be undertaken in the next year you would maybe someone care because that 's what we were informed about alright thank you very much much appreciated you 've obviously is putting a lot of it but as a community Gordon has appreciated Thank You Ian thank you we move on to the paranoid _"

    "text": "back to item 27 25 5 which is the Urban Development authorities there was a high there was a concern if you just go to the to the front but so the conclusion finally the council is reluctant to support the autonomy of you da to undertake certain works such as reclassify exchange or revoke reserves without appropriate and we would like the words delegations and safeguards without appropriate delegations and safeguards because we felt that we should be explicit about the nature of the safeguard and this is on page 2 5 oh sorry the UM it 's probably not a huge property even got the entire gender '_''_76.2 on you see it just above the conclusion the line just above so without appropriate delegations and safeguards and the appoint was was just to make it clear that we could delegate that authority as a council yep okay move by or on yeah I 'd actually like to go one step further than that if we can and rather than saying is reluctant to say Council would not support without appropriate delegations and safeguards okay just strengthens it a or comments as well which were are the bigger graph one the introduction the council generally supports any submission made by the UDS and DCL feels very difficult to do they 're having not seeing those submissions I mean I wonder whether we actually need to say that or whether we could just take that out and say that we know the UDS partnership and decel may provide their own separate submissions on the discussion document this submissions not intended to replace or detract from either of those I 'm uncomfortable saying we support something that we haven 't seen yeah you know and then word so paragraph two general submission points there could be potential merit in exploring the lessons learnt from the specific post earthquake Christchurch legislation there could be potential it 's a little bit weak we may want to say we believe there is merit in just makes it a little bit less subjunctive and not the CER ik though I wouldn 't use that as a example of anything good yeah very just and I think I 'd one more point so that the GCR and exploring or there would be men at marital exploring the lessons learned from the specific post recovery legislation such as the greater Christchurch regeneration action sorry I missed the Sir act and there from that so that 's the reason for what were the lessons learned from the cereal how long have you go to a day I gave up my binky there s we need a conference for that sure I choose not I think we need a symposium for there we can certainly remove that of that Pauling this is clarification one you might better to help me out but so this the purpose of this is about using special enabling powers that 's that through outside of normal legislative processes and just quoting from the Me 's report today that 's noted by the UDS I see that when proposing to use a regeneration act it 's necessary to satisfy the provisions of the Act to justify using the legislation so are we strong enough and being assured that there will be method and criteria to justify using this so it doesn 't become like a there 's probably a couple points to note with the gcrh council may choose not to use any legislation that may come out of this discussion document over the next three or four years while we 've got something else in place so so that wouldn 't be surprising but but we think if they would have pick up on all the matters that we 've raised in our submission which reasonably detailed then we 'd be pretty comfortable with what has been proposed yep yeah I think you I just I guess I just wondered how betterment this really was for us is this really about Oakland I mean given that it 's about infrastructure provision and land supply of which we have plenty and the letter so I guess we 're taking a principled stance today that 'd be more air position I think there are there are other places outside of all conduct could be applied nationally queenstown is one that comes to mind it 's not just for areas where they 've got land supply issues but that 's one of the examples that the that are in a reasonably unique situation and comparison the rest of the country given we 've got legislation in place so that this is just an opportunity that would avail itself to us and we may choose not to use it particularly for the next three or four years while we have other legislation in place and other organizations which re plane in that space but there 's a good chance if the legislation does go ahead it will certainly take some time with them which to enact and by the time it is it might be something that this council chooses to use it to use so it 's certainly for fragmented land land which is problematic to develop it is something which has could come in pretty handy in the future all right hello um just look thanks for the work on it Ivan like it just seems to me that you have attempted to strike a balance until the usefulness of this end caller I think your recommendation to us it it be a Urban Development Partnership and things like that makes sense but it just earlier seems to me they was pretty clearly would have taken would take potentially take away a lot of democracy from any territory Authority and that 's what Europe you 've also commented on I think quite strongly here potentially and I think the actual detail of in the draft legislation but we want a signal at this stage that the commit that has to be a community you know the community has to be involved at the start and it needs to be a partnership with the community as well with as well as with the government we think there are improvements that could be made well there in the legislation there could be improvements that could be made of the proposals that would give a bit of surance to that and that 's um yeah that 's but some strategy and one example there will be the council having the right to veto any oh that 's yeah essential absolutely engine exciting all right would someone like to move this nobody fill seconded Sarah I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "um item number 26 is the nurses Chapel repair so people will recall that I was somewhat surprised to find this had been moved and oh no it 's not that it 's item 25 it 's not could you 've ever put it in the room oh I see I changed the okay they 've changed the order and okay so I was somewhat surprised because we had announced that this was happening though I had announced this was happening and it was a bit of a surprise to find that it wasn 't so um so I asked staff to do some work and what they discovered was that in fact it had been incorrectly by error moved in the draft annual plan and and the error led to them taking the approach a pragmatic approach to approve and principle the correction and reinstatement and that would save people making submissions on the annual plan because there are some Muslims who sort of basically are pointing out that I did announce that it was happening and it you know it 's kind of you I did say that face and that would be fine but anyway the trouble was is that what it has identified when I 've done a bit more delving and it 's not stated in the report is that this is one of the examples of a program of work which includes multiple projects in it which enables budgets to change without going through a proper governance decision-making process so I I 'm of the view that we should to fear this paper until after we 've heard the hearings which means that it would go ahead with hearing the the hearings hearing the submissions that have been received on the subject but it would enable us to make a and an administrator the correct decision around the allocation of funding within these programs so when when when work has approved the two because when this probe when this project was approved it was part of the LTP so it 's set within a program at seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars it has now gone to approximately one point nine million dollars with no governance decision around it and that 's the problem and I 'm asking a question because we had a deputation from and who 's over they thank you to ask about this issue to our community board and I said well as far as I understood the project was supposed to have being started and I kind of look at that the press article it says the council which owns the building will spend an estimated 1.8 million to fix strength and restore it this was in November the work is expected to start within weeks so how could we go out and announce something so that starting weeks and it didn 't start but it did start and the sense that there 's a lot of Investigation work to be done and as you can see from the report the engineer has determined there a mortar Embera compaction test was required and the timeline to obtain the results added six weeks of the project timeframe so there was there were some delays around the technical aspects but I just saw a Richie turn up in the room okay well if you come to that so I 'm Darren is one of them probably got a couple of hundred of projects that fit with the net and so the interpretation of the word work starting the mirrors quite correcting it from that point of the announcement on the lawn and living by last year work did start in detail so we had a we had a rough water if you like developed design the the the get go on that was that we could get going with detailed design further complications were found and we 're at the point now where we are in a position where we could go out to contract for Eldar took him it 's the work subject to funding that 's great but I mean it said in here that we knew the finish time so we must have done some design we knew that there was going to be an investigation first because it is a tricky repair I mean it 's not just a straightforward order and so and I said that in my speech when we announced it that there would have to be some repair and some investigation further investigation it was never going to be a straightforward process and they did determine that further testing was required that was not oh well it wasn 't it wasn 't highlighted in the original the original approach says we go back to the the memorial chapel trust to tell them what was going on so Ritchie who wasn 't under it doesn 't seem to stand outside from it has been in touch with these guys on a regular basis so some of those folks here today representing on path I just make a comment this is one of quite a number of successful projects that my team and Richie and his project managers have delivered over the last two or three years following a similar approach both in terms of this negative design developed design resource consenting and in construction so it 's the same team delivering a very similar product and in this case the food that I 've gone the more they found and hits the cost of have increased I just make a statement there whilst the costs have increased I guess the beauty of this is and it has done over the last four years so we 've delivered all of the projects and facilities rebuilt to date to a bottom line and I am and all say it in a public arena expecting to complete the project with a surplus against that we 've had over and under so if it 's some projects cost more based on the rough water costs that we submitted in the LTP so at that time they were rough order costs some we 've delivered a bit of value some we 've gone over but we 're managing it on that overs and unders basis and this is one we 've been comfortable that we we do require a bit of additional funding we 've finished the sign of the target hey and we 've got a surplus here a bit of a couple of hundred thousand dollars so overs and unders and look I really uncomfortable with that we report through the capital governance group in terms of that process and I believe my mandate was to deliver your projects to the bottom line of program pot an have is I don 't understand we spent I don 't know how many hours and days talking to the committee words about 500,000 across the city for some for their projects for our budget and yet we 've got projects that are twice as much you know four times that amount that just appear and seem to have no discussion no reports so I mean I really appreciate the work that the felicity 's rebuild team are doing but I do think we need to understand at a governance level how how exceptions can be made we 've also got this issue I think with some of the cycleway projects as well where it 's just not clear why would we even have a line item that we consult and our draft annual plan if actually it doesn 't matter what people say the work can just get on and get done hang on Aaron this next and then booking welcome I mean is it possibly going to understand why we 're putting these projects in a draft annual plan if it actually doesn 't matter how much money that 's really this one would have continued if it hadn 't have been shifted in the budget and the you know as the report says it was an administrative era that took it out so it wasn 't supposed to be taken out it was already underway and actually it 's it 's the only reason it hasn 't proceeded to tendering to a contractor as because the funding hasn 't been secured in the annual plan process yet so the idea of the paper was to actually secure the funding for it so it could continue I would be perfectly happy to proceed with that today is it 's a decision in principle the only thing that 's been alluded to as a is the program of work approach which you have raised on a number of occasions programs that we 're not requiring any reference back to governance and it doesn 't it doesn 't feel right to me and that 's why even though obviously I would prefer that this got brought you know that we confirm today that we are going to reinstate the budget they can just get on with the job that they 've already started I would rather do that but I honestly feel as you know and my with my responsibilities that having discovered that it hasn 't been through the approval process that we 've discussed as a governance group I 'd rather I 'd rather you know be open to putting it off as well well so what but what I 'd what I thought we were going to get and I raised this at the start of the draft annual plan so the very first capital work program that we got identified that this budget had doubled and said why is that doubled can we get a report over what the issues are so that we know because it was very obvious from the first paper that we got that this had changed significantly and I was told we would get a report but we never get known in the sooner you know no I 'm not going to I 'm not going to buy that because what we were told was that it had already started so annual plan wasn 't a decision to push it out we had we had a resolution to get a report on the financial options around the nurses memorial chapel it 's a formal council resolution and it was before it was transferred but it was years ago there was in 2014 that was an email from Murray it was years ago so just because we 've got a resolution few years ago insulation goes back to 2012 12 the stuff advice was in 2014 no no no there 's stuff that we would get a report and I can send you that email again you know no I 've got the email so I mean I want this project to happen but I do think like with most the Heritage projects we 've got we have an option around how much we spend on versus repair versus deferred maintenance we have options around what level of code we 're going to we haven 't had any of that information on this project yeah and we 've also not had we 've also not had information generally about priorities as againt 'll be some people in Christchurch who 'd prefer that we put heritage on the back burner until some of the other things are appeared so we 're looking at a range of options around different models of delivery different trusts that we could set up around certain buildings some we can 't_''_718.43 because they 're statutory but you know that I mean we 're trying to look at different ways as a city of getting these things done but I think one of the pizzas is done it so does it the time that programs are put on the LTP they are put on with a approximate budget yeah because we don 't want to have done our speed a whole lot of money on detailed designs until we know they 're going to get through that get over that hurdle once in the program the council has given discretionary to the capital governance group to actually make those who guess decisions about over and under so it 's not just lifted Aaron he does actually report on to a governance group that actually look at sort of yeah program that 's right and if there was ever a point that actually something was going to fall out of the program that would certainly come back to Council because it 's actually here 's a package of projects and you do it within the under this bottom line and you manage your overs and unders as you get the detailed designs what does it mean the one that the end has amazing the greatest air of missing you sorry I see the question and they made that prioritized as equals if you like so we 're not nurses Chapel may appear on a list at the bottom it 's not we 're doing them as they come on stream as the Derval achievable so they 're all being delivered at once we 've got some that are still in design some like the tacit hose now complete they were all in the same sort of the Maxell together and things move as projects do that some of them are easy to move through nurses Chapel has proven to be more complicated than we envisage two years ago and put commitment to me from me is that they will all be delivered because that was the commitment whether they 're rebuilds or repairs era yeah so I was more than happy to move this today because this is just a correction to something that was incorrectly deferred and the reason why was more than happy to do it and so I 'll ask you the question around that is over timing that this needs to be finished by next year and it says August next year in here is my expectation is well and that 's only eight weeks before the November 100-year anniversary of the end of the war which is very important given the status of this chapel too not just this city but the entire country yes agreed and knowing that that was coming here today that date has had a lot of attention in the last week with a commitment that that is our commitment so so freeing up the funding the team are in a position where we want to go out and solicit a tender for the builders affects this building we couldn 't in terms of we didn 't have money in the bank to support the tender process this will allow that process to take place and then at that that 's if this is not corrected today is there a chance we can miss that deadline quite possibly yes thank you I 'm sorry Jamie I 'm sorry Becky was near I even I won 't_''_913.32 i won 't evict of the over cylinders there had been quite a few in terms of heritage buildings that 's quite difficult to achieve what 's going to happen but basically they have been overs and others all the way through that have then been approved along the way and the works all being done from the same budget basically absolutely right so if you like this as a current code it was approved and then if you like projects our siblings if it that they could have apartment take off the required amount and at the end of the project surplus is put back to the parent until the next projects going and mate and in this case to be fair with the rough order cost of a couple of years ago that we 've had and as I say the tacky hey we 've just stopped just approved the change request which will grab the David and the governance group for approval to return as I say a couple of hundred thousand dollars back into that into the Heritage Program but the difficulty with heritage buildings you don 't know all of the details until you do the exploratory particular so you 're always going to get that overnight under it 's what I 'm not seeing the problem hugely I 'm trying Rhys data so no I know what yours to think it is yeah but I think that I mean that the difficult thing for me is that you know under the local government egg it seems like we have delegated to staff a really high level of decision-making around options around repair timing priorities within a program and that that to me wasn 't as crystal clear as it is with this this decision but but given where it 's up to and given the importance of it in I mean I 'm I 'm perfectly comfortable with passing this resolution and getting the contractor to complete the work I 'm really comfortable with their but what I 'm not comfortable with as as saying that that 's going that the mechanism for spending these vast sums and monies within programs as necessarily right and maybe that 's what we need to get a report back on so that we can actually consider it but it 's not just your program of work it 's it 's actually other programs of work I think there 's 60 to 70 programs where significant sums of money are are located and I think that we need to have because I keep saying just because it 's on budget it 's not a governance decision to commence the work you know that you know we we we are required to you know the guards of the repairs contribution to these things we may have got some insurance but certainly it 's not insurance or some paying for the total amount of these restorations but anyway Jamie yeah kind of carries on with and I guess at the end of the day it all comes out in the wash can why can 't we do it can 't we do their work with us what with the overruns we 've known this this has been you know since the dawn of our facilities rebuilds are constantly being overs Landers and we 've reached into other GM jars to be able to top other things up how with our surplus there what 's what 's the additional amount that that we would know it 's not it 's only been moved it 's been moved in the budget by excellent we need to bring it forward for it to continue so we can open up 2018 so is it it 's actually somebody so it 's just simply that due to the administrative era the funding that was in this current year is now in the next year create okay well the issue that I 've been got with it so that 's even simpler again probably clarifies my position even more the most important thing is that you do what you say you going to do it I can 't see how there is any other option but to not progress with us it 's not a tremendous amount of money there are others and other areas and we 've started it in we just like wind it have to finish it I still I can see I mean maybe I 'm missing what the debate is then around it because it seems like like there 's no other option why don 't you agree I don 't know what your Griffin the only reason that I 'm raising it is because there was not a governance decision to proceed with it as I thought there was and shall we meet it now q what you I can help us is that we the thing is is that we don 't have a paper and it 's my thing is that we don 't have a paper you know when we when we do major projects we have a paper that sets out all of the background all of the details I mean there was a land swap involved here this came over the council back in 2013 before I was elected as the mayor so dates back quite considerably it was implemented by ordering council and 2014 so that was when I was the mayor and it was in relation to a whole land swapping around the development of the of the hospital but the agreement had already been made that we would take it over there 's a whole Christian around insurance which is not included in this report there was a whole question around a number of other elements of the of the whole process so nothing 's transparent around it so I would like to see a transparent report that details all of the background and all of the processes and everything and I thought we had done that when I announced it that doesn 't need to be mutually exclusive though to does it then to the in principle recommendation not so I think we could still make an invincible recommendation which I think gives the comfort that they actually deserve I 'd be really happy for their because I want it brought forward so that they were I also want us to set up a good decision-making process for future decisions because it can be there are some of money placed on the budget is sufficient for a governance decision for the work for the repair or the build to heaven it 's to me that 's not good governance and so Sarah angling so I 'm certainly happy to support the son principle to get this dealt with today and I 'm just really going to ask Darren about say reporting to the social Community Development Committee because and just so councils know my understanding is we had agreed to have quarterly reporting back to the committee that was so good in fact staff like Darren can get on and do the work and get it progressed and I 'm just checking with Darren 's to Wednesday the next report to the committee and council might be approximately timely so historically for the last term of council we came through the cheat committee on a monthly basis on all of these projects little one-page oh here 's we were is what we 're doing so we Saturn there 's a lot of business to get through and talk to marry who choose that committee we come quarterly and we 're coming to see the committee on the 31st of May and the report is going up for authorization today so as we all of these projects bit of an updates and for information only how much is on the budget total total that the program be 55 I think it is off the top mid sorry I compared my five million dollars yeah I think so thing jealous yep okay um so I 've got Sarah Glenn Jonnie I mean I think that this is who 's discussing because it 's the process is used at a whole range different levels of different types of programs and completely understand there 's a very special building its heritage its high status needs to happen but where do we we need to have a discussion about where we draw the line so there 's other other projects that have been in the long-term plan that work head started on that we decided as a council to put off they pushed projects out that had already started on consultation of those kind of things there were programs of work so happen to be thinking about Scarborough playground consultation had started so so we 're we have to work out where in a program what sort of value what sort of status of work do we want oversight on and where are we happy to delegate all of that decision-making on what projects or priorities to staff and I think we need to have that discussion because that 's when I 'd like to see ball forward question really just over the timing and their committees structure I noticed that announcement was the months after the last election and we didn 't have our committees in place by then so you know I really appreciate all you were reporting Darren in the previous term it was monthly we had a consistent ongoing conversation over a whole range of heritage and other community facilities just wondering whether that lack of structure had a bearing on things or not at all I think my take was that there was a fair degree attacking along quite nicely the projects all spawn their own micro world of community consultation and engagement and what-have-you and that those issues would come up so we weren 't really bringing any significant issues back to that committee so we felt that quarterly would be a regular pace you 've had a had a lot of chief than the last six months towards summer as you know with opening a number of community centers and facilities and heritage buildings and mona vale so we 're back into more of a steady as you go so we think quarterly will just provide that degree of comfort that we 're on track we 're targeting having the entire program complete towards about Christmas next year that 's just better everything done yeah new build repairs etc etc thank you thank you so um one question that I 've put forward is how much of this budget is for there appear versus the sort of deferred maintenance that the CDHP may have not done so do we have any idea of that I 'm going to Ritchie will have the exact number order it 's probably 5% of it would be sort of what you call maintenance issues bearing in mind that this building has set what are we up to six years probably now so that says some temporary strengthening done doubly water ingress and all sorts of bits and pieces but I 'm happy to provide in writing what that exact split diesel and then the other question and I 'll get into the boat ship but I just want to check if if it 'll prove this today but then had a report come back at the next council meeting in two weeks with the kind of outline of here 's the scope of the repairs here 's the Co a lot of other things that the mayor was talking about before would that be okay is that something that we could possibly get so that we can actually make the conscious decision to sign off on agreeing to this work just so can you just repatched a question I 'd so like to a number of issues that the MIR raised around the context of this you know what the financial issues have been in the past what the options are in terms of repair methodologies time frames etc like you know when we got the son of the targa a building which was referred to we got a report that said you know here 's here 's to the percentage of code that we want to fix it to here 's how much it will cost here 's the kind of proposed methodology we haven 't had any of that for thus so I just wondered if you know if we agreed in principle today around the reinstatement and the plan budget but also got that report that actually signed off as a council to say we 're happy for this project to go ahead um and so cup just a couple of comments see it certainly can bring more information to edge so that no problem the I guess that was the transition because we were bringing projects on a project-by-project basis to this council and it was getting probably a little bit frustrating on both sides possibly and we agreed that we 'll move away of our what do we need to protects and how much do we need so I 'm not sure certainly with the with the Vanessa 's Chapel absolutely that information is at hand and I 'm sure we could have that information to you very quickly my slice of that pie is essentially the project management building side of it the legacy issues relating to land transfer and I mean Andrew owns assess it as the internal customer at the end of the day here it 's a council I see it but he 's our internal client so Andrew can talk to that stuff I can talk to the what are we doing how are we fixing it and what 's it costing so we absolutely could bring it information to your not problem at all to we in debate no no look I think that of it yeah I 'm Dion okay because the wish that I guess the question that that I 've got is that it 's I mean it 's kind of and related to what Yanni 's just said that there 's almost no to then expect that the council will make a decision I think that it 's probably better that we approve it on principle but then we ask for staff to prepare a report on on the capital programs as well I mean I don 't_''_1786.88 I don 't recall us being so explicit about the nature of the projects that went into programs I was shocked the other day to find out that there are 60 to 70 programs that was a surprise in terms of the number what what does your what does this program cover for some of these regal program is a singular program basically covers the so that 's the suburban facilities its community what I 'd loosely call community facilities so representing for the most part Miri 's assets for one of a better term so libraries pools libraries pools toilets [Applause] Andrew looks after the Hirogen s its libraries poles toilets sports fields pavilions the things where people congregate in the communities have fun activities with done wealth and poll we rebuilt the Norman Curt Paul we 've bought community centers and Heathcott and library sews covers quite literally hundreds of assets across the city but some of them do come to us or a variable not in recent times they did it early in the piece they were coming on our so we had to we used to have to work up quite a detailed case with a cost income and seek approval and it was happening on it was quite a bit of churn involved in that which is why we discussed the notion if you like a calling it a program we work through with community boards what are the priorities what we can only affect so much initially what will we fix lists were agreed and off we went so in how did heritage fit into that because all eq a year I 'm essentially imminent I 'm the council 's earthquake PMO so instead of Fletcher 's fixing houses I 'm fixing the citizens assets and Annette and it sort of inheritors are part of those assets whether they be the target a the mona vale Craig Croft community center etc etc it 's great work it 's rewarding to complete really it 's not the new projects don 't fit on those polka well we are building so we 're building new things to replace youthquake damage so someone 's getting rebuilt because we lost it entire race it we rebuilt the the Red Cliffs library because the other one was a complete write-off they 're not completely new things they 're all related to EQ work yeah nothing price related nothing so it 's just the EQ work year and I also run the housing program as well where we were focusing focusing on social housing as well so today they 're absolutely right to be crystal clear it 's the EQ related fix-it finder with it project [Music] okay yeah what 's what 's wrong with getting Yanni want to report but it which i think is a good idea I slightly disagree that that sends a signal that there 's no point in doing it because it sees that we 've probably got to prove it anyway yes it 's exactly the point we probably are that 's why we 've said in 1a hopefully so I think that 's really the question is do you or do not want to proceed with what we see that we 're doing what we were doing for me that answer is years if the answer is no for some people I think that it 's fine they can vote against it yeah but I think we need to make that call and yeah that 's true but if the second one is is to produce a report or we to coincide with the annual plan and it 's not that if they want to approve it then what 's the point of approving in principle you know because because it gives you what you wanted with the transparency and bringing up all of the issues that we discussed which I think completely valid and they probably have fallen by the wayside so we can create there we can get what those options are as long as the figures aren 't changing I 'm fine with that we 've said that we 'll do it I 'm happy to continue doing that but I think that I don well as long as the people that support the resolution today I committed to support a well I would probably say we couldn 't couldn 't do that no it 's highly unlikely that we wouldn 't it wouldn 't make a lot of scenes though we keep an open mind yeah so but you know that 's the note that we 've see the expectation that 's what a long term planet you know I understand it I understand it um yes we can change our mind but I think it would be unlikely and the question now is you know do you want to progress with it for me I think yes and I think we can have that report and I think that can highlight a lot of the issues that you 've raised which are valid and I think that if one a passed then I think that would be what our will be which then called for a report today I think would be unlikely that it wouldn 't be asked when it came to us first we staff to prepare a report and on pro-pro on digital on the facilities rebuild and program in terms of how it operates and the nature of the projects within the program and they were and maybe we were at financially if it 's yes yes and and also a specific report on on the nurses Chapel which includes the the history because I think that I think that there has been an unwillingness to commit some stuff to writing because the original decision was taken in px and I 'm as I say it was before I was mayor and I can see no reason now for that original decision to remain in px because the ordering Council has been passed and both that can debrief DHB end and the council have settled their insurance on a global basis so I think I don 't actually think there 's anything left that needs to be MPX so a report could actually cover off all of those issues as well yep and the nature of the projects rather than program nature of the projects within the penguin yeah and what with it within the program and with a that 's probably a good discipline anyway it would be really good because you 've got a number of other projects like walleston Red Cliffs that have had reports to Council and have had governance sign off on scope design and particularly for the nurses Memorial Chapel there is actually a formal Council resolution and formal council staff advised that a report would come back to us so I think that protects us from the audit audit offer if we do actually get that report back but all we 're talking about in terms of one is fixing the administrative era and the draft and your plan in terms of the timing and there 's a number of other projects that have actually been deferred or being brought forward around different years so actually that that number one is almost irrelevant if you 've got flexibility with a new program to move money from year to year to fix what you need to fix and that 's I think that that we do need to get answered under to it program is phased across enough of years so moving more as the report identified you know I understand that but also we 've told it as unders and overs and and some things are coming in under budget which we don 't have any idea what the rights impact of that is hmm so yeah so I would welcome these additional resolutions okay so would someone like to move this Erin seconded by Jamie any discussion I 'll put them out who would show us the under Synovus sort of balance yeah yeah if you yep yep it 's just accumulating a whole bunch of information I 've already got into a palatable report yep yep yep the only question is then just timing around that report do we do it to coincide with annual plan or is it even is that sort of implicit on that yeah there 's no point in yeah I mean that the bigger picture stuff around program I 'm their sister oh geez that can that 's their LT page so that 's that this report now you know for the annual clean all right just to be clear an expectation when there is I I guess well we please sign our honor yeah before we sign off certainly were to Bajor taken June early June early Ching bits doable those oh yeah but this is good because that 's all send a signal to people who have quietly waiting for a signal that we don 't need to worry about it in terms of the annual plan all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or those opposed say no it 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "and now I hear over the break that there 's this heaps of questions for the acting chief executive on a yeah so the liquid grilling began thank you I don 't know whether I will enthusiasts to be essay as the mayor please feel free to interrogate me but just what does that highlight a few things in the report and you 'll see from that front page that we 've had a lot of focus recently on muji emergency response in recovery so we 've had the tsunami report there were prepared nurse for the cyclone DB which impact as much as we thought thank goodness the fire response but also for all of those moving into reviews the review stage and the recovery phase so we have completed the tsunami review as we spoke earlier we 're starting our review on the fire but we also contributing to the National operational review by fire around that event you will get back next month the or later X years note early next month the recovery plan for the portal stop fire as well as that our tsunami review the firearm as well we also the other thing to highlight as in this report it mentions the awards that we gain through sorghum and I think that actually last time I was sitting in the this tier I mentioned those because they just come through so today I 'd actually also like to highlight another couple of wards that same our team received last night or yesterday so the consenting and group receives the commitment to customer service and excellence and also the insight innovator of the year and that was from the building officials Institute in New Zealand so fantastic work by they 're considering and as you all I see that we 've got the heads up so just I won 't just skip over there are the things in take take them as read and listen has got any questions yep it was an affirmative coin on that consents at the time we lost it and I think Jani will agree with me too very user-friendly cabinet ministers amongst many we 're Morris Williamson and Chris Tremain and they were great in Morris Williamson said we good to those were his words back then it 's good to see this now that we actually have done there yes I and also you 'll see from the report just not reliable data so still continuing to put new improvements in place I am see on page three this potential of the new programs and fast tracking Andrew thank you um under transport under city services delighted to see that the first of the cycle ways to be completed will be the Little River link is there any celebration planned to mark the opening of that cycle why it 's a huge achievement I mean all the work that the various teams have put into making those cycle ways happened to see the first one completed absolutely brilliant I 'm really keen to see some kind of a celebration to mark the opening link with Solana that this is the one that goes from Morehouse having you write the way out to Little River so we 've we have got our ten support people here if you do you have a vid planned and put this up at been starved for sharing us that they 've got things in place specially for the papua new parallel which is shortly after it 's about two weeks away ministers office master transcripts office to try to get a nice out so we work with it all right baby 's good and any other quit year Yanni the question that I had before run the whole way in which peacocks gallop those massive projects that are still happening post-earthquake how they reported back to the community board and to the public and I am concerned we were told that the community board I to think that there would be no consultation and no decision-making regarding that that they would just happen but if you think of record and Road that 's a pretty massive project there this to me a similar sort of project so it would be good to get some clarity around when things will come to us first sign off before they go out for consultation and before work starts so I did transfer that question down to the team when you asked earlier so you 're able that is done underneath the non screen program which is part of the cost share agreement and so the whole corridor has been out for consultation the issue that we 've got at the moment is the broken sewer line that serves all of Sumner we couldn 't get in there because it was sitting underneath feed containers and so we couldn 't do anything until the containers were lifted off and so as soon as they are we 've read under the design and we are going in to replace it now as part of that government non-school program as part of the cost year so that 's going in now and then on top of that will become the pavement there and we are working through the final details of that including the safety rail on it there are a few areas around and sent an email or my everything around multi-point where we 're going to change the traffic that peacocks gallop is going to be a replace life look-alike of the state however it 's going to be built and we will come back and consult the outside so the two will be linked we sent out a memo on mullet point for example because we 're going to change the traffic layout and that will have to be a decision of councils of weather that appear to shift bus stops look at no stopping lines etc etc I think help me here we gave a timetable of that hopefully the work will be done by Christmas that carrot that the corridor we have got an extension of the 83% subsidy we get from NZTA until until June 2018 so we 've got really a 14 month window to finish that week because it is real quick though so is there going to be like a report is it going to be public consultation on it did you keeps it dead is it going to be over basically no will happen we wouldn 't normally when we 're putting like there will be public consultation on our point because basically we are changing things when we come and do the Coastal pathway that final piece from basically request right through to the to the surf club be resource consents on that because it will somehow I 'm not sure it 's that big a detail either get piled into the coastal area or it may overhang the coastal area I look I don 't know that whole details so there will be quite extensive consultation on the finish of that product incorporating how all those components will go in a short term we are just replacing about 200 meters of pavement but we are putting that safety barrier in there as part of that and out of safety improvements I think probably because that 's not hard of replacement apparel because there wasn 't a proper safety barrier there private would it be possible just to get a mirror to start learning the broad timeline in terms of wing community board tool here and we will be consultation when reports will come to council I think that would be really useful because part of the problem by in this corridor we 've had feedback from people like they didn 't like the design of the fences but there was no project team that was making decisions people felt really alienated from actually the process and I 'd be really concerned if that was the same approach because I think it 's really important that the local community can feel that they can put their views forward and there 's a local democratic decision-making around them so I 've just got the nod that we will seemed out a timeline just giving dates if we know since of okay yes I was not been consulted on what has been consulted on and if people have conditions how they can express those may be really useful so thank you yep David look I just noted Leone has returned to the room and as chairman of the regulatory performance and committee I would really just like to acknowledge them acknowledge the great work that does continually come out of this unit and they are very motivated in terms of continuous improvement there is always something new on the boil in that department so things are evolving all the time and they are responding to the changes in our building climate we are shifting more to a commercial focus in off and the unit continues to adjust to the changes in in their workload and at the same time does put a lot of effort and to continuous improvement so well done very good um Sarah thank you so quick follow on from what Annie was talking about I think C is a that the community and some are really really looking forward to having that section of road done I mean it 's going to be very disruptive having it dug up and and lanes and then shut on and off but actually the anyone who 's driven out there knows that the surface is incredibly poor as it as round mold bone cave as well the communities getting really really pleased hip consultation on the changes around Melbourne cave because they 've been asking for a long time to be able to have pedestrian access Bank for safety of kids getting to school in that area so that 's going to be really really good really looking forward to that the coastal pathway especially the section from trend stop around onto actually some of the beach there is is dangerous that guardrails we 're going in as part of the roadworks but it should pathway itself and council has a previous resolution poorly worded and from about two years ago that does ask to prioritize police unique seas and areas that have been affected by the rock for remediation works and so really looking forward to getting that done in conjunction with the coastal pathway very good Pauline so a very quick question you may not be able to answer it doesn 't matter but the women stocktake so how do they do that do they do that from the buns that are out on the footpath in my question veneers what what about the buns that people have got like round the back is you any sort of an amnesty program or any encouragement for people just to run up and I know someone that 's got two they only put one out they don 't know what to do with the other one so what do people do about that what we do is we go in and information into a small area and exactly a then at the same time we are checking each one of those spoons and we are registering them with a doing over whatever the numbers call and so a record read number and so India tradition fear if films come out after that collection they become an unknown bin and we will in deal with that then as they come out we believe we 've probably found about 15,000 bins that are in wrong location lady came out of Webb 's own people that have got multiple bins and so we 're so it 's actually making a very good job my understanding they haven 't done my area but John dump standing this and it 's quite thorough and people so what you 're saying is once your area comes up then people get all the information they need about it that 's great for crew that goes in and identifies and it 's not done as part of the police unit to see yep I see oh thanks Dave um that clean Livingston I think you rubbish here just the bins in the bill what Pegasus area I 's a lot of burns so I 'd like to know what 's happened to those burns please and also why we can 't find a way of redistributing them where people reasonably need them in special cases I know we 've got kind of contractual arrangements which have to be strict and these questions over precedent-setting but I 've run into Cyril I can think of a man in the chair who would need he needs another yellow bin he 's the culture of prominent sports person for what that 's worth but he needs a special burn for his medical requirements but there 's no flexibility and it frustrates the daylights out of me and a lot of people is there a way we can actually tackle it we 'll give extra ribbons and potentially if he 's got medical waste that may need a red then it might be specialized maybe rubbish it shouldn 't go into opens anyway if it 's something but you can get bigger green boots and you can get bigger yellow bands immediately you pay for them and we are working at people have a really nice guide and they want a big bigger bin and they have to pay for it well maybe that 's the wrong incentive and the amount so we are looking at ways where we structure the funding of additional capacity apparently you can only get at this point one yellow bin per household and some people for whatever reason want more than one Gallivan and so we are looking at that with waste management about how we structure the funding of those extra resources because the more you can get into the recycling bin all the composting bin the less we get in our red bin which is our objective is it all right so um Oh people gotta move in a second oh oh not yet move by Pauline seconded by Mike I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they note that 's carried _"

    "text": "I feel free to grill me Yanni you wanted to make some comments about the Heritage event that you attended on our behalf what are your next three days it is the Me 's report but the mere can 't go to everything and sometimes I get counselors to go to connects that I can 't go to and actually Yannick volunteered before I even knew it was all oh okay well I was hoping to have some photos for you but haven 't_''_34.14 been able to do it due to a few issues so I 'll send those around but there 's just a few things to say and that is that it 's going really really well so this is the future of heritage workshops that we 've had as an organization as a council and leading to the development of hopefully heritage strategy so this survey there 's a survey that closes on May 22nd we 've had 75 people participate that 's on the heavy or say website strongly encouraged those counselors and board members to send that round or your contacts and encourage people to on the 26th of April in North Beach and we had written ice and MP there along with 26 other arts 33 other people and that was really nice to meet in that North Beach the War Memorial Hall one thing that did come out of that is that would be really great to put Wi-Fi into our community facilities so that when we have those sorts of workshops and functions it 's great for people to be able to be connected the second workshop was held in the function room at Council 6th of May and that included Niki Wagner MP and 43 people so that was really good she 's also the minister of the nearly appointed Minister earthquake recovery so that 's that 's even better that she took the time out of her busy schedule to be droppin are we 've had three drop-in sessions or two so far but the last one is on this Saturday 6200 straight from 00 to 00 didn 't to 12 and that take grab college and there are other two job incisions the one in town wasn 't so Gaiety was and there was about 28 people there talking money about a Corral and the peninsula heritage there 's other consultation plan which is a run internal staff workshop throughout the different units of council including libraries to really get get some some views internally there 's a visit to a number of schools there 's been a presentation to a post-graduate environmental science class and is also the formation of a partnership with no Tahu and the local Runa and works going on in that um the next steps are really two for the information to be collated and reviewed the identification of key themes and recommendations and then in june meetings with the Runanga representatives 5th of july in informal briefing to the SCD committee of council the social and Community Development Committee 7th of July meeting with community board chairs so I just wanted to acknowledge the awesome effort of staff in organizing those forums I think one of the key things that has come out of the people that are participating is that although they felt that you know it 's it 's been really actually been able to come together and I also wanted to acknowledge um councilor and Galloway for attending the workshops as well because people really like the idea that we were having a two-way engagement listening and talking and understanding what what people 's views were and I think that 's a really good model as we talk about moving forward for the LTP of having a more regular engagement with key sectors to get those ideas in those contributions so I think staff have done an amazing job on getting those things organized they saw a little work to be done it 's a great step I think to the city coming up with a really coherent and clear vision and strategy for what we do with heritage going forward so thank you to everyone that 's been involved thank you for the opportunity just to say a few words as part of your report because it 's quite a diverse sort of month isn 't it so there 's everything from the Ministry of Austin 's birthday through to Anzac Day to handing over villages to saying goodbye goodbye to teary I was just wondering what were the highlights of the it I 'm really grateful when counselors can do things for me and I just kind of want to acknowledge eonni he really took that one up as on his own volition but then reported through the mayor 's report and I really appreciate that and I want to encourage others to do that to fill clear water represented me at the opening of The Salvation Army Citadel well it 's not a Citadel anymore but or as a city core city core and I mean it 's a tremendous facility and obviously the Salvation Army have played a significant role in our city so I was you know said that I couldn 't attend but I can 't attend everything I really liked our Delmon architects of space said Richard dolmens a local architect and I went to primary school with them and I said that you know if you can 't ask somebody you went to primary school with who turned out to be the mayor to come and open your building then there 's that I loved the pilot Pacifica Youth Parliament they that there are there are some extraordinary young leaders in the city and I feel very confident about the future of our city when I go to an event like that and see just saw and some of her is it no better say have you birthday on facebook yes it just just was yeah extraordinary but look I 'm really pleased that I 've made contact with the new Minister of Local Government the Honourable and Tolly actually knows a lot about how our city operates and I 've reinforced that message that we are up for trialing new ways of doing things here that 's part of you know who we are and on a post-disaster environment there 's just opportunities to do things differently so I 've reinforced that message talk to hear about the inappropriate division of functions on public transport but we won 't go there and I 've also actually met more than once with the Honorable nikki Wagner and we are establishing our joint meetings on a very regular basis and and I 'm on that that community engagement approach that regenerate Christchurch is locking into place in the city so that 's great and oh gosh there 's so many hearts Ministry of Awesome I have to reflect on that so that a very small get-together really just to acknowledge we they 've come in five years I can 't imagine the city not hitting them you know now and yet they didn 't exist five years ago so it 's they 've done an extraordinary job in terms of that emergent leadership that seizes the opportunities and they they really have helped the city I think not only recover but also springboard and and look at new ways of doing things as well so anyway that was just a quick snapshot thank you for the question okay so would someone like to move you 'd like to move it revenue by lighting comments you you want I mean in response to assumption Linda is efficient I also was in there you know it is not only the assumption in the the kind of photos is efficient nature is the very early in China in the New Zealand for popular 50 years so the Riviera 's can excellent the vehicle yeah yeah yeah but a mobile neighbor one we still have education we all Federal Council not yet to have look I encourage you to do a book that 's well yes still the dealer was why stairs stairs yeah when we first went to China to set up the sister city really was there so we got the pleasure of meeting them so we actually asked him what he missed most from New Zealand and he said boysenberry ice cream so the task was happy obtain it is very ice cream across to China without it melting but we did it your photo is in China and your smile hasn 't changed right so you 'd like to move the report seconded by Andrew thinking I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a post they know that 's carried _"

    "text": "welcome thank you very much Mehta mirin capsule is that I haven 't got the PowerPoint for you unfortunate we haven 't caught up with that level of technology yet here we must be here and there in our report we 've got the the trees issues we got in sort of nuts and bolts thing whatever like to see so I think in some of the other community boards would back me up on this it would be really really good if we could regress the trees in public places working policy so it helps us when these some requests come to come to the community boards that were all singing from the same hymn sheet the moving on the the two parties the record and racecourse liquor bean and M the attributes of the whole whole form the whole library so and we 're very very supportive of both of those and just like to acknowledge them the staff that from this organization that were involved in the Port Hills for us and and appreciate the fact that the fires are out but there 's still a lot going to be an ongoing issue both positive and negative I think for for our communities in the coming months the and we 're really pleased that the that the liquor license application got turned down for 76 Rickett and Road and appreciated the fact that our community board did ask for the opportunity to present to the to the liquor licensing authority and we were we were granted that that opportunity even though we weren 't submitters so that was there was very helpful and really the next exciting thing if we turn over is the community board significant matters of interest and err dear old caterpillar bulldoze of its in Harrington Park has been graciously restored by members of the local community actually seen blasted it and repainted it and and fixed it up so that was something that I was really concerned about it has happened to start you through Christchurch 's a tractor or this sort of equipment is taken away from a park and then the community are told over just taken it away to restore it and bring it back and they don 't some significant and monument and Ricca Dhin is some staying there so just like to go say that that work was done by volunteers from the community in the movie for years the Wayne Francis Charitable Trusts done a documentary called our story and it 's about the positive developments undertaken and the Rickett and West community through the work done by the Oak Development Trust in the Rickett neighbourhood policing team and that is an excellent excellent video and we 'll get we 'll get the link to that sent around so that you can share that with as many people as you like it 's a really really really good story so it certainly changed significantly a major area of record and in a fairly short time and that community is now strong enough and so supportive of enough of each other to keep that momentum going into the future so it 's a really really good documentary and I would highly recommend it that 's done our report is there any questions of myself or my dear friend mr. Watson move moved by Jimmy chin seconded by did you have a quick sorry wait I see that the board 's obviously going to be using twenty thousand dollars of their funding and there 's going to be a rental on that is there any way that that rental can actually be returned back to the boards for you some further community projects um oh is that a question of other things that mm also board has passed I 've worked with their project to see whether we can reduce that number by working with the community correct to do some of the piece in the near johnny is in line with councilor strategic directions so we 'll be doing that so there may not be too much about capital vouchers of these xfinity but also games for where the regular go through today very good all right well I 'll put the motion on the report all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried move on to the record on race course and you 'll note that the times have changed so that it 's 00 a.m. to 00 midnight so it yet so would you like to move that Jimmy seconded by David I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then we move on to interim use of three eight one horse will Road so are we going to head in there not only to reduce the amount but will Kemp can force staff to work with the community board to see if the rental itself can be returned to the community board yep okay and well just a request staff to explore options around reimbursing the community board yeah it in relation to the rental received something like there yeah they 're kind of fee because six months along the five 5,000 5,000 or six months in reimbursing the discretionary response funders that called okay reimbursing the community boards discretionary response about there 's some I don 't really know them but is a Presbyterian Church involve soldiers yeah I know if it god it 's a longbow you get it cut because my grandparents were it okay no no all right yeah can you just say that is executed no they do yeah all right sorry um bit sir so so he didn 't participate in there and everything so I will know we need a mover and a seconder be good idea Jimmy chin singing bye buddy back I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much why cause it 's unhorse wall consumer work has been all the way you know it 's been her life 's work that 's completely unfair Dean that 's right okay carry on thank you now we move to the mayor 's monthly report _"

    "text": "tsunami alert review I 've just suggested some changes to the wording because of course stuff we haven 't actually we actually haven 't formally adopted the or received the tsunami alert review as a council so it 's got to come back to council so the proposal was that the resolution read and I 'm happy to move that staff note that staff are developing advice on the tsunami alert review request staff to prepare and report back on this are merely review in an implementation plan based on the tsunami alert review deputy need to prepare and request staff to consider know who it 's included under options no request staff to consider resourcing options for resilience plans and community lead preparedness plans which may be one on the same so resourcing options to assist communities to lead the development of resilience and preparedness plans good I mean there may well be one on the same that 's why so end or Brazil end or for the communities to lead the development of resilience and then just do a slash preparedness because I mean though to me they right cool this that 's something that 's the reason that and I 'll just explain why I 've played around with the wording the reason is is that there are some recommendations that have that are in the review I mean the reviewers excellent the recommendations are excellent but I think there will be other recommendations that were want to consider as a result of some of the advice that 's in the review for example the MEK dem advice on tsunami sirens requires some very specific work to be done and in terms of the future so I 'm I would like to move that and Yanni you have you to second it yes right all right clear um just and I 'll just include this in my speaking to it I strongly support us receiving this formally and I just wonder whether we should put a date on that we 've seen in our area that we 've got a number of groups coming to the local board for funding but it 's not just to prepare the plans it 's also for the equipment like you the the other things that people want in a emergency prepared kit so I just wondered whether there 's it 's not just the funding and resourcing for the development of the plans it 's actually also the resourcing of the equipment that people feel that they should have in place so I just wanted a three could be could include that or if it already does but yeah so I just think it 's good practice when we get a review like that that was undertaken that we do get a formal report back with here 's what we do to respond and you yet which is great from I 'm very supportive of doing that and I think it 's really important that we we get that with the chance to consider just going to change number two to request after repair and prepare in report be prepare in report this one makes sense request staff to report there to report back on tsunami alert review by the end of June and provide advice it 's a little wand and um it 'll be on yeah and provide plan for those recommendations because um because what we want to do is is make sure that we 've that we as governance are signing off on the recommendations and the implementation plan so that the implementation plan may need to some adjustment depending on how we respond to the recommendations yeah well yeah I mean yeah I 'd rather leave it just general but I 'm kind of noting noting that there may be cost implications to the resilience and preparedness plans but that comes next to need so that would be me did about my journey implementation so she 's to lead well but that 's what they 're coming for all right so can we just leave it like that yeah I 've just got a question about the timing of it and preps Mira can answer this because I understand that II can and clearly this will be joined up with the other pieces of work they 're being done but one that he can have asked for from me were is a whole tsunami risk report and I understand that isn 't due to about well it 's really just to check with Mira defect yes then it 'd be some work potential flowing out of this debt and the tea will start on already around the tsunamis out you know zones where welfare center should be located and transport or evacuation plans so they there will be some work undertaken in advance that some it won 't be LT finalized to other partners I don 't have social work so will I do to find it under play in the timeline of things yeah thank you yep Aaron yeah Mary will that claim also indicate the routes the evacuation routes because we don 't currently have signage that most cities and townships overseas do they 're like a large blue tsunami accept resumes I don 't wellington does because they went through a very detailed community I mean I just see like that all the west coast of the US and so the plan will identify when and how that will be done so the plan won 't here we won 't be ready by the end of June to have all those things beginning on this and we anticipate that it will be completed by each state what so work has has started on evacuation plans and routes but there are other agencies that have to be part of it at least we 've got the maps online now right so I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "say banks peninsula Community Board Christine get ready so here we go our morning or even ourselves all Benoist and we 've got a few clips to go through so that we might just run those through and it 's very slow no not quite we were going to say this to last but I think we 'll do it first because I got ahead of us this morning and like everyone else it said a ship I should have one too so these would come out of there and a little chap Business Association and know very little trim for such a long time obviously it was about a blue ships coming Beach a little chat and and so really I 'd like to take this opportunity I 'm half of the Bates financial community and love channel particular to say thank you to all those that were involved in the ships coming be because it 's a huge thing to the peninsula I think you and so out of date we 've had a discussion at community board on Monday aid we 're looking at the possibility of when the ships 14 and see how we can encounter per hour and just see here we can make it work for both harbors what the pro shops so we really feel like 2018 is going to be a year and also just moving on because we also hit a briefing from the crew they 're working on stubborn arrives so with it being reinstated that 's such a big Leto and to the community and avoidable and has brought a lot of comfort to the origin community because our yeah really the channels the only way at Michigan or in the bags so it does mean a lot also just going to be to the harbor we have lots of interesting exciting things happening down near thee is the development of the Tiana marina and also navel point so there are really big projects that are really going to enhance that habit and obviously I think that 's really just going to be good for the economy of little children in Christchurch what 's navel point there 's lots of meetings going on with all the case stakeholders standing plane as I think I 've mentioned it before it 's such a huge project and it 's like trying to fudge the sweep here into a round hole because there 's so many needs and it 's such a well linked in all the Navy and you sort of just don 't week at the moment so that 's just working through all those I chose just I 'll make toe the community would place to get the QRA and I know it 's a while ago but it 's also bought a little comfort to know exactly watch as you know the state of play down the sou that 's been good the ste anna marina as as I understand the only walking floating marina that is going to be at the South Island what she 'll be at the UM but anyway we 're looking forward to Athena 's very exciting with all the other changes I had need out and the port and I think that 's a really good time to actually meet Shirley our master plan but was put together in 2012 because a and I think it 's without mentioning the son said he keepin in the last five years so it 's really working well with the timing of the cruise ships coming back the reinstatement of stabbing the road all the development on the porch so on the town side of things we 're excited about the museum project and also all the council facilities that have been reinstated we 're really thrilled with the library in the silver center that in our joint facility in also a new board room which is lovely and we have a wonderful view of that we 're very spoiled and also our recreation facility we 're all excuse me we 're all where government 's taking their offices and then is a real bonus we do here so that 's all yeah so that 's square which is called lbs we are right in front of you boardrooms so it 's just really what I 'm called in dr. it really his helps you so the numbers change the farmers market on a CJ a big cavity on a Saturday Ange I mean it yes we won 't hear you might fell on it too much you 'll change it I absolutely love this club and for those of us that love and muddle Chamonix what we 're going to say when the cruise ships are baked so it 's just wonderful for those who um dream of a outgoing way on cruise ships or can afford it and for the even certain looking at the wooden eye as opposed to what siding like and range so that 's wonderful and [Music] so and I know you highlighted more about and the little genocide of the peninsula and today if it 's a wee bit different to our report that came out but I really think that those things don 't need to be highlighted and here was it wonderful announcement end and we were very privileged to be the M in Duluth it was great occasion and mr. crews she actually finish on me and because lookaside has been such a big thing and for the community will bring thousands of tourists into little turn on a regular basis once it 's completed see it well the day that it was announced lean org of quite a lot of relief to the community over there and it may have been wonderful accommodating the cruise ships but we believe that a Corral we have to market itself as like a boutique cruise ships in accommodate those more appropriate to its size in addition daily trips from cruise when the cruise ships that come to Littleton can go across to a Corolla side other sorts of things that we 're looking at at the moment and then and 2014 Croatian queen bee tourism estimated that returning CRO shops to Louisville turn would in the entire 13 extra 300 million over ten years and influx of tourism to our city will help an EVs speak diversities economy so I 'm just enclosure that 's what 's it mean on the financial our end and I had to say we 're all just got lots of positive exciting things happening and so we 're really pleased that we were at mock society they believed to see as an item is going to be a good year for it briefly and thank you very much indeed Christine for the report and great that you focused on the the Cruz birth announcement this morning that is a huge announcement for Littleton for the peninsula for Christchurch and in fact for the region quite possibly for the country is a major piece of infrastructure we 're talking about there and you 're absolutely right that some announcements brings about some considerations for Littleton in terms of the way that the Littleton community can really make the most of particularly the economic development opportunities that that crews worth and development presents and we 're fortunate to have a couple of years of lead time before those changes actually happen before the 2019 cruise season and it 's great that the community board passed a resolution at its meeting on Monday to look at ways of working with representatives of the Littleton community the business community in particular to make the most of those opportunities I actually met with the Business Association at their meeting the other night and they were very excited about that so that 's a big step forward that in a Corolla there have been different views expressed around the cruise ships certainly there are some in a Corolla that are very pleased about the Littleton cruise birth announcement because it relieves the pressure on a corolla in particular the pressure on infrastructure at the same time in a corolla i think we need to be sensitive to the fact that there are some particularly in the business community that are feeling a sense of future loss that some of those cruise ships won 't be visiting there by the same token it 's great that the community board are going to be working with the a corolla community business community in particular to look at ways that they can make the most of the changed environment from 2019 onwards and in that regard I met with the chair of the akoroa district promotions essentially the a Corolla Business Association to start to talk about those opportunities yesterday as well so I think you 're absolutely right in identifying opportunity all around this is a big announcement for for littleton for the peninsula and with far wider economic so now thanks very much indeed for highlighting that any presentation today okay oh that was already thinking good yeah okay um Pauline beasts turn on the new bus stop of Norwich kin-kee and people are having difficulty crossing the road there are you progressed in it thank you you 've called for a report or something so the bus stops painting and started down and it 's been moved so we 're just waiting

Albans school which was at that stage situated in a poor working-class part of Christchurch with her husband 's help ada put on concerts in aid of the school prize fund in 1892 ADA pregnant sought two months leave of absence the North Canterbury Education Board was inclined to grant this however it was opposed by the headmaster James spacian of course we 've got a he wrote a long letter on the delinquencies of mrs. wells so rather than being a granted a leave of absence which as I said was two months around her pregnancy and birth of her child she was fired so times have changed we still have a way to go we still have a way to go I might add yes so I just thought I 'd add that so there 's a link there with our Ward today all right we 're just going to let the pictures run through and the edible garden awards are referred to in our report there were a number of roading decisions and I won 't go through those individually and that did raise though however the issue of how pedestrian islands or slowing traffic calming traffic seems to be able to happen reasonably quickly in some parts of Christchurch and in our Ward grampians Street being one example and yet when it relates to schools or areas around children it appears that there is no budget move on move on and we 've asked for more information on that Community Grants opened noted that the application period is four weeks and not six weeks as it usually is but that 's because it 's been through a review period and they normally open in February severe opening much later as well now there is a part a in our report which I will come to and perhaps give you some more detail if you want it in a moment the work on the sticks and the Kappa Tony 's stream continues as well this dedicated staff on that important part of our ward and there is a survey undergoing at the moment the work will commence rather on the 10th of April and will be completed by the 30th of April the Sun ovens community center continues and and building hopefully will start at the beginning of August there is a time capsule that was dug up or discovered once the old or when the old community center fell down that will be opened as per the very specific process that is outlined and the council 's policies and procedures at this stage we 're looking at putting a new time capsule in a kind of competition about what they would like to see in that capsule and why there will be some guidelines obviously because a capsule isn 't that big and we want to include things like there cycleways which are key in our area at the moment as well the garden awards which are just flicking through at the moment they took place on the 6th of April at the horticultural society and record and ethnics to the Hadley oval area that was the last time actually I think that anything is going to be held in that building we had 60 people attend it was a great result this year with 48 entries in the awards and that is up from 35 so it was a considerable number and I think as people get back into their homes and re-establish their gardens that was a real reason for that and it was really awesome to see the local community groups getting involved and and some new faces which is important too as far as the cycleways go that has been and continues to be a major issue in you 'll be aware of that we did last year and again five weeks ago for information on these as we move to the commissioning of them on the 19th of May we still haven 't received any information and without date getting closer of course we being asked questions by our constituents and we would very much like to be able to give them some answers so we look forward to a briefing and better understanding the public education plans around promoting the cycleways explaining where rubbish bins will go how bikes will use them and how cars will park around them so we do hope that that comes soon because it 's only you know what 's the date now eight days away so the pate in the in the schedule today and the mixing agenda today are there any questions around that because we 've got some it 's clearly in your agenda so that 's the report actually but I 'll ask any questions around that if you want one time yep I 'm Erin yeah it 's a it looks good and more make the page 57 the MEC didn 't show all of the signalized crossings on that stretch of road was the only point I wanted to raise I thought that was the one at Halloway labs not marked and of course the one that 's just being installed now that grass me is not on there as well I just thought okay we we can note that and that was part of us that know the area well what 's we it 's irrelevant that for the others that might not pass pretty sure we 'll may be lucky enough to go to pepper knowing regularly maybe staff can note that and stuff that we provide in the future that perhaps that should be there but definitely the board was well oh well across it yeah yep there any other questions on the part a on the report can I just add that the staff and the mall owners worked exhausts staff worked extremely hard with the mall owners and getting to a an area a place of of conciliation agreement yeah yeah good agreement might have been it but yeah it yeah we got there in the end and I think that that 's something all credit to them not just that the victory established a really good working relationship now to move forward with so that 's been a really good outcome the same with in 5.1 with the sticks kappa tahi our work that the board has been doing with the community out there set up a community working group with some board members on it and out of that has resulted some some with some extra work being done from the land drainage team so that 's been quite productive that is a long haul that one out in the sticks but we are getting there and I think the community is starting to see a response from council with the query so that 's another good example of a community working relationship with the board that 's been improved as well because I understand has now been some specific resource applied to that as far as staff goes and I think that we have to keep that in mind as well we keep asking our staff to our ward as well and yet you know you need people to do that and time to do that and I think we have to keep that in mind as we keep asking our stuff to do things mm-hmm thank you and so Mike you 'd like to move there the report and seconded by Pauline so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed then no that 's carried _"

    "text": "the Linwood Eastgate public transport hub upgrade options now that this is the one that you wanted to actually have a question on the main report um we you can raise then at the commercial ward yeah well no it was raised so sorry I thought you said that the reports not of the board but of staff on the reports oh I can 't what up okay what I 've got I 've gone over that one it 's a very quick question it 's okay just to raise it already um otherwise it can raise it in the chief executives report but it is just on seven I 'll just make sure people aware about it 's on page nine and seven point two peacocks gullet Road reconstruction and waste water in your it 's quite a massive project and my understanding is there will be no formal report to the board before it commences so I 'm happy to raise that in the seas report just around how what the process is for significant projects coming for sign off before it goes out for consultation or even be consultation on that one so who 's doing that is that a skirt project or is that a good suggestion ah so it 'll be council okay Mitch team okay so we can get back about the process in yeah that would be great thanks Alko thank you alright so next we 've got the Linwood east gate public transport have upgrade options so his has anyone got any questions on this one Danny just um appreciate that it 's a little bit wider than just the public passenger transport option but it does seem to me that it 's hard to evaluate where that option is best without a plan for this whole area in terms of the intersection we 've currently got the cycle we 're going through well close to here we 've got the school that I think has made repeated requests Lim would have school for safety improvements we 've got them all wanting to expand and we 've got the issue of the public passenger transport so I was just really wanting to know if staff felt that we were able to do slightly wider area to sort of help bring everything together because it yeah at the moment we 've got money being spent without any sort of plan for the area there 's already works going on on the signals on this intersection hmm yeah I would hope we would do that I mean it wouldn 't be sitting there in isolation because particularly with options 1 2 it involves putting in a new pedestrian crossing and you can 't_''_172.52 do that in isolation of of the network around it and and we with the other options if er if they came if they were deemed to be suitable again there would be what sort of widespread changes to the network to try and get you know circulate the buses safely as possible round the from Buckley 's Road and then back to to Buckley 's Road so we couldn 't just do it in isolation right so would it be I mean it 's probably a bit early to say what the nature how it would actually come to pass I mean it you know it but we couldn 't 's the main point ISM it doesn 't just sit there and own on its own except like the cycleway project is going to make changes to that currently Street intersection except that the traffic signals project that 's already been started as making changes to all just putting the signals back as they were so there are kind of projects happening without any plan so I mean that 's why I thought it would be really good to just maybe have an additional resolution that go staff the mandate to start doing that work around the holistic plan for this area yeah because those projects are happening now that 's not very small it makes perfect sense cool maybe it 's Phillips if we wouldn 't look at an eye isolation and we won 't because as you know the intersection is a key intersection in the city you 're very busy it 's also a high safety risk as well yeah so we 're looking at trying to improve safety on that intersection it said that no we 're happy with their resolution to look at so what plan for those yep that 's absolutely fine okay so number two request staff to develop an integrated transport and traffic traffic plan public transport is that Warren well it 's inclusive I mean I want it to be as nice a train to an integrated transport plan will need traffic requests staff to develop an integrated transport plans for for the immediate area the immediate area yeah yeah to considerably conceal the other works that are occurring yeah so to consider what doesn 't working like the cycleway yeah but or to consider all of the work that our carrier so an integrated transport plan for the immediate area I don 't know that to consider the works that are occurring is not necessary yeah you 're taking into consideration all of the works that are occurring in the area there I mean it 's to join up the works that are proposed not just the works that are occurring because thank you just follow the works that are occurring you may get a really poor outcome because you 've got five different projects all of the works that and our proposed yep all right yeah I think that 's good yeah okay um Aaron you are next and then Phil thank you just some questions around the bottom of page 15 in the that there was no consensus except that the VPT passenger facilities needed improvement and I just reluctant to be spending millions of dollars on another facility that might get trashed when I say might as most of them around the city seem to the new bus exchange is a fantastic example of a great design which doesn 't have the issues and your social problems yet we 're still creating or spending millions of dollars in the suburbs on facilities that do get trashed and some of the buses as well eaching tagging in anti-social behavior what works being done to curb that into a trap I 'm sorry look I 'm just going to intervene and say that that 's not an order for this particular consideration we 're considerating consider a considering evaluating the preferred option which at this stage is not a bus interchange at them all but it 's still a they 'd okay for those to be trashed on it this is for consideration and the long-term plan they are they are they 're going to evaluate an option and bring it back so if you want to add into the resolution that is part of the evaluation well that there actually is the Buckley 's Road facilities upgrade that they 're evaluating yeah they 're not evaluating an interchange no you know if you can lay your fears that we know internal building it will be an upgrade of the on street facilities most of the cost is actually the pedestrian crossing T of people safely from the from a new on street facilities to the mall entrance so mostly that 's the bulk of and we would we would involve the community support team to review any proposal for the crime prevention through Environmental Design principles to try and minimize or eliminate crime hotspots so dart spots that sort of thing to try and you know to try and address those issues before they actually occur okay yeah but any facility we spend money on we should be going to consider the actual report as part of the LTP not now Phil and then David so will it be further work done on the other options too because you 'll refer to the on Street facility at batteries Road three option three here in the mall car park area we we understand from the report that in fact there 's a future more building to be as proposed in the ax to so the question really is art while we would like this information by the time the LTV are we actually going to be able to have some sort of I guess some evidence that in fact that an option like that would be in the max a still particularly so that that people might use that as a central place for a form of a bus exchange but the you know what one of the options anyway sort of wondering the answer 's no we have looked at all the options and taking into account environment can 't agree and getting through the intersection and getting buses in and out of there more car park it pedestrians and vehicles so yeah yeah yeah I mean it would you know it would indent there would be a lot more bus movement through a car park with which has you know paid pedestrians crossings cars coming in and outs of car parks so park and also it 's just been much more costly because you would because of the as Richard said we would have to develop options to address the intersection zone cranly Chelsea probably the car park itself so okay teenagers keke that clarifies what the options are going to be yep David I 'm interested to know whether the option and part to view will actually look further issues that Phil 's just raised in fact if it concerns me that you know we have a lot of these bus stops and particularly well just about all of them that are associated with the mall there 's problems even the more operators resistant to the preferred location of a bus stop and secondly sometimes that 's the kpi 's that he can put on the the transport whether it 's erm it just adds a and there resistor from that point of view but in this particular instance you know here this bus stop on Buckley 's Road its primary function does serve that more it 's a quote you 're actually sending people across one of the busiest streets in the city and yet you know we just heard a minute ago there you know there 's issues with firm buses and the car park and pedestrians be a lot slower so I just get concerned when we 're doing these evaluations that we we 're not actually concerned with the primary index of safety of people we 're quite happy to send them across Buckley 's Road we 're quite happy to you know have it in the middle of Reckitt on all of these issues and I actually think that the passenger safety seems to be pushed right down the bottom of the list and followed very closely by ich and some notion of wanting to minimize the amount of time the buses travel so I really want to see this this whole question that we 've raised and point to to area and putting people people first and looking at what is the best okay as fair enough until the mall closes and when the mall is closed behind them all would be the most dangerous place to put people true but still no still no still no safer on Buckley 's Road either oh yes they are safer on that please right the point is that they are safer on Buckley 's road because people driving by can see them where they can 't see them would be tapped and behind well it was exceedingly well lit and I will order a bus exchange tap done behind a mall that you cannot see em I would not do that no I 'm afraid our district planning really has been fed and allowing some of these more so developing it might have been the case if it could have been located next to the 7 McDonald 's but it 's not possible to do that so I mean effect we 're possible then you 'd actually have a sea solve thumb of safety but there is no safety about having people here at best and the worst of it and I don 't know that we 've done that you yeah Sarah and then thank you I mean I 'm happy to move this the board has had some really really thorough discussions on this weave workshop that we 've looked and with questions staff and and I think that this is the what this is this is the way to go and while there might be issues crossing back these roads you know there 's a proposal to put a note signalized crossing and it will make things safer and it is a direct route at has oversight it might be that what happens is that we need a little bit more land or that as the pot is the bus user population grows we might need to talk to them all and have some space on there each of them or because it 's still right next to them all it 's just on the road side rather than in the car park so I 'd like to see us get moving on this also really pleased today I but there 's been a lot of work done in that space those have have not quite fully resolved but they have improved a lot with the added focus and attention that 's come on this space here and I 'd like to think that they would keep improving as we invest in the community it is second only um you 'll see from the minutes that I didn 't support option one and that was because those other options get ruled out and if you think about the point that David 's making he 's absolutely right but you know our district plan he can actually gave a support to the non notified consent when they were asked if they were okay with the design being able to exclude buses from going through the mall I mean it 's just crazy like basically when you look at malls redeveloping and you think about the future I think of public passenger transport which isn 't going to be about big long buses with drivers that 's going to be smaller vehicles and possibly autonomous then I don 't think there an integrated solution to this and the good news is we actually own the land some other land whether McDonald 's us we 've actually got it as Rovers they 're leasing it off us so you could actually do a really lovely integrated development with the library the mall and the road and actually get a really nice place where buses can pull on and as David said the biggest problem is that he can are so resistant to changing the bus routes to let the buses deviate from the main roads to pull on and get it right what I personally think is a better safer option for people so I mean I think it is really good to do an integrated transport plan the other issue that we also need to be mindful of as cyclists but this is going to be a major intersection for cyclists and we 've certainly had some feedback from people that that there is you know need to have better cycling facilities when people you know lock up the bikes shower etc so we know that more was actually through their hugely significant lower number of cycle parking than what they should have had and by a district plan so you know I just think the opportunity to do an integrated traffic assessment for this area and come up with a chance for plan for the future is really important and you know I won 't support number one because again I do think that that is the wrong approach I think there 's other solutions and I think number two is actually the critical thing before we spend huge amounts of money on fixed intersection designs we actually come up with a plan so yeah I would urge you to support to and I 'm not happy to rule out those other options and option one until tour has been complete because I think it should inform not not respond to the works that have already proposed okay well I 'm just going to say that I don 't know why the council rejected the idea of referring this issue for advice to the Joint Committee for public transport and I 'm certainly as a member of that committee going around the malls and I would like the advice that you 've just referred to yani to take with me because if they are precluding that I 'm going to understand because it 's the time of the treble that is the reason that they don 't want to take them off road but actually overseas that 's exactly as you say but the moves they 're open they 're connected to train stations that are open 24 hours a day so they 're slightly safer than environments that there are not and but but an extra feed our buses stop at about 11 o 'clock anyway so just providing for that safety at nighttime after the malls of clothes that that seems to me to be part of it but I would really like the Transport Committee the Joint Committee to be looking at these issues because I don 't think they realize the challenges that we 're confronted with when we 're faced with these decisions anyway I 'll put that motion so and I presume you want to vote against one and you want to vote against 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no that 's carried and just yani against one _"

    "text": "so I 'm very aware that people need to get away from Christchurch in order to get up to meet them for the community boards conference so I 'd like to call a limit central Heathcott Community Board and Sally buckles not here so we have Tim instead hit I so if have you not been advised the agenda order Chris no oh well I 'll tell you it 's um Linwood central head coach first pop annoy and a second thanks Peninsula third costal Burwood fourth Pendleton why my first horse for Hornby record on next and then the final one sprayed in Kashmir right turn welcome thank you good morning everyone I 'm occupying the heavy position of deputy deputy chair the Linwood central health community board had a very busy month in in April and lots of things happened we had a lot of deputations and some of those are listed up there and there are also in the report we also had many matters to consider some of which were pretty straightforward there 's a list of there I guess one of the ones in there the amount of parking directly outside Christchurch Hospital sales time could go up and the board was a little bit unhappy for there and asked for some more information I want to move quickly though to the meat of the report which is recommendations to Council and significant projects the one of these recommendations did exercise a lot of our time and that was the Linwood escape upgrade options we could not come to a decision directly on the information we had provided so our request to Council is to ask staff to give more information on the preferred option to assist with the decision the next item on that on the recommendations the surrender of the shoe antennas cover lease and a variation to Richmond Cricket Club is pretty straightforward it 's a swap of use of land which is agreed to by both parties so we recommend that and we also discussed that tsunami alert review and we 're very keen that council progresses that review and also gives advice on how communities organizations that approached us looking to do community preparedness can be funded we 've had we 've given some support we would like to know more about how to in the significant projects and initiatives of course the most exciting one is the Lynwood Woolston aquatic facility we had two workshops on that and the result of those are pretty exciting we think the the facility is going to shape up to be complementary to other facilities around the city not the same as it 's something that will attract people from across the city to it the way the concept is shaping up and we 're very excited about the way that 's progressing we also spent time on the Wilson library and community facility community consultations there considering those particularly interested in how it will look from us from the street and helping make Wilson look like an a community area and also access to facilities such as toilets for public use in terms of significant issues when we also spent a lot of time on and had a couple of delegations about was the inner-city Eastland wood village area this is Stanwell Road between her food and Gloucester Street where to worry in the doris Lusk park loss of potential loss of shops changes in the way the rental properties are post-earthquake and the board can is learning a lot about how this particular part of christchurch works how affected it 's been after the earthquakes and what needs to be done to move things forward we 're particularly keen to set up and have in the annual plan submission some requested some funding is made available for a drop-in center which will reduce the pressure on Doris last part for people who want to gather homeless people who want together and their associates terms of other matters of interest we 've spent some time thinking about Ferry Road it 's a bit of a hot potato with the cycleway going through it and parking is a strong issue and with that when we 've had a request from grace vineyard church that the parking restrictions that apply a close to the church which are seven-day-a-week restrictions I 've given a holiday on Sunday so worshippers can park without breaking the law we had our board meeting at Rahul marae and that hold some of its meetings at community facilities to get out there and about not stay in our own little headquarters and that was a very exciting one I think all of us enjoyed the multicultural aspects of it and also learning more about how Morrow works and what its needs are normal slides we also discuss the pickups Gallup Road the lifeline through to Sumner and the safety issues around that corner and it 's very pleasing to see progress is happening there and action is occurring and I guess the rest of what we have to say is in the written report you can read it so I 'll now open a leave time for questions thank you I 'm with anyone have any questions and Glen you think you Tim is there an understanding of I 'm sure there is over the issues with Doris Lusk so there 's been a lot of commentary that as if one thing will solve it but it 's that 's one issue I in my observations are with what I 've been asked to do there the board is on to be probably some long term ah there 's it 's a very complex issue and we 've had presentations from the police and from the community about it though so it is it is complex ok so a request for support for a drop-in center and thinking about maybe a wet centers some somewhere down the track is part of the solution but there will be a lot more thinking and actually because I had another question if I may just in relation to your first part over the proposed Aquatic Center with a some kind of a local social needs analysis will sit behind that as well I know that a lot of us will want to have aquatic centers but yeah they really need to come out of and fit the social context we 've done some work on that and in our in our work so far in our discussions with staff so far it was very much local needs local needs based and discussing the character of that community and what they were like and that 's one of the reasons why I 've said them a lot less expensive under and which is great I 'm just saying um right okay well look thank you I think what we should do you 've got a question for your community board gia was just more of the stuff around some of the reports I just wanted to check when bm 's just going to go into the reports in them okay now so would someone like to move the the receipt of the of the report Sara seconded Deon I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye

through some of the logistics for today because we 're starting early with ordered tea and coffee for 00 a.m. are standing orders require that there is a break after we were meeting duration at more than three hours you have to have an adjournment so we 'll have a 10-minute or German to add 11 o 'clock and it 's my intention to move the council when to public excluded to deal with items 42 and 43 at 12 o 'clock and then the council can reconvene at 2 o 'clock with Andrew Turner and the chairs I won 't be here this afternoon and what else was I going to say I think it was about all right okay so I will call for apologies and I have councillor Jimmy chin and myself for early departure would someone like to move it Andrew Turner seconded Jamie Gough I 'll put that motion all 's Kate decorations of interest there haven 't been any Oh sorry decorations of interest is deputy mayor Turner and counts the buck declared an interest on public excluded item that be 42 and 43 wouldn 't up both yep and and so that that that 's that 's why we 're dealing with them and the order that I 'm proposing and so now we move to public participation I 'd like to invite and welcome commotion from OSHA tahi creative spaces thank you now we needed that we need your microphone on so there should be a button that you can yes now screen really very much perfect kyon Cotto I 'm Kim Morton from Ototo creative spaces thank you very much for this opportunity to address the council about our work about the partnerships we have with the council and to invite your future support we are working in neighbourhood creation stations and these are create there 's our creativity groups and local communities building social connections and resilience we 're now running for creation stations in Illinois New Brighton Peterborough and Phillips Town and these are 're successful because we 're activating community spaces which are the living rooms of our communities we have the total support and commitment of library staff and we work with local groups such as actors to maximize participation we 're seeing boosted resilience a real increase in social capital social connection stronger families and relationships that bridge culture age and status so here 's a picture of two artists in the know in Creation Station the fact that one of them a police uniform really makes no difference when you 're both working together creating a woodcut trying hard not to UM cut your fingers and the process so we 've seen I guess they 're a good example our creation stations are a good example of communities leading their own recovery and having a lot of control how about how that happens the other aspect of our work is room five creativity groups these are creativity groups for people with mental illness we run six groups at the Philips town community hub two of those groups are cope up or moldy through these groups we 're providing tailor intensive 48 artists to reach their aspirations and the artists are achieving great things and that that 's best summed up by one artist who said arch saved my life again we 're seeing a reduction in social isolation so people who formerly didn 't leave their houses have got the bravery to come regularly and weekly to these creativity groups we 're seeing improved well-being and for some people that 's a reduction in their encounters with the formal mental health system and a reduction in medication we 're seeing motivation and hope there 's a real sense of belonging and that the artists are part of something in the wider community people are taking up volunteer jobs at eastside gallery we 've had artists taking up scholarships with the learning connexion and achieving qualifications and people are also getting paid work and generating income from the sale of their art this picture also I guess depicts how artists are expressing the feelings about the earthquakes through their art so here 's a drawing by Carmen Brown of the Christchurch Cathedral the balloons represent the people who died in the an Auckland recently and she said I want people in Auckland to understand what we 've gone through in Christchurch creativity is also giving people a reason to reconnect with the central city so excuse me moment we recently went on a group visit to Coca and saw David 's reglas exhibition there our artists were invited to prepare work in response end this week I delivered 85 drawings to Coco which will be displayed in the gallery in the cafe gallery gallery cafe Dan Steve and what struck me though that was that for some of the artists that was the first time they 'd been back in the city since the earthquake and it was quite confronting for them but they overcame their fears and now they have the honor of having their work exhibited alongside an artist or shrug leaf and international standing so creativity opens doors offers hope and a place of belonging and provides a way for people to use their voice but most importantly it builds resilience in social connection with like-minded people our work this year has been funded by earthquake recovery grants continued we don 't receive any funding at the moment from the district house board we 've succeeded in the face of adversity excuse me in an environment of reduced funding streams I need and I guess an environment where the connection between creativity and well-being is not always well understood we have a strong track record and we 're committed to building well-being through creativity and Christchurch long term we 've focused our work in the East where the needs of the greatest and our partnership with the Christchurch City Libraries and maximize maximizes engagement and activates community spaces so we invite your help to continue our work we 're excited about the council 's commitment to resilience and well-being through the establishment of the community resilience fund although announced in February there 's still no information about the how this fund will be used and how it may be accessed and so we 'd appreciate your advice on this and how we can partner with the council and future to continue our work we urge the council to keep up the momentum and prioritize support to build the the most vulnerable and least engaged we also ask the council to support the long term use of the closed schools as community gathering spaces our base at the Philips Town hub in the old school New Brighton both being very valuable assets for the community and ones that we hope can be available long term we understand there 's a lot of complexity around that though I 've given an information sheet about our programs without my contact details and we would love to have you to visit if you 'd like to contact me for further information my details of the M thank you thank you very much I 'm really pleased that you came and made that presentation because it just it 's very grounding and it reminds us of what creativity and innovation can do and the wake of a experience that we 've actually we 've actually shared it collectively you know there 's just nobody that 's been unaffected but people who may have had pre-existing vulnerabilities have been made even more vulnerable and I just know what you 're doing is awesome so is just the public participation part it 's just a five minute okay well there 's not time yes thank you very much my details of the original watch it yeah but but do I mean counselors do you take up the opportunity to approach come and and do take the opportunity to go on join with the different opportunities that are there okay so the next item on the agenda is presentation of petitions there are none or there were no deputations by appointment no presentation of petitions are supplementary reports I 'll move that item 43 public excluded housing opportunity be received and considered at the council meeting today do I have a seconder for that that 's not conflicted Tim skin but I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried but someone like to move the the minutes is here Andrew seconded by n Galloway I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried I 'm going to just leave the building and infrastructure improvement allowance report just move to council controlled organizations finance statements for six months and would you like to introduce this reporters the chair of the committee would you like to move that the envious and then Jamie was sickened it so are there any questions Glenn thank you just curious ready page 92 over Civic building it has an environmental target that seems clear but it 's kind of mixed in with a social performance one and I couldn 't see what that was my question arises over the fact of smoking although we have a a no smoking area at the on the Wooster Street and I think also the here for the street side of the building sexually not being adhered to and the smoking is being transported up through the ventilation system into the committee rooms so I for one am not it I don 't have a life aim to be a passive smoker so I actually want if there 's an objective over there please I would like that I 'm going to raise it with the chair of the ya know James are these and you know financial statements for the six months that they defaced in December but I know I 'm just trying to find a way to wrangle Evans be honest at least I think mayor issue that do Neal III say I have raised it let 's see yeah but but there are some issues around the cafe lease yes I rise I understand so that 's part of the deal to with civic isn 't it the lease yeah um I think we 've got a resolution or a note to have a workshop around the whole civic building relationship coming out of our appointments process so I think we had asked that we actually do have a workshop and hear how that arrangements worked managed etc so that might be the time to address it the issue you phrased as one of an area that 's been designated for and it 's not being policed for want of a better term but it really comes down to what are the ramifications of what what what does it being or who set those is that the landowner so we can there say violent because it 's a public space through you madam chair I think what Glen race is there is an area where we 've said it 's not it 's not a smoking area leave that is my view is that that 's operation was probably conversational to be here first instance with Carlene maybe it 's not landlord assume this ownership that 's possible yeah I do know that there was intent because I have had a conversation with Nyjah who was that there was to be no smoking at all on the premises so that and that 's part of the lease arrangement so we need what you 're saying is is that that is that if people smoke in their area then the smoke actually comes in yes it 's it 's big enough experience the area that is actually raised isn 't actually counselled handy anyone thank you thank you for that Glen yes um so I 'll put the motion those in favor say aye as opposed they know it 's carried through Canterbury Economic Development Company Limited winding up now just to explain this company that was established a number of years ago it 's been a shelf currently reading but with ongoing obligations in relation to the [Music] you know report reporting and filing annual returns etc etc but of course nothing 's transacted so I would like to move that we approve the winding up of the company seeking a five David East any discussion oh right okay Jana Johansson meal form did it look from a vision all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the next item as development crashes I must have update report April 2017 would you like to yeah I 'm gonna move on well yeah I 've introduced yes MACD sale and just updated us on the three key bits of work they 're doing which is obviously New Brighton and the hot saltwater pools as demonstrated by David there you can stand up if you oh yes okay thank you Vicki are you taking a picture and then on that 's progressing well obviously this that 's in the annual plan so that will come out through that process the on the adventure park and obviously the impact of the fire which they 're still working through but otherwise that 's it and so so you 'll move there yeah and yeah yeah I 'll get a seconder first second of four terms can direct so yeah he 's got a question yeah I was just wondering if when DCL or might be able to report back publicly on the work they 've done around Central City car parking given that there has been a very topical issue yeah I 'm sure they were I think they 've been doing some work around the performing arts precinct and to the north of the city but everything else around car parking actually is pretty much in train I think we 're gonna have six car parks open within about the next three or four months so we 'll be back to where we were I think once they 've got a proposal for the performing arts precinct then they can we can talk about that yeah all right so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as advice from theack on a revised memorandum of agreement for the committee I 'm happy to move this the zerah zerah Templeton there any questions any discussion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried stormwater pump station 205 upgrade and repair options it 's pointing Cotter would like to introduce this and move it you think you 'll move it cm we had quite good discussion about this at the key committee meeting and it 's the pump station that pumps the water out from Horseshoe Lake there and out of the four options the preferred option at 1.9 million seems to be the most robust it was going to give take into account the sea level rise and give a 50-year life and because the land has actually sunk this actually means that they 're going to extend the flights they call in the Archimedes screw it seems to me quite innovative way to address this problem but it 's also going to protect a lot of homes from above floor flooding so the fact that it 's operate particularly in a storm event so it 's quite crucial that this actually gets repaired so we considered all the possibilities than the OP preferred options supported by the committee and they 've also we 've talked about any possible developments in the residential red zone and this is not going to affect any of that so I 'm happy to move it thank you seconded by Michael Ovitz question yeah I 'm just looking at the funding but this is earthquake damaged so yeah with this considered as part of the skirt process on terms of the allocation from peg look Steve see to the skirt examination of the of the pump station only focused on the structure did not look at the operation of the station or issues like ground settlement which is what 's occurred here yes the the earthquake damage relates to the ground the ground stood on the station sunken to the ground part of the flight extinction is the earthquake recovery the bulk of this one point nine million one point five of it is actually for replacement of aging equipment the station the two Diesel 's are aging and some of the equipment has unable to be replaced so we 've gone a little bit beyond the scope this includes a bit of basement if you like to use that description I 'm Sarah did you have a question or night down [Music] I 'm just just on the ground sitting does that come under the EQC no that 's residential is it only the only resident Kingdom Nou replacing the diesels with Diesel 's the proposal lead to replace some of the electric pumps okay that 's good thank you Glen thank you my questions over the context background section same distances 5.5 I know you 're going to address the siltation in the tailwater channels and culverts or just from a lay person 's perspective wonder about the culverts and weather in your discussion you well it was the discussion over whether the culverts themselves so the up flow bins they even seem to be sufficient given the extra loading on the foundation from Preston 's and other areas this is no proposal there 's no proposal to replace the the any extra potential runoff from areas like Preston 's has already been has already occurred sorry I just lost must trigger my thoughts there the short answer is we believe the culverts are sufficiently at capacity the ability to lift the water inside the tailrace will actually help drive the water through the culverts there is some sedation of the culverts that needs to be removed okay I just want it just from being on the river looking back you know even a not a high tide level then the waters right out yes it yes it is part of this proposal the the pump station said would buy a hundred and fifty millimeters this proposal includes to restore the left of the station by the 150 plus an additional 450 so this is actually allowing for some future sea level rise in changes that have already happened within the catchment what does you proposal the proposed option is aiming to do is to maximize the capacity of the station within its existing infrastructure limits which we believe will continue the life of the station for at least another so I 've got a mover in a second dollar menu discussion but the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried item number 15 porting would you like to introduce that and move that yes we 'll move it this sum is regarding disposal of the land that 's already been acquired under the flood intervention policy and so it means that the internet the infrastructure can be taken off the land and the land can be released for sale so that means that any new dwellings built on the Atlanta to comply with the new regulations it means that the council can actually recoup some of the the money that we put into this to allow people to move on it 's basically seconded by Mike Davidson any questions any discussion I actually do want to say something about it because the thing the thing about you know there 's been a lot of discussion about the impact of the earthquake on land and the people who were made the most vulnerable after the earthquakes were people who didn 't require a the levels that you would build it in terms of flood management area and so this policy of the council buying out the the properties that were vulnerable very vulnerable to the flooding and the particular areas that they were prior to the work being done that land can now go on the market and the new properties that are built there so that the empty land that we sell and the new properties that are built there will be built above the floor levels that are required for building in these areas and I think that 's a 1 for the city and it still worries me that we have many properties that are below the flood management area and that 's something that the council is going to have to continue to address over over the next many years as as you know various elements of the you know sea level rise and things like that take effect so so I think this is a one-one it 's a very good outcome it is right yelling I 'm going to sir I should have clarified this um I land if like the sale process is not the disposal process that we would normally go through and we decided this when we bought them that we would put lease that we would put them back on the mark that once the work had been completed okay I just wanted whether we considered transfer to other parties or sell to other parties who might have a need for it before we actually made the decision to go to market to sell we might we 've made this decision in your walk can I could through Lee and I completely recall that at the time we made decisions around those properties I think the point that is being made is that things have changed since it in pajamas should we review these properties and the light of them where they 're located do we need to make a zero disparate may need to make the decision today don 't think so whose fault is this there 's nothing in here that says yeah I guess there 's no urgency in that councils already bought four of them and we 're in for those the sort of idea behind progressing this as quickly as possible was to recoup money spend but the policies more social base rather than anything else so council doesn 't need this land for any purpose to that you 've got to understand that these advances forward properties peaceful boundaries of neutral area so the implications for them may be limited yeah and we still would need to probably approve one to actually enable the twenty to include the removal of the dwellings on the property but then it also sees to consider retaining non habitable structures such as garages on the property if these are considered to be three so already and that 's good because they 're not covered by the floor level yeah but also we 've got um other papers and report you know around you know we still got the issue of the housing trust so and that wasn 't known at the time that we did this and the original resolutions I can 't see any anywhere where it says we would resell them um so I thought you know week dad the resolutions and I can see now it was it was an in terms of the the paper that we considered it was absolutely crystal clear that some of the cost would be recouped by the selling of the problems and but we 're going to face that cost anyway with the Housing Trust so whether we do it through this or through another means but I guess that stuff can just take that on board but you know I personally think it would be good to just think about that it 's actually neutral in terms of cost to council so this the the value of it 's very selling would be Beland basically so it 's probably not going to be just be section values ultimately it 's not a huge II understand that but we 've just acquired Linwood village and then the Housing Trust is acquired and it 's got needs somewhere to put those properties yeah but that it may not be that that land is suitable because they don 't have the floor levels you 'd have to build up the land in that makes developing houses very expensive on that sort of land I must say so it may not be suitable lens I probably need unfortunate but I we probably need a report if we wanted to go down you ever knew that I must say that committee didn 't discuss it as an option at for the day but we were quiet because this was the intention this was always the intention was to buy and sell so because it was an intervention to help these people um yeah okay all right well I 'm I 'm I 'm going to put the motion I think that there sometimes things do change but I think in terms of these properties the amount of time that would have to be taken to evaluate each of them for the suitability in terms of for example social housing would be it would hold things up too much and I think the the sale of these properties that the funding for that actually comes off the cost of the the whole of the flood flood drainage recovery program for their area so it 's been project for that purpose all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no sit no that 's carried and proposed busts passenger shelter installation 42 he referred Street I saw people standing there in the rain yesterday very much in favor of this is this is a need shell bus stop so bus shelter sorry so there 's no cost to council on this one thing that the committee did talk about was because there 's digital advertising on there that would it be possible for staff to investigate council I 'm having use of the digital advertising space or some of it or a portion of it to actually raise our own profile of events or consultations or stuff going on in town so hopefully that will come back to us and so there 's also probably going to be another four or five shelters installed around the city by the end of June including kilmore Street the airport one so that 's quite weasel great so that 's moved by you with it seconded by Tara okay Jonnie nice day is there any process for us to talk to add shell about stops that have the highest usage that don 't have shelters being a priority rather than ones that are good just first advertising but maybe not so good for passenger numbers because I personally think it would be really good to start having that conversation on our board our community board has repeatedly put in quests with a bus tour outside things like the disabled person 's place and what 's the story and it did seem a very small number of people using it there 's a priority so we 've looked at all that I think every community board has those discussions every time a bus shelters going in but there 's a whole lot of conditioners and obstacles often around bus shelters including resource consents and hearings some of them can be very expensive I presume this one over here because there was no objections it 's quite a quick and easy one to go and so but what we 're going to do is the Itchy committee call for a report and a try and get a handle I do want to note it in here because I you know I can understand why they 'd want to go for this one but I think it would be good to get that other work done as well sooner rather than later so that we 're not just approving ones that are good for advertising we 're actually approving ones that actually have a need in terms of the numbers of passengers that don 't have absolutely so this one being cost neutral is probably a good one to just get on with isn 't it yeah so um yeah deal oh no oh yeah just just a real quick um comment on on these it 's very loud today these bus shelters because it 's inside the outside of the delegation of our community board I mean we don 't have a decision-making power over that but I think it would be quite nice to actually just get some sort of update about what 's actually happening around these kind of things that are kind of normal community board stuff but just like with inside your walk because the community board still kind of want to know what 's going on I suppose because it is part of our community board even though it 's metropolitan delegation can that kind of process be put in place could you tell them well I didn 't I didn 't know until we got kind of the report yeah like to parking changes and things like that in the inner city which is outside the Central Board delegation so I suppose there 's probably reasonably easy to give them board an update preps for Evy to three months of changes into parking in bus stops here yep Oakland thank you just a minor but small note continuing the crusade our bus shelters are smoke-free now so that 's part of our extension to our smoking in public places policy so if we could I think obviously this is an important location so let 's just make sure that long Williams yep and yeah yeah thank you yes yeah yeah it 's a feel um let the smoke-free but is it like look with regards to this 're proposing to put a bus shelter at 42 here ohrid Street I saw several people waiting in the rain last night so the longer we debate this the longer they 'll be raking the rates and but there 's not it 's not really relevant to the debate and just stop it I blame you for theirs and I actually blame myself because I switched off and forgot to pull you I mention it again is anyone else good did you have a question sorry it wasn 't a question it was more of a quip that if the bus stops are smoke-free most the buses won 't be allowed to stop there there is also out of order so there you go Mike so I just wanted to note if you have a look at the the diagram of a run 6.2 a while back I had a walk around with people from the disability sector I mean one of the problems with people with Keynes 's is the gap between the glass petition and the the ground actually caused an issue for them because we 're now to write to the last second didn 't feel it to rock the last second I 'm so I 'll put that up and they 're going to actually look to close that gap and start retrofitting all the ones existing ones so to remove that obstacle which is quite a good progress cool all right I will put a mover in a second Dave I know I 'm gonna use I have got a seconder who second do it Sierra that 's right zero temperature down the bottom yep cool I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried transitional City projects fund amendments to terms of reference yeah I 'll move and we 've added some we added some words there no so oh sorry I 've got written down here additional wedding editor recommendation three but there is a recommendation three excellent yeah yeah yeah okay um so you 're happy to move it no Paul if you could just say the item number before you sorry item 19 so apologizing no no I would say that it transitional City projects fund and Vicky 's moving this but would you like to introduce the paper just this has been a fund it 's not massive it 's a hundred and fifty K it 's this broadens it so that it goes across the whole city it doesn 't specify what parts have to be done in the central city and the suburbs it changes it slightly from transitional to regeneration that 's especially for you then and it it enables it to do a slightly different range of things but basically it just brings it up sort of six years brings it up to date yep to have a sigil early supported by the command Roo for your discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye or those opposed say no that 's carries 21 X minus 21 heritage incentive grant approval for tuck tree it 's just we 've already passed my nuts Emily yes okay there 's the one with additional wording under three and Strasse okay so um so there 's been some changes to this one I noticed that the review of and I think that can be somewhat limiting in terms of what we 're trying to achieve so that now reads by September 2017 in order to inform development of the long-term plan and there didn 't seem to be an appetite to to limit the delegation to a value of 100,000 making the point that you know community boards have substantially higher delegations and I don 't think any of us can recall a a time where we where we declined a recommendation from the committee so I think there 's a degree of comfort around the delegation sorry no just clarifying do you mean that it remained it is what 's here at a hundred thousand or are we talking about I think it 's just full delegations this is the flow delegate and just wondering in fact though if figure say like 150,000 so that with there were real are large applications which might be more contentious and in fact they do come back the full council that 's my only thought yeah it the only thing that you mentioned I don 't disagree with you just them I can 't either but most of the time I think more times are not we sometimes do add bits and pieces or will amend will it mean data Council that 's just my my only concern is that you know the lot the last one like remember us doing was even saying could we put in something around there about trimming the trees Bex we could see it or could they be part there to tell that story so I don 't think that we 've got this quite right I agree we 'd spoken earlier around doing this review I note that it 's there in item 3 but I think Yanni it was that raised a point about perhaps incorporating it with a strategy I think we do need to have a wider look at it because there are a lot of reoccurring things that continue to come up and that 's oh that silly really if they continue to come up so we might as well put them in as policy but I 'm just reluctant to give full delegation there until we 've got it right yet and it 's not a lack of confidence in that Lizzie that 's just so that we tend to think we visit that after after we 've received the review that 's my song we could review rip divisional delegation Sarah yeah just a couple of responses I think that the last time we changed things as before the committee was seeing these first and so it was coming straight to council without a committee recommendation and when we took method trimming the trees and putting a plaque and stuff and I think the committee would probably do that the other thing when I mentioned this first earlier was that it wasn 't for all heritage grants it was for the huge incentive grants because actually there are some heritage grants that we do that are much broader with larger amounts of money the landmark ones for example so it 's actually for number 4 worth it straightforward to approve a huge incentive grants this is always I 've sent it 's the specific funds that we are dealing with today for these three applications and it year of sort of 700,000 and I 'm really comfortable with each community boards others have you know delegations over you know pots of money that um that are above the hundred thousand and we need to trust our colleagues to just get on with it I mean the interesting thing for me was that the particular heritage incentive grant that we 're being asked to approve today wouldn 't meet the delegation that was proposed by the by the by the committee yeah you know we 'd still have to because it 's a hundred and seventeen thousand a 100 and you don 't be very happy for the committee so yeah Danny yeah I thought last term it was raised to 150,000 and I personally am comfortable with that I do think that there could be quite contentious ones to come and also that just given the quantum of the fun that anything over that 150 actually should be a full council decision because it would significantly erode the money that could be remaining in it so and also also because it 's actually sometimes good for the my recommendation would be that we change it to 150,000 I think that 's in line with the advice that we had lost I think there needs to be a the delegations is this for a reason stuff I 've got them everyone here everyone has and I just think no delegation of carp large probably isn 't the way I 'd like to go I 'd support raising it but I think there needs to be something there it 's it Imaginext I support no upper limit obviously as a council we 've set a total envelope for for how much can be spent on these these grants and we 've just recently a delegated decision-making to the IT committee about cycleways which is a lot bigger than what we 're talking about here and various community boards you know the the Linwood central he 's got 1.6 million for the Woolston facility those kind of things and we 're happy for the inter to be working on it with a net budget um when we 're not getting you know oversight of every decision that it 's being last Thames was was a hundred thousand years I 'm just wondering into the discussion in fact if we should decide on the limit at the time of the review comes through which should be well guess it still September but maybe that this aspect goes back to the committee so the committee are comfortable with the limit that we 're deciding there 's a quite a few different views around the table as to whether we have no upper limit or whether we say have it at 150,000 widget the last one is my own view at the moment alright so um let me see how we handle this so let 's let 's do 1 2 3 together yep if we got any stuff the can answer yep yep the staff are here he 's bringing oh yeah Brennan I 'm my only question is just around the first one there I just find that the just with the cost with prelim in general in contingency what what actually is there and the only reason I ask that is because contingency I 'm pursuing as team seen but figure view just as general and prelim and general I 'd want a bit more explanation than just general preliminary for the biggest chunk of their money what it what is their premier in general is just the establishment of the site scaffolding or all the items that a contractor needs to to have available on the site the site office you know everything that you can 't necessarily quantify but they have to include in their price okay and the other the other contingency sums are to cover and I 'm we and on heritage buildings you will find this virtually every time but when you when you engage into the when you get into the work you 'll find more work than you needed to believe the new thought was going to actually need to be dealt with good segue into the second question and you know normally we 'll do a contingency of team centers that are higher and do you see they 're often higher and businesses like us and is the steam sea towards a greater it 's it 's normally a standard construction figure the other thing to remember anyways is the those those costs when they when they 're put in they are provisional sums so there is the grunt is actually paid out on the actual sums the receipts that are there are paid so we it 's it 's better to have a slightly higher amount to make sure you 've got enough cover because more than likely you 'll find more work than you anticipated so the provisional and general sums and contingency sums cover those variable work costs though that are almost certainly going to happen on a heritage building because it 's not it 's not as clean and clinical as a new build where you know pretty much exactly what you 're gonna what you 're going to have to pay and do we normally put contingency in general and I just found it a bit why could you ever call it just yeah no pun you know what we find is that different different applicants and different contractors of different ways of pricing things so some of them make the PNG as a separate item some figures so what I find is best is rather than staff trying to make up and anticipate what exactly is in those figures it 's better to just put them as they come in but as say the key thing is that the it 's paid the amount of of grandness paid is on the receipts of the work so it 's the actual cost of what these these provisional sums may may actually leave something in in the pot which is returned to the fund and I was just surprised that essentially nothing about the roof looking at the photo probably the radiused part of it especially the the roof it doesn 't have any worry actually being down to the roof and well it may it may look pretty ratty but that might be part of I 'm sure oh and my whole route is it part of the charm probably yeah yep I mean yes it 's odd sometimes the the most awful looking part so there 's a lot of rust on it that Armenia it 's taken quite well to get that rust okay so so would someone like to move items one two three Sarah Glenn I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye or those opposed say no that 's carried now let 's the original motion that was on the on the paper did did actually have a it hit a hundred thousand and we have a a desire to shift that to one hundred and fifty thousand and we have others who believe that there shouldn 't be a limit or a cap on on the delegation to the committee it 's a it 's a it 's a limited pool as I guess the the argument there so can you change the hundred to the hundred and fifty and we could have I think yarny and Jamie to move there is that right I thought it was almost an additional idea which could be somewhere in the middle of net was perhaps we decide on whether there is or isn 't a delegation at the time of the other piece of workers completed because that might inform that no no but there were there was a delegation a desired I mean this one wouldn 't have been well in September 2017 it 's up there obviously they 're going to come back with a review of that so I almost wonder it also appear that that they shouldn 't their limitation so when they review potentially inform that though so it 's hard to say well be but I 'm just trying to get to a solution here so no I 'm ok with that um yeah can I just check my Brennand see how often we get ones that are over 150 yeah I don 't like nonprofit you see I 'm on the report yeah that it gives the previous sort of grants for this year most of them are on 100 but we usually get at least two or three that would be over over hundred yeah this one here 's 117 sales tonight and in 127 make a little but um they often in the past if they 've been over 150 I mean those 150 just going to see most of the decisions done anyway um because I 'm it 's the costs are going up so it 's a good idea to adjust that figure up anyway but yeah it is hard to anticipate what 's coming in because we get we get such a wide variety we get we get grants right down into a few thousand right up to the the multiple hundreds of thousands so I say on average yes about probably three two or three a year would be over that figure yeah one of the other things tonight as well is that the committee if they did hit the delegation the full delegation but they felt uncomfortable about it they could always refer it to Council why not keep it then I personally are and I know there 's move by yani so if I just speak to that I understand that we have allocated a pot of money for this purpose I do think that the Uni as a counselor there is that responsibility or expectation that that final say will probably sit with Council there so I 'm not I 'm not saying this due to a lack of trust with the committee far governance is that you want to have those checks and balances there there has been a figure in the past I I would almost lean towards a hundred thousand as the original recommendation just simply because if you look at the history of this there are only two that are over there so I don 't think that 's going to be particularly onerous I think it gives the delegation to you know four ninety five percent of the applications going to have delegated authority there but I think that you can 't just just have nothing I think that there needs to be some figure so whether it 's a hundred or 150 if you do 150 then nothing will come to counsel but I think you need a thresholding I would actually be comfortable with 100 it would mean that two of the ones that are in six figures plus get sign-off from Council and I think that 's appropriate right I 'd agree with Jamie I think a hundred thousand seems quite reasonable to me I mean as Mike pointed out I mean the cycleways is of came back to council than this type of stuff which seems pretty straightforward so I 'd support 100,000 does it emit so drop baked or what a while yeah I think that 's really mean just in terms of what I remember coming through a lot of stuff is it 's generally under a hundred thousand well if we if we are if we 're going to reviewers at the time that we 've received the report then then I 'm happy with that all right so we 'll leave it as it was yeah she support the hundred and fiftieth only the committee 's perfectly capable of making the decision as a council would and that gives us a level of comfort and it means that these things have to come back here so I support 150 will do want to move that it be amended to read 150 so we 've got love and your second net right okay so we 've got we 've got whip no but we 've now got a resolution that we 're capable of putting so the amendment has been moved Paulin a hundred and fifty this is an amendment so it 's just separate yes um I think 150 is reasonable if counsel want to delegate the responsibility to a committee to go over the detail of these applications 150 is pretty reasonable I think kind of like real litigating issues like tip tea tree cottages we 've already started today is a case in point where in fact council don 't really need to do that a good committee should be able to eat trusted to do the work and the residue I 'm supporting of a limit of 150,000 thank you right okay so um I mean I 'm happy with either 100 150 but given 150 s on the table happy to support that um I as you don 't think it 's going to make that bigger difference in the interim because there 's so few applications for over a hundred that actually I think it 's pretty negligible I just wanted to take the opportunity though under number three just to point out that the staff have had been working really hard on a heritage strategy thank them for that I think the review that 's been requested of the grants while important actually I think it should actually align with that work that we 're doing so I just don 't want to put the pressure in terms of September 2017 when if we haven 't finished that strategy work it seems quite hard to do a review of the grants so I hope that we can give staff a little bit of comfort in terms of that flexibility because I think it is important that we take a holistic approach to developing the strategy and obviously funding will be one of the key things that comes up out as part of those discussions the workshops that have already been held there has been an issue that has been raised so yeah but I welcome this grant being made today it 's a shame that the council 's not hearing directly from the people that are behind this restoration but actually it 's it 's a really positive story I think for a very valuable historic asset in our city and there 's a real to their community and to the citizens of the city to see this historic building when it when the repairs are complete so I think it 's a really exciting project and I 'm very happy to support it Andrew thank you I 'm reasonably ambivalent as to whether 100 and 150 or 100 is the right amount certainly taking into account Brendan 's commentary around inflation that probably would point to the hundred and fifty I think it 's important that there is threshold there somewhere just from the point of view of an application that was larger than 150,000 would take quite a large proportion of the fund and that 's where we perhaps want to be making a council decision but I 'm certainly supportive of a delegation going to the committee so that we 're not dealing at council with the kind of things we see in front of us today I 've got full confidence in the committee to do that work and of course the committee is the right place for the detailed question-and-answer session to be held so the committee can be comfortable I 'm just getting this reboot because we had Jonnie and Jamie moving second the hundred thousand and the amendment is now in the name kata and Clearwater and it 's the amendment that changes the number from a hundred to one hundred and fifty right so oh oh sorry I 'm just thinking that this is a useful discussion to be having in terms of live-streaming because it actually raises the profile of our heritage buildings and if we have a higher threshold then maybe this won 't happen yeah all right well I will put the amendment first those in favor of the amendment say aye those opposed say no um I can 't tell don 't other columns here that 's carried sharpen those in favor of the amendment raise your hand those opposed so you want them to want that mangie Galloway golf cute queuing was it okay you were the only one on that side okay so um so that is carried I 'll put the motion now all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you address ends in the month yes they can ever we chatting love you and the break and thank you community organization loan scheme no sorry no I 've gone off the heritage Jones and he returned to the st. of grant approval for 209 charm Street yeah would you like to introduce this one so so with 209 to M Street we are referring to for those who can remember the former High Street post office building and now as we know the cc1 and it 's also was LSS as well so that 's the building we 're talking about and like it 's quite a clear and the report shows it 's quite a clear part of that street scene it 's a really nice heritage part which has been preserved and it doesn 't get the you know I 'm a group it isn 't the group one highly significant buildings dear for the nothing within the district plain so it 's a relatively small amount fifty five thousand nine hundred thirty one dollars and of course as counselors will be aware the these um the this money isn there 's also a covenant around the building as well and have council any further questions I 'm sure Brennan will answer them so that you 're moving me I 'll move over seconder clean Livingston any discussion I 'll put them just a brief thing I think what this shows what the to application shows is that heritage isn 't just confined to the central city that 's in the outlying areas to you and I think as part of the strategy we 're going to look at developing a heritage trail it 's really important to have that people talk about future buildings yes must have them but they only have meaning when you have your heritage as well so we 've got to ensure we retain it and yep fully approve this thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried Phil which not to introduce the next one which is item 23 approval of an extension of time for heritage incentive grant for five norwich kay so it 's simply an extension of time that the people doing the work it 's taken a lot longer and more difficult than they anticipated in so we 're talking about the what was there previously the little didn 't have a board building in replacement of a whole upper storey of that and so it 's again the same provisions apply as I refer as we referred to in the previous item and so the second delegation here which is the delegation to the committee to approve extensions of up to five years for the uptake of heritage incentive grants which again are in and in line with the conversation with just d 'etre very very much support yep um do I have a seconder question two sir who would like Andrea would like to see conduct Norwich key is that in your cage not mic and then down thank you oh just got a quick question on that second resolution and I don 't have too much of an issue but I 'm just wondering why five years which obviously makes it roll over election Toomes would you know long-term plans and just wondering why it to the end of the actual election cycle term cycle and if there 's an impact from drilling right yeah I mean I 've got an answer to it but Brennan have you got a few or well five years yet five years quite a long time and it may cause it may cause accounting issues one thing but what we what we 're finding is that the work that 's coming out of of the grand schemes now are always being funded by the grand schemes it 's a lot more complicated than the grand scheme was originally intended it was it was originally just for maintenance and conservation works to existing buildings now we 're dealing with repairs and seismic upgrades to damaged buildings and the works much more complicated and we 're finding that eighteen months invariably is a hard time frame for people to meet by the time they 've they 've planned it they 've got their their engineering in place their architectural drawings in place and actually started the work 18 months is were really tight for even for relatively small projects so of time and normally we ask for at least a year in terms of the extension of time so I don 't maybe maybe something like two years would be a better about a timeframe we would like people to actually make make sure that people do the work so maybe given him five years might be too much because they might just sit back and think I 've got five years let 's take it easy but we want them to actually do the work so is it okay with the mover and the Sikandar yep d aren 't you deletion yeah I just wanted to ask about the the ongoing maintenance of these this building in particular and others that need these extensions of time do you check to make sure that they are keeping them like with the tightened stuff so that ongoing deterioration of them well that 's a different issue in all buildings have to make the building code so and the building code has provisions in it for the long long life of the components of the buildings they have to meet the building in maintenance that you have to do to any building and it varies obviously with the type of materials that you 've got on the building but repainting I mean the previous granite was an example of that where a painted building has to be repainted every probably every 15 to 20 years so that that 's a fairly standard maintenance issue we we don 't monitor that but what what obviously I monitor is the works that are going on that are funded as part of the granite it 's up to the building owner then to ensure that the investment is protected through the through the maintenance the long-term maintenance of the building we will certainly help them with a long-term maintenance plan if they if they choose to do that we 've done that on other other grant assisted projects cool let 's come all right so Andrew thank you.thank just speak to this briefly and this is a significant building in little turn intercourse in a context of Littleton having lost a lot of its heritage as a result of the earthquakes this buildings on norwich the port gates that 's an area which over time has seen loss of a number of other buildings and an increased industrial creek because of the the port operations this building actually forms part of a or potentially could form part of a heritage precinct and with this building on one corner the old British Hotel on the opposite corner and the Littleton Times building next door so a significant heritage feature because of its location and because of its proximity to other remaining heritage in Littleton we 're fortunate here to have a building owner who took steps to preserve the building in its damaged state and certainly fortunate to have a building owner who 's willing to invest in the future of this building given its prominence and significance to the history of that lower part of Littleton so I 'm strongly supportive of this all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed and no that 's carried community organization loan scheme thanks Brendan thank you [Music] we got that if there 's anyone got me professionals on this Sarah Templeton any discussion oh no I just want to strongly support this application I think humanik Enterprise to the long history they do terrific work with people with disabilities and they 've they 've survived very well financially as well to through the earthquake in terms of the way they 've done their work and that they will in the future be able to sell their building to UM back up the mortgage that they 're asking for a loan for for strongly supported often sympathetic that I do too that 's um I went to visit Kilmarnock enterprises last year and was blown away they have completely transformed the operation they are genuine social enterprise they offer opportunities to people that would otherwise potentially be excluded from the workforce and in a way that is much more than just a job but it 's a way of life and I just take my hat off to them so I think this is a really good way of supporting them with their new premises but the motion all those in favor say aye the place they know that 's couple of amendments to the on a week no we 're going to refer this one back to the housing task force or to the housing task force in order to bring back recommendations to the 25th of May there 's just some slight wording in there about you know I mean I think it 's really important for example to head the MIR as part of your governance group if I could be able to delegate the authority and you know the minister may do as well although we like having meetings with ministers state I limp or cotton know so he 's happy with the day 's happy with it so well Glenn would you like to move that the to refer this item to be short us of people to do the ending the second FL clearwater I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried so you can all have to behave for this one promise code of conduct item number Tweety 's is officially to appoint the recommendations that we have in front of us as code conduct with an amendment to 4.11 as discussed replacing the council 's parent code request each community board to replace their current codes of conduct with new code and that requesters in order to have consistency across all of our community boards and the council of Salvia and authorizes the chief executive to approve any non material changes that may be required before the new code of conduct is published you know don 't want apostrophes in the wrong place do it no absolute definite knowledge I 'm sorry I 'm very down on so yeah so I you and I hid this in common with all right as there are there any well I 'll move it and and draw a second up so is there any other any questions is there any discussion should I just go ahead and put motion I wasn 't going to give a homily but I won 't all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they no that 's carried thank you very much well done local governments state and this is just a published on the website yes we we had to comply with the react by having it on our website within six months of the election which we 're done yeah good all right so I 'll move there it 's thickened up by Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried now let 's work back to item number eight and item number H as the building and infrastructure improvement allows government fund I did I did ask that that the correct title end us known title we 're used and throughout the document so that we I think that people got used to calling it a better month fund but it 's actually it 's a loan facility at the capacity to like to borrow so the proposal is that we allocate the balance of the allowance to the Port Hills recovery program including water protection parks restoration public safety elements and then close the fund once the allocation has occurred and we note that the original purpose of the building and infrastructure improvement allowance was superseded with the balance of the fund does not align with the original purpose of the fund but supports HD I would just put supports recovery from a more recent event which has not yet budgeted for visit element of infrastructure but this the environment doesn 't feel like the word infrastructure to me so I 'm happy to move that and second it by Dion so now that the Yanni um had a question I guess it 's for the chief executive in terms of there is a number of skirt or earthquake repair projects that still need to be done and I just wanted to understand what the process is for seeking additional funding to do it once and do it properly and I just give you example of Griffith where we 've just had the road renewal start work notice or for the consultation document sorry which had a tooth code repair done two years ago and I 'm struggling to kind of understand why ain 't no one asked us for money to do the renewal at the time that is go repair but also if there 's my understanding is right sort of last thing that skirts doing if there 's a process by which you can seek additional funding to actually do it once and do it properly rather than having to come back in two years time and put more money on budget and West that resource um soon you ask David Ansen to respond to me the strategy that materialized I 'm incorporating what the state of the roads would be incorporated class because we knew this people look at all those theories a new way of um is good for it and they just hatched to an area where functionality had been lost so we will get a rough road but building into your long-term strategy any financial strategies we move forward army obligations required to bring your infrastructure back to that previous question state so those projects are incorporating your long term pain hope you see it as a time these people a limit to the size of capital program and so this time we go for Arkansas is here which will be powerful long-term LTP that will come back the quiz Park projects everything is the any opportunity any of those additional redundancy yeah because we yeah this no no this no it is relevant it is relevant and that 's why pop this to the to the end of the public so let 's cut it yeah but what they only is asking is having due diligence you news name you well know with those projects that remain are there any betterment opportunities that sit with them and if so how would they be brought to our attention given the winding up of the fund I would have to go all the way basically the only payments are our CMS and quite big pond station an opportunity for betterment and any of those is an action fact very very limited I have to go exactly see what twelve that are outstanding at this point in time of my understanding this day a lot of pump stations first water pump stations those sorts of things that the reason is are delays because we have to get delays and specialist equipment coming in to connect them off otherwise they were walking finished at four and this we 've got good effect in doing the dermis where be more cost-effective for us and get another contractor and where our agents contract if we were to look at sort of getting so we 've got master plan sitting there we are look your ways will integrate all those in as we go through with our cable program so the 1.5 million basically I suppose the reason why governments come to you because they wouldn 't pay too much once you know know I 'm most hit list I think previously or recently yeah so we can provide that again there is no don 't listen I know we 've done if you obviously scene but it 's just a Colleen dakotas and my understandable I 'm hacking man yelling give advice on that when he comes and well but I mean I think that that 's not unreasonable just to to circulate the listener the remaining scoop projects but but I mean the truth is is that shutting this down as a fund doesn 't actually stop us from bringing it back for a station that there was an element of betterment and so I think people have moved away from using the fund because that has so little left in it that they they just wrap it up into the cost of the total program now but if there are opportunities were than what remains of scared I mean I don 't know that the hug would actually support them doing additional work even if we paid for it I don 't know because you know that that they 're wrapping up and getting out of town as it were what I can see is around the defects that need to be replaced and sometimes it just seems crazy that I mean the stress of a collect donations they 've got so many Ashville holes in them that that you actually might what you might actually do is actually seal it properly yeah so again some of them with a defect staff but actually it might require additional funding so but I appreciate that s fund you know that doesn 't preclude us from doing that but I think if we can get point designers 157 purpose of having long-term practical confessions tonight imagine some of those will be the ones that John is talking about without going to do work is the amount allocated in this critical program to go back in before they those defects all have to be fixed before they get transferred and oh that 's right to counsel it may go into practical completion before 12 months after that they become final and completed now what we normally do is get rid of or list if giving project now all go why start prior to it going through that prep book of region but there is allocation in the funding all that amount so we don 't need additional funding in there that is already allocated through that model cost-sharing agreement to actually take it for that yeah okay I think one is that the designer or the scope of the repairs in some cases I think is an insufficient it 's actually fixer which means you 've got all this extra maintenance is generated so yes I 'm going to put another domain this is actually a what we can PA the bus up stand as one justice away yeah okay I 'm in 120 157 project okay alright so I 've got a mover and a seconder I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried and I 'd like to now move that we move into the public excluded decision for all the reasons listed on the agenda and for item 34 for Lea scales CFO crashing City Holdings to be President item 35 insurance so she 's great brazen speaker to be present and item 42 the transfer of assets and Housing Opportunity Kate Cooney CEO Alex Skinner board chair and Lea scales CFO CHL but the other former two of o-tar Community Housing Trust and all of the reasons I set out on the on the agenda so I 'll move they 're sitting there by Andrew or actually you know maybe she 'll Tim good yeah yeah I just want my vote recorded against 41 42 and 43 plays significant public interest that they should be done in public link is depart transfer show that on the on the minutes and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know it 's carried now we 're going to adjourn for morning tea and there should be a trolley available and it 's being brought into the so we 'll start looking in ten minutes well done well done you _"

army obligations required to bring your infrastructure back to that previous quote state so those projects are incorporating in on campaign obviously at a time that is you 've got a limit to the size

next finally 35 projects everything is it any opportunity for additional redundancy yeah because we use yeah this one no no this no it is relevant it is relevant and that 's why poplars to the to the

attention given the winding up of the fund I would have to go over there those of you young poets are our standards and quite big pond station the opportunity but betterment in any of those is an action-packed very very limited I have to go exactly see what 12 are outstanding at this point in time my understanding is that a lot of pump stations West water pump stations those sorts of things that the reason that our delays because we have to get delays and specialist equipment coming in to connect them off otherwise they were walking finished so the opportunity really of doing things in their streets go at 00 on this we 've got spirit back into the pyramid where be more cost-effective for us to get another contract around around opens contractor free world and that 's what again so we 've got master plan sitting there we are looking at ways we can integrate all those in as we go through with our cable program so the to you is because they wouldn 't pay for much of the once you no no I must hit list I think previously well recently yeah we can provide that again take the bus that came out a week ago if you 're busy on scene but it 's just my understanding well but I mean I think that that 's not unreasonable just to to circulate the list of the remaining school projects but but I mean the truth is is that shutting this down as a fund doesn 't actually stop us from bringing it back for a specific decision I mean we heard before around the pump station that there was an element of betterment and so I think people have moved away from using the fund because that has so little left in it that they they just wrap it up into the cost of the total program now but if there are opportunities were them what remains of skirt I mean I I don 't know that the hug would

that I mean the streets of a collect donations they 've got so many Asheville holes in them that that you actually might what you might actually do is actually seal it properly well it is again some of the only the defect staff but actually it might require additional funding so but I appreciate that s fund you know that doesn 't preclude us from doing that but I think if we can get the lost of the projects that 's the first starting point time is 157 closures of having long-term practical compilations and I imagine some of those will be the ones that John is talking about without go back in the Jews were insurmountable faded into the scaleable program to go back in before they those defects all that we fix before they get transferred candidates run to council they go into practical

decide on whether there is or isn 't a delegation at the time of the other piece of work has completed because that might inform that no no but there were there was a delegation the last time of a hundred thousand and there is a desired I mean this one wouldn 't have been well in September 2017 it 's up there obviously they 're going to wonder it also appear that that there shouldn 't be a limitation so um when they review potentially inform that though so it 's hard to say well be but I 'm just trying to get to a solution here so no I 'm okay with that um yeah can I just check Macrina and see how often we get ones that are over a hundred and fifty yeah I don 't like them graphic you see I 'm on the report yeah that it gives the previous sort of grants for this year most of them are under hundred but we usually get at least two or three that would be over over hundred yeah there 's one here 's one hundred and seventeen sales today and in 127 make a little bit and they often in in the past here they 've been over one hundred and fifty I mean those 150 just going to see most of the decisions done anyway because if that 's the case Dean yeah I think on with inflation yes the costs are going up so it 's a good idea to to anticipate what 's coming in because we get we get such a wide variety we get we get grants right down into a few thousand right up to the the multiple hundreds of thousands so I say on average yes about probably three two or three a year would be over that figure yeah one of the other things tonight as well is that the committee if they did hit the delegation the full delegation but they felt uncomfortable about it they could always refer it to Council why not keep it then I personally are and I know there 's move by Yanni so if I just speak to that I understand that we have allocated a pot of money for this purpose I do think that the Uni is account so there is that responsibility or expectation that that final say will probably sit with Council there so I 'm not I 'm not saying this Jews with lack of trust with the committee far from it but I feel that just you know good governance is that you want to have those checks and balances there would almost lean towards a hundred thousand as the original recommendation just simply because if you look at the history of this there are only two that are over there so I don 't think that 's going to be particularly onerous I think it gives the delegation to you know four ninety five percent of the applications are going to have delegated authority there but I think that you can 't just just have nothing I think that there needs to be some focus so whether it 's 100 or 150 if you do 150 then nothing will come to Council but I think you need a three sholden I would actually be comfortable with a hundred it would mean that two of the ones that are in six figures plus get sign-off from Council and I think that 's appropriate right I 'd agree with Jamie I think a hundred thousand seems quite reasonable to me I mean as Mike pointed out I mean the cycleways is of a much bigger piece of care and much rather that came back to council than this type of stuff which drop my upbeat or what a while yeah I think that 's really mean just in terms of what I remember coming through a lot of stuff is it 's generally under 100,000 well if we if we are if we 're going to review it at the time that we 've received the report then and I 'm happy with that alright so we 'll leave it as it was yeah she support the hundred and fiftieth only the committee 's perfectly capable of making the decision as a council would and that gives us a level of comfort and it means that these things have to come back here so I support 150 will do want to move that it be amended to read 150 so we 've got those and your second that right okay so we 've got we 've got whip no but we 've now got a resolution that we 're capable of putting so the amendment has been made Pauline Cotter second FL clearwater that the some be increased to a hundred and fifty this is an amendment so it 's just separate to delegate the responsibility to a committee to go over the detail of these applications 150 is pretty reasonable I think kind of like real litigating issues like tip tea tree cottages we 've already started today is a case in point where in fact council don 't really need to do their a good committee should be able to II trusted to do the work and there is a that 's why I 'm supporting of a limit of 150,000 thank you right yeah so um I mean I 'm happy with ADA 100 150 but given that 150 is on the table happy to support that is you don 't think it 's going to make that bigger difference in the interim because there 's so few applications for over a hundred there actually I think it 's pretty negligible I just wanted to take the opportunity though under number three just to point out that the staff have had been working really hard on a heritage strategy and a heritage vision and just take the opportunity to thank them for that I think the review that 's it should actually align with that work that we 're doing so I just don 't want to put the pressure in terms of September 2017 when if we haven 't finished that strategy work it seems quite hard to do a review of the grants so I hope that we can give staff a little bit of comfort in terms of that flexibility because I think it is important that we take a holistic approach to developing the strategy and obviously funding will be one of the key things that comes up out as part of those discussions the workshops that have already been held that has been an issue that has been raised so yeah but I welcome this grant being made today it 's a shame that the council 's not hearing directly from the people that are behind this restoration but actually it 's it 's a really positive story I think for a very valuable historic asset in our city and there 's a real desire from the people behind it to open that up to their community and to the citizens of the city are complete so I think it 's a really exciting project and I 'm very happy to support it Andrew thank you I 'm reasonably ambivalent as to whether one hundred and one hundred and fifty or a hundred is the right amount certainly taking into account Brendan 's commentary around inflation that probably would point to the hundred and fifty I think it 's important that there is a threshold there somewhere just from the point of view of an application that was larger than 150 thousand would take quite a large proportion of the fund and that 's where we perhaps want to be making a council decision but uncertainly supportive of a delegation going to the committee so that we 're not dealing at council with the kind of things we see in front of us today I 've got full confidence in the committee to do that work and of course the committee is the right place for the detailed question-and-answer session to be held so the committee can be comfortable so on balance uncomfortable 150 and happy to support now so I 'm just getting the hundred thousand and the amendment is now in the name cotta and clear water and it 's the amendment that changes the number from a hundred to one hundred and fifty right so ole boy oh sorry I 'm just thinking that this is a useful discussion to be having in terms of live streaming because it actually raises the profile of our heritage buildings and if we have a higher threshold then maybe this won 't happen yeah all right well I will put the amendment first those in favor of the amendment say aye those opposed say no um I can 't tell don 't I think I don 't care that 's carried sharpen those in favor of the amendment raise your hand those opposed so you want there you want that man G East Galloway Goff qq1 was it okay that you were the only one on that side okay so um so that is carried I 'll put the motion now all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank

    "text": "um next one is 21 heritage incentive grant approval for tuck tree it 's just we 've already passed my nuts here Mike yes yes okay there 's the one of the additional routing under three and Strauss okay so so there 's been some changes to this one I noticed that the review of excuse me funding didn 't have a report back and I think that can be somewhat limiting in terms of what we 're trying to achieve so that now reads by September 2017 in order to inform development of the long term plan and it didn 't seem to be an epitope to limit the delegation to a value of 100,000 making the point that you know community boards have substantially higher delegations and I don 't think any of us can recall a a time where we where we declined a recommendation from the committee so I think there 's a degree of comfort around the delegation sorry no just clarify then do you mean that it remained it is what 's here at 100,000 or are we talking about I think it 's wondering in fact though if a figure say like 150,000 so that with their work really large and large applications which might be more contentious and in fact they do come back the full council that 's my only thought yeah it the only thing that you mentioned I don 't disagree with you just saying that I can 't remember time we 've declined them I can 't either but most of the time I think more times are not we sometimes do add bits and pieces or will amend will it mean data Council that 's just my own my only concern is that you know the lot the last one I can remember us doing was even saying could we put on something around there about trimming the trees specs we could see it or can they be part they tell that story so I don 't think that we 've got this quite right I agree we 'd spoken earlier around doing this review I note that it 's there in item three but I think yarny it was that raised a point about perhaps incorporating have a wider look at it because there are a lot of reoccurring things that continue to come up and answer that silly if they continue to come up so we might as well put them in as policy but I 'm just reluctant to give full delegation there until we 've got it right because I don 't think we have got it right yet and it 's not a lack of confidence in that Lizzie it 's just so that we tend to EDD think we visit that after after we have received the review that 's my son we could review the delegation Sarah yeah just a couple of responses I think that the last time we changed things as before the committee was seeing these first and so it was coming straight to Council without a committee recommendation and when we took method trimming the trees and putting a plaque and stuff and I think the committee would probably do that the other thing when I mentioned this first earlier was that it wasn 't for all heritage grants it was for the huge incentive grants that are much broader with large amounts of money and the landmark ones for example so it was actually for number four it straightforward to approve a huge incentive grants that 's the sort of sentence the specific fund that we are dealing with today for these three applications and that 's the one that has the the set limit every year of sort of 700,000 and I 'm really comfortable with each community boards others have you know delegations over you know pots of money that um that are above the hundred thousand and we need to trust our colleagues to just get on with it I mean the interesting thing for me was that the particular heritage incentive grant that we 're being asked to approve today wouldn 't meet the delegation that was proposed by the by the by the committee yeah you know we 'd still have to because it 's a hundred and seventeen thousand a one hundred and you don 't be very happy for the committee to do that so yeah Danny yeah I thought last term I was raised to one hundred I do think that there could be quite contentious ones to come and also that just given the quantum of the fund that anything over that 150 actually should be a full council decision because it would significantly erode the money that could be remaining in it so and also also because it 's actually sometimes good for the forecastle to be aware of those significant buildings so my recommendation would be that we change it to 150,000 I think that 's in line with the advice that we had lost I think there needs to be a the delegations is this for a reason stuff I 've got them everyone here everyone has and I just think no delegation of carp large probably isn 't the way I 'd like to go I 'd support raising it but I think there needs to be something there see the budget or if I support no upper limit obviously as a council we 've set a total envelope for for how much can be spent on these these grants and we 've just recently a delegated decision-making to the ite committee 're talking about here and theories community boards you know the Linwood central he 's got 1.6 million for the Woolston facility those kind of things and we 're happy for the inter to be working on it with a net budget um when we 're not getting you know oversight of every decision that it 's being made so some people change their everything Oh the last Thames was was a hundred thousand years I 'm just wandering into the discussion in fact if we should decide on the limit at the time the review comes through which should be August till September or maybe that this aspect goes back to the committee so the committee are comfortable with the limit that we 're deciding there 's a quite a few different views around the table as to whether we have no upper limit or whether we say heaven 150,000 which it the last one is my own view at the moment all right so let me see how we handle this so let 's let 's do one two and three together yep if we going to stuff oh yeah Brennan I 'm my only question is just around the first one the I just find that the just with the cost with prelim in general in contingency what what actually is there and the only reason I ask that is because contingency I 'm pursuing as team seen but when you 've got a figure which is the highest figure they 're just as general and prelim in general I 'd want a bit more explanation than just general preliminary for the biggest chunk of their money what it what is their premier in general is just the establishment of the site scaffolding or all the items that a contractor needs to to have available on the site the site office you know everything that you can 't necessarily quantify but they have to include in their price okay and the other the other contingency sums to cover and um we and on heritage buildings you will find this virtually every time but when you when you engage into the when you get into the work you 'll find more work than you needed to believe than good segue into the second question and you know normally we 'll do a contingency of team scene is that higher and do you see that often higher and curettage instances like and as the steam ceedric writer it 's normally a standard construction figure so ten percent is about what you would expect yeah bit the other thing to remember anyways is the those those costs when they when they 're put in they are provisional songs so there is the grant is actually paid out on the actual songs the receipts that are there are paid so we it 's better to have a slightly higher amount to make sure you 've got enough cover because more than likely you 'll find more work than you anticipated so the provisional and general sums and contingency sums cover those variable work costs that are almost certain going to happen on a heritage building because it 's not it 's not as clean and clinical as a new build where you know pretty much exactly what you 're going to what you 're going to have to pay and do it a bit why could you ever call it just yeah not one you know what we find is that different different applicants and different contractors of different ways of pricing things so some of them make the PNG as a separate item some of them just put it into the rest of their figures so what what I find is best is rather than staff trying to make up and anticipate what exactly is in those figures it 's better to just put them as they come in but as say the key thing is that the it 's paid the amount of of grandness paid is is on the receipts of the work so it 's the actual costs of what these these provisional sums may may actually leave something in in the pot which is returned to the fund and I was just surprised it is actually nothing about the roof looking at the photo probably the rarest part of it especially the the roof and that doesn 't have any movie actually thing down to the roof and well it may it may look pretty ratty hold it my whole route is it part the charm probably yeah I mean yes it 's odd sometimes the most awful looking parcel there 's a lot of rust on it that Armenia it 's taken quite well to get that rust okay so so we 're all good with arguments one two three so would someone like to move items one two three Sarah Glenn I 'll put that motion all those in favor say

    "text": "and propose busts passenger shelter installation 42 Hereford Street I saw people standing there in the rain yesterday I 'm very much in favor of this yes this is an ED shell bus stop so bus shelter sorry so there 's no cost to council on this one thing that the committee did talk about was because there 's digital advertising on there that would it be possible for staff to investigate council I 'm having use of the digital advertising space or some of it or a portion of it to actually raise our own profile of events or consultations or stuff going on in town so hopefully that will come back to us and so there 's also probably going to be another four or five shelters installed around the city by the end of June including Kilmore Street the airport one so that 's quite pleasing great so that 's moved by every move it seconded by Tara okay Jonnie I was checked like there 's 20 people using this on a day is there any process for us to talk to ad shell about stops that a priority rather than ones that are good just for advertising but maybe not so good for passenger numbers because I personally think would be really good to start having that conversation I know our board our community board has repeatedly put in quests that a bus stop outside things like the disabled persons place and mr. story and it did seem a very small number of people using it there 's a priority so we 've looked at all that I think every community board has those discussions every time a bus shelters going on but there 's a whole lot of conditions and obstacles often around bus shelters including resource consents and hearings some of them can be very expensive I presume this one over here because there was no objections it 's quite a quick and easy one to go and so but what we 're going to do is the issue committee call for a report and a briefing on the whole process as well so we can try and get a handle on do you want to note it in here because I you know one but I think it would be good to get that other work done as well sooner rather than later so that we 're not just approving ones that are good for advertising we 're actually approving ones that actually have a need in terms of the numbers of passengers that don 't have absolutely so this one being cost neutral is probably a good one to just get on with isn 't it yeah so um yeah deal oh no oh yeah just just a really quick um comment on on these it 's very loud today these bus shelters because it 's inside the outside of the delegation of our community board I mean we don 't have a decision-making power over that but I think it would be quite nice to actually just get some sort of update about what 's actually happening around these kind of things that are kind of normal community borne stuff but just like a memo to say hey look this is actually happening with inside your walk because the community board still kind of want to know what 's going on even though it 's metropolitan delegation can that kind of process be put in place could you tell them well I didn 't I didn 't know until we got kind of the report yeah like it as two parking changes and things like that in the inner city which is outside the central board delegation so I suppose that 's probably reasonably easy to give them board an update perhaps for every two or three months of changes in parking in bus stops here yep Oh Glen thank you just a minor but small note continuing the crusade our bus shelters are smoke-free now so that 's part of our extension to our smoking in public places policies so if we could I think obviously this is an important location so let 's just make sure that long as Williams yep um Tim yeah yeah yeah thank you yeah yeah it 's a fit um the smoke-free but is it light with regards to this out of favorite we 're sort of getting away from those we 're proposing to put a bus shelter at 42 here ohrid Street so the longer we debate this the longer they 'll be rating on the roads but there 's not it 's not really relevant to the debate and just stop it I blame you for that and I actually blame myself because I switched off and forgot to pull you I don 't meet you it again is anyone else got did you have a question sorry if it wasn 't a question it was more of a quip that if the bus stops are smoke-free most the buses won 't be allowed to stop me there is also a out of order so there you go Mike so I just wanted to note if you have a look at the the diagram of a run 6.2 awhile back I had a walk around with people from the disability sector I mean one of the problems with people with Keynes 's is the gap between the glass petition and the the ground actually caused an issue for them because we 're now walking along with it came they didn 't see it to write to the last second didn 't pulled that up and they 're going to actually look to close that gap and start retrofitting all the ones existing ones so to remove that obstacle which is quite a good progress cool alright I will put a mover in a second Dave I know I 'm gonna use oh here put a seconder who second do it Sierra that 's right Sarat in front down the bottom yep cool I 'll put

    "text": "item number 15 porting would you like to introduce that and move that yes I 'll move it the sum is regarding disposal of the lien that 's already been acquired under the flood intervention policy and so it means that the internet the infrastructure can be taken off the land and the land can be released for sale so that means that any new dwellings built on the Atlanta to comply with the new regulations it means that the council can actually recoup some of the the money that we put into this to allow people to move on it 's basically yep seconded by Mike Davidson any questions any discussion actually do want to say something about it because the thing the thing about you know there 's been a lot of discussion about the impact of the earthquake on land and the people who were made the most vulnerable after the earthquakes were people who didn 't require a building consent to repair their properties but had fallen below the levels that you would build at in terms of flood management areas and so this policy of very vulnerable to the flooding and the particular areas that they were prior to the work being done that land can now go on the market and the new properties that are built there so that the empty land that we sell and the new properties that are built there will be built above the floor levels that are required for building in these areas and I think that 's a one-one for the city and it still worries me that we have many properties that are below the flood management area and that 's something that the council is going to have to continue to address over over the next many years as as you know various elements of you know sea level rise and things like that take effect so so I think this is a one-one it 's a very good outcome it is right yeah Lee I wanted to sorry I should have clarified this um I was just thinking in terms of our needs for this land if like the sale process is not the disposal process that we would normally go through and we lease that we would put them back on the mark that once the work had been completed okay I just wanted whether we 'd considered transfer to other parties or sell to other parties who might have a need for it before we actually made the decision to go to market to sell we might we made this decision really broken so can I get through Lee and I can certainly recall that at the time we made decisions around those properties I think the point that is being made is that um things have changed some severe degenerative should we review these properties and the light of them where they 're located do we need to make a zero disparate may need to make the decision today don 't think so please for piously there 's nothing yeah I guess there 's no urgency in that councils already bought four of them and we 're in the process of buying another two and contracts are out for those the sort of idea behind progressing this as quickly as possible was to recoup money spend but the policies more social this land for any purpose to that you 've got to understand that these are the four properties piece of the boundaries of the neutral area so the implications for them may be limited yeah and we still would need to probably approve one to actually enable the twenty to improve the removal of the dwellings on the property but then it also sees to consider retaining non habitable structures such as garages on the property if these are considered to be sensory so already and that 's good because they 're not covered by the floor level rules yeah but also we 've got um other papers in the report you know around you know we 've still got the issue of the Housing Trust so and that wasn 't known at the time that we did this and the original resolution so I can 't see any anywhere where it says we would resell them so I thought you know we did going through we absolutely did well it 's not on the resolutions and I can see now it was it was an in terms of the that some of the cost would be recouped by the selling of the properties and but we 're going to face that cost anyway with the Housing Trust so whether we do it through this or through another means but I guess that stuff can just take that on board but you know I I personally think it would be good to just think about that it 's actually neutral terms of cost to council on hippies so this the value of it 's very selling would be beer land basically so it 's probably not going to be just be section values ultimately it 's not a huge e I understand that but we 've just acquired Linwood village and then the Housing Trust is acquired and it 's got needs somewhere to put those properties yeah but that it may not be that that land is suitable because they don 't have the floor levels you 'd have to build up the land in that case which is an RMA resource consent requirement and it makes developing houses very expensive on that sort of land I must say unfortunate or not but I we probably need a report if we wanted to go down the Avenue but I must say the committee didn 't discuss that as an option upon the day but we were quiet because this was the intention this was always the intention was to buy and sell sell because it was an intervention to help these people um yeah okay all right well I 'm I 'm going to put the motion I think that there sometimes things do change but I think in terms of these properties the amount of time that would have to be taken to evaluate each of them for the suitability in terms of for example social housing would be it would hold things up too much and I think the the sale of these properties that the funding for that actually comes off the cost of the the whole of the flood flood drainage recovery program for their area so it 's been incorporated into the packet it 's been incorporated into the budget for that purpose all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor carried and _"
