one is going to be just a real basic core exercise so just keeping those little core muscles going it 's really good for just day-to-day basic life it helps you during your other training and some of us are doing it for vanity for that lovely little six-pack joke all right you don 't need any equipment for this one although it 's really good to have like a map or something soft that you have so you 've got to look at Yoga map or training mat that home going Brown just dig it up pop it on me don 't even a lot of space all of the exercises are gonna be done on there as always just make sure you 've gotten injuries or any concerns or new medical reasons or if you 're pregnant that you have consulted someone about it and that you are needed I will let you know as well try to work them into the exercises so fire core exercises today we 're going to do them each at 40 seconds per exercise you 've got ten seconds to start on to the next exercise okay how are we going to do it I 'm going to do the fresh mount with you with my timer at the end of the video or at the end of the workout you have a minute rest you replay it and then you do it all again so it 's like a circuit style okay now on my time we 're going to go from Belle to Belle I 'll be talking during the exercise so if I 'd stop the exercise you just keep crawling with it I might just explain a different modified version of it or maybe some safety pointers okay and again if at any point you feel this is a bit tricky or you 're not sure you have any concerns rather stop that particular exercise and just move on to the next one if you know about one also beginners do them three rounds but if you 're a bit more advanced or you want to challenge yourself you can go four rounds or five rounds all right have fun guys so first things first just get our timer ready but about six seconds to stop so you get down nice and low alright and we 're going to do some bunny hops so just going to go from one side to the other side you don 't have to do the whole one you can do like middle to side just making sure that the core is nice and tight and the bump is not too high up in the air keep their wrists underneath the shoulders so that they nice and stable if you want you can go a little bit slower and then as you get stronger and used to the exercise you can do limit bit quicker all right next one it is supply of push-ups so you can do the maybe the full version or the modified version with the knees on the floor so again find your stuff my straight body the other side get down nice and low use that core to get you up make sure the wrist is nice underneath the shoulder and support it and the bum is not coming up too high well done we 're going to give our arms a bit of a rest now so we lying on our back we 're going to do some leg raises so this right make sure that their lower back is nice and support it on the floor if you 're unable to but that 's not too high just put your fingers down at the lower back or like myself I prefer my hands on top if it is a bit tricky for you to do both legs at the same time that 's not a problem you can just do one leg at a time making sure both legs meet at the top keeping that lower core engaged and that belly button drawing straight through to the ground make sure the legs are nice and straight we 're going to stay down here for this next exercise this is our B toe touches do going to start down low touch the top some people can get their feet up a little bit higher that 's okay but if you can undo bands down here that 's also fine look completely up off the ground into that v-shape if you can go faster do that just trying to do as many reps as you can each time you do exercises all right mix up some walking plank so we 're rolling back onto our front a built in plank it 's pretty much up right onto your plank down to your elbows and then up onto the arms down to the elbows making sure that the wrists are support straight underneath the shoulder base and the bum is not up too high and the body is nice and straight you want to have as little as possible rotation in the hip coming up and down keep that core nice and clean Paige the feet slightly further apart the last one this is on our side plank so I 'm gonna have to do either one on each side or one round on each slide so hip and up twist up drop the hip up so you can do 20 seconds on one arm swap round do the other side or if you 're out throwing lots around four rounds you can do forty seconds per one if you find you 're unable to keep the knees up you can bend them that 's not too late hi guys I definitely felt that I hope you guys and if you 're doing a couple of rounds I can assure you you 'll feel it I 'm hoping that you staying safe I hope that your fandom in these videos just doing something is better than doing nothing okay it helps us keep saying it helps us just feel fresh and like we 've accomplished something so don 't just sit on them on the couch and eat all the trippy 's have a bit of fun this only takes about 20 minutes it 's better than nothing see you like [Music] _"

    "text": "hi guys my name is Yvonne I 'm one of the trainees here at des Redford we 've been putting together a few videos for you to use at home in this crazy time I hope you guys are all the same safe this exercise today they hit exercise that we 're doing does have some equipment but you can use it literally any type of way that you have so if you 've got a loose kettlebell we 've got a dumbbell or play or anything a child whatever you can use do that if you don 't have access to the weights it 's not a problem at all most of these exercises you could probably still do just with like household stuff anyway but just like we we always ask you if you have any concerns any medical reasons and injuries pregnancies anything like that just make sure that you have consulted someone before you do these exercises I will try my best to do modified versions of the exercises as far as we can now each exercise we 're doing them for 40 seconds and then this is going to work each I 'll do the first round with you so you just follow me we 're gonna have our timer on and then at the end you 're going to just replay the video to where the exercises stuff and you 're just going to do a couple of rounds of that now if you 're a beginner I would recommend three rounds really good starting point if you feel you 're a bit more advanced or you want to challenge yourself four to five rounds are absolutely fine remember you can do these things as many times as you want to exercise this fantastic mental health and just keeping you sane during this time it gets your heart rate up especially with the hip classes and it just gets you moving okay sweating is good I 'm already sweating so have fun with it okay now today I 'm going to use a mat and I 'm going to show you the exercises done with a kettlebell or with eight they 'll so whatever you feel like that 's okay okay bish you can one I 'm going to use the dumbbell the kettlebell however you can do it with a dumbbell throughout I 'll mention it and I 'll demonstrate the exercises as we go might make a few safety points so just look out for them okay have fun I 've got about ten seconds before we start if you can make sure you get one of those timer apps if you want to do this by yourself or like I say you could just do the videos now ZZZ all right first one sport and pray so we go down a little and we 're pushing up those killer bells up all the way to the top now I haven 't done my warmup on the video however best is always to warm up before the time okay so couple of jump squats a couple of jumping stars just a few little stretches that swing at the arm anything that gets the body warmed up you usually only need about two to three minutes before you start your work map even if it 's just doing a quick little run around get down this I 'm going to use out dumbbell now Russian twist speed up making in my speech shape with the body and make sure you twist now if you finding it tricky with the feet up that 's okay just put the feet down make sure that the back is still nice and straight you don 't have to use a weight it 's pretty for your beginner you can just do the exercise without the way your ma no problem these work the obliques which are the little sides on Furcal and gives you those 60 little lines alright now for some more legs so I 'm going to grab my kettlebell again for this one but you can use any one no problem so we 're going to just step back and as you step back you lift the weight up make sure that that back leg is nice and far and that knee goes down throughout each exercise make sure that the core is tight the shoulders are relaxed all right enough with the whites for a bit next one running on the spot and make sure that the knees are tucked in so I need you to do ten little sprints and jump you don 't need a lot of space for these exercises so don 't worry if your time to pick your spices too tiny all right now that the heart rates up he 's out of breath again we 're dropping down load and slowing things down they get into your position to peg we 're gonna do ten shoulder taps make sure the body is nice and straight once you 've done ting you drop down into a push-up and you do it again you can drop the meat and do the push-up if you need to and if you need to you can stay down here for the shoulder taps alright I 'm going to use my weight again for this one these are single leg deadlift so you can use it 's about or it down belt but make sure you 've got something so one leg straight bring the weight down bring it back back leg up this one 's for stability but it also works the don 't fall alright swap legs again best to do these exercises slightly slower concentrate on the movement get down as low as you can with that backless leg lifting up as high as you can all right because I love babies so much we have to do some burpees but with a little bit of jumping so first month six lateral jumps and then a Burpee all the way down to the top if you 're unable to jump that 's okay just do a quick little step that 's absolutely fine all right we 've got one more to do this time again some more triceps you can use the weight or whatever you have just bring it behind your elbows up giving that core nice and tight bring that weight all the way up to the top if you 've got really light weight do them one arm at a time this one 's a bit too heavy so best to get a nice heavy Sun thing making sure that elbows are pointing out to the top all right now you get a minute rest so in breath rewind I 'm going to do it all again I hope you know that fun today try and do these as many times as you can like I said before this is really good just to keep us sane just to give us something to do during the day first thing in the morning when you wake up if you need a break from homeschooling or you just feel like I need to do something I just need to feel better the more we work out the better it is it just gets all of that excess anxiety stress make sure both of energy whatever it is that you 've got in you it just helps you to relax a little bit you 'll sleep better you 'll feel better just do it stay safe guys stay at home as best

    "text": "thank you very much mayor so yes my name is Andrew Nemo I 'm president of the Institute of Architects in New South Wales also partner in Lars Nemo architects now we 've got two speakers tonight the second speaker has had some difficulties as in his aeroplane from Brisbane was cancelled but he 's we are gonna use technology and he will be speaking by smoke and mirrors and most we will still have the presentation so please be patient so what if you haven 't been to one of these talks before the way we normally do them is two speakers around about 20 minutes each and then we 'll have a Q&A session we will sit down here I 'll usually kick off the Q&A session with some questions and then I open up to the floor and encourage you all to ask everything you 've ever wanted to ask at that heritage so without further ado I might have mainly to come up and start our talks so thank you so much for coming to hear me talk today there are a lot of factors working to such an extent that many see heritage as a dirty word conservation may appear to be all about controls and what you may or may not be allowed to do however we hope to present the case that heritage can inspire good design rather than present as an obstacle to it Suzanna price and I have a heritage of consulting and design business called modern heritage matters our partnership has been bonded by a mutual belief that Sydney 's built environment gains much from the preservation of its mix of building styles our aim is to celebrate the ability of great contemporary design to maintain and enhance existing structures and to add more to that mix this one I have approached a career in heritage conservation in a fairly atypical manner I have a banking analyst background however following kids I marked on a number of property renovations as host Susannah it was during this period that we became aware of for how difficult this process can actually be when you start changing a building and updating its functionality where do you stop sadly it 's often easier to and the money restoring it I remember taking months with an architect designing a sympathetic contemporary addition to a weatherboard farmhouse when our vision came to fruition we were a little appalled when one of the builders came up and asked us when the old part was to be demolished just remind me if I don 't do the photos being in the renovation game brought interviewed a large number of residential buildings we are losing sadly often what replaces these buildings lack quality in both materials used and their design as Australians we hold a lot of a large percentage of our wealth in property and we rely on capital gains water views are highly valued and the tall of the building that best of those glimpses can be a block of land is often worth more to a developer than a house owner as they can demolish the existing building and build multiple houses on the site sadly government intervention cannot solely be the answer to this problem they do not have the funds and politically they do not always have the appetite the community remains an important busy and they have competing priorities we need to make heritage call again so owners want to keep these buildings I completed a master 's of heritage conservation and around this time Susannah returned from a 15 year stint in London bringing with her wonderful design skills our business started with us creating a website with a large educational component primarily we thought to support an advocacy role but the website led to the inquiries our business grew in the past four years we 've had over 50 clients mainly residential encompassing over 15 local council areas some clients have heritage listings at local or state level but some simply old they have old buildings that they want to have sympathetic design solutions for so why does our built heritage matter I would like to use a broad definition of build heritage not just those recognized for listings but also character buildings for any period why is heritage conservation a good thing heritage plays a very important part in our sense of well-being and quality of life old buildings are unique interesting and often inspiring this is what we feel as we see in Paddington Hunter 's field line Commerce feel here they encourage people to think of themselves as custodians and as part of a wider community there are areas where history and elements such as the building style and streetscapes create a cohesive sense of place that is worth protecting this lovely Street we 're in now whose relics Early 's Church Civic buildings in beautiful 19 and 20th 20th century houses this tonic environment is a proven source of benefit to local economies particularly through tourism many businesses particularly food-related but often businesses such a small startup strike best in these settings a nice example here is couldyou pavilion which has long been a feature of the coogee beach front in 2014 it was purchased by the Mirabelle group and reopened as a restaurant of bar complex the result is a revitalized area where a successful adaptation of an interesting building has become both the community-driven venue and a tourist attraction heritage buildings provide a good local educational resource the rocks is an area of huge historical significance and is often described as Sydney 's outdoor museum area provides an important resource which gives an immediate appreciation about early European history it is hard to believe that in the 60s there was a proposal for the area to be demolished the plans only shelved as a result of community protests supported by trade unions and to think we may have had an area full of brutalist style serious buildings which I 'm actually supporters it has been said that the greenest building is the building or rebuilt now this is a concept that is seriously underplayed and it is hard to understand why a recent study coordinated by the preservation green lab and office of the National Trust concluded that building reuse almost always offers environmental savings over demolition and new construction moreover it can take between 10 and 80 years for a new energy-efficient building to overcome through more efficient operations than negative climate change impacts that were created during the construction process there are often there are various theories of course older buildings tend to have be built with high quality materials such as hardwoods that may no longer exist they were generally built by buildings that age gracefully experts don 't masons and metal workers were more available and affordable in these times a related problem provocative is the fact that developers often use fairly bland designs to appeal to the widest possible audience frequently using lesser quality materials with no aim for longevity and finally demolish buildings can never people back and we can never be certain what we will value in the future it is so important that experts assess the importance of older and save them fashions come and go television shows like Mad Men bought attention back to the mid-century building 's brickwork is coming back into fashion at a time when so many interesting brick buildings have been rented over or demolished look around your suburb and you will see how many of these old character buildings are being lost authoring the bill makes faith of your area forever this image shows a building done from house a Federation arts and crafts building that was to be demolished by the state government in 2011 it was eventually Heritage listed and saved following considerable local community backlash but how does a lot of detail here as I imagine we have a range of knowledge in the room but basically in New South Wales there are two types of statutory heritage listings statement monocle the basic difference lies in the approval process controls for state listed properties are more prescriptive and focus more on retaining fabric and reversibility these buildings often come with comprehensive conservation management plans to guide their changes there are also a number of non-statutory teas such as the National Trust register Institute of Architects which play an important role in alerting us to the potential heritage value of a place in New South Wales the heritage significance or the reason why building on area area is listed is determined according to seven criteria which I 've listed there so that I don 't have to read them all out to the majority of locally listed houses that we work with tend to have a combination of historic aesthetic and representative values a large part of our job is spent preparing heritage impact statements which must be submitted with das the Heritage listed items properties and conservation areas areas the perception is often that we can provide you with a list of what you can and cannot do however the process is not so straightforward our job is to assess whether significance or the of the building or area lies and to limit the impact of any proposed work on this value as mentioned earlier it 's not just a single building that 's listed a heritage conservation area can be a precinct streetscape group of buildings landscape suburb or town with particular heritage values that give it a distinct identity these values include historical origins subdivision patterns consistency of building materials or age within these areas there are the three levels of importance contributory neutral or intrusive contributory buildings will retain a high proportion of original features and alterations are generally reversible these buildings are considered to be an important resource for the interpretation and understanding of the history and development pattern of that area neutral buildings do not contribute or detract they may also be new synthetic development or included six world within a streetscape it is generally preferable to keep these buildings and restore the for appropriate new development intrusive due to inappropriate scale bulb setback roof treatment a typical garage arrangement the materials okay now design we often come across the attitudes such as don 't worry we 're happy to go straight to court what do we have to keep them why can they tell us what to do when it 's our house locally listed buildings which are the majority of our clients have greater scope for change therefore more risk with poor renovations however we would argue that a good design which embraces cancer controls will be more likely to increase the value of a property that are poorly thought out animation so how do we achieve a good outcome we 've compiled a short list of what we consider to be important rules to consider during the design process for both restoration and new work good design has its roots in the understanding of your style of building the values in a modernist house built in the 50s differ to those of a terraced house the federation era was not the Victorian era clients are often amazed when we point to their building unfortunately style details can be hard to obtain retail stores use heritage as a generic name for anything of a traditional style the image shown here is around LED light window a new tempered or installed in a 1920s beach house at some stage the glass have been replaced with what could only be described as shallow spring probably because LED light was out of fashion the temptation was to go in free contemporary interpretation as the building has been altered and it 's not listed however we decided it was important that we do our research to choose a design that was typical at the 1920s and these LED light windows have a full range when installed it completed the decide and reinstated the drama of the entranceway a labor of love for us has been a property we 've been working on for a number of years now in coogee this beautiful building constructed in 1886 by timber merchants is one of the few grand Victorian residences remaining in coogee and is notable for its elaborate firm style decoration as part of this journey with is or to face it is a great case study for most of our design laws for us it was important to keep as much of the historic fabric as possible repair sections of fabric rather than replacing the whole as hugely tempting as it may be there 's no reason why our buildings should not look old there may be no reason to repair cracks that are structurally sound to recoat worn services or to remove patina or even to excessively clean services where the coating of time is not destructed nor concealing detail there was much talk Akagi about cleaning and fixing the original tessellated time foyer but we settled upon doing as little as possible Suzanna referenced the original pattern when renovating the adjoining bathroom choosing a pared back design a lovely juxtaposition of new alongside the old the aged and in some places broken original for we argue allows for a beautiful tension that 's the old owner the correction of structural problems such as leaning walls or beams or uneven floors may cause damage or the loss of important fabric it is usually better to sufficient to restore the structural stability of the building use traditional techniques and materials where appropriate and use appropriately experienced and skilled contractors do your research ask the right questions anyone can add the word heritage into their business name these photos show the response to a dangerous structural issue we had in the roof that coogee well-qualified at heritage engineers and builders reached a solution with minimal impact on the original fabric in these types of situations we are vulnerable to misinformation take your time to research the alternatives if alterations must be made to important building fabric there should be as reverse as possible for example if brooms have to be divided use lightweight walls which can be later removed if there are previous alterations these may also contribute to the building significance and therefore should be respected emphasis should not necessarily always be placed on one period unless it is much more significant this is an example of a house in Darlinghurst that was originally built around 1860 another building layer was added in this area when a lot of the houses were converted into boarding houses was materially altered in 1918 when it was turned into four flags and this way has been officially recognized in its narrative significance the early context or setting is generally part of the building significance new intrusions into the setting should at the very least be respectful and sympathetic this client was hoping to get a large brick granny flat into the rear garden of a lovely listed Victorian weather board we guided them I 'm not quite sure how successfully had to respond to the materials of the original to allow the existing to retain visual primer mass here is our beautiful coogee building the loss of curtilage for large suburban or ant houses is a good reason why councils are generally very anti subdivision of heritage sites it 's looking very shining out there in the corner no no we are not architects but part of our web sites aim is to feature what we consider to be positive heritage outcomes using contemporary design the following slides help us illustrate how renovation guidelines a new work can be used successfully there are so many architects doing wonderful work feature them all so this is a good example of allowing the original building to remain the hero potential additional the addition is lightweight and similar in height to the original picture the new roof of width of walls and columns reference the old mission-style while making no attempt to compete with it when we decide to renovate a property we leave heritage until last repeatedly we 're asked to provide reports to council addressing plans that have been designed without any heritage input this creates delays and very often disappointment we have started to offer design briefs where we come in early to assess the feasibility of proposed works the aim is to collaborate with architects in order to achieve the best outcome learning about the history of the house makes people appreciate more about what to keep we would far prefer to say what could be done then be brought in later to say what cannot be done one of our favorite jobs was in Penrith where we assisted a restauranteur to create a stream within a Heritage listed Victorian Gothic building we were also able to guide that woods he got the result he wanted and expressed amazement that had gone so smoothly we believe his expectations were so well managed that he forgot all the restrictions that we we had opposed upon him you can see are these these views come from a passion to preserve what is remaining of our built heritage as outlined today there are a lot of factors working against us these issues are rarely black and white but we remain positive and attempt to make make a difference wine after house at a time

    "text": "hey Brandi right together hello everyone sorry I can 't_''_13.13 be there in person the weather 's conspiring against us two blocks down but we have technology so hopefully this goes well often seen lots more programs the inherent activity when it comes to anything associated with heritage being dealing with plans the planning office the detailing or construction techniques require the undertone is always that often you 're inviting trouble and consequently one of the mains that when the proponents of the program achieves their desired outcomes heritage is not a down stuffy it 's not a straitjacket stifling opportunity I don 't believe that consumers are more aware and probably more informed about what they may achieve and as a result are more confident to engage in these types of structures we can jump onto the next slide when it comes to heritage buildings it is ready to see the developer societies where only the front elevation is retained that you build in instead of behind and likewise simply for considered both character replicas appear to be underway Minnesota 's heritage overlays and heritage buildings have been raised inform the design response and should be considered in the same money that orientation to property in corridors and solid gaming are considered his presence can provide opportunity context character materiality and texture to which one can complement or counter in the interpretation for creating contemporary spaces to illustrate a piece and what can be achieved I 'm getting presented project we 've completed a couple years ago next slide number seven gravel street is one of a pair of 120 year old city terrace houses of masonry construction each sided on lost land measuring to support my now ex-wife the Heritage status noted the buildings this is a 2-story semi-detached carrots in the anglo-dutch Federation style dating from 1898 to 1899 originally named ocean view the property is listed as heritage item with the local heritage significance its front portion is two stories and the rear is a series of single-story additions accommodating in the photographs and vice versa next edition enclosing the MS identifiable features of this building style painted brick facade the brick parapets a slavery twin double hung windows the decorative arch moldings and small cantilever in the in its history number seven is being modified by the live off the balcony the replacement of the ice queen dose and the application of a textured redneck OG to the masonry next slide our clients brief was fairly common in us with we have an out sale you run down two bedroom house that just doesn 't function the way you need to to suit our lifestyle doesn 't have the minimum level of amenity instinctive of a home of this day and age construction for their of the proposed works included the desire for a kitchen living laundry and full bathroom on the on the ground floor level and then on the upper level to add two bedrooms and a full bathroom as well in addition to the special at once the clients also want to look still front of the property next slide immediately life is much easier when you have a client already committed to working with the existence of exhaling in speeches our response is always project specific tailored to the clients requirements and the constraints and opportunities supported by the site much the dislike to death property and as usual these other differences of opinion however they did reveal an agreed admiration and respect for the usual part of the home as well as an excessively strong desire for an insightful and a shower that honestly people see the back of the house very in the distance at the back of the original portion of the home and in the lean-to issues culminating with the fiber and fiberglass backs we jump onto the next slide this this like it shows us a little bit of the work during construction they 're going in to protect the when I pass the details down the corridor and through the arches jump onto the next line operating accordance to the clients was the part beside restoration as well aware the sixties interventions were an obvious with the remainder up to detail and doing no fate fortunately for us we had a point of reference just next door at number five or Adams use it to confirm details proportions and use to imitate moldings just in that slide there you can see number five there in sixties additions where we 've we 've gone for the Queen modernist look remaining developing breaking out the French door was to insert a little double-hung window and then that nice retained you 're looking down at the front did you plant in the whitey next slide archival research revealed that there was no existing records or images or of ocean view however references or the buildings as that could be found in the neighboring servers these examples were formed form part of our heritage division we 've got here on the left is raffling stream from a junction and on the right is whatever you in the library and you can see similar detailing happening within in each of these terraces to house next slide the facade works included stripping back to the render and textured paint reinstating the top pointed masonry and removal of the previously digit windows and in those photos that you get a a sense of how thick that rendered you know work was and the joy that the contractor had in chipping that away to the dimensionally before and grinding out some of the with the little details at the at the base of the arch the textured paint on there which almost caused us you to lose the detail and then wear a couple of hours of work with the Dremel browser reveal that back to its original form next line reforming the double swing between double-hung windows was significant part of them it works forming up the decorative moldings which involve taking templates from the ages probably reinstating the upper level balcony reinstalling the French doors to the balcony and repair work to the slate roofing which eventually they 're just allegedly it 's a complete replacement for the week 's front of the property included the revealing of police tone stairs and paving concrete stretching was uncovered and also restoration of the sandstone fencing and the water density but here you can see our guys here installing masonry to start forming up the between double hung windows and then creating their forms and using them normal materials traditional materials are supposed to do next slide please turning our attention to the interiors we identified with front rooms as being of a their current functions they also maintain much the original character in detail the content of warlords the definitely skirtings definitely cornices and trims original doors and fan lines than the original fireplace the back to dreams were little cozier to to the installation of a very steep narrow stair and after much debate around the values of retaining these original details versus safety I just decided to remove this dead as dead this presented the challenge of where the position the new step but in that it also provided us with an option leaf here you see the the ground floor plan on the top there 's the original plan in highlighted the original portion of the home and the rep line indicated the series of additions that were removed and on the lower plan again he blew the original home and then proposed addition next line which is this is a great opportunity to talk about a plan that just a challenge with terraced houses that you set sausages true from rooms the long corridor was the blank side walls the openings at the ends typically results in dark home to address this we treated the addition as a portion separate to the original building has provided us a number of benefits on the upper level it provided separation between the master bedroom and the new these veteran additions it allowed us to create a light well to bring natural light and ventilation deep within the building plan it allow us to transition across the floor plate and the break up of the long corridor but most importantly it allowed us to gain to again engage with images on each portion of the home as a result one is aware of where the heritage component of the home starts at the front gate and where it ends on entering the circulation zone this transition zone like well became the location grab you stare and as such allowed us to intimately engage with the reader of the original building each and every time he transitioned through the levels of the property or moved through the plan allowing us to appreciate the detail next one again either here you can see on the top there the in blue home with then were removed and then the new addition to the property next slide it 's just further illustrates the same you know red we 've got the addition blue the original and the void apart between the two which is our circulation area forming our light well the separation between the two parts next slide this image isn 't the corridor people picking up the existing detailing in the arches the restored original timber floors daiquiri skin illnesses as you can see the impact of the light well at the end of the corridor rather than being dark there 's quite low light spilling into that space well on this local store your attention towards the end of the corridor on the right hand side we see BJ timber lines introduced into the property to as a break from the original fabric this was installed whether the stair was removed but the v-j material still related to definitely bought that previously lined the stairs here 's the the front lower ring missing ring much of additional details of the property within the the address purchases whirring change cornices the art writing and the reverse angle reinstating between double my windows still made those original features including them they the door Muslim and fan lights over next slide to the positioning the circulation zone as the transition between the old and new is a practice we often use in our designs and when extending were added to a property in Brisbane where we operate most thing a town plant typically refers to characterized as opposed to parity terms and we often use this approach when extending a workers cottage it allows us to step back from the original home to appreciate it and it also allows the home to illustrate the story on its development this is not a project we did where you can see the back end of a worker 's college and it 's French doors originally dick something like that but an addition to be put in there and we 've created a stare circulation zone between that and the addition allowing us then to understand where the original property stops and where the new property started next slide this is an image taken at the end of to the addition not you can see the hint of the BJ wall to your right as has also the scare and in that area which is literally the center of the house bathed in light due to that well that 's there the next slide this is in the addition looking back towards the entry you can see the light well there directly left hand side and still a middle to the right hand side beyond the default coming away from the television you can see the original corridor that 's the front door next line again closer peek so here in the small image is what was the second bedroom with the original stair protruding human and the VGA linings used that concealed instead and what we did then was utilized the video lighting in our here insertions again integrated was the stair so there was a resemblance back to the original detail what you can see here is you know the back of her home the slate and Sun roof and the masonry back and have the light bulb kicks in and you get an awareness from of the original home next line again similar photo it 'll straighten the same that you know now we 're in that pointed area and as we move up through to stay with ya engaging themselves with the back main story from the original house so there 's an awareness of where house stops where that 's true next slide this is taken from the the bathroom window illustrates the separation between the two parts jump into the next slide this there is an awareness that one is entering and leaving it very fortunate that I created by applying threshold which follows the line of the mansard roof and the changing level also at the floor were at floor plane we step down in that transition between the two parts likewise that the ceiling it lowers to indicate a change between existing and a new again on the right hand side you see the v-j line as this is a new wall inserted to form the bathroom next slide just got the pretty pictures here this is the upstairs bathroom see the window that opens was an original window very these two that voided area to ensure that the bathroom that 's of life let 's finish at the next slide this is the downstairs bathroom to directly below also set up that laundry we jump onto the the next slide then any illustrates again a lot of shots of the bathroom climb into the detailing the glimpse of that window in the bathroom looking out into the void and then also the finish and the right there is looking back to the party board furniture terraces that when we started looking at removing some of the it 's falling yeah Mordor from that big whip we expose the pretty quick and the climb they decide that they would like that became complete you will jump onto the next slide so we 've undertaken the restoration on the frontside Woodward and rehabilitated the city portion of the home and we 've developed a plan planning strategies to allow us to appreciate the character of Lubitsch online this brings us to the Leticia this is treated as a new contemporary addition as such it could be slick polished clean lines but it doesn t provide a cohesive ambience when in such a small space and gotta remember that this property science is only four point eight meters wide so the property itself spices with former 2 inches so it 's a quite confined space our preciouses home was one of the sympathetic contrast freight a point where we consider that context the material and the detailing and applying in a way that won 't contrasting the originals implies it from the molarity the Heritage presented that the homes identified by fine detail different trims so this project rather than running with sleek clean lines or repeating those decorative details we 've created our own detailed and Dekker by structural elements and expression X that they become the decoration life lights we waste materials and textures from the original home into the addition or being interpreted to create a character of their own next slide so this is well within the addition looking back to the light world again you can see how the exposing of the floor joist above created rain happening and decoration on the ceiling and likewise you know to the timber flooring in the original own but also create texture tactility through just the looked natural in there finishing and the DJ Mag next slide this is looking in the opposite direction back out to the really yards a small garden area and thanks to North we delays that whole elevation by putting the level back to maximize so I was getting into the property natural heating during the cooler months next next line here we can see the introduction of Cheaper elements on the wall and also see into the inclined sidewalk which was an addition to the property following discussions heat the neighbors they were concerned about the perceived bulk of the extension of the rear of the property albeit in a line within their extension so in consultation with the client we decided that we could angle that hall to slope away from their property and this would reference an answer bridge of division property and lessen the impact on the neighbor 's backyard visual it also gets very interesting anchors at lines or within the property next slide so this is now we 're back towards the original home and you can see the upper level is pulled back with the bedroom upstairs mr. taine reinterpretation window-seat bay window and the timber wall in quite or carry next slide this is just the upper bedroom it 's Apple across the suburbs not quite actually viewing long but next slide and this is from the corridor looking back to the rear you can see the compliant in the water and the way that he sort of wraps itself around the occupants Indian bedroom and leisure right after those views next slide back out corridor we end up at the y-12 circulation Stella [Music] back where it all started again so every every time you work through that area you 're experiencing the back of the heritage will begin next slide so then you have a non 7 Greville streets a home and a project that involve the restoration of heritage so the rehabilitation of each ears and their detail and the reinterpretation for the new addition I hope this presentation Illustrated how heritage context can be considered as one more design parameter with projects in to inform those thank you [Applause] _"

    "text": "I think what 's interesting here you would have seen a clear correlation between Maties approach to heritage and and restoration modern work and Brad 's work I think what 's interesting is one we looked at a whole range from some contemporary projects by architects that you like but some of the more restorative projects you 've done and then jumping into the absolute detail of one project which I think you 'd have to all agree this is quite stunning I think what 's really use thing about this is it 's the story it tells about there is a time to do absolute recreation restoration and there 's a time not to do it and this project actually has them both where they you look at it and really studying those two double hung windows and the balcony above and the French doors was absolutely the right thing to do would have cost some money but they 're going to be so much happy with them and it looks so wonderful to the street it 's a gift to the street I think whereas the work at occupied these houses and I think what 's interesting and I think both speakers mentioned it is when you 're working with heritage buildings a lot of it is actually about telling a story and with any building especially once it 's been around for a hundred years or a hundred and fifty years there isn 't one story there 's actually many stories any house has probably had five or six generations of people moving through it when this house was first built it probably wasn 't even on electricity but it certainly had outside toilets it wouldn 't have had a free trip would have had an icebox and you think of all the things that have changed no television radio internet to a modern lifestyle where the way we live in the way we do things is totally different so that layering of history is actually what 's really interesting and this one I think tells you it in quite a literal way in some some places we see the addition and you 've actually got the slate roof going from outside to inside and just replicating of saying here we say old work here 's the new word what now I 'm just gonna think of some wonderful questions now for me and endeavoring Here I am one thing that I think back to say my childhood and I remember mums would come down to Sydney and she take me to all the wonderful national trust houses and your admiration of them was all about first of all they were all what I call big age heritage so they were grand homes often built by very wealthy very powerful men and they 'll quite beautiful but they were very much of a type and they they spoke about their power and their influence and their money and I think the attitude was that heritage was about restoring and bringing it back to some sort of imagined time when it was first done and I think I hope as we 've grown up the whole Australian society is now much more sophisticated and mature about the way we treat heritage and we have big a charities but we also have small a charity so a row of important and it 's important for its cultural importance of miss story tells to and sometimes the things we should preserve and look after they 're not grand and not beautiful they don 't necessarily even magnificent materials here they just tell a story in that and that that wants that sort of preservation but then idea of part of a more mature approach approach to heritage compared to what we might have thought about 50 60 years ago you know talk a little bit about that yeah I get that 's probably the area where we 've tried to focus them on on I think we are all now understanding that the Victorian style terraces are beautiful and we understand how they should be renovated but there 's a whole lot of character homes out there that may not warrant listing they may not likely fit within a conservation area but they have beautiful character Spanish mission homes we 're losing a lot of them I am received an email yesterday from a music director who would like to do a video of a Spanish singing in Spanish mission and I just take a whole lot that are gone or a whole lot that I 've got just the facade but all the Spach in science gone so yeah there 's that next layer I think that we are losing that aren 't listed and I think people don 't pass them and really love them and they don 't realize that there 's there 's nothing I 'd like to there 's I think these days to look at a building like this or look at of the examples you go you show tonight we don 't have to work very hard to convince people they were looking after an end and doing something with then it comes down to the detail that what 's appropriate not appropriate I think what 's very interesting and this is probably where the issues of architects tries to have a role in is there 's a transition between buildings that are modern they knew and they obviously have a lot of value then there 's that point where they transition and when they 're around about 50 years old they 're the lights have gone that probably don 't comply with all the reason codes and the fashions have moved on so at the moment buildings in the 70s are all being demolished at a massive rate because people just don 't appreciate them just do this you know we 're not alone here in Europe with the present ruthless they just slept these things on and you can 't breathe and it 's fine it 's fine I mean they 're there what I mean what is the downside I can 't see the downside after all I mean the derocker 's don 't make money but then they don 't know that they didn 't make money and something that never happened right so it 's it 's not a loss so I think you know my my take on it would be just you know be very straight they 've lost these things missed everything left right and center and and the wonderful thing is dangerous because it has been so much development tentative architecture here is incredibly high I mean this building is just beautiful in every people out there who can deal with these things and they and you 're wonderful you should write a book I don 't know if you did you invent all those this is a laundry list always based on the parent-child principles they 're just down fine well it 's a great library and they should be summed up then they could be you can put in everyone 's litter box and I mean that would be my thing and just work with it so we 've spotted where we got a lot of land we could really build high-rises wherever we want to be at you yeah and we are trying and one thing that is lovely about it needs to be to have a range of styles you know you 're going to cities are you seeing the same style of building when we 're required to understand so many different styles it 's amazing they 're all there but but it 's just the little quirky ones that people just don 't they keep the prongs or but they take out all the essence of these buildings in the 80s and 90s of facade ISM where again everyone thought if you kept the front facade or that was okay and thankfully I think we 've moved beyond that look at them along we do get on people say now that we 're keeping the France cuz we only have to create the problems you know what you think conservation areas you 've got to keep a little bit more in front and if those five places in management reasonable person comes to us can we give it the fireplace it 's that funny marble colors pink yes when Scott ladder I 'm probably not gonna be quite that positive about the preservation heritage I think you simplify it too much I think you 're always fantasizing fairly it doesn 't need to be preserved body needs to be asking more sophisticated questions than this essentially what you presented is a way of preserving something that everyone would probably like to preserve those things but there 's bigger questions to almost from these things you know how do these work buildings respond to the environment how do we 't simply preserve buildings because there are a hundred years old they have some value we must ask more sophisticated questions and the questions you 're asking of these things and I think what is illustrated tonight is probably if this is counsels approach to heritage this is why architects are frustrated with the process because party simplicity it 's far too simplistic no no but this seems to be this notion of if it 's a hundred years old and it 's a great opportunity there 's a reason why these bills are probably not that a program I mean we laughed about this one here that was shown on the left when they took away the large big window you know by the large big window was there is that the most two different windows at very little the way to the interior house and the reasoning that when people windowing there was that it made more amenities of these spaces to simply say that things should be preserved and it 's not really a casing of preserving what was really Illustrated to know it was a restoration different restoration and preserving some it 's a very different thing and I just think they need to be asking much more sophisticated questions than have been almost what 's interesting is we put a couple of very very different opinions and this is the thing with with Heritage 's as soon as you figure it out there are a whole lot of different issues in terms of America I mean if we look at it from a state point of view off buildings have embodied energy and that issue that you actually have to spend energy to demolish them it 's one of the aspects I think the other one is and I think you see this one is that [Music] there 's another thing of actually just keeping it regardless when it was built or whether you just keep that 's okay [Applause] [Music] he did an amazing career there which actually you cannot see from any other Street around there 's only thank you and he did that with purely I think to your point anyway Michael really radiate that heat so the the concrete slab really of the light well which he definitely put in there oh yeah it cools brilliantly but it also mix as well like the front rooms are amazing because in Australia this wet hot that front room in summer is release because it stays cool now it 's up a little heater in winter and because it 's actually it 's more room it 's probably the most efficient room in our house to actually heat during the winter months so it 's a very interesting thing of using new technology to assist cold climate buildings or aspects but also then making you know the poor living spaces you know both environmentally friendly but also very extremely livable so from our perspective and I think but the architect I think you dragged all those really like the fabric it 's it 's my dad that 's where I go and watch the ashes cricket really Tennyson is in there a trade books which is nice but then the back you can entertain and it flows through quite well and I think it 's if that wonderful mix of how do you what another 100 years a lot of someone else might do an extra renovation but it 's still working I 'm very new to Sydney but back in London things like the Barbican are not necessarily the same stylist but they 're really vital heritage it 's a story of the people and the culture in the evolution but up say two of the major projects in London right now a heritage leg Kings Cross the back seat or enormous projects but like you say they 're expensive developers and other people have money there and so there needs to be a system laws and regulations to try and keep that in check with people as king of Jets enough people were tough enough to stop project than they can and if people are not prepared to become then it will disappear that 's a different story but there needs to be councils needs to be empowered financially and legally to stand up against developers but notice that I 'm not just doing that and do take the time and energy to engage of community and to consider heritage should and a bit more leeway sometimes to say for new rules and regulations appropriately leeway suggests there it 's actually the Barbican that you point out because if I go back when I went through architecture we went we did a a tour through Europe as we 're students and of course we 're going through the Barbican and part was a little doe deep in the seventies and it 's now been totally reevaluated from being probably you know it was a heroic one was built in a week from the period where the architecture profession itself produces school and honored you could easily be offended by about billing but it 's now come to come the full circle and it 's now going to be appreciated although I would still say that a great chunk of the stock of the society would still struggle with in the same way that even with serious there was a big chunk our treasurer and deputy Peruvian has a big problem with it he finds it incredibly ugly about ten years ago English Heritage changed their primary stance from preservation so that looking to keep the value it 's a good example of trying to keep what is it they 're trying to bring new life as well so it 's not just gonna stay frozen in time and isn 't really usable in any sensible way and what we 're trying to breathe new life into old and that is a bit of a sophistication in Heritage 's sometimes this great baby in heritage you can really add value sometimes it is sometimes sometimes it 's don 't what that type into that face okay I think we have to so I 'm going to pass back to the men to say some fun words well my final words are very pleasant I 'm wanting to thank our speaker particularly Mandy who is here in person and and her Susanna right and very very interesting talk thank you very much and I 'm horrified I thought when you showed that picture of that house in darling point it was one of those ones where they 've just put a color on it you know just photoshopped the whole thing and then yeah anyways thank you very much for your presentation and your brother did a wonderful job from far afield and thank you for your contribution to in adding what it 's like to live in this wonderful place and congratulations to you for restoring that building like that I think it 's absolutely brilliant and thank you so much Andrew for as always being so important to the architecture series that we have here and we won 't hold on like this you within her next year so all of you who have enjoyed the series this year please look forward to the notices again for next year and we 'll have different buildings different architects and more interesting topics and I know there 's a little surprise for you thank you [Applause] _"

    "text": "so this is this is this is now Kuhn a I 'm going to give myself the duty of the first question and this is really to to all of you I suppose we 've talked about about the origin of the campus and and I had actually heard but when the campus was first given to the university that the then Chancellor vice-chancellor decided to put one building in each corner of the site so that nobody could take any of the site back again and from that point of having sort of put a stake in the ground at each corner then the university has developed obviously internally but I 'd like to to hear your your thoughts about what next in the sense of what are the issues now that we 've got a fantastic campus and everyone I speak to talks about how significantly improved the campuses what what could what could improve it beyond where we are today I think the the big thing with the modern campus now is permeability so if you look at all the old campuses Sydney Uni etc ridging they way around with beautiful iron gates to say here 's where you enter and we can shut you out if we want to it doesn 't work like that anymore every campus right around the country is trying to invite people in to demystify what goes on there to break down the ideas that this is not some sort of elitist place this we 're doing interesting stuff worthwhile stuff we want you to know about it and share about it and maybe give us some money to help us to do more of it so the idea that you have you make nice spaces that you can anyone can walk through so the idea that if I live over there and I work over there you 're welcome to walk through the campus enjoy the campus and maybe you 'll buy a coffee or something on your way at one of the shops within the campus so it becomes part of it integrates with us with the city around it so I can see in the future especially now that there are more residents student residences on campus there people from surrounding areas come in and eat at the campus just like as part of the city and that the edges of the campus are no longer defined they start to become a little bit frayed almost and little tentacles that are reaching out into the surrounding areas but their surrounding areas reach into to them I did um we did a master plan for the Cambridge to technology and the number of years ago in in Canberra and we 're talking about what sort of things could be sort of workshop and what sort of things could be on a campus and and one of the teachers said well when I look at campuses and she 's especially specifically thinking of Anu they 're really beautiful places to be and I 'd like to live on one why can 't you actually have apartments for just anyone in the middle of the campus and we thought that wasn 't a great idea to do something like that so it really does start to become integrated with with with the community now I think that is a big part of Technology it was the New South Wales University of Technology play to change its name and the Vice Chancellor was a nuclear scientist who had very little interest in what hand has just been talking about but there was one gleam in his eye and that was to do with the old toad and back Baxter 's interest in amateur theatre was going to drive him to make sure that the old toad survived at least for a few a couple of decades and out of that came NIDA and out of that came great things so it was just a spark of of cultural imagination in that the mind of that nuclear scientist which led to other things outside but there 's also the phenomenon today where campuses are taking downtown space and high-rise building a high-rise campus remote from the original grass roots or green fields campus so I think picking up what from what Andrews saying that the campus of the future might be a cluster of buildings scattered all over the city not with not with not with no Nessa no necessarily no territory which captures a particular building or a piece of a space that was the the game when I was here but no longer thank goodness yeah I think I think the main one is engaging people to live in the campus so if you can get more students the technology of computers people learning online you 've got a Dre you 've got to keep them in the campus so it 's it 's making the campus a place where want people want to come to is the most important thing at the moment we get you know we build lecture theatres they don 't work because you don 't need the you know 500 people in that one room anymore they can learn that online they don 't go so you 've got to create the spaces we 'd engage with the people and and make them want to be in that space so more living on the campus is where I think we should be pushing to to make them engage and and stay on campus and be comfortable to come into these spaces and stay just a quick need to do is somehow interrelate the urban environment of around the university we 've tackled it I mentioned the light rail project we put in a pre-feasibility study 2011 and the government took that and did build a public transport system we are still trying to do work on that for example we 're pushing now we 've got on public display the first extensive bit of separated bike path which will start in South could he go up one wrong road go up along third Street get to the king where the old Kingsford roundabout is or was at South where the the most southward of the planned light rail stops will be then it will head through a bit of a farm the neighboring council Eriko across gardeners and go up Houston Road and cut across I think the Doncaster intersection with Anzac parade and try and provide a bicycle pathway that will all of us come from coogee go up interrelate with the light rail transport and then service the University and then move on to connect up with Centennial Park by Doncaster and then hopefully the separated bike path it 's another one of those contentious projects that ramming City Council tends to get into a huge battle the light rail and reconciling that and we 're going to have another one of I think the separated bike paths and the most difficult will be to persuade or convince residents along Doncaster Avenue that this is going to be good for them it 's going to be good for the students the university it 's going to be good for people that want to live in the university and yet somehow still access the CBD so it 's exciting times for romack City Council and really complements the University very very effectively I think one of the other issues that hasn 't been mentioned is the idea of lifelong learning that people want to continue to use it live near a university and benefit in a life long way from all the facilities and learning that happens in a university so that 's I think that 's one of the other really positive things that are happening and the universities have to adapt and actually engage them in lifelong learning now we have a roving mic so if anybody would like to ask a question it 's now over to you we have a question right down here put your hand up so that yeah our roving mic can see you I 'm interested in the cost of running something like this with the glass and the air conditioning just and the cleaning just that logistics yeah because I was a building that was sealed against noise back in the 80s and our particular building cost a fortune around so I 'm just I must ask John to answer that we also have people from facilities here and they may well also have a view about the cost of running some of these new buildings yeah it 's complicated because of the existing buildings for instance a very poor passive buildings a very thin glass they have you know I don 't whether you remember the facade out there that was all mirrored you know stuck on the back because it 's too hot what we 've been looking at is using this space to the two buildings is conditioned by spill air so it 's similar to a shopping center approach so we 're not actually conditioning that space specifically we can ventilate that space by opening elements if we need to we 've got fans up on the roof that this works as a smoke spill as well so we can ventilate this space if we need to the 50% on the top is to reduce the heat load through this the roof the protection of this facade on this edge is provided by the space between we we double glazed we use high-performance glass we use shading where appropriate we thermally insulate as an interesting conversation on this building when you get into laboratory spaces on whether you 're over insulating a building which is the first time I 've ever heard a environmental person tell me that one but basically because you 're putting equipment that are running and and producing heat in a space if you collect all that heat and keep it then you 're going to need to cool that space there research facilities then need the conditioned in those areas because of the way that the research takes place we have to suck the air through the through the spaces we have to maintain specific temperatures so there is they are scientific buildings they 're not a open workplace there are controls that are around these buildings we do what we can to make them as efficient as we possibly can through the facade there 's solar on the roof of both buildings we have I can 't remember Jeffery do you remember how much we 've got up on the roof of here we use bore water we use the best technology we can for the conditionings basis we 're using central energy rather than diversified plant which gives you some benefits we 're readapting this building which gives another benefit environmentally that we 're not ripping the concrete down and building a new concrete building we 're replacing the facades but we 're replacing them with more high performance facades yeah I don 't know whether that answers it but we we do think about it we we plan for it and there are Street as possible this is Jeffrey Leeson who is the I know you 've got a new title Jeffrey director so I 'm the senior manager of deliveries so I head up the construction team that are rolling at all of our projects on campus we have very sophisticated building management systems so you know air conditioning is turned off when people are not around when there 's low load chillers when there 's only a few people around and they have the entire building being air-conditioned lights are on movement sensors so they 'll be running when people are around we 're putting solar cells on roofs wherever we can probably more importantly though we are going to be Australia 's first carbon-neutral University because of a joint venture we 've entered into with a an organization that is building a solar farm out in western New South Wales and we 'll be purchasing all of our energy from there so that 's quite an amazing achievement in the field of sustainability but yeah we do take sustainability very seriously well up there is a track up there is a love that sailing was that a question about how you clean the windows just for those of you at the back the question was how do you clean all these windows yeah absolutely so it 's like the outside of a building only on just on the inside of the building so and in fact the outside of the building where you 've got the terracotta blades that John was describing you wouldn 't believe how many hours we spent doing mock-ups of how big is the squeegee mop or cleaners can they get there and didn 't between those blades to actually clean those windows because there 's a gap between those blades in the glass and there were many hours of doing prototypes so can we actually clean them yep yeah we took a squeegee to China that 's a couple of really good questions thank you very much indeed um any any more questions come on don 't be shy yes just to follow on from your earlier question about you know what 's next obviously is a built almost Phoenix quite a few beautiful buildings what hospital with all the work that they talked about doing now and I was he merged in both organizations take the integration you 've talked about before can happen I might ask Nikki to talk about anything like that I don 't think the individual architects would would know about what the plans are beyond the campus and and their building so Nikki would you be prepared just to say it are you thinking about heading towards the the hospital what some or are you happy where you where you are in terms of the boundary of the university little bit closer [Music] putting forward with regards to a hospital there and we 're continuing to work with levels of authority to engage with the hospital and others one element that I think Andrew pointed out with permeability it 's just making sure that the university connects with its community so we 're looking to obviously have strong relationships with the hospital with all our neighbors around us so that 's that 's the extent of work that we 're working towards it 's actually more of a comment I would be really beautiful to do a history of the main architecture of this University because I know in the library there a lot of photos of campus in the very beginning and if it could be done there would be so many alumni so many people who would love to a book like that I think number of ways because saying that word [Music] this was done by Professor des Lee Luscombe a number of years ago it 's probably due to be updated I think but I also know if you go to the University of New South Wales website their archive department has a lot of stuff you can look at which has a whole series of aerial photographs through the years and photographs of various buildings and I agree I think it 's time to gather that together with the with the buildings and and Geoffrey you talk to the right people and have an exhibition and a book I think it 'd be wonderful idea as far as the Faculty of architecture was concerned that Eric Daniels I think wrote a history of that faculty years ago but the I think you have to remember that coming back to the Baxter era you had a nuclear scientist who who didn 't know one end of an of a good building to another he you know his his brain was focused on atoms and and such my new things so for a long time for a long time there was nobody within the university administration who was strong enough to push for some quality buildings the round house I think was one of the first and we mentioned a couple of others the round house came out of the government architects office Joe van der Steen I think was the architect but you know little by little Colin might have had something to do with it but Joe I worked on some of the details for the round house with with a black called Joe van der Steen um but the I think the point I 'm making is that the the growth of a commitment to good design was slow initially because of you are surrounded by these scientific boffins who all I wanted to was a sand hill I mean I think it 's hard to imagine that now but that 's what it was like yes we 've got a question at the back there yeah hold it closer yes I just wanted to ask about the bite track one correction I think you meant bond doc Street you said burner on right it didn 't_''_1262.84 I know it does run a long burner wrong comes to the intersection I think it 's comes to how you 're gonna get across spawn dog Street and stood it 's a terribly dissection that it will get across because um it will involve putting in lights and then moving the that 's right and but if you you know where 's the third Street intersection isn 't it people will cross on the southern side divert a buyer the lights go across to the western side of the military owned land and then just go a short distance up and turn right into bundle we haven 't decided on the final um a design for the bundle Street second we don 't know whether we military side or whether we will put it in the middle of Bangkok Street as a separated bike path that we will finalize that but I think the most exciting thing will be that it will be a safer way for students to be and staff to be able to access the university rather than just simply depend on the car I 'd noticed with interest during one of the talks there was a big entrances in the 60s to get the cars out of the university now councils trying to get the cars away from if they access points and control that and just make it a bit we 're really proud of what we are trying to achieve along this section of an tape road from Kensington to Kingsford via look I 'll start talking about bikes or no matter my friend Larry over there he come up to he might have a chat to him there was another part that was very important and especially to the University a bike path and it was an existing one that goes from High Street here down one zeroed down 100% and it 's disappeared with a light rail and I noticed down and unfortunately they 've even caged it off now for years and you have to go along this pothole II dangerous part in all the traffic so we 've been putting up with that for years now but I noticed there 's a path there along Allison Road now where the bike path was but it looks really narrow and there 's landscape that I mean it looks lovely but totally unfunctional because if a bike gets on the edge of that you 'll go right over it 's dangerous right and if people are walking and it 's shared and I 'm really concerned and it 's a beautiful path I mean when you look at the bike paths in Sydney at the map we are one of the only areas that has these off-road bike paths and we have mostly flat sort of areas around Maroubra it 's just a bike haven around here and it 's so important for people so to reduce their high glucose you know with this beast society we have my bike as much as I can into the city and I have noticed over the past thirty years since I 've been riding from Maroubra into the city that there 's so such a huge increase in people using it thank you so much for your comments we are going to you might want to talk to Murray offline because you know you 've obviously got a detailed knowledge about about the bike paths in the areas yeah well talk to Murray about it off lot offline now we do we need to to wrap up in a few minutes I 've got a couple of questions we 've got one here but we 've also got one over here yes it 's got a very quick question and you mentioned about student accommodation on campus does that mean you 're intending to expand more teaching spaces or are you just encouraging more people to live on campus compared to living outside of the campus do any of you want to comment about student accommodation so I think it was a comment that again Andrew brought up well no of uses so increasing and improving and encouraging more student housing is something that the university is looking looking to do definitely yes it 's always a competition for space isn 't it between student accommodation and and teaching and research and all the rest of it okay sorry I know that we 're like short on time but I was just out maybe I can just stay and get the answer to the question I was just curious when everyone talks about permeability and the concept of like reaching out and reaching in what efforts have been done to kind of facilitate that community engagement and student participation and like what kind of input is happening around that whole concept of getting everybody involved in relationship building and all that so I 'm my brief was very brief very brief we at the very early stages of looking at how we move the university internet the next phase and we 're doing some internal work and we will be working with various groups of people such as students and the general community to to start to engage again I we update our master plan framework and we 're at the early stages of doing that so with the light-rail that comes up High Street and there 's going to be a major new stop in High Street kind of near LOI or gate 9 basically and we know that area quite well because it 's another project that we we won a competition is actually looking at that whole space and that is going to that so in front of Clancy auditorium out to where the gate 9 is and where the stop is it 's now what 's it 's going to be a much more open inviting space where it will become a real front door to the upper campus which I think it 's always like you know you 've got the the mall which is a very clear here we are this is a way into the university but the upper campus has always had a whole series of sort of little entries and I think the new gate 9 is going to be a very inviting symbolic entry for the upper campus and remember and they 're wonderful little piece of piece of theater because everyone 's there looking looking very happy they 've got their proud parents there they 've got big bouquets of flowers everyone 's taking photographs they 've got their gowns on and all that will be part of this theatre that 's sort of on display to High Street and enter the surroundings I think that 's that 's part of that perme building and engagement it 's also about breaking down what actually happens in this place and it 's not that mysterious and it 's wonderful and all sorts of things there 's also the light rail stop at Anzac parade so the two new light rail stops will actually be a a new focus for and the university interface I think with the with the local community in the local area it 'll be a major address I think for for the University of both ends at grade and high street and we 're doing we know obviously where new public domain works there will actually transform those two those two stop areas um we do this point I 'd like to ask ask councillor Matson to say thank you to you all for coming _"

whole medical precinct up at the center of the campus and we 're delighted to be able to have him here to talk about the next two buildings it 's two buildings being built to create one building so that 's where we 're at I think Andrews stolen most of my commentary as well so it 'll be much faster than his is probably appropriate basically going through the spaces as we talked about up in the biological sciences precinct when we get there is more of a defined courtyard at the Michael Burke gardens there 's more of a defined entry sort of sequence into the into the site so the the the buildings that we were just discussing here in here there 's a very defined entry through into the courtyard space and when we looked at this building there were options to have entries off the off the street but we [Music] but the precinct than the buildings so we we sat in stage one which is this area here behind D 26 which is this building here and we we said let 's use the existing entries let 's use the the precinct that 's been developed in the courtyard space to create the entries into this building so it 's kind of strange this building at the moment finished it 's been done the only way you get in here is through a construction site it relies on stage 2 to be a completed building and essentially it reinforces the the original sort of concepts that were done by the other buildings which is to to in encourage the link through here there 's a future development through here which happening with the medical precinct but the chancellery walk as a primary thoroughfare coming through the the gardens themselves and then the entry into this this precinct so this is the the layout that we ended up it 's still under a bit of development here but they 're probably the big difference between the way we approach this building is 're trying to do is continue streetscape down through the the buildings which I 'll show in a minute but also it 's to activate the the Michael Burke gardens and actually connect into it so that we 're engaging with that space when we originally got the the project there were some reference schemes that we then I won 't go too far on to this but basically we we rationalize the schemes to create the ability to open into this space through opening the the the the learning and and again it 's the same concepts that we 're talking about before these are your support labs these are open labs this is your workplace and then the the space that joins the two buildings and connects through to the Wallace worth building so when we when we got it was a very square box we looked at the space that was available on the site we then cranked it open so that we could create more space in and and allow for the opening of this space so by building one building we got the internal it we we got that extra space the third space that was was excellent in though in their principles on the facades we looked at or the mass of the building we looked at how we could connect in with the the Wallace Worth building and its facade and how we could bring that to an end at the gate 11 which is a natural so completion of this corner and of the campus as well so we 're right on the edge as you saw in the previous slides so the massing of the building started to to drive the the gaps between the buildings the articulation of the forms of the spaces that sit behind those those areas so the basically starting to develop up the the support laboratory space the open labs and then the the workplace then the atrium as it slides in so then we clad those areas differently because we see that the we need more protection to the labs and the support lab areas we need less protection to the open space and we 're trying to get that light and that transparency through from the other side so we 're again we 're looking at this atrium space as a connector between the two buildings this is really purely these stage one elements as we then developed it further we started to look at how we then connect into the stage two building so we linked all the floors together we made them all the same height that created a few challenges with the amount of services that run through these buildings but basically what we 're trying to do is enhance the public space which is the being developed by the previous master plan for the space bring them into a public space at ground level we go to the what we call the invited space which is more of the teaching and learning space which links in with the two stories in in these buildings of teaching this building of teaching and then the private space which isn 't necessarily privates just more research-based space that we want to allow the the people to have a bit more privacy from the student but it doesn 't mean that they 're not more diagrammatic and then at ground level we were looking to open up spaces as much as we could onto the courtyard so there 's the student hub in there there 's cafe going in there and there 's central allocated teaching so they 're places where people are coming and going so we don 't need to control them through the building itself oops but we we allow them to directly access which in which engages more with this sort of external space and then this is basically a diagram showing what we were talking about before we are teaching interacts across the the precinct at these two levels then research is more is still connected at this level so that the connections across make it for one research zone so again it 's in a simple diagram we 've got the the workplace the open labs that support lab laboratory is wrapping through and then the workspace at the end obviously maintaining the existing fabric of this of that building which was also another challenge for what we had to do I won 't go through this too this is the set up of the research zoning in those in those areas the facade itself we we looked at the colors that existed on the existing facades we took the ideas of a biological building we looked at colors we looked at the the butterfly the the rock so we 've got geology going on in here we 've got biology going on in here and we ended on a macro view of the the butterfly wing which drives the the color variation that happens in the facade and that then gets interpreted over the over the facade we tried many different versions of this but we ended with what we 've got now which is essentially as we develop this this facade through it changed multiple times but basically maintain that same approach of the of the the color variation and then in the in the the development of the streetscape we 're using the the color variations that are happening here we 're being complementary to them at the end we 're breaking down the form of the building we were trying to reduce the bulk at the end we started to define the the research space versus the open workplace space and then the link between is defined by another form which is this one behind me so these were our original 3ds of the space and we 're also picking up on the colorations that are happening in adjacent building so it 's trying to blend and connect the various buildings this is it as a completed building so I think we we came very close to what we had in our imagery to reality we 've got a terracotta facade which references the other facades in the in the print in the campus especially the tyree building red centre and a few other buildings around and it 's a longevity of material it 's a masonry construction that that also works well with the Wallace worth facade and then when we got in inside the courtyard space or the the precinct we were looking at the way the building has two sides to it so Stage two started to need a different approach from what was happening in stage one and that was the existing courtyard space we didn 't want to fight with those I mean Green versus red would you know not be a good look so we we were trying to blend more with what was happening in that space so as we developed the lines around the building we looked at the heights and and the way that the the vertical elements of the of the facades on these buildings we we didn 't want to contrast them with a different building we want to make him feel one of the same family so we then took our facade on the street we looked at the loi facade in the Wallace Werth facade we blended those together and came up with what we believe is the as a complementary version of the of the facade so that then took the ideas that we had in terms of pixelation and movement through the facade onto the new facade within the context of the vertical facades that were around in the other areas and that 's essentially the the stage to look we still bring some of the color from our the opening of this facade at ground level is to activate the courtyard space we continue those those elements of verticality through the through the space and and and create a new focus to the southern part of the of the campus which is or the precinct which is hopefully going to be he 's very successful the entry we 've floated the the canopy so that gives protection allows people to sit up in these spaces also protects from the Sun it 's quite nice the way that the buildings across the way don 't overshadow the space so we were working with that to try and keep the light happening I think we 've gone through most of this before but basically creating that that space between the buildings which is this area here and and forming up the the spaces around the courtyard we took color again from the facade and we added it into the building so as you go up you have a range of colors that define those spaces and that 's where the it doesn 't work on that the stairs and why same basis and the colors within the laboratories work around that and hopefully it helps people orientate themselves within the within the building this is the ice this is a view looking at this stage to building so we are currently in here so what we did here was try to create a place for the researchers come down we were purposefully trying to limit the on floor sit and have your lunch come down here and talk come down here and mix and and try to get that serendipity happening within within the researchers so when we finish the walls that you see over there will disappear this will become another atrium space taller than this one another two stories down so it goes down into the the teaching area so it engages the teaching space to this space but still keeps it a fairly invited space if you want or private space and just another view of that it 's quite difficult to do all this within code requirements and and the depth of this space is part of that requirement so we went through a lot of code compliance which is fairly complex in this building and we we went through the basis of making it one building so this is fundamentally one building at the end of the day so this is the view that we 'd be looking at if we were standing on the other side of the building we would be right down at the end over here and we 're connecting all that through so I was up there the other day and then we 'll the Steel 's in so we 're getting close [Music] basically the atrium space which you 're in at the moment better work to make it all work with structure but that 's where we ended up and it 's it 's quite a positive space it feels good it 's great in the light that comes down through these the skylight where we got 50% light is quite good at direct the blades direct the light down into the space and it 's very happy with the quality of light in here during the day and expression on the end of the building to define to the facades of the building the the glass box if you want of the of the the workplace versus the research space and then the recess to help define that edge and that 's it again the crosses but anyway and then color which we add a bit of fun into our architecture at the ground we create places for people to work in an informal way the same concept of open learning I you know the the teaching on display happening in the distance and basically taking the cues of the color from the facade etc into those spaces so these these spaces got created around making places for people to feel comfortable in within a larger space which I think worked quite well in it seem to be populated when we 're there more of those spaces again color making the the various colors bringing them into the signage into the laboratories where they reflected by the colors in the building this is more about lighting two buildings and vertical facades I 'll go quickly basically these are the spaces where you 've got your laboratory space 're trying to connect these guys together in the distance is another level of support laboratories in that that area to the left basically more of the same this is what it looks like without a building I could explain all the stuff that we 're trying to stuff into these buildings it 's quite a feat in trying to work out how to make all these services reticulate through this building and still maintain an open feel it 's it 's quite phenomenal really and that doesn 't include this building that 's just stage one and again the laboratories are on display very happy with the way that this laboratory got developed in use using the building in a way that the its intended use to display those skeletons and things within what they 're doing out to the outside and again they 're all PC to which is all about control of air and and stuff so you can you can do it it 's just a bit tighter that 's the original and that 's it that 's our building or Jefferies investors building here 's exactly _"

James Coleman who worked on the original UN s master plan back in 1957 in 1958 he will provide a quick background context of the development of the UN s W campus Andrew Nemo is the New South Wales chapter president of the Australian Institute of architecture and the director of Lars Nemo architects he will focus on the development of the UNSW campus and will discuss in detail the two buildings designed by his firm in association with his Wilson architects the LOI Cancer Research Center and the Wallace Firth expansion Andrew has presided over these talks for the past six years it is a great pleasure again to be involved with it I would also like to design development of the second phase of the biomedical precinct John will be focusing on this very building the Biological Sciences Building he will look at how this building has transformed the streetscape I would also like to extend my gratitude to our MC tonight friend of mine professor holiday from planning practice at UNSW who will also be facilitating our question and answer so scroll all the hard ones at her and not at me I encourage you to participate in discussions during the question and answer session that will follow thank you for coming [Applause] _"

    "text": "okay thank you very much indeed we 'll move straight ahead to our first speaker with Jim Coleman Jim and I have known each other for too many years to mention and Jim 's going to talk and we 're still friends Jim 's going to talk about the very early days at UNSW thank you very much sue well it 's it 's a pretty nostalgic little kick for me tonight because in nineteen nineteen fifty-eight I think I worked walked out of these gates as one of the first architecture graduates from this university so I 'm going to take you back to that era very quickly it 's say an alma mater I 've got two degrees from this university so it 's quite close to my heart when I was a student a student it was the time of drawing boards and tea squares and slide rules and butter paper and drawing pins and rubbers lots of rubbers and corduroy trousers of course were de rigueur and suede shoes suede boots and and even some smocks which you 'll see in a moment on the top it in the studio there where the the guy in blue finished up with a successful career in New Caledonia he now lives in France and he spent a time as a senator in the French government the bloke in the red was a new Australian from Hungary so we had a mixed bag but it was a very small class ten or twelve students compared to today and so by the way Ted Mac ex-mayor of North Sydney was one of our he was a year behind us and the two or three years other years behind us with Glen Margot Keith Katya genres earth bub Maya and several others so there were the classes that were moving through in the late fifties there were there was a diploma class as well which was being phased out and Colin Griffiths was one of those people 's Jeff Stinson Jim Tanner a few other names like that so where did they all go most of them went overseas I went overseas it was our first intention after graduation to get out of Sydney and find out what was happening so or seven weeks to some other place and some of us didn 't come back for years and years in my case it was seven years before I going okay before I came home so the faculty at the time professor Tony town drove from Britain Eric Daniels was our design lecturer Derick Wrigley is still still going in Canberra Myles Dunphy the great Bush Walker and mapper and he was an architect the father of Milo Dunphy his lectures were a sellout because we learnt more about the bush than we did about the the pyramids or the the the Gothic cathedrals of Renaissance Italy but he was a sellout there and it was this time that we first moved out from Ultimo to the top floor of the old main building which was still under construction the faculty started in the old Tech College buildings you know in Ultimo so the university and architecture was the first to move out there was a racecourse here be prior to the university being built and as far as I can remember from the roof of that building we looked out them of the the campus planning team the leader was Dirk Dyck a Dutch sorry a Dutch architect and Hans Morelli went on to become an associate of a leading firm it was Madigan Tour zillow myself and Ross Smith who was a draftsman notice the ties and the very careful dress and our boss was Cobden Parkes recently retired government government architect it was a cynic EUR for him but he used to drift in and out of the office and look and kaznia grabbed a pencil but but the the real work was was done by this team and we tried hard to get a handle on what this campus was all about these are the models we made at the time here 's the Roundhouse it was the lower campus there was nothing up on the top it was a big hill and we tried to get some order into this this this remnant racecourse and the derelict buildings that by the way the old tote which was started out here the the vice-chancellor of the day Professor Philip Baxter his private interests were theater and he club out here and I think it was his initiation his interest in the theater which caused the alto to start and eventually we got NIDA so there 's the campus as we we made this model and we tried to get it developed into a more of a master plan and after that I 'm not sure what happened because we all left and here 's the looking from the west and this image here sorry that image there is the work that my little group of the three of us worked on our final year architectures studio so that 's the kind of thing that students were producing in those days yep after Parkes Cobden Parks we win our own directions I went downtown and worked briefly with Neville Brisbane and went overseas and so that was brought me to the to the end of my connection with the with the campus but I must say that the the the the the delight of being a student at that time it was at I suppose at the time we didn 't really think but a small class ten more we 're working through a new university new faculty somewhere over the hill to the west was the the Ivy League of Sydney University and professor Ingham Ashworth another pommy by the way there were there was there was an army of English academics that just gonna captured the act the academic world in Australia during that area but so and with that dream of the what is now the site of the North Sydney Council for that finally a project thanks very much sue [Applause] _"

    "text": "[Music] it 's wind that makes waves but there 's three things about the wind that 's important one is how fast the wind blows so the faster the wind blows the bigger the waves will be the second is how long the wind blows for if it blows for a few minutes nothing will happen but if it blows for a few hours or a few days you will get big waves now if you 're going in the water and you see these dumping waves you got to get your timing right but here if you got your timing wrong and this big things about to break on you don 't stand there get underneath dive into the water hands out hug the bottom and you 'll be okay when you come out don 't turn your back on the way okay people get whiplash all the time they get hit their head neck goes back they get hurt always look behind you and just get your timing right so you should always body surf with one arm or two arms out in front of you so if head when you see waves break and you see whitewater that means the waters been let go so all this whitewater is moving to the beach okay now you can 't have water piling up on the beach all day long or else we 'd all be underwater it 's got to go back out somehow and that 's when we start to get ribs and if you don 't know what rips are the the easiest definition is I call them rivers of the ocean and just like rivers they sit in a deep channel between shallow banks right and they flow in one direction well same with rips most rips sit in the deep channel in shallow sandbanks and they take the water in one direction and they 're there to get that water back out now to me there 's a really obvious rip in this picture but if you don 't know where the RIP is what you need to do is look here there 's lots of whitewater but then there 's a green gap now I 've got this nice saying called white is water means it 's shallow you can stand up that water brings you back to the beach where as these green gaps or deep water and they could be rips so there me and that 's the rip they look like these green paths or gaps almost like roads going out to the surf that 's what you got to look for now this is how they work I 've got an animation this is from Tama Rama so the waves bring the water in it meets in the middle it finds that channel or it makes its own it flows offshore that 's a lot of water moving out and if you try swimming against that you 're not gonna make it unless you 're thorpey they 're really strong but the good thing is they 're easy to understand there 's only two things you really need to remember one is that waves break in shallow water so wherever you see waves breaking in this white water it means it 's shallow that 's a sand Benny sandbar the second thing is that waves don 't break as waves breaking out there because it 's deep and you also don 't see many waves breaking in here because it 's what we call a deep channel or gutter or trough now Rip 's do not take you to New Zealand that 's a myth they take you about as far as waves are breaking maybe a bit further and they 're all about breaking waves if it was flat calm no rips but as soon as waves break you start to get them so if it was if the waves were bigger well then the rip would go out further now one of the things here I mentioned is that so many people get in trouble and rips because they actually look like great places to swim they look safe and every year we 'll get a family from the country or from overseas they 'll go to the beach they don 't really know how beaches work and they go hmm where should we put the kids in the swim well that looks pretty nasty you won 't put them there that looks pretty nasty we won clean and calm so I put the kids in and off they go and then the parents go in and off they go as well it happens every year and that 's one of the problems a lot of people call rips rip tides they 're not a toy it okay but rips are affected by the tide so rifts flow faster around low tide so two hours either side of low tide things are shallow waves are breaking the rifts move pretty quickly at high tide things are deep the rips the channel isn 't a big deal because it 's deep and the rips can stall all our surf beaches have rips but if you go to the northern beaches freshwater there 's a pretty flat Beach which is really good for learning how to surf now it 's always harder to spot these things from the beach so what we do is we tuck in the purple dye it 's fun now this rip went straight out they don 't always do that they can go in angles they can do s bends they can do all all that water from the beach back offshore so once they do that they stop they thought they 've done their job and in this case all the water and all the dye went out and it came back in with the waves and it made a complete circle so if you 've been stuck in that rip and you 've done nothing but just float you would have had a nice little ride but in a few minutes you would 've been standing up safe and sound the sandbar and that 's why if you ever do get caught in a rip don 't panic I know it 's easy to say when the beach is disappearing that you shouldn 't panic but there 's reasons one is that the rips do not pull you under the water people call them undertow there 's nothing in the ocean that pulls you under and holds you there people say what does it feel like being caught in a rip it doesn 't feel like anything because you 're just going with the water so do not panic panic is what take in some water you can drown it thirty seconds okay and if you 're not a good swimmer and you 're on a nun patrol beach never going past your waist because if you lose your footing and and you get caught in a rip you don 't feel it right and then you look up and see you 're out here how do I get here so you 're your reaction is to swim back to the beach against the RIP and you swim and you go backwards and then you swim faster and then you go backwards and then you get tired and you get scared so don 't swim against it the best advice at the moment is just stay afloat okay because we can all float even if you 're not a good swimmer our bodies are designed to float lay on your back move your arms and legs signal for help from the lifeguards lifesavers surfers right somebody will come and get you but just stay afloat and relax swim between the flags you must swimming the flags if you don 't you need

of course their life experiences and not to forget their success and the achievement that they 're proud of being an Australian Rarick city council initiated this project mainly because the local government area we have quite a significant proportion of residents they were born overseas over 3 of the population they came from more than 100 countries and they speak over 16 different languages at home so you can see that this community actually is quite culturally and linguistically diverse this project is with an objective that we would like to promote cultural awareness promote empathy respect and tolerance and everybody in the community live happily it started in 2003 over the years we have already had a few publications it is a biennial project and we already had a move for 125 migrants sharing with us their stories my name is Jorge Vargas I come from a state called Kerala how it 's they come high school principal my spelling friends in not Borneo High School where I was teaching when we were having lunch together one day I told them this is the end of the year for me here in this high school and I won 't go to London and do my PhD Oh daddy 's and then my friend said well you want to go there why don 't you go to Sydney with the oldest university like any other university then I in a in an easy way I stole my friends you don 't know what you 're talking about they didn 't understand the fact that that people who are not European migrant who are not allowed in this country at that time so they discovered it the next day after a discussion in the evening and they came back and told me don 't worry about those things you just apply to the University of Sydney and see what happens and they kept insisting the University and applied saying that we are happy to have you but you have to get the immigration permission so they send so on and just to make sure that I understand what 's all about so I read through the papers and filled in the application for immigration and luckily for about two months they see it as an unprecedented case you are allowed in when I decided after and a bit long and never feeling lonely after the education training course and then I thought I had maybe time for me to get married so I went to India and then I was my parents knew this family and so they said this girl is there she is a university not only graduate master 's degree and therefore I thought it may be better for her to come with me and she was quite attractive for me and got married I 'm only two children one boy the older one the other one is my girl ironic City Council started a multicultural Advisory Committee that was because they 've started to feel that there are migrant people coming in and they are from different parts of the world not all Greeks and Italians who earlier migrants and they were well-off asked to be on the advisory committee and for last 10 years or so have been on the advisory committee trying to help new migrants as well coming and they needed a lot of help so I 'm really enjoying that Renwick library I used to take a number of people into the library so they can and see what the Randwick is about so they can look up books and read about Renwick and if they wanted to settle down here then they should know a little bit more about the people and they life of this particular part of Sydney and what it 's like and also on the library 's Advisory Committee as well so it 's a wonderful place in different ways I 'm enjoying Renwick my name is Fred or and originally come from a place called Lancaster Pennsylvania in the United States the Amish country had always had a fascination with Australia right from the time when I was in high school I met an Australian at a local church who spoke of the outback etc and that really ignited a very strong interest I decided look I interrupted my studies and came to Australia actually came as part of a invitation from the state education department and they were looking for science and maths teachers and I 'd had some experience in teaching and so I 've raised my hand I said yes we 'd like you to come and then I arrived my wife is a British nurse and I guess if you were to look at the pencil and paper comparisons probably say this would never work out we have three children Matthew 's the eldest and he 's a war correspondent works for the US Marines the second is Vanessa she 's a psychologist works for the Cancer Council here in Sydney and the third is Catherine and she 's a primary school teacher of Dulwich Hill and Vanessa 's got two children so two grandchildren a boy and a girl and Matthews got a grandson who lives in Seattle Washington well they very much I mean as yesterday I mean it 's a Sun and surf and sand sort of lifestyle they they enjoy very much amount of doors in the days and every every day was gray and overcast and I 've been on the gloomy side as far as the weather was concerned whereas here the bulk of the day 's you start with you know lovely sunshine blue sky and it makes such a difference to your approach to the day well over the years I 've volunteered in various capacities I have a very active role at the Renwick library I convene a art group called the next chapter art group and we meet each month with speakers and and that group has grown from about eight people to I think about 65 at the moment I have a very active interest in native plants and have a strong affiliation with the Ramba community nursery I 'm there probably several times a month and actively look at new plants and and I volunteer at the st. Jude 's Church up in the northern part of Renwick looking after the plants in the cemetery and so I take a lot of plants from the nursery of the ramp nursery and plant them in the cemetery but that are here it 's truly a multi cultural melting pot on the street here where we live there probably close to 20 nationalities that you know when we moved anyway we used to have a Christmas potluck get together at Christmas time and and people would bring a a meal that is characteristic or symbolic of their native country or the country that they attached them that they would identify with and we had Greek we had Lebanese we had Canadian English New Zealand we had a huge array of people and and that 's quite characteristic of I think the general state of Australia it is a lovely melting pot and for the for the greater part everybody seems to get along quite well hi my name is Java coffee and I am for run with Dave one of a student in school and media well I 'm from a country called Cote d 'Ivoire which you call it the Ivory Coast my my memories from Cote d 'Ivoire very very great I have a very nice childhood I studied Commerce Business and at the end of my but to be able to get out of Africa was not given that 's not something that is given to everybody I have to to work fine work work very hard you know so I decided to be a musician so play in clubs you know nightlife you know so I ended up working in a five-star hotel you know and that 's when I managed to save a bit of money and once I was kind of I could cut myself a ticket and I decided to go in adventure to South Africa the apartheid system of course I wouldn 't say I left because of upper classes after Potter was abolished long time but the consequence the drawbacks of the apartheid was very well alive you know it was a beautiful fascinating place but I also went through a lot of personal difficulties but it is all a part of the journey of the adventure that I am because without the stories I wouldn 't be Who I am today and I probably wouldn 't be here if everything was so perfect well it was a bit strange very virtual place like Johannesburg you know because what 's been already Africa 's which is another country good Jonathan Mexican jungle have come into Australia you know very clean city everything very well organized and it was different the opportunity that has been given to my children is the peace the peaceful environment that has been provided for me and my family to live in security teach my children share with him what I came weave from my country even before we were born share my music make sure that I pass on everything that is very important to me in my life which is music and today the result is here clear in the way that my son Yannick has been able to achieve at the highest level the highest that can be higher he 's only 12 he 's a piano of Oprah Winfrey he 's been in America way he 's been on CBS News celebrating Jimi Hendrix 40th anniversary been here on Korean show five minute performance on Korean show now he 's doing Australia guitar well my son was born here one year after at least after 10 months I knew I knew that he had a talent I have known for whatever reason it is I have known down deep inside myself that that kid had something and at its very early age I made the resolution that was my my duty to do the right thing by him because I didn 't want to sit and wait one day when he is 20 to say I wish I did this no I 've been doing what I needed to do with him to develop what I found and thank God today I haven 't been proved wrong by taking more steps we shouldn 't think that this is a country where you come and take this is a country where you come and exchange give as much you can give because if people haven 't given we wouldn 't be accepted to this country so it 's not just a matter coming to take but coming to contribute my name is Andrew this is my wife Dean it 's a head of a human restaurant we both came from the Hunan

full treat up all of your feet the crimes will tackle back graffiti is some type of painting on properties when this is done people will usually ask the council to remove it we will be calling it the remove those this to stop tacky and encourage straight up straight up is an amazing part of the retirement just irritates people and makes it wonderful movie it would be crazy to stop it if you could our communities will be more awesome what is group for fading and battery feeding well you 're about to find out that both up after these n dimensions this is an example of battery and what some people think about 4 feet where we ask them a few questions do you think there is a lot of bag repeating randwick know how do you feel that bag of baby back baby back your penis looked as a few different types of graffiti there 's graffiti where it 's an Electra PT like this sort of stuff and then there 's four feet away obviously that 's better how do you feel that good baby how do I feel I like good BTW i think it 's colorful i think it makes place what do you think we can do to support group repeating maybe get more graffiti artists in how often does a small behind we change the wolf should change generally changing sponsor my probably that and hopefully within the next 90 days and i also think having good rafidi on a wall especially like this this is a huge world and if you don 't have any graffiti and if you just paint the world it 's gonna get a lot of other people that do like repeating how so having free space your Kefi more popular no it does precision people love with your feet even at night and color blue looks great and the next more inviting your some graffiti that has been sprayed on a looks cafe do you think there 's a lot of a graffiti randwick oh yeah there is a fair bit of a graffiti if you mean just vandalism and people tagging yep how do you feel about bad CD um don 't really love it I think it 's a waste of time for people in the council to clean up it is also form of self-expression so you could say that it 's good and it 's just people say we can do it but my general opinion is that it 's a bit of a waste of money if elected later how do you feel about good for Haiti I love it it 's a great form of art it 's taken art from galleries and being inside for certain types of people for it from now being fair everyone it 's in the streets every can see it everyone can appreciate the the people can enjoy the artworks that are created if it 's out there in the streets for building what do you think we could do to support good for Phoebe I think we can petition councils to find places where it 's legal to do it I know some of the council 's have set up certain areas certain streets and skate parks and walls that illegal Wars for people to just paint whatever they want to I think more of those would barely be good I also think if councils can find ways to set up youth projects where kids can be taught by current artists ways that they can do it in ways that they can do it in a way that means it 's leave or they don 't have to do it I late at night and in places but if we get in trouble if employees I think that would really be great thing that the council could do to set it up I also think just talking to people about it and making it not something that 's really other name from seen but that it is a legitimate art form I think that changing what people think about graffiti I might also be really good way of doing it graffiti is a work of which we are trans and beaks graffiti will affect your money because it 's a customer it can cost hundreds of dollars the problem is partially about the removal there are good was a little as natural chemicals which is bad within five it removes it removable there will be four feet everywhere so instead of getting rid of the removal will go with your feet how do we get rid of for free every time we ask people to stop and just keep on going well couldn 't it designated areas maybe to graffiti we can also introduce four feet AG two straight out and I can feed Lots those are for all gray I deets if you have any ideas tell the council and maybe pervading we saw once and for all I 'm totally we got asking ugly when you sell your house the graffiti lower the amount of people want to buy it could way that should name a book it makes it look bad and not it 's not just a

our city who attend the ceremony each year ladies and gentlemen what a beautiful day but a day that in many ways masks the greatness that will sit on many hearts here this morning it is my pleasure to represent the prime minister here today amongst you all i acknowledge the many distinguished guests here but particularly we together acknowledge the family and the friends and the supporters and those who 've nurtured all of those directly affected by this most horrible of incidents 12 years ago i particularly welcome the very young australians who are here today the boys and girls that sit amongst us in this tremendous community who would not have even been born when this most horrific of things took place far from our shores but very present in our minds here today i 'm pleased to be here today as part of a community commemoration as we think of the 22 lives that were lost specifically here from this community this commemoration here today has taken on over the years an even more significant role in australia 's national life my own the seven australian women who were lost on that day there are fellas here from the forbes rugby club and they 've come here today from other parts of new south wales there are people from all over the country i 'm sure are here today but it 's appropriate that this is done in a local community commemoration because it is the sense of local loss the local lives that no longer walk amongst us we mourn their loss but we also mourn the loss of a life that hasn 't been lived for those past 12 years and we reflect on that here this morning in this bright sunshine in this most beautiful places of reflection and what is our response our response i think is to live the life of peace to live the life that they had taken from them to live a life that reaches out to others as they did to live a life of celebration of this wonderful country in which we live and the values which it represents values of tolerance values of community values of respect values of looking out for with us so this is a a very important day we cannot let days like this pass us particularly in the times in which we face today when we 're so terribly reminded that the things that presented so horribly to us 12 years ago are still out there australians we respond to that with the resilience that those who lost people so directly have displayed every single day since that terrible event took place that 's what gives us all hope that 's what gives us all strength as i met some of the families this morning i looked into the eyes of hope of resilience of strength of character and we thank you for that as fellow australians and we joined today as fellow australians or fellow fuji ciders or new south welsh men and women but mostly as australians who love this country and deeply love those who we lost we remember them today good morning everyone as mayor of ram week i 'm extremely honored to welcome you all to beautiful dolphins point kuji and the bali memorial i would also like to pay my respects their elders past and present for me it 's hard to believe that it has been 12 years since the bali tragedy how quickly time has passed for you the families and the courageous survivors and for many australians it has no doubt been 12 of the hardest most painful years you will ever experience we lost 88 of our fellow australians the lives of their families changed forever i am also deeply honored to welcome the survivors of this strategy and the close network of supporters all of whom have shouldered much grief over the past 12 years we gather here today as we do each year to remember the sons daughters mothers fathers sisters brothers and friends we lost and to pay our respects to the courageous survivors of this awful terrorist attack the impact of the bali bombings on our local community was enormous with 20 of the 88 australians who lost their lives hailing from our own close eastern suburbs community for their families friends and survivors the pain is as raw the pain is as real and raw today as it was this day 12 to rally together and support each other is what makes us uniquely australian and is what helped us to get through in times of adversity in 2003 on the first anniversary of the bombings remember council unveiled this special bali memorial sculpture in commemoration of those lost in bali to provide a place for people to pay their respects to the innocent victims and to pay tribute to the australian spirit of courage and endurance the portico just down the hill is also a special place for people to go and remember the 20 locals from bondi to malabar that were lost in the attack we cannot forget that others outside of renwick city and the eastern suburbs lost their lives and were injured in this attack which is why which is why three years ago we installed the new south wales place of reflection with all 43 names of the new southwest victims inscribed on it there is no other place in new south wales that carries all their names and i hope the families and friends of the victims can find some solace and peace while remembering the an enduring testament to the unity and spirit of our local community the resilience of new south wales and its people and the unwavering strength of all australians grief is a part of life we will all experience it we cannot shelter our children from it nor can we ourselves hide from it whilst i myself and many others here today know all too well the heartache of losing a loved one we cannot even begin to understand the pain and anguish the families of the bali victims live with every day but what we can do as a community is support you and help you in times of need as i said earlier for you the families friends and survivors i 'm sure it seems impossible to think that life could possibly go on after that dreadful day but it does and it has and that very fact is a testament to your strength and courage you continue to honor your lost loved ones with such dignity and grace and is truly humbling to witness i know that in the lead up to the anniversary of this tragic event memories and feelings of that day must come flooding back to you this is the time to stay steadfast in our resolve to face adversity and tragedy to rally around those when they struggle with grief and to honor and cherish the precious memories and lives of the ones we have lost we as a community as a state and as a nation must pull together not only on this day but every day to show the world our spirit and our community cannot be broken this beautiful sculpture behind me with three linked figures symbolizing life hope and strength is a permanent reminder of how acts of terror will not destroy our faith in humanity or our way of life thank you for joining us today well good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you kyle i too would like to acknowledge the digital people of the durawall nation the traditional custodians of this land where we are today this land was is and forever will be digital land i 'm humbled and i 'm honored to be here speaking and sharing this occasion with you again i acknowledge i acknowledge you the families and the friends whom we will remember and honor today when i first heard those news reports from bali 12 years ago i think few of us could have conceived that we would be brought together each and every year since on this day at this place no single area in australia was and remains more affected than here in our home of eastern sydney the events of that day will be forever etched in the memory of our community here and in that of our entire nation it 's been 12 years of pain and grief of grappling to understand why adjusting to loss and learning if forgiveness is possible the beauty and tranquility of this place stands in stark contrast to the scenes of kuta on that dreadful night 12 years ago today we come together here at dolphins point to remember the names and the faces of the innocent victims their smiles and their youth their beauty and their innocence and today we pay tribute to the survivors the emergency service workers the defense forces the medical staff the councillors every individual in the weeks months and years to follow and we pay special tribute to patrick byrne who left us earlier this year terrorism 's purpose is to inflict terror on a community through acts of violence which are unpredictable unexpected and indiscriminate the targets in the first instance are the innocents who perish from these crimes but the ultimate target of terrorism is our democracy it is our right and it 's our freedoms which are the targets to practice or not the choice of our religion to live our lives to our full potential and to pursue that most profound of human desires happiness it 's a way of life it 's what we call the australian way of life a way of life that those whom we remember remember today were living and thriving in 12 years ago fanatics and zealots cast the first stone in their conspiracy to break our nation 's spirit they cause so much destruction and pain but they have failed and those who seek to follow them and imitate their actions will fail too their deeds have galvanized our nation we 're now years ago as john howard said in parliament immediately following the barley attacks the things that unite us as australians are infinitely greater and much more than the things that divide us today thousands of people across the world will join together just like we have here to remember the victims of the many nations who perished in the attacks whilst we lost more than any other nation on that day let us also remember the many other victims 38 of whom were from indonesia and sparrow thought for their families it 's a mark of a mark of the great respect of our two nations have for each other that the acting indonesian consul general mr nicholas menopause is here with us today more than ever we are united we are defiant and we will always remember we will never forget digging trees family guests welcome this is my story 12 years ago tonight both my sisters elizabeth coternacus and debbie my twin were killed the three of us were from a lobby family all we needed was each other and our parents anyone was an added bonus we with louisa zervos 2 33 and christine batmalic 29 i remember clearly that day what we were doing we were sitting by the pool drinking our cocktails talking about our next trip the following year back to bali that night during dinner i got a migraine so i decided not to go out with the girls instead i said to them to have a great night i kissed more goodbye and i left them that was on my final goodbye not knowing i 'd ever see them again that following morning my mother rang me asking if we were all okay i was half asleep saying we were all fine she insisted my sisters call her i waited for two hours until i could actually find something out about them there was nothing i could do i could only go to the police station because they would not take us to the site i went back to the room and just answered cars in tears that night three people came to my rescue with a plan to find my sisters and the other two girls and bring them all back was set i went and collected their luggage the others went looking for him unfortunately they never came back that night i asked to be taken to the hospital to find my sisters i went to the hospital and was told there was no westerners around they had all been flown out of the country i called my mother telling her to get ready for the funerals because there 's nowhere they were coming back elizabeth was id 'd on the friday the 25th of october through dental my twin sister was id 12th of november through dna they were both gone forever louise and both my sisters just broke me and my heart forever for many years i have dealt with the pain by putting a mask on not crying in front of anyone especially my parents i just kept on going as i would nine years later i decided it was time that i got some counselling i started seeing julie she listened to me watched me cry and finally got me through everything i had a lot of guilt inside me thinking that i should i should helped me through the whole thing of understanding it wasn 't my fault i 've returned to bali many times having my own little tributes placing flags around with all the 88 faces candles with all the 88 faces on there during the night just to remember more because in bali after the 10 years they just wanted to sort of forget it that 's why i 'm grateful today that we got around with council that lets us all come here today to remember all the lives that were lost or heard it brings me a bit of comfort to be with you all today thank you morning everybody my name 's jason and i 'm here today to honor my brother patrick patty was in bali on that tragic day as part of the kuji dolphins in the season footy trip for some unexplainable reason a minute before the surrey club explosion paddy decided to call it a night and left six of his teammates drinking around a table in position a right at the entry of the club i imagine he walked past the suicide bomber sitting a classic full teeth grin as he strolled past moments after paddy turned the corner the bomb exploded and he spent the next few hours living hell his actions have followed with the stuff of legend and ultimately earned him a bravery award our paddy was a hero most of you would have seen patty the day after the bombings as his silhouette was emblazoned on the cover of the sydney morning herald his arms shielding his face from the inferno in the background the twelve years that followed were a roller coaster of post-traumatic stress that sadly ended for patty in may this year the short story of mateship heroism and tragedy but the missing parts of paddy shorts story the most important and those that we cherish the most on his return home from bali patty made it his mission to honor his mates and support their families something he did tirelessly and of which our family is most proud paddy became president of the goodyear dolphins and focused on growing the junior teams and embracing the wider kuji community the club prospered patty is a dad two and for good reason they are legends jed is a champion athlete and an a grade student and shay well he 's the xbox champion of the universe they both support the parramatta reels and they love their mum lots they are patty 's ultimate legacy they are what matters most in the story of his life and we thank him unreservedly for bringing them into our lives god bless you patty we miss you but you know my name if i saw you in heaven and would it be the same if i saw you in heaven i must be strong and carry on cause i know i don 't know here in heaven would you hold my head if i saw you in heaven and would you help me stand if i saw you in heaven i 'll find my way through night and day cause i know i just can 't stay here in heaven time can bring you down time to land time can 't break your heart please do beyond the door there 's peace i 'm sure and i know there 'll be no and would it be the same if i saw you in heaven i must be strong and carry on because i know belong here in here yes i know here in heaven you _"

obviously celebrated across the country but it 's not just about symbolism it 's about a really underlying important message and that is to make sure that we all do our little bit to protect our environment ramberg city is as I say getting really involved in this year 's earth our promotions and what we 're doing is we 're promoting businesses throughout Lake City who are what 's called a dine by candlelight concept so over 60 businesses through our very own city will be offering their patrons and customers the ability to dine by candlelight so to turn the load those lights and to really try to enjoy and experience like so we 're really really proud to be able to support this concept and to really get behind it a live on it 's got national on the mirror of randwick and i 'm also on earth our ambassador Gramlich city council is promoting a concept learning guide by Kent life where various local businesses up to 60 of them will allow their patrons to dine by candlelight I 'm going around our senior businesses firstly as business owners why the environment is important to them I 'm also asking them what they think we should be doing as a community to help protect our local environment I i 'm joined by Tim who 's the owner of the x 74 cafe in coogee thanks very much Tim for you and your business participating in the earth hour dine by candlelight for concept well I just think it 's such a beautiful area where you 've been and as we will travel around the world we see how when environments I 'm looked after how bad they can become buy into major cities in the world it can all go horribly wrong so I think we all contribute and try and look after our own environment will maintain could you randwick in the pristine condition I am here with Thomas the executive assistant manager at the crowne plaza danica G Thomas thanks for environment here in coach is paramount to our business and everyone living here in the community we are very fortunate to be in the space here Australia that has the most beautiful beaches we attract guests from all over Australia New Zealand and obviously globally while they 're traveling to Sydney and it is paramount that we look after our environment it 's not only an asset but it 's also a very significant piece of their trip when they come here to Australia hi i 'm here with Morris who is the owner of the last brt of restaurant in coogee beach Morris thanks for joining us and thanks for being a great white mantle icon set as a business owner in Granite City why is the environment Glasgow has been involved with the last seven years somebody important each year we try to educate not so much if you cannot say but it may be trying to really people know that we are very involved in the community and then we can recombine yeah I are here with Neal there 's one of the owners of the little participating in the earth hour died by candlelight concept along and I think it 's incredibly important to us I think we 're very lucky to have wonderful surroundings that we have a little chipped cherished OH surroundings and look after them it 's good for my customers it 's it 's good for my restaurant to be recycling to to be looking after the space that I 'm in as i mentioned in I think it 's really important with recycling like you 've got to be really careful with the we recycle rubbish we 're very concerned about the garbage collection oils and picked up regularly I use coffee grinds we recycled to help the market garden just at the back of acceptable restaurant we actually grow as you can see a lot of room for juice which by doing that we minimize managing and the chef of myself of the we 're very we control freaks or low to control things that we grow over that way we know exactly what goes on to the place we trim our own sirloin and we turn the trimmings from pastures which once again just arrives at its raw produce which is flour and an egg so that 's minimize some minimizes editor and wastage the fish that we fill it fresh every day we turn the leftover fish into seafood buoy bays which we give us a little aperitif to customers on arrival I think it 's really important to support local farmers less transport just just look after the local environment and the local people and then you know which I just think we contribute to sustainability in the local area and will we use only sort of sustainable called fish and seafood and we use the best in my opinion the best bishop lauren sidney and yeah it 's a duty as a chef to to be doing everything i can to protect local fish dogs endangered species and not overfishing and it 's a privilege for me to be here and I need to move doing everything I can support that certainly fish industry for example Oh what sort of things came in businesses do to build the environment in Roman city there are so many and others are also self initiatives we has come aza here have a program that 's called engage and every year we set ourselves new targets and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions we look at waist look at gas consumption water reductions and obviously electricity and fire Earth Hour is obviously a symbolic event celebrated once a year it 's really important that everyone prices that for the rest of the year that in fact that positive impact in sustainability _"

    "text": "i think the idea first came out of seeing how many of these kids were turning up to anzac day ceremonies both at the beach and in town on anzac day the council was approached by the kuji surf club to look at building a national memorial for fallen lifesavers that is members of the life-saving community who had lost their lives in the wars it was initially going to be a memorial for fallen life savers at kujin in the local district and then we had so much support from all levels of government that we decided that this had to be a national memorial as a surf lifesaver of 28 years experience i 'm really proud that this nationally significant monument will be right here in our community for well over a century volunteers have been giving their time keeping the swimming public safe on our beaches surf life-saving australia would in its original form surf bathers association new south wales was formed in october 1907. kuji was one of the eight foundation clubs they were hit with world war one and surf lifesavers signed up in big extension of their service in the community the lifesavers their duty is to preserve life to help people and when the call came for them to go to war they volunteered they didn 't serve when the colder war came and our lifesavers went off to the war it decimated the membership of the club and it was pretty well much the few remaining members the women and the children of the members that stayed behind that kept the surf clubs running in those war years the anzac ethics always been very strong to australasians well it 's one of our major things isn 't it i think because of my background and that it 's um it has got a special meaning for me alan has just been a treasure since the moment we found him his initial sketchings and then his modelling was just fantastic and when i first saw that first model that the hair on the back of my neck stood up the model was about 500 ml and scaled up four times we got just over two meters on the life size i thought it lifesaver and you have the soldier and you have the surf reel in between them and they 're looking out at sea one looking after the swimming public and the other looking off in you know across the horizon to the unknown it 's a very special and uniquely australian design that really captures our ideas of service and sacrifice i don 't really like highly finished sculpture i tend to think if you leave it a wee bit less or underdone it leaves something to the viewers imagination the ultimate tribute to service to our community and our nation it 's the perfect representation of why australian diggers are so dogged tough and willing to surf this project interests me on three counts i 'm the patron of the newport surf lifesaving club i was saved by lifesavers my father was saved by lifesavers i have a deep ingrained respect for lifesavers i 'm interested in australian history and i 'm interested in commemorating the sacrifice made by australians in wartime as i go around the country to different clubs you 'll see on a boards honoring those who from a national focus there is a lot of attention on it and it 's very strongly supported the electorate of kuji is one of the smallest electorates in australia but we have four surf lifesaving clubs here so i think kuji is an entirely appropriate place to put a memorial such as this the surf lifesaver is a ubiquitous site around kuji and there 's so much part of the fabric of our lifestyle here we never wanted the memorial to be something behind a pedestal or behind a wall a fence it had to be down for the community there 's a memorial wall to commemorate the fallen lifesavers there 's the statues looking out over the bay there 's a flagpole and beautiful landscaping somewhere that is appropriate to commemorate these fallen lifesavers i think that everyone that comes from all around australia to see the names of the various persons on it that they 'll be impressed with it too and many photos will be taken of that that their grandfather or a relative whose name is in that place the only one in australia the tribute to surf lifesavers and those who 've served our nation each year at the beginning of the surf season a raising of the flag ceremony will be held at the site this will be an important day for the community to gather at the memorial and to pay their respects it 'll celebrate the contribution that surf lifesavers have made to our nation and those who have gone on to serve in our defence forces protecting that way of life that we as australians enjoy every day right across this nation national recognition of fallen surf lifesavers is very important for the movement we have many members who have served as volunteers in the military and gave their lives while i can 't particularly in the first world war make sense of why my primary feeling is the least we can do those of succeeding generations is to remember them their service is our heritage and that 's why it 's most appropriate to build a national memorial to them they shall grow not old as we the left grow old age shall not weary them nor the years morning we will remember them lest we forget _"

    "text": "friends I 'd like to welcome you all to Round Lake City Council 's 9th annual eco living fair and I 'm sure you agree it 's the biggest the best we 've had yet the Eco living affair began in 2005 and it 's part of the council 's sustaining our city initiatives which uses the five-year environmental levy to make sustainable improvements to ramik city the program has been a huge success in changing people 's behavior and helping all of us tread more likely on the planet and establishing ramic City Council as a community leader in sustainability a great example this is the Rama community center which we have over here which is the epitome of sustainability and access our environmental education hub for Community Learning residents and school students of Sydney 's eastern suburbs and with the lighter that we 've recently announced a partnership with the University in New South Wales to build on their great intellectual power in terms of sustainability practices to put us to work in your community but if you look at the center you can see the large solar one of the first small scale wind turbines installed in metropolitan Sydney and generates the equivalent of half the energy needs for an average household you see the rainwater tanks that feed water to the toilets and gardens of the center and energy efficient ceiling fans in the hall for cooling all of these things showcase the practical sustainable she 'll be our environment and that 's really amplified when you look around you at the Eco living fed today there 's no one approach to sustainability but the simple point is that even the smallest lifestyle change can make a difference from each switching energy to save light bulbs and using green recyclable bags when shopping to installing a solar hot water system and using eco-friendly gardening techniques there are many ways we can embed sustainability practices into our lives so I 've got all this here with the terrific lineup of stalls talks and demonstrations and activities for you all to get involved today got a great lineup of music here we 've already heard from the round week public school band and Yuki and shortly we have take your time to have a look around have a look at the sustainability demonstration house over in the community center and if you need time away from the action have a look at the spectacular nature of memory photographic exhibition so check it out see what 's on offer you _"

    "text": "we just didn 't do a total gut the house replace everything we 've tried to work with what we had here and then as with over the years as we needed to replace things will try to make a more sustainable the some of the things you see in the house is still some sustained a non-sustainable items that was giving a bit of an idea about how they might work with new ideas as well one of those would be things like the lighting one part of the house was still got the old halogen lighting and we 've got meters to just show the difference between the power usage on those and in these areas we 've got LED lighting we haven 't put a graywater system and things like that because we don 't actually use a lot of water except for the garden so with we 're capturing a lot of rainwater we can basically we have enough for a watering of small gardens that we have here and we have a 1.5 kilowatt system on the roof for solar energy the while we 're because we 're not a functioning house if you have to do a big kitchen so we retrofitted storage cupboard space so because we don 't have a large house we can put a small fridge in and some of the small little features to do is make sure you 're always ventilate so that event under the fridge to get that heat out and this little idea is a concept that you can extrapolate for a big fridge basically in winter you can let that heat come back into the room to utilize waste energy back into the house but then in in summer you can close that down now this is all closed up basically the air going out and then we let the air flow up through a vent that goes to the that 's through the roof went into the roof space you can have a ducted Oh depending on you can take it out through the roof if you want and then you can put a little bit to just close it off so you don 't lose too much hot air in winter but idea like to sell ur having cool air coming from the subfloor we 've got Vince underneath the floor here that come in and bring cool air in and go through a so this can reduce the size of your fridge by having potatoes carrots things that don 't necessarily need to go into the refrigerator we can go in here and again that cool air can flow up and through vents and out through the ceiling they 're just trying to reduce the size of your fridge because in a house the refrigerator is one of the big users if you don 't have air conditioning that your refrigerators your big item this is a hoop pine pilot it 's I like this product they use and you can get a lot this some that use glues that aren 't so great but you can source one that has better glues and use a low volatile compound on the big what they call low v AC material finishes for the finish surface this can be a great use of materials because the idea is it uses a rotary peeling can actually reuse the material to at the end of its life so it sort of got an ongoing good reuse capability because a lot of materials these days are made out of like composite boards like mellow mines on on MDF and generally when the end of their user gets thrown out onto land till go to scrap you talking about ventilation into the roof space do you do you make any use of the ventilation within the at the roof in here we have it at the moment but what we have got is we have a solar heater around the corner here is a just come around you want to just move here we have a solar air dryer and as a turn on the moment but there 's a little explanation here but we have a little fan and it 's like a big box up on the roof it heats the air and then the air it 's got a little solar motor that drives it down and pushes warm air into the room so it uses the concept of in a glass panel with then that is pushed down into the room so we 're using that but you can use strategies of taking the hot air from the roof space and little pumps to comfort download try and put your lighting lighting is a big use of power and home put task lighting over benches when we built this LED lighting was still quite new I think it 's over six seven years now we put it a low-cost you know fluorescent tube and that 's just over the bench a lot of homes do a lot of overhead sort of led halogen the old halogen lights these are LED lights so you just turn those on so that these are really good busy like the next generation of lights now this is a there 's a great LEDs but it takes a lot of energy to get that light source down onto a bench so it 's better to light directly from here when you got task orientated things like officers where your writing we working surface and then you don 't really have to turn on a lot of the overhead a lot of that in design as well think about those things but then having them on a separate switch so you can turn the lights on you can eat general lighting in the room use of recycled glass tiles in the splash back in so read idea of reusing materials having a second life as we walk through to go through the hallway here you will notice lit from above and these solar tubes which were introduced as well some these homes get quite dark in the center so they 're very effective during the day this window we replaced elements we had to we this windows not working as well as what we 'd like to it we had to deal with the fact that classified as a showroom under like a building regulation so we won 't allow to have open windows here so it would have been nice to have some operable windows that can let the because of fire regulations we had to they have to be closed off so and there 's a few features haven 't_''_367.06 been built we haven 't built a really nice you see we 're getting light into the room but in summer we do get a little bit of heat energy coming into the room so should really have a little awning on it but it 's nicest Tony you can see the warts coming from the windows so when we did this would put we did an example of double glazing in here i will put so this is double glazed and then we 've got different ways of dealing with how you could do this in a retrofit on rental homes this is a material that has a reflective back surface you can see that silver is company and makes it and then son hit satin can bounce a lot of that heat back out soon right that 's energy is coming in and so it just done in different ways of how you can do it as a flight doubles it 's a fly screen as well as a heat reflector between the two different rooms you 'll notice different floor treatment in this room is an old polyurethane finish that was is like a and so it 's a it 's a fossil fuel sort of derived finish it 's made from petrochemical products basically I thought I think we should be really using more sustainably grown sort of finishes come from a more plant-based so the one we 've used in that has come from a like a nut finish more like your tongue oils and things like that that 's a German product with these in there live off make finish and that would beauty of that one in there is that you don 't need to sand between coats you can just recoat it it generally needs to be recoded more this might take you know every maybe six years you need to recoat maybe that one every year or two you need to recoat depending on how much but you can just mop that one on this one needs to be sanded between coats so more energy intensive over the life of the product I think you know this one in there would actually be a lot easy to use because every time you sand is for your reducing the be some floors only allow one or two sands especially the new timber floors they 're only got like a five mil thickness of timberlands on on the veneer so you 've got to be careful those sorts of things just a few little features of ebony gone for the old idea of the Pullman curtains the idea is try and have this either the curtains going from floor to ceiling and no gap so that air can 't sort of circulate behind those curtains to actually it basically that cold air keeps replacing in the room and the warm is flowing in and so reducing efficiency of your heating in your room so other little tricks you can do with the curtains so you can put and we 've put it on the air jet but you can actually put velcro down sides of the curtains and stick it against the wall to reduce their sides yeah little things like that you can put snakes you can actually have velcro and velcro snakes to keep them waiting down to the floor or they 're all little important little features 's your house one 's using 50 watts of energy and what and the other ones using any 71 so you can see the effective light you 've got a little bit of light drop off on this one but you can see basically corresponding here we 've got the effigy meters the one on the left here shows the energy current usage of the house and what we 've got turned on on the right here 's what we 're actually producing from the house at the moment we were before the lights Ron world point 06 as it updates will it 's gone up 2.16 and at the moment we 're producing 1.4 970 1.49 so we 're in yeah we 're producing more than we 're using this is not a hugely intensive energy usage house say and then and that was using the halogen so we 'll point 16 we use it putting on the LEDs for a similar site sized room we just watch you are went up point zero three so it is a big difference in the amount of usage you accumulate that home you _"

backwards and forwards between the United Kingdom and Australia three times and then when he got back here two years administrator with the pair of X and then News Limited groups and you probably would have seen some his work reading those papers and gizelle teaching illustration and more tape that 's a bit of concern for my foot again because you 're trying to line this all up for this year and he didn 't not there when it 's teaching gym and but he 's here with us today he has very consistent services to children and we 'll be talking about illustration be creative yeah what rank sizes is true of what the illustration something like 30 years now and now I teach you that I teach observational floor ok so I brought some portfolio today I 'm not sure how I 'm gonna go on looking at them so on I guess you can later but i also realized i have a website so we can look at some illustrations up next but i did prepare a little talk what is the difference between illustration and fire out this is only going down an alley and time to try to explain the public demonstration is love us you 've not doing that a lot of people noticed without look at some of those later so and also having a book published two people my first problem so you some details about legs around you guys and put group 's info by thousands of more than you wanna get this book in price the cup of coffee and chat what is the difference between illustration and finite people sort of explain the difference over many years and there are many theories on the subject such as art is the idea brought to life you know that if your eyes while an illustration is a depiction for explanation of the moat you find out is simply art for art 's ink but illustration is explaining the story or idea and the last one ella in modern and something Noble is put to ignoble edits there 's a deterioration and value so that 's how they think of illustrator prepare to quantify matters now they 'll be quite a guy called David APIs are largely today so you can determine their surveillance I started opening poor eyes in my view there is no apparent difference between art and illustration except the way in which payment to the artist process I 'll explain what he meant by that state so for the first thirty thousand years of our artists make a decent living working for key pubs partners Commission for temple walls royal palaces and the homes of aristocrats and then Kim 's began to disappear hold stop Commissioner these replaced by a new commercial class fueled by the birth of capitalism and invention of the corporation so our craft from being salt it 's on the old bag of very rich the Kings our support to this new commercial ties and this class became the new patrons about an artist 's adapting to the new business realities fact two paths so the first to us to produce and corporate art collections second plan offered as a result of the newly invented printing press so rather than selling a picture to a wealthy patron artists can now make multiple copies of picture and sell the phone small amounts of money to larger numbers of less wealthy purchases so if this option had existed during the Golden Age increase or early Italian Renaissance you can bet some of the greatest artists were taking full advantage of in fact where this biggest business model first began to emerge with the advantage of action some of the greatest artists such as juror and Rembrandt quickly embraced red rag turn to actions as a way of selling multiple copies of single image to Dutch merchants so around the time of the Dutch East Indies w the first major massive corporation don 't emergency route the body and engraving pre-production why do I know this has never happened before you see so many other things but this is no megami so in your own home you could have what 's this actually an artwork by jury as I say this is this the which was commissioned to be ugly royal palaces and so forth to something would you universally book pretty much universally available the invention of crazy was essential for the growth of illustration there would be no modern illustration but I 'm two key developers one is the ability to create and distribute quality copies to large audiences to the ability to collect small proportional payments for that bar from large audiences so you get paid a smaller amount of money but from a lot more people you see other sailor make sense is that you find out now we have illustration making money from sheer volume of the work that is selling and it 's only possible because of the invention of printing now because of these developments the most talented artists but we can never afford to hire individually under the old business walk around like because one but they can now create beautiful pictures to entertain and be like public and they were rewarded with a tiny fraction of the price that was paid for a magazine or book so talk them now when are another sort of here example yeah you slept alright people like that display of the strainers so suddenly everybody can see this work you didn 't have it wasn 't hang on wall somebody 's house okay so they were rewarded with a tiny fraction of the price of debate or magazine or book and so by aggregating tiny payments from vast audiences who take handsome sums to great magazine illustrator such as Norman Rockwell and backs with cash so we don 't know those guys again and now just as we pay handsome sums to the talented creative picks up the Michelangelo never have the options get paid that way so for a snapshot of how this new opportunity opened up for hours we 're going to look at the pirate illustrations of a vampire now Klaus depart modern illustration as the technology for reproducing its troops gradually improved over the course of his career quite a long period and the technology changed and accrue so as the technology reduces pics gradually improved overs career publish became more enthusiastic and a bank increased dramatically and as I said here the earliest big too much into wooden painting ones how to pass laws and illustration its then sent to this artisan and the greatness of different a lot and he reproduced so how apart signs appear and engravers work is here ok sign so these are the first this is the first reproductions or the magazines and books and this is quite a shock you know and as I sizes very late but illustrative of the job then we have the grave of doing a great job as an outer zone to do this right he should sign and then I added crew call it to enhance the aliases but that wouldn 't make something as well expected and if you could have actually seen this point you soon um 18-19 setting our thing I should check that when I gotta be on the board you guys and so they would have the crude color to this and as I say isn 't nothing seen before but it 's a beautiful thing and it 's no longer if this is now cured illustration it 's no longer what we call fine arts who sensitive parts of it so now instead of an engraver actually cutting this out cross hatching it this is not a photographic plates around the birth of a photog revealed so this would be exposed and then exit onto a plate of acid and you 're going to get these much more sometimes this is more likely whistles boy and this wouldn 't be this is the next progression in this and this sort of herons in this new era of golden age how part as I say you can see the progression of this work of avoiding range improved printing technology finally reaches the fall colors and technique in the original to this is unless you would have painted this leads to the Golden Age illustration and a proliferation of illustrated books and magazines so as we think are these images we see how the quality of reproduction and these newly sophisticated ways of delivering to the public transform the economics of our and inspired universe and creativity in short the three pillars of modern illustration of one quality reproduction such as this and to the ability to collect created a robust opportunity it sounded us there are core of economic model for the Australian and the only categorical difference between body illustration and fine up as I see it so that 's that particular tool and I was gonna go once and show your photos but I don 't think this fractal at this thing so we might go into the website oh I should show you some of the work that I 've been doing hope you have any questions so this is what I 've been doing as I say open some 30 years I 've worked for The Sydney Morning Herald a daily telegraph and stroke then all the bottom a steady using the Telegraph concern in the Australian sunday telegram I went back to work for the Irish pen for a while whooping advertising and so on and so forth so it 's just we show you some examples of going to stage this was done around the time of the Olympics and I like to work in a more realistic style as you can see this was just some little feeling from the we are the qualities whatever they had a big war vitamin water cuz we don 't get it right first time I 'm not have honest part of the waters any put Mexico needs a go cover for guys who worked in the first I think fast you know you have to become I just got used to work with I saw stuff that wasn 't broke so mixing that I then checked up with one things like sprecher bought some of my pics couple this has done on watercolor paper so any questions about down on three yeah I like to I like to work up a bit exam another thing I also work what we call same size alone illustrators they work larger than sometimes 207 so the aisles work same size because I don 't like to see my work reduce I 've got a lot of detail the guests reduce down now heads look like I 've seen my work this size blown up at the back with every user illustration is all the time they make proper sex where my work is blown up it we blows up up go because produced at me Charlie Chan taxi money oh my god there will be serving for the financial pages that 's just a car to a bit easier it 's no one but I brand Tommy 's the next week is let me so you look at again you have something clichés but I used to anything is when you work in as a newspapers for eating crap visually pleasing to God because you 'll be given a job ads come out of the holiday at three o 'clock have busted for the long run to the golden dragon and then they come to then give you 2,000 words is shameful to fill okay you can come up with bonus captions by sending back to the server and if they want a crowd sequencing because deadline be 630 so you 've got about three hours to come up with the idea across the 80 feet so this we saw the thing about you know my simple it looks very happy doesn 't he traces give me my promoted nothing I think I just to keep eggs and checked on you can do another one now it looks even more I love the things i love this piece up I love this world do great musician best rhythm guitar planet now I 'll understand there 's just nice to see me it 's nice to be here that 's this key fits just died I crash on a watercolor paper any any questions yes it is yeah I work a chorographical with that good question what I do is I their photographic records achieve things like that I put them on a lightbox might work with fairly white paper that paper is very likes 18 itsm run a 95 grams per square meter and as shows them so we put them on a lightbox we don 't like boxes yeah actually breaking you put that on a light box it shows for the nineties paint spray on top of it I used to like using big brushes that come from fine point see some guys with a personal thank you get paid on a boat anchor based on its and the paper has to have been of God southcrest paper will draw the paint from the brooch and you get a big bang crystals absolute baby that 's on top no questions that would take me down like four they would take me about I think I had to break them closes for me but that would take myself out the down take ballet out maybe 10 hours so it straight off well you have very good photo reference work so this platter you were to publish them questions the photograph being somebody else 's visually or is that solution now that 's fine is there is no copyright reflects once I hated it the stars are

webinar is titled a call for action and uh in this webinar professor daryl low choi from griffith university will prove present the findings of a recent survey it was which was undertaken to increase the community 's engagement with community-led resilience planning project so just some housekeeping as we progress through daryl 's presentation i 'll ask that you post any questions you may have in the chunk chat function on the top of the screen looks like a little chat icon and you can post questions up there and what we 'll do is when we finish the presentation we 'll come back to those questions and then run through some of those as time allows so before we do i 'd like to extend a warm welcome to mayor amanda finley who will carry out the acknowledgement of country and welcome you here today thanks shane and it 's really lovely to be here we do a webinar and how many times we uh you know think that we 're getting used to this technology and what we see before us is is no faces and that 's a really difficult challenge for everyone but i 'm sure that you 'll agree that today 's information will be is really interesting and of course is that call to action um or an appetite for action in regards to resilience and our communities attitudes towards that but can i begin by acknowledging country this land is was and will always be aboriginal land and i pay my respects to the elders of the past the present and the work that the elders are doing with the the future people who will be the the knowledge uh keepers into the the next generations and i know also i want to acknowledge that all of us are probably coming from all sorts of different um tribal group country and obviously daryl coming into us from queensland today he 's coming in from the murray country rather than the curry country and i 'm sure he can tell this afternoon and just a few opening remarks i want to thank daryl and his connection to shoalhaven this is in his first round of the kitchen with shoalhaven city council he 's he 's been down here before and worked on other projects with us so he knows the lay of our land really well and he knows many of our people quite well and i thank daryl and his team for taking the risk and and joining on for this i think is another groundbreaking um piece of work that 's being done by shoalhaven and i just want to thank all of you as participants for joining in today i know that our time is valuable and as we lead up into christmas and the the christmas craziness hits us that it 's all starting to feel you know a little bit busy back in the shoalhaven so i really do value the time that you 're bringing to this project today as well and just in a few words you know i think that we all felt then the disappointment coming out of glasgow from the those issues squarely back on uh communities like shoalhaven to continue to work uh not just on our resilience but on our sustainability and you know we love the place for the nature that it has all around us and we can live in harmony with nature we just have to work in collaborative ways to make sure that we understand what our role is so resilience is not just a buzzword you know we see it displayed in many places today but really what it 's about is about you know all of us doing our bits to not just bounce back to where we were before but to come back better than where we were before um and there 's so many different ways in which we can do that but i 'm going to hand over to daryl now to um i think that 's who i 'm handing over to maybe back to shane for another quick introduction um as we go through these very important community survey findings thank you thank you amanda for the introduction um we 'll just hand over to professor darryl you daryl thanks shane and thank you amanda for those kind words so this afternoon we want to present to the attendees the findings of the community survey which i guess most of you if not all of you took part in um i 'd also like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the country where each of us are meeting i 'm in queensland of course it 's terrible country in the middle of brisbane i 'd like to acknowledge the elders past and present and all the traditional owners of land and seascapes which have been the subject of our research so the purpose of today twofold it 's to present the results of the community questionnaire survey that 's been recently conducted and secondly is to highlight where the questionnaire survey of results fit into the overall planning process for your community led up community-led adaptation and resilience strategy for shoalhaven which of course is the bigger the bigger picture and the one that we hope to embark upon early next year covert permitting so the survey objectives um we designed this survey to collect data about hear about that today we want to understand communities views on aspects of the swot analysis about their region the strength weaknesses opportunities and threats that we 've analyzed and will continue to analyze about shoalhaven uh we wanted information about people 's aspirations for the future of the shoalhaven and we wanted information about community stance on the need for a long-term community-led adaptation and resilience strategy for the shoalhaven because adaptation uh relates to climate change and resilience is how we experience uh get exposed to but more importantly recover from from certain events uh we wanted information about people 's willingness to be involved in the development of a resilience and adaptation strategy and importantly in that regard we want people 's thoughts about personal and community efficacy yeah we 'll be sorry jane no sorry daryl oh okay i thought i thought i was getting a message um and in doing this survey we took the opportunity to collect some basic demographic characteristics of participants and so on right so those of you who attended an earlier presentation you would know that the way in which um all the different ideas and proposals that the show lab and community have both individually uh in your groups and this is the beginning of that process and what we intend to do with all these individual ideas and proposals from you folk is to pass them in through a planning process where they 're all tested so we we we will devise a test of the veracity of people 's ideas and proposals pass them through the planning process to come up with this community-led adaptation resilience strategy so this in other words is a comprehensive and consolidated approach to put all those individual ideas together and work out which ones should form part of the overall community-led adaptation and resilience strategy and what we say the byline here is collective action has greater weight than individual action so the swot analysis questions these were designed essentially to gain a better understanding of the assets the strengths the capabilities of the community as well as what you think are the risks and challenges in fulfilling your objectives here so principally we were seeking to find out what people out what 's what do you believe some of the issues are that are problematic in the region or what you would like to see improved thirdly we want you to identify external opportunities that could support a better more resilient shoalhaven and these could be economic in nature demographic could be dealing with a physical environment legislative local and national or international trends and then lastly we wanted you to identify external challenges or external barriers external obstacles you know to positive progress and examples here could have been environmental factors process of urbanization legislation funding resource sources international events beyond our control a lot of these are beyond our individual local control but they need to be identified to see how we can get around them should they occur now these initial findings particularly from the swot analysis we intend to explore in much more detail with the participants of the first workshop and we 'll talk about when we propose to have that first workshop covered permitting and i 'll just remind you about the overall process here of how we 're using a scenario planning and strategy for childhood so the first workshop uh is essentially defining the focal question for the process but that 's where we do the swot analysis and we start to develop the vision the second workshop um or the second phase is to identify certain uncertain drivers of change and you 'll see the color coding here blue is stakeholder task that is the participants from shoalhaven the yellow is the work from my team at griffith uh out of the first two stages we 'll develop scenarios based on those drivers of change you know what do you think is driving change now and in the future then we 'll assemble with your assistants uh some future options for dealing with those drivers of change that will lead to a next step where we test this this is the test that you saw in that previous diagram testing individual ideas testing individual proposals and we use scenarios to do that then we 'll develop what we call a roadmap or a storyline to go from the present to the future to our vision then we 'll add to this the approach to dealing with adaptation resilience planning and that 's a back casting process where we 'll jump to the future whether that be a future for shoalhaven in 2030 or 2050 and we 'll step back from that to see what policies we should have in place now to reach that vision of 2030 2050 or whatever so then we 'll review these policies and programs to see what needs to be amended or changed or introduced and that will give us what we call an adaptation pathway a pathway from now to the future to deal with where we can in the best way possible that the likely changes and events that we 're likely to encounter you know we can 't predict the future of course at least we can prepare ourselves for likely events and out of that we identify what we call mural indicators this is monitoring evaluation reporting implementation and learning to understand the adaptation approach to implementation right so that 's the process these are the six workshops where we have face-to-face uh contact um and as i said covert for meeting into new south wales um under a constraint free environment carry indications those barriers will be down by christmas and should that occur we plan to undertake these workshops in the first six months of next year but more about that later so challenges going forward there is an imperative to understand the needs the hopes aspirations and vulnerabilities and diversity of the shoalhaven community and we 're starting to get an understanding of that from this survey that we 've undertaken and you 'll see that in the results that i 'll present soon and lastly the other big challenge which again i 'll go into in more detail is we need to engage with all sectors of the shoalhaven community all sectors and that 's going to be a challenge but again we need advice and we need input and guidance from you folk as to how we can better achieve that so that 's the end of the introductory part i hope i 've given you a flavor for where the results that i 'm about to present to you will fit in to the overall planning put them on the chat and we 'll address those at the end eh what i 'd like to do now uh is go to the next presentation okay so if um shane and sharon can just tell me is that new powerpoint being shared please it is daryl we can see that good okay thank you um so the title appetite for action will become the leading obvious to you when you see these survey findings because it certainly looks that way to us so in a nutshell this community survey stayed open for two months uh and it was closed on friday the 17th of september and that 's given us sufficient time to extract the results from surveymonkey and to analyze there was those results and put them together for today and into a report you should be aware that there 's a complimentary youth survey uh being undertaken right this minute it was open in mid-august and we 've left it open to to to the end of the of the school year which will be next year sorry next week i think grade 12 and off at the end of the school year there 's currently 41 respondents to that youth survey which is very encouraging so we 're getting to that age group and don 't forget i mean when you 're talking 2030 2050 it 's the future of these youth that 's really important um people like myself uh you know we 're done and dusted by 2030 2050 but it 's the youth that are important to pick up on their views their aspirations their vision overall for the main survey we had 390 responses and that was a mind-blowing number for us we 're extremely pleased there around 70 of those 390 had a full completion rate so not all of the 390 respondents answered all the questions of the 390 about 260 70 percent complete at all so what i 'm about to present to you today is the responses from the 260 people who completed the survey and that 's a really respectable number uh the responses were from a diverse uh age group but as you might anticipate the dominant group were aged over 60. so 58 diverse localities across the charlotte haven and i 'll show you a map of that distribution in the presentation uh 60 were females 40 males uh six six respondents preferred not to say uh what their agenda was so again that 's reasonably balanced i suppose um it was predominantly non-indigenous the respondents are eight people did identify as indigenous uh in their responses so uh it 's not as if indigenous voices weren 't part of this it 's just that they 're lower number so about the age group um well the largest um cohort is the 60 to 69 um and then 70 to 84 that 15 year eight h cohort another 20 but you can see the distribution there um you know it 's as we were expecting what we weren 't expecting was no representation from the 18 to 24 year old you can see that is missing entirely we got no responses from that age cohort now you know i guess in terms of the demographics of shoalhaven there is a preponderance of people that are in the older age groups so you know know as well as i do there 's still some 18 20 24 year olds living in your community um so we 're going to have to find a way to engage with them the 25 to 34 year olds the you know predominantly young married couples starting careers starting families only three percent um it 's an issue that we 've encountered previously particularly in the shoalhaven but it 's not restricted to the show labor by any means so again we need to put our thinking caps on how to engage with that younger age group because again it 's their future that we 're talking about so where did they come from well 57 locations and the map says it all the size of the circle gives you an indication of the number of responses from those locations they 're quantified there on the left-hand side but again it 's encouraging that we 're not dealing with just coastal communities we 're dealing with inland communities here as well and they would have a different take on the issues so you know i 'm encouraged by that came from uh duration of residence in the shoalhaven well again this is encouraging because look at that over just over 50 of respondents had spent lived in the show labor community for more than 10 years you know so we 've got a lot of experience coming in here if you take the next cohort uh people living four to ten years 30 so there 's 80 straight away of all respondents that you know have got some experience of life in the shoalhaven so so obviously they if they participate with us uh in the workshops then we can be assured that we 're drawing upon their experience they know what they 're talking about all right so again you know time will tell when we can start to conduct the workshops whether we 're tapping into this experience but i 'm sure we will be okay what were people 's experience with extreme weather events and what is their sense of that threat so we 're dealing with a whole range of extreme weather events you know it 's not just fire it 's flood as well participants 96 in fact have experienced extreme weather event and of those 93 percent experienced it within the shower haven now it 's extremely important we tap into that experience it 's extremely important that those people participate in the workshops to make the output the adaptation and resilience strategy a meaningful document and of course the events included as those indicate those photographs indicate flood fire tornado extreme heat over 43 degrees celsius extreme wind extreme rainfall events these are all you know extreme weather events that the shoalhaven has experienced and will experience into the future we don 't know when and we don 't know how extreme but that will happen and 76 of the respondents felt threatened personally threatened by these extreme weather events so there 's proof enough that something 's got to be done so the next there was a question that asked what impact of these extreme weather events worried you the most um the table on the left is just to give you the data can i refer you to the graph on the right so the major impact that most people impact was to infrastructure now roads bridges social infrastructure as well as physical [Music] nearly 70 again damage to personal things like home and car loss of life two-thirds social impacts you know impacts the livability in the life just over fifty percent and so on so it gives us a good clue as to where people want to prioritize so that that that sort of data that you 're seeing there gives us a clue as to where to prioritize future policies so factors that people felt influenced the frequency and severity of extreme weather events this is subjective but it 's based on experience and it 's based on knowledge um and the the word cloud here says it all so we we took all the results and we then present them to you as a word cloud so what 's that cloud telling us well it tells us that the terms climate change and global warming were mentioned 190 times in the responses that you gave us 74 percent and again again um it says it all and you know i think amanda summed that up in it says well it might be disappointing it looks like it 's up to you and i it looks like it 's up to local communities and councils local authorities to get on and do this and you know there 's an appetite to do it as you 'll see so why don 't we do it um nearly a third said inadequate planning and land use management issues um were influencing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events that was mentioned 82 times and natural fluctuations in weather weather patterns uh 11 so again we 've got a fair idea what people think about this whole issue about frequency and severity of extreme weather events so what did you say about the influence of human activity on extreme weather events uh well nearly all participants 98 thereabouts if you if you take the totality not just a great deal and a lot in a moderate amount add those all together most participants believe that human activity influences the frequency and severity of human uh i 'm sorry of extreme weather events only about two and a half percent what do people say was the relationship between perceived level of threat and extreme weather events and human influence on extreme weather events so um look at the set of figures on the right hand side of the figure those who believe that there was some connection a great deal is just standing out above all the other responses so again when we start to cross correlate a lot of the results from this survey and we will be doing more as time permits and we 'll get a richer understanding about how the respondents in shoalhaven feel about issues related to the themes of this this project so then the question was asked about the unique special important uh issues about the scholar region and this is where we 're doing beginnings of a swot analysis we 're trying to find out what do people think are the positives and again this word cloud you know it starts to just throw it in your face um with what people believed were then the assets if you like the uniqueness of the shyhaven so the strengths word clouds don 't in that sense the results didn 't give us a specific theme there was a diverse range of responses and we have to unpack this in greater detail particularly in the workshops this is an area that needs open frank discussion in a face-to-face context so we couldn 't gauge any specific theme out of the results from the survey but these are some examples there was a feeling that inadequate physical infrastructure was a weakness and as you can see there some of the examples people gave in the small print so inadequate physical infrastructures infrastructure was a weakness poor emergency preparedness was a weakness identified but it wasn 't by a large proportion and what we 're putting in brackets after are either examples or in this case in red quotes these are quotes from some of the surveys that people responded to land use planning over development and again a quote from one of the respondents just to give you a flavor for what people are trying to say to us here poor communications with communities i don 't think any of these would be new to 's a question of how we deal with them now that 's a longish quote but it gives you some flavor for what 's being said there and lastly political deniers denialism and inaction on climate change you know and i think we 've settled out so we know what the challenges are all right opportunities strengths opportunities these are external opportunities that could support a better more resilient childhaven people found this a tough question to answer that 's our take on the responses again there was a very diverse range of responses but there was nevertheless a strong focus on the urgency of the of the need for policies around climate change mitigation and adaptation and environmental protection that was no surprise to us so i 'm just going to give you a couple of quotes here from people they 're anonymous of course but it gives you a flavor for how people are responding to this question about opportunities it doesn 't quite fit but it 's a response to this question nevertheless so again you can see how this sort of question needs to be addressed can 't_''_2092.24 be done properly by a questionnaire survey it can 't_''_2095.919 be done properly online you need an open forum face-to-face to discuss this so that 's why it 's important we get maximum attendance at these workshops uh threats that 's how it was defined external factors or obstacles that could prevent shoalhaven from achieving positive progress and becoming a better place to live and visit now don 't forget these are often outside your control but again the responses we got were very diverse and some examples of what people gave as examples of what they saw as threats okay so when we now look at the vision because the vision is important in this exercise as it is in all strategic planning exercises this is what 's going to guide us in our decision making in this planning process so once we settle on the vision up front you know out of the first workshop that 's remains it it remains in place we don 't we don 't go back and adjust it or cut you because we need that vision to guide us in future scholar well perhaps that does it 's not green in it well there 's another coastal futuristic city is that what you fake think charlavon is well no one have a heart attack you can get up off the floor now because i can assure you none of those images are reflected in the visions of the participants so none of those illustrations represent any response we got so we 're not dealing with any of those images i think at this stage we 'd say your vision could be summed up as a place of smiles we 'll test that but clearly respondents wanted the natural environment protected in a future vision they wanted enhanced community preparedness to natural disasters they wanted improved infrastructure and services they want a vision that promotes and supports a diversified economy you told us you wanted a vision that possessed better relationships with first nation people you also told us you wanted improved governance and you wanted to explore ways to enhance communities input into planning and you wanted to maintain current population density so i think you can see we 're should find their way into a vision statement for a future shoalhaven 20 30 2050 we will we 'll decide on what timeline we develop that vision for when we have our first workshop that 's one of the issues to discuss all right so there you have it a place of smiles and hopefully we can find ways to retrofit all those elements into a vision statement for a future shoulder so an appetite for action how did we get to that well we asked you the question should charlotte haven city council how to have an adaptation and resilience strategy is a simple enough question what would you tell us well that says it all does it not i don 't know who the 3.45 were that said no but i don 't think that matters because overwhelmingly 80 nearly 84 said yes so i think there 's the authority from the community to go ahead so now we had a question try to tease out what you thought were individual and communal sense of efficacy in doing this so nearly 40 percent believe that as an individual 40 percent thought as an individual they could do that but more importantly nearly two-thirds believe that as the community they can influence the development of the strategy that point is important but two-thirds of the respondents think that they can do it as a community not as an individual but as a community so that gives us the authority to keep going in the form of a community community-led strategy not a council-led strategy a community-led one so having got to that point we then ask the question how should the community be involved well these are all the ways through surveys social media tandoor meetings workshops submissions community forums community expert panels advisory boards specialized committees so again in one manner of form most if not all of those approaches will be picked up not necessarily in the preparation of the strategy but in its implementation so don 't forget we 're thinking about not just how to come together and prepare this strategy but more importantly how the heck are we going to implement it and this set of issues here like techniques methods a lot of parcel uh of the core of the preparation of the strategy we 've already done surveys we 'll do submissions in the next couple of months so that 's what you told us and i think we can meet that so the critical considerations of these you said that all consultation and communication should be handled in a transparent and inclusive manner and the council and certainly griffith are doing a darnest to meet that requirement and i think what 's happened to date you 'd have to agree that has been the case you said that engagement activity should be supported by expert knowledge and endorsed meaningful sorry meaningfully by council and again i think the evidence suggests that well the evidence proves that that 's been done and to be more expert knowledge put into this process and we 've got the full support of council you said there should be opportunities for involvement well advertised timing should be carefully considered and enable diverse their participants to attend and i hope most of you if not all of you participated in that poll that was just done in appropriate time for the workshops to commence and we 've taken that information on board and setting out a tentative timetable or draft timetable for the workshops the diversity of participants well i think i 've highlighted the challenges that we see but you know we 're only academics we 're only researchers and we 're up here in brisbane and we 're not locals it 's going to be up to the locals on the ground to get us that diversity of participants how to tap into those youth i mean we 've done a lot of work with um with the sussex inlet community in the past uh and we did have youth on our working group but they were sons uh we didn 't have any daughters we had sons of some of the working group members so maybe you could encourage some of your children who fought into that youth category cohort to participate i 'm sure that we can rely on you folk to give us a hand to get that diversity covered there um i mean you need to you said we needed to and personal agendas and some of you have been in workshops that i 've run previously you know that we have a set of protocols and they are given up front to all participants and we manage the workshop behavior according to those protocols so rest assured we 've got that base covered and lastly you said ensure that there 's adequate resources allocated for the implementation of such a strategy well that 's an ongoing discussion councils are involved in this process so i think those resources for implementation will come naturally but it 's something that we 'll be having a very close look at as we progress so to sum it up at griffith here we find these survey results very encouraging and there are testimony that we 're dealing with a community that 's well engaged it 's enthusiastic about improving their backyard and their capacity to plan respond and recover from extreme weather events and other disasters it 's clear as crystal now the many detail responses have also revealed that we 're dealing with an experienced community that 's got an intrinsic knowledge about sholhaven can become more adaptive and resilient that resilient in the future now despite the relatively high response rate to the survey we would acknowledge there 's still many voices in the community that haven 't yet been heard and i i 've discussed that so i won 't labor that point except to encourage you to help us this survey is only the first opportunity for community engagement and it follows it 'll be followed by a range of other activities including webinars workshops and so on that we will be facilitated by my team from griffith university and the results of this survey they provide an important context to an input for the upcoming workshops and they will be incorporated into future community led strategies that we develop so thank you for that happy to take questions and back to you shane good thank you very much daryl it 's um i think i 'd like to thank daryl and posit from griffith university from for for taking the time to help us prepare the survey it wasn 't planned it was never originally part of the engagement the covert situation we had this year and the border restrictions and and lockdowns we saw that it was an opportunistic time to reach out and and and do some further engagement with our community and it 's really great to have such a positive response to that and um and it 's really great to see how daryl 's been and the team have been able to interpret that data and give us that information back and you can see how now that can provide a good basis for moving forward with the workshops so we 're currently reviewing that um project report for that survey that daryl and the team have provided and we 're going to put that in a format that can be distributed around that to all the participants probably next week after we 've had the chance to uh to um to pretty that up and and produce a few guys so um moving forward where as daryl said we 're looking at early next year running the workshops and we 've sent out a poll recently to try and engage try and gauge resoundingly the majority of people have been in uh back in touch with us have said that february is going to be the preferred start date so if we start any earlier than that we knew that january is going to be problematic so at this stage we 're looking at february next year and uh daryl and team are going to are working on a timeline now of workshops that will uh commence in february and and move forward from that date onwards so as soon as we have those dates firmed up we 'll reach out to you again and let you know when those dates are going to be so we can get them locked in and i really look forward to getting involved in those projects and getting face to face with everybody and as darryl and posita are two it 'll be uh great to actually get this project underway face to face so um i 'm just going to have a look here at uh we 've only haven 't gotten many questions daryl so that 's a good i think that 's a that topic really well and i think i 've just got a suggestion here of engaging schools uh engaging with the youth fire schools and established youth youth groups and um i can just let everyone know that um that has been done quite extensively and one by the survey that we 're trying to do but we 're also been waiting for the schools to get back face to face and trying to work that in with their curriculum and having that survey distributed through the school networks and newsletters themselves so we can get some more engagement with that and now our youth engagement officer at council is actively working with those people across all the high schools uh locally as well okay um just reading some more questions here um it just says it 's really great to hear how much interest there is in the community it 's it 's a shame that young people haven 't taken part yet and are there any participants that can help with getting some local youth people involved again that just speaks to what i said previously yeah we hard to engage with younger people especially on topics as complicated as this but uh we are trying to do our best to get as much engaged engagement as possible sorry can i make a comment shane please daryl am i still yeah i 'm still able to be heard um one technique we 've run in the past in childhaven and we would propose to run it again should the need arise is for my team to actually go and do some school visits uh and engage various groups into the schools and try to elicit i mean if the mountain won 't come to muhammad muhammad goes to the mountain so that 's the approach we 'll take should it should it be necessary but by hook or by cook we 're going to get that youth view in here how we get the 18 to what is it the 24 year olds the the younger married couples uh i don 't know that that that 's that 's the tricky one because they 're all busy starting families and starting jobs thank you daryl um i just community as well as three percent survey response rate is uh quite low and um again we 've tried to put the survey out to as many people as possible and but also by providing the links to the survey with people uh just the survey with people like yourselves enabled you to you forward that around uh throughout your networks as well so when you consider that we have had 390 responses to a survey that was very impromptu it suggested that the communications plan around that work quite well and that networking that you have done yourselves has worked well as well it is um i mean um it is hard to try and get uh get responses from some people in the community but um i mean it 's through networks like yourselves that that is also achieved okay there 's a few more responses about um people wanting to make sure that the youth are actively engaged in this process and um and as you as you 've heard we 've tried to address that where we can and we 'll continue to do so until or so okay well it looks like that we 're um it looks like we 're drawing the questions coming to a close now so um if there is no further uh questions that people have for the panel then i 'll probably draw this uh webinar to a close and thank um professor daryl o 'joy for the work he 's put into the survey and uh and uh mayor amanda finley for joining us as well and um i just it 's very promising for our um our workshops as we move forward we 've got a really strong foundation and really in uh looking forward to getting together next year as we 've talked about so i um yeah thank you all for coming along and attending today it 's really great to see how many people have come along we 've had what 30 33 people in the in the meeting right now and um yeah it 's really uh encouraging to see people turning out for this so without further ado i 'll call call it a day and thank you all very much for coming along thanks shane thanks daryl you _"

    "text": "madame councillors thank you very much for the opportunity of presenting today i 'm just going to share screen so today i 'd like to present on the social impact assessment that we did between january and march this year on the proposed development it was a very comprehensive sia with a demographic and locality analysis housing market analysis crime and safety analysis extensive community consultation and then an analysis of the reasonableness and factual basis of those concerns that were raised by the community in terms of the overall findings on balance uh we found that there is a strong net positive social impact particularly from the increased housing diversity and affordability in locality as you 'd be aware there 's a much older and a rapidly aging population very very high rates of housing stress particularly smaller very low and low-income households for all ages there were no one-bedroom apartments available in postcode or in the dcj data at that time only a handful of two-bedroom apartments available and a very very high rate of moderate income and low-income essential services workers amid this very poor housing supply for rent and for purchase by many low-income and modern income renters and purchases it 's likely to house a high proportion of smaller working households a lot of them will be essential service workers in their locality it 'll meet a major gap in terms of housing diversity and it certainly supports council and state government strategic planning objectives there 's the potential for adverse social impacts there was significant community concern and opposition to the proposed development however in terms of the factual basis there was really no basis in the analysis of the demography and so on for the crime and safety concerns raised one of the major concerns raised if not the major one was the wrong perception that it was going to be public housing of course that 's not the case though it would be preferable if some were affordable to very low income people and privacy concerns uh which again appear to be unfounded given where it is and the configuration of the dwellings and the character impacts also appear to be mitigable as has been known about other experts in terms of impact uh experts on that and certainly one of the only issues i think that was raised that was considerable was um the valid concern um about poor public transport and certainly in recommendations we would say there 's a very strong need for council to advocate in that regard for all residents so in conclusion likely there will be net positive impacts and it 'll make a very important contribution to housing diversity and affordability in that local context thank you very much for your time _"

    "text": "me [Music] i can 't believe i did [Music] the shoalhaven is prized for its unspoiled beaches abundance of natural beauty and wildlife and its relaxed lifestyle spanning across four thousand kilometers on the south coast of new south wales the region is valued by residents and tourists alike for its strong community spirit and connection to nature for many the impact of the bushfires in the summer of 2019 not only devastated the land and the wildlife but also the very spirit of the shoalhaven community the carawan and combatant fires saw over 80 per cent of the shoalhaven impacted with hundreds of thousands of hectares of natural environment burned hundreds of homes destroyed and tragically three lives lost [Music] after 74 days the fires were extinguished the 7th of february 2020 marked the end of the fire and the start of recovery [Music] hello i 'm michael i 'm the local catholic priest here in milton and that takes in the communities of aaladala and sussex inlet and places all around and one of our commitments at the moment as a faith community is to be out in following the devastating black summer bushfires we saw this space as an opportunity to support people in a variety of ways so the past year for our local community has been very unsettling but it 's been extraordinary to see the resilience of people there 's been a lot of pain and there still is a lot of fragility among our community and particularly now that the um you know immediate needs have been in some ways responded to shelter and safety now people are dealing with some very strong internal emotions and there 's a strong need we believe for people to tell their story to do that in a safe way to do that in a non-threatening way and to do that in a creative way [Music] hi i 'm peter dover and i 'm from salt ministries here in the shoalhaven and we just work with those that are struggling and those that have been struggling throughout the cohen bushfires we 've just been helping in the area of neriga in the area of kangaroo valley and in the area of conjolla park we have now marked havoc in the shoalhaven unfortunately recovery takes some time many have lost homes and suffered damage to property and many are still working out the trauma they 've endured it 's important that every person impacted in our community knows that they see the support of the broader community you don 't need to do it alone there are organizations for you to connect with and together we can shoulder the journey of recovery the strength of a community is grounded in its ability to reach out and connect to one another in the midst of suffering and great hardship the people of the shoalhaven rose to the challenge last year with grit and determination we face such great devastation and we continue to rise every time we reach out to one another and offer support our effort our finance our love and our hope for a better tomorrow each of us have this unique opportunity to be the light in someone 's darkness to love our neighbour to care for the poor downtrodden or homeless remembering that we have a god who loves us exactly as we are and radiate light and that light is contagious as we move together into 2021 i 'm confident that we have an incredible road ahead of us as a community with fresh vision towards the future let 's walk in solidarity with one another because collectively we are the show [Music] well my name is jan fricken i i am at the moment i am the i own the supermarket investments bay but i also a co-facilitator of the show heaven and europa dala multicultural group and before that for about 12 years i was working for lawrence multicultural services providing support to migrant refugees so we started the facebook group course of course community support group which i mean focus on at that time push by support and not knowing that job will become a full-time job for a few months for me and so so what what what we did as a group you know like i said my strength in community development so what we did as a group we actually asked people out there you know what they can help you know for example say people from long another area someone would contact us or private message me i guess that okay i have a bed i have two bedrooms at queen 's bed i have post float i have a car and that 's how i can help and so on and so on and and that 's when the first time that i actually feel wow you know this is this is really powerful this is the the string of the community you know when you when i think about each time about that i still cry and can 't believe how everyone have come together to support each other i still see people every day most of the week coming to talk to me and and we still have tears and so nonetheless you know i think this bushfire thing does one beautiful thing about this boots for is it actually brings company closer and it 's sad but at least we will learn from from what 's happened in the last past year and i just hope that you know the community will be connected just like that in the future [Music] my name the although aboriginal landscape i provide a number of services in my community including welcome to countries smoking ceremonies bush tucker tours history tours as well as cultural education [Music] my role in the community i represent our local land council in various areas um also support our local members and neighbouring communities as well yes after the year that we 've had with 2020 um you know the country 's sick it 's been sick for a very long time and uh after the fires and all the devastating stuff that 's happened in 2020 we still have a lot of cleaning up a lot of work to do before we can restore our country to the way it needs to be not only that you know the effects of losses of homes and wildlife and and you know just other resources in the country it 's absolutely devastating you know the emotional and mental effect that has taken its toll on people as well one thing that represents our community most the one thing that stands out to me is the strength of people you know very emotional that lost their homes and and things like that myself my grandparents and family members and close friends lost their places and you know it 's devastating for me sitting back and even looking out on country now and seeing a lot of country without any canopy on the trees and scorch burnt land and it 's just very devastating and i think the way we go from here is not only to work together as one but to rebuild for the for the better of our next generations to come i think the strength of our communities and that our people ourselves is the one thing that stands out the most [Music] hi i 'm mayor amanda finley the challenges of 2019 and 2020 may be behind us for now but we still have a way to go on our resilience journey and the way that we can do that is to work together and to continue to keep our community bonds the stay kind movement asks us to consider doing one act of kindness every single day and even when we 're at the depths of darkness if 'll make an amazing difference not just for ourselves but for the recipient of our act of kindness make 2021 your year of acting kind of being a community focused person we 've got so many of them the shoalhaven that we 've got a lot to celebrate and by the time we get to our second anniversary of the tragedies that we 've been through we 'll be in a better place i 'm positive of that we can remain optimistic we can go on the resilience journey together we 've got some way to go but so far we 've done really well so let 's lift one another up let 's continue to do the hard work together and we 'll get there thanks shoalhaven [Music] one year on there have been heartwarming stories of support shared within the community today we recognize the contribution the generosity and the goodwill of those who came to the aid of shoalhaven residents during the bushfires there are countless residents emergency support services volunteer groups and community service providers not-for-profits and government agencies who went above and beyond to protect takes time and that every individual is at a different stage of their recovery journey so let 's stay connected and committed to supporting one another as people begin to rebuild re-establish and grow together _"

recovery into resilience project information webinar today and thank you to the councillors who have joined our audience to support their community to start i would like to invite our shoalhaven city council mayor amanda findley to give an acknowledgement of country over to you amanda well good morning all and these are strange days indeed aren 't they where we get to to come online and you know this workshop was meant to be face to face down at our emergency operations center but the way that the situation has unfolded here we are doing our very best and in doing our very best i do want to acknowledge that the country that we 're on is you and country and that there are many tribes across the shoalhaven the jaringer the narrow lands council and also the aladdulla lands council and i really want to pay my respects to all of the elders our local with the impacts of the covert pandemic and we 've had issues in the past around pandemics and epidemics that have you know done a lot of damage to our aboriginal populations in our communities and we wish them all of the best during this time this land is was and will always be aboriginal land and as we move through um from you know into our recovery and resilience what we can look upon is watching our landscape return because recovery means so much to so many people and that 's just one part of that journey so we watch our landscape landscape grow and those new shoots give us the hope that our lives can return to normal but there 's also the recovery of our mental health and our mental health is really important and if any time during this discussion because we never know what 's going to you know trigger our thoughts to go back to those dark days but if they anything is triggered for you today and i 'm hoping that it 's not um please make sure that you reach out and back to us when you 're ready we 'll we 'll still be here until the finish time and of course then there 's the physical space and rebuilding our homes and making sure that we 've got roofs over our heads and that those roofs that we have are better than what they were before because when we build back we really do want to have to build back better and to enjoy that that new sense of ownership that we have of a place but resilience and recovery do go hand in hand and what could be better than facing the next disaster and feeling a high level of confidence that what you 're about to face that you 've got the right information that you know what to do and you know where to go when things are really bad and that 's why i really i 'm so behind this resilience project because at the end of the day it is about people and it 's about our people doing the very best that they can whenever times are tough we 've done okay but how see during the the next little while that there are plans afoot that we can do it better but we need you our people to make it work thanks and thank you jane i 'll hand back to you thank you mayor amanda i have a few housekeeping items to go through before i hand over to today 's presenters this webinar is being recorded and it will be posted on council 's website to allow the community who have not been able to join us today to view this webinar at their leisure with the flow of the webinar is intended to have a question and answer session at the conclusion of the presentations to answer any questions and i encourage guests to post their questions in the chat room and at the end of the session our moderators will read them out and refer the item onto our panel of presenters to provide an answer the question answers will also be recorded and posted to our get involved page and we will post the information on the get involved page at the end of this presentation now our duncher who will provide some background as to how this project came about so over to you stephen thanks very much jane uh and good morning everybody or afternoon whenever you are watching this webinar um as jane said stephen duncey is my name i 'm the chief executive officer of shoalhaven city council and i 'm very pleased to be with you today to participate in this information webinar as others have said given these uncertain times it would be ideal that we 're meeting face to face to this as we got the opportunity to do through the uh the recovery project after the bushfires unfortunately we can 't_''_308.16 do that for lockdown for covered reasons but we do appreciate that not online webinar may not be the best way to provide the information but we 've all shown how adaptable we are in this difficult space that we 're in and i 'd like to say thank you for all of you for coming along to view the webinar just a bit of a background on this project itself we could just take a couple of minutes the devastating impacts of the 1920 or sorry the 2020 1920 bushfire season we saw many of our communities your communities isolated without power and communication for an extended period of time from this experience council identified an opportunity to provide reliable and authoritative information to those communities via the information hub technology upgrades at our local facilities the local information hub will provide as i said authority information and inform the community in a measured way so that res residents and visitors are able to be informed and to execute their emergency plans in good time and having real time information possibly one of the most endearing features of the communities within the shoalhaven is their isolation as we all know which presents the largest risks and to those one road in and those one road out communities also many communities populations expand as we know many many times over in the holiday periods making it most important that that real-time information is made available the information hub will allow emergency services to enforce warnings and for messaging when other options may not be available pleasingly this infrastructure spend business and supporting local jobs in the shoalhaven chologen city council wishes to thank very much the new south wales government and the commonwealth government for collectively contributing 2 million dollars towards this project and we hope that you find this uh this webinar interest interesting and informative and so on that note i 'll hand back to jane to continue with the other present presentations thank you john thank you ceo stephen our next presenters are vince di pietro and anthony russell vince will be known to many of you already from his role as the local recovery coordinator in the aftermath of the 2019-2020 black summer bushfires vince is an integral part of the recovery into resilience project and continues in a coordination role with oversight of this project joining vince for this part of today 's information presentation is anthony who is council 's principal electrical engineer vince and anthony will be talking to you about the recovery into resilience project and more specifically the local community information hubs so over to you vince and anthony thanks very much jane and uh thank you very much uh for your introductions good morning everybody and uh and i just want to acknowledge uh that there will be a diversity of awareness about this project online today some of you will have heard this background briefing a few times some of you are new to the new to it so what i intend to do is keep it as simple as i possibly can give it a very much a high level view perhaps if i could use the analogy of a helicopter view and then if you have any questions that you would like to ask about the project please feel free to make sure you log your uh your questions on and we 'll get to those towards the end of the of the presentation so straight into it thanks uh thanks sharon next slide okay um we know where we have come from um if you have a look at the middle picture there which is on your screens now that 's our recovery infographic and it gives a pretty good idea of what we all lived through in in the fire period in the fire a an extremely successful and effective recovery action plan to deal with the effects of the carowind bushfire and the very last page of that plan sought to lead into the future by saying that what we need to work on is our resilience and our ability to understand with good and realistic information exactly uh what the circumstances that we might be uh not aware of beyond our own communities looks like hence to the right hand side of your screen right now came the recovery into resilience project action plan dated october last year and it 's available on the rrp page of the shoalhaven city council website and i 'd encourage you all if you haven 't already seen it to uh to look to look at that document to see what the project is basically about on to the next slide please and we 'll get a really good overview of what the project is is really ostensibly dealing with there are three lines of work attached to the project the first is work stream one which we call work stream one and that 's where as we possibly can with our partners griffith university to start looking at how to plan and and look for adaptive strategies for the future to be able to involve the community and the strategic level of staff planners inside council in tailored workshops to work out what we want the 10 to 20 year picture to look like and to make sure that the community is a part of that most importantly not only is the community a part of it but bringing the reality of sorry bringing the expectations of community into the same workshops as the reality of budget and timing required to get these things done will allow us to get a really good look at what the future might look like and how we need to adapt to uh to get there so work stream one 's progressing well not with standing covered which is uh putting a couple of speed bumps in our way but it 's not stopping us so work stream one has had in the most recent times about 368 people respond to an online survey to help shape the workshops griffith university team joining us from queensland we 've also had council initiated youth surveys issued which we 've had at last meeting of last wednesday it had been on the streets for about a week or 10 days we 've already had 16 replies completed replies from the youth of the shoalhaven as well because we need to be very well aware that they will be the recipients of the planning that we look at the second part of the project is work stream two and i 'm not going to steal any of michael payne or his team 's thunder because that 's what the primary reason for this webinar is about but suffice to say it 's about looking at more of the here and now what 's the nearest crocodile to the canoe what do we need to be getting on the underway to uh to get ourselves resilient and ready for the future the third part of the work to be done is the local information hubs and i 've asked the the city council 's principal engineer to join me in explaining that because and authoritative information to a place inside our communities which we know is not going to suffer any disruption due to anything that can affect a terrestrial mast or radio mast through which mobile phone signals come or the power which comes through the power lines which disrupts and gets gets interrupted more than once in a year for all sorts of reasons but the primary idea of this is to be able to provide at these identified local information hubs which are council owned amenities in our local communities with authoritative timely and accurate information what that is about is to really inform the public in good time inform our communities in good time especially the visitors to our places in the summer months for example of what is happening in the broad and what we 're actually going to be asking the community to uh to understand is happening in and around them but most importantly it 's to provide the information in a timely way so that we can encourage people to leave and to do the things that they 've got to do in a good do is i 'll hand over to the principal engineer because you 're going to see some of this work happening right now from now in your local areas and some some sites have already seen the the work start so i 'll hand over to anthony and then i 'll come back and round up with uh with a few uh a few sort of fun facts at the end of it so over to you anthony thanks vince and uh thank you jane for the introduction so good afternoon everyone as mentioned on the um principal electrical engineering here at council and i 'm involved in project managing um some of the components in stream three so only a few weeks ago on the 25th of august we had wild winds in excess of 130 kilometers an hour this resulted in widespread power and communication outages and road closures a total of eighteen thousand homes across the shorehaven were without power and some without communication and you 're all aware that being being in one of these beautiful show haven towns with one road in one road out storm event rolls in one afternoon and leaves a town without power and comms and road closures on the main road you may also find yourself in a situation where you struggle to find authority reliable information on what 's going on beyond the town and also the sun is setting so there 's a potential to be without any lights however soon there will be an information hub at your doorstep this information hub will have uninterruptable power from the tesla battery for essential equipment like lights and vans gpos for charging your phones and ipads power to a non-terrestrial based communication system that doesn 't rely on towers that is susceptible to weather and fires this this communication system channels authority reliable information to a monitor that is also powered by the tesla battery and a telephony system that which allows verbal communication to emergency services this information is about reliability particularly reliability of communication from reliable and authority sources there will be 23 of these information hubs across the shell haven including amongst those sites are public halls community centres show grounds and holiday haven the local seven and ten kilowatts as you can see on the slide there the photo the right is um it 's the systems installed on top of kalala bay community center uh next slide please show the solar pv system charges an appropriately sized tesla battery and only and any excess power goes to either the facility or back to the grid so the photo on the left there shows you how you can real-time monitor where the power is coming from the photo on the right shows the the tesla battery and how much storage you 've got in inside inside the battery so this can be monitored in real time and will be available at each of the local information hubs on us on a monitor screen next slide please share it in the rare occasion that there is no available sunlight and the battery can 't_''_1074.0 be replenished by the solar panels there is a generator connection point to plug in the generator at the local information hubs there will also be an nbn commercial grade satellite which is the photo on the on the right this is bands have only become available in the skies above the south coast in the last month there will also be a monitor screen to display the authority of information as you can see the photo on the left and this will be enclosed inside a a framework which will be fixed to the building there 'll also be a telephony communication system to communicate the emergency services and minor building alterations um to matching with the building so that 's all that i 've got from the infrastructure point of view but you 'll see me around at these facilities over the next few months thank you thanks anthony um he 's uh he 's been pretty modest there what we need to emphasize is that this is actually happening right now the picture on the right is the installation that has just been installed to the pilot site at kalala bay the screen on the left has been manufactured and fabricated locally by south coast glass the frame which appears as an aluminium type frame there will be powder coated to exactly the same color as the kalala bay and be a part an integral part of the building and all up um it 's a pretty exciting place to be so a couple of a couple of facts i 'd just like to wrap up with before moving the the presentation on so we can get to your questions is that the lion 's share of the of the of the funding received from both state and federal government for this project except for the things that we don 't make here like samsung television screens and tesla batteries and live lg solar panels all of the other work that 's going to happen with this project happens locally so the lion 's share of the two million dollar frank grant funding which has been received will be spent locally and for the benefit of local companies the other thing which is important is that this is not a science experiment it 's not it 's not cutting edge technology it is contemporary technology it 's available commercially now but what is really special about this project is that it integrates the technology with the community engagement for with the help of the community into something which is usable at the sites by anybody who rolls up at the at the local information hub and wants to have a look and the information that 's on those screens will be designed and tailored to a certain number of screens on a rolling fashion a little bit like ordering your burger at mcdonald 's except you don 't order a burger you just read the information and um and it will be in a in a readable form which is um sensitive and and aware of the fact that what we 're trying to do is keep people informed year round and so the information will be available and accessible in formats which doesn 't mean you have to stand there for days and hours reading it but it 'll hopefully use the sorts of icons and pictures and messaging that makes uh instant sense to whoever 's reading it noting that we do get a heck of a lot of visitors in the especially in the summer months the final thing which is really important is that all that this is the start of something that can be as big as we want it to get so while there are all sorts of um ideas which make a great deal of sense that we could do with all of this namely why can 't we have it spread out to an app to people 's mobiles why can 't we have it more broadly transmitted rather than just at the one site the answer is we can but we need to start somewhere and we need to get the message to a recognized local information hub in the first instance and that 's what this project is about one slide i didn 't put up and i didn 't ask to have uh have shown and i won 't ask to go back now but we do meet as a team every week every wednesday afternoon at 1 30 for about an hour we allow for two but we generally meet for no more than an hour and we have representatives from all work streams and all of the key people in council to make sure that we times so we 've started this in december we 've met 31 times and we have uh have kept as closely as we can to the timeline which we submitted for the original funding and the deed of funding with the state government so that we are actually accountable for the delivery of this over the time that the project has been allowed which is effectively completed by the 30th of june 2022 with that i 'll hand back to jane and i look forward to your questions thank you vince and thank you anthony michael payne is our next presenter mike is council community connections department manager and has been with council almost two years within a few weeks of mike joining us at shoalhaven city council he was seconded into the recovery action team and headed up the social recovery stream mike and his team continue to have an important role in working with the community to grow and build community-led resilience to adapt and respond to disaster and emergency situations today mike will be sharing more information with you on the community readiness aspect of the project um yes as james said my name is mike payne i 'm the manager of community connections here at shaw haven city council um and i 'm working with a fantastic team on the community readiness aspect or the stream two aspect of the recovery to resilience project so next slide please share okay so um if you 've read the recovery into resilience project briefing you 'll see that we do have a vision for the shoalhaven the council 's vision is that the shoalhaven will emerge from the impact of the 2019-2020 bushfires and to prepare for future disasters in a better stronger and more resilient position than it was prior to the bushfire emergency this project the recovery into resilience project really is about working together to make our communities safer and more resilient to disasters next slightly shannon so vince has already spoken about this particular slide so i won 't repeat um what vince has said however the one thing i would just like to reiterate to go back to is the resilience planning so that is the stream one part of this work that um which will be rolled out throughout the next 12 months or so as soon as we 're able to and there is still an opportunity to get involved in those workshops if you would like if you are unable to commit to those workshops then we do have the surveys available the resilience planning surveys which are still open um and at the very end of this presentation there will be a link to our get involved page and i just encourage people to go to that get involved page where you 'll be able to find both the uh the uh the regular survey and the youth survey and really like to encourage people to complete those surveys if it 's all possible um okay let 's type your show so community readiness so this is the stream two part of the project and the community readiness component of recovery to resilience really is about comprising the short-term actions to enhance the availability of emergency planning information within our communities so council is going to engage um directly with communities to provide education on emergency preparedness and to program will also be complementing work that 's already underway to improve um tourist and visitor safety and emergency preparedness so part of the work will be the development of an all hazards information guide which will be provided to our tourism operators and particularly those really large scale operators the caravan and campsites and that will assist them in an emergency and we 're currently working with those providers and we 're consulting with those particular operators at the moment um this particular program is around engaging the community in the activation of the local information hubs um and that that that also forms part of this part of this activity stream now as as stephen and jane have both already mentioned and and and mayor amanda um our preference was always to hold um all these sessions face to face it 's very hard to do community engagement um via a webinar um however unfortunately the circumstances dictate that we we have to be reverting to an online format at this stage um when we 're able to we are really keen to come back out and start continue um planning to to deliver online um until we 're actually able to open up and and come and come out face-to-face so this this particular meeting was um supposed to be held at the emergency operations center um which would have given us all uh uh an opportunity to come together and and have further discussion discussions and we 're even gonna do a workshop component after this meeting but unfortunately that hasn 't been possible and then the follow-up engagements we were going to be coming out to each of the um the halls to do some pop-up engagements at the halls to meet with members of the community um to give them information about what this program was about and also to recruit them um into some smaller working groups as well and then that would have been followed up by some face-to-face community workshops where we would work in smaller groups to develop procedures and protocols for activating the information hubs okay next slide um so step two um so after this meeting what we intend to do and what we 'd like to do is to say will be held online um our workshop facilitator is here today so i believe david sanderson who 's here today will be speaking to you about what that the format of those workshops is going to be um but the first round of workshops will be working with um the people on this webinar around how we can engage more broadly with your local community so we really want to work with you and we 're looking for your guidance and support in who we should be engaging with and how we should be working with your communities um to identify people that maybe like to be part of the localized planning and also the activation of these hubs and then our second round of workshops will be very much focused around developing our local procedures and looking at the best use of the provided infrastructure um but as i say at the moment these um uh these workshops will all be held um online until we 're able to come back face to face and that in a nutshell is our stream too so as i with everyone when we can um but in the meantime very much looking forward to meeting you all online in our workshops if you 're available and with that back to you jane thank you mike our next presenter is professor david sanderson david is from the university of new south wales and he has over 30 years experience working across the world in development and emergencies david has published papers concerning urban livelihoods shelter and disaster risk reduction he has led post-disaster reviews across the world following natural and human-made disasters he is currently working with shoalhaven queen bien bieger and a number of other councils on bushfire recovery and resilience projects david has kindly agreed to assist trollhaven city council in our recovery into resilience project by assisting with the delivery of the community readiness component over to you david well thanks very much jane and thanks mike and thanks vince and uh it 's a huge privilege to be part of a program that 's so thought out so clearly well thought out and at the core of it is around ownership of people who are affected be better prepared so it 's uh it 's a huge privilege for myself to be part of this story and especially with stream two when it comes to engaging with community groups and others about ownership of the opportunities of how to be more ready when it comes to disasters and reduce or even prevent those from occurring can i ask please for the next slide i just have one slide very much following on from what mike was saying just to give a an overview i like what vince said the helicopter view is very much the big picture about the workshops and the point of that is because the workshop content is to be decided pretty much among those who are in it what 's very very important here i think you 're hearing throughout is is ownership ownership by uh communities and so these workshops uh follow on from this this webinar which is around sharing the information the first round of informal meetings we we might even call them meetings not even workshops meetings of course it would be much nicer to meet together and we are doing it online in this strange to two-dimensional reality but there it is we 'll probably meet for maybe 40 minutes an hour or longer if people like or shorter what we 'd like to do is put out invites for mornings afternoon evenings weekends really to work around the availability of people themselves and the idea is to to ask people to sign up to whatever uh meetings i 'd like to attend we 'll have a number of those it 's not around me it 's around people and and when you can make uh pretty informal but sort of work like uh sharing conversation uh frankly the less i 'll say the better of course uh because it 's around people themselves organizing what 's important and so the key question for each workshop just looking at the top there is how do we engage communities in the activation and use of local information hubs to build readiness that 's really the question it 's a hopefully a simple question and it 's around cup city and engaging and understanding and listening and all those you like very rough very much a starting point uh obviously we 'll do introductions and hello and it 'd be wonderful if everybody could speak because that 's very very important uh we 'll reflect a little bit on what we heard today from vince and from jane and from mike and others um and then we 'll just quickly talk about what is redness what does that mean we don 't have a prescribed idea of what that is but as has been said it 's the crocodile closest to the canoe um and and really focusing on that in this broader long-term context of course of resilience uh so this is very much plugging into that bigger picture and then and then we 'll ask the question well i might ask the question i said they 're not going to answer it how do we engage communities how do we how do we use these amazing resources the the comms the tesla battery everything else uh in in these communities to actually make them useful so they 're not just in the corner but actually are vibrant all all those things so that that 's the point of those conversations uh for those meetings i i i can 't wait i 'm really looking forward to them i certainly involved elsewhere before these things immensely enjoyable a huge privilege to engage and to listen and to collectively discuss these things uh and to see where it takes us so i hope that 's okay it 's very much an introduction a starting point and it should be a very enjoyable series of meetings so jane thank you very much and back to you thank you david and thank you to all our presenters we 'll now move on to the question and answer part of the information webinar i note that there have been some questions posed during the presentations and so if you have questions please keep those coming in i will hand over to vince di pietro for the recover the recovery into resilience coordinate to facilitate the q a and vince will impr invite the appropriate presenter to talk to the points that have been raised so over to you vince thank you you members from uh from the project um i think that was as as solid as an overview as we could provide given the uh the time and the constraints of uh of remote remote technology but we have had some good questions come in um and i in no particular order but i 'll try and uh get a few of these um a few of these uh up and up and out um the first question uh from anonymous was what 's the point of being able to charge up your phone or ipads or live laptops if you can 't access the signal via a commercial nbn dish that 's a good question but again it assumes that this is about general public access this is a local information hub to try and get authoritative accurate and timely information to the community in such a way as they are able to assess think decide and act the assumption that this is there for the inextremist part of an emergency where the fire has completely enveloped anything and we 've really got our backs the wall that is not function like that because one of the things we 've got to be very conscious of is that it 's the timeliness and the accuracy of information which is all important to make sure people know when to act in a timely and respond in a timely way especially with concurrent emergencies like covid now the notions of evacuation centers that perhaps had some attraction in the past i 'm afraid in the current day and age probably don 't carry the same attraction and most importantly that one of the key aspects of anything which is determined to be an evacuation center is that it must be able to be accessed in two ways by emergency and first responder teams so anywhere which is at the end of a one road in one road out which has the potential to be blocked we want to make sure that people are leaving those sorts of places or at least responding with their bushfire plans if it 's a bushfire that we 're responding to in an early and a timely way while for power for laptops and and um and if power for whatever reason has been disrupted somewhere upstream it 's an available amenity with the uh with the emergency um configuration of the power of the at the essential services to each place another question was will we have the sites published and the answer is yes if you go to the rrp page you will see that there are 23 sites they are all locally owned sorry council-owned local amenities they 're effectively the hub the little um halls and community centres and places which in the past have really largely sat awaiting the next booking for a social event with converting those to have their essential services powered by something which is not reliant on something bolded to the earth namely the sun and can be communicated with by something which is not reliant on something bolted to the earth namely a mobile phone tower so the answer to the question is yes you can see the sites they are council owned amenities hopefully we 'll have a little bit of um of budget left over to perhaps look at a couple of places which are of sense to equip with this equipment in due course another question from carol are there plans to consider access for people with limited mobility and for vision impaired people great question fortunately most of the places that we 're talking about because they are already owned by a local council by our by our council they do have things like ramps and uh and um mobility uh advantages already plumbed into them so they 've been built you know the ramps have been built for example at uh barrel lake there 's a terrific ramp there that goes into the hall um equally at lake congola community centre there 's there 's a great ramp so if the if the if the facility has already been addressed and looked at for those sorts of uh of access issues then this project won 't work won 't seek to touch or nor is it funded to to change any of that but what i can say is that most of the facilities that we 're talking about here already have been addressed in terms of limited mobility and access vision the next question which is will this thing be able to provide information in multilingual for people who aren 't english is not their first language um what i 'm trying to do and what we 're going to do with the local company called itbase camp which is the the it and software uh team in huskerson that we 're using to help us build the the five information screens on a rotating basis the key aspect of the information we want to have on the screens is that the information is not verbose so if you can use an icon like a picture that is to depict um you know tide or a picture to depict uh day hours of daylight or a picture to depict road closures that 's what we want to use so that people can actually just get to the screen see the icon realize oh that 's the picture about road closures and then if if we need to add any further information we can can it be multilingual obviously we 've got limitations and we can 't compromise the information for the we can do though is on one of the screens is encourage people to see in their own you know multilingual sort of listing if you like where to look if um they do happen to need to more information or if someone 's standing there can 't help so it 's a it 's a big question and as you as you consider when you consider the the number of um of um of people that have arrived in our in our country from all sorts of corners of the earth to cover every one of those languages is just not possible but we can make the best use of pictures possible to get them to the right information another great question was is it going to be audio or just visual the screens will just be visual and there will be a telephony connection to the sites so that if there is a need to contact either council or if the emergency operation centre is active contact the eoc there will be a means to do that and each site will have a means to to achieve that appreciate as we do our site surveys down the coast almost all the buildings are absolutely unique there 's no standard cookie cutter approach been applied here some of the buildings are amazingly modern and well equipped others not quite so and and what we 're trying to do here is at least to apply a fixed and a common standard a common um specification if you like to this project irrespective of what the building looks like so i 'm just going to walk down this list again and see what else we 've got uh information ralph cook today ralph thanks for all your help down down at um at your neck of the woods and as you can see we 're we 're going going down a good path there but information circulator is only as good as the input of the information to the system absolutely right all too often information from rfs and other services is out of date or confusing that 's uh that 's to to uh to uh that has very much been receiving a great deal of attention in things like how do we anticipate information being circulated in an efficient manner to make full use of the facility well what we intend to do is that information that man 's that that populates those screens now it 's not only just in times of emergency but year round will come from authoritative sources and it will be loaded only by those with authority to to load the information so if we 're coming in for example into an emergency period where let 's say the the eoc is uh is activated and we will then shift the communication point from the shoalhaven city council admin building to the eoc information that will be populated on the screens will come from the most authoritative source that we have and for those that have been to the eoc you 'll recall that it 's the very next room where all the first responders the emergency responders all live and they will be able to feed us with what information they have to be the most accurate at the time but and here 's the kicker because this is a local system and sort dependent on the site 's configuration if people in the community and that 's why stream two 's work is so important because if you are a part of this and you are volunteering your time and your and your dedication to making it work at the community end if you see something in your part of the world which has not been captured in any other way then this will be a way of getting your view of the situation to the right people at the other end of the phone so it 's a it 's a really it 's something we didn 't have 20 months ago is it uh is it the silver bullet no it 's not but it 's a darn sight closer to loading the magazine with a few bullets that will work and because it 's scalable and can be made to be broader in due course it 's a terrific place uh further down the track than we were 20 months ago and will be a very uh very good addition to the shoalhaven city council 's ability to communicate with the council so uh other questions here i 'm just looking down my little screen here uh from amy at husky thank you very happy to be involved thanks very much husky as you know we 've we 've been able to fit the battery the inverters and the um and the screen sorry the um solar panels to your community hall um and as soon as we 've done the kalala bay pilot site so that we can have a really good set of comprehensive pictures of what this actually looks like um we 'll be able to then move down to husky and to the other sides that have been very uh very cooperative in helping us get our um get our surveys done and get the configurations and the uh and the specifications worked um i think that 's all the questions i 'm just seeing if i 've got uh i think that 's it oh no here we go um husky hall was is a pilot hub we have the panels and tesla battery any update on the monitor screen and satellite internet capability 've done kalala bay we 're moving into uh into husky we 're not moving in we 're not going to be that pushy but but we 'll be down at husky to to build that little um that information hub up we talk about from amy and we talk about communications and power what about the physical safety of the buildings if there is a fire ravaging through the area how will the hubs be protected okay i 've got to be very clear and up front this project does not deal with the physical aspects of fire protection or bushfire attack limits and the like this is about establishing the information hubs to be able to provide a clear link with authoritative and timely information as far as what to do about the buildings themselves if there are smart things that need to be done to protect the building because for whatever reason you know we haven 't cleared the right amount of area around it or whatever the case may be that needs to be addressed through other sources in business as usual with council do we um as i 've just described in and explained try probably very poorly is that these are not intended to become magnetic gathering points for people to go if everything is completely black and it 's gone very very fast very very seriously south these are designed to get information out on an uninterrupted basis all the way through because as we saw from the bushfires in the main there is a significant escalation period as things start deteriorating these hubs will hopefully empower people to assess think decide and act and i sincerely hope that that means that in due course especially for the visitors to the area it will encourage them to not seek refuge inside the very place in which they may be in danger the idea of this is to get you clear of danger and away from danger in a timely way um thanks raymond uh nice words uh um what are the time frames for installation activation okay we um we we 're on a bit of a dance card promise here we 've got to get this done by the 30th of june got to complement the team that have been working very hard on this to date what they have managed to do is to do a lot of the thinking up front so instead of you know plucking it and seeing and just you know i 'll put this up there and see if it works things like determining what we want the minimum specification in those sites to be has been worked out we 've done the um tendering process for the electrical company the local electrical company to do all of the fit outs throughout the city of shoalhaven they have done all of the specification costing and pricing to each of the sites because that was part of the tender so they 're ready to go as soon as we we kick that into life and in terms of the installations for the screens um craig hatton down at south coast glass is uh is very keen to start putting into practice what he has done with the pilot site installation which is to basically design what the fabrication model looks like and what a standard screen fit once we 've got the power in then we will start rolling the screens down and in parallel to that the stream to work with the community to work out the readiness message will dovetail into the work that we 're doing with it base camp at huskerson to build the screens so as i say we want to be done with this by the 30th of june 2022 and uh and and we 're going to stick to that as religiously as we can uh will there be water tanks installed no that is not part of the rrp um and and again if there is a need for that to be uh the case if there is an obvious reason to have the water tanks installed then what i would really uh encourage you to do is use the council business as usual channels to a ask and and get that work done um okay what do we got here sorry i 'm just looking down the list here it 's important to note that information hubs are not necessarily evacuation centers or places of last resort that evacuation centers one is the shoalhaven indoor sports center up in bombadery and the other is the alla dulla civic center down on the highway on the main road just opposite the harbour at alladalla there are a couple of other places which have been identified as suitable the saint george 's basin country club for example is one and the bombardier bowling club is another and again i emphasize the reason the evacuation centers receive that accreditation from the rfs in particular is because they have access multiple ways of access and exit and most importantly a clear way of having the first responders reach people that are there unfortunately in the shoalhaven our greatest attraction is also our greatest achilles heel when in times of emergency in so far as that we mostly live on one road in one road out same road out i live in north narrow i 'm looking at the shoalhaven city at shoalhaven showground the road into my estate is a single point of access so it 's it 's one of the things that we we love about the place about where got to be very ready to respect is a limitation and to act accordingly in times of stress will the screens only be accessible internally great question no we 're going to have a number of screen options available the first one which we 'll see at kalala bay is a back to back screen so it 's literally about that thick and one screen shines out through the glass which is behind a deadlocked glass so we can clean the screen and the other screen shines into the hall so that the information is accessible internally and externally the people that the very the very uh community-minded citizens down our coast who are involved in the management of these halls will have an ability to turn the screen on or off because they will have remotes for the screens and the screens can also be monitored centrally from the council and activated remotely if required so it 's a it 's a great amenity it can be viewed from inside and outside and or and or outside some sites will have a screen outside and a separate screen inside spending too much or any of our very hard hard-earned grant money on making major structural changes to halls we want to be able to bulk these things where possible into the infrastructure as it exists um carol will there be a facebook page that can replicate what is shown on the community hub screens great question and one of the things that i was talking about it being scalable what i 'm really hoping is that once we 've built the hubs you know the the word hub has a very specific connotation of being the central node once we 've built that there 's all sorts of applications and uh and variations that we can employ to get the information that 's on those screens through an app on people 's phones to their laptops which they can currently get anyway if they go to the shoalhaven city site somehow city council website but yes it can be scalable in due course for the moment this is not in the scope of the project but the project will at least allow us the heart of that activity to we can and want to and can afford to do it we 'll expand it um what are the issues for managing building security that 's also a great question one of the reasons we 've used um a local provider to to build and um and fabricate the security around the screens is because we 're very conscious that we want the screens to be secure equally we want the batteries to be protected so in certain places where we can 't offer a lock and key and a behind out of sight out of mind type scenario we are investigating being able to install wire cages around the amenity so it doesn 't get affected the screens themselves if they are if they are visible from the outside they will be behind 15 mil toughened glass and a dead locked hinged door so that we can clean the glass and the screen so is it uh is it absolutely vandal-proof no but it certainly is discouraging um you know the transient bit of fun which uh which which folks might want to have on a saturday night hopefully interestingly it 's a similar configuration in terms of the construction of the boxes as exists for the community notice boards which have been installed by south coast glass down a number of the halls down the coast and interestingly those have suffered very little vandal at vandalism so fingers crossed we are we 're in a position there to uh to um to kind of short circuit any uh any any attraction to uh to to delinquency if that 's if that 's the right word to use the other thing to uh to point out is that the um is that the screens themselves they 're not normal televisions so it 's not something it 's of any use to anybody even if they could get to it they are instead of landscape they are portrait they 're either 46 or 55 inches in size they are an interactive screen but they are specifically for the purpose of displaying information in a very clear very highly pixelated very highly um defined way so it 's very very high definition screens so it 's not the sort of thing of anyway right vince i understood that you said the informations played on the screen of the information i will eventually be available to see on my pc at home is that the case yes what we 're trying to to do is build the information screens that will feed from council to the hubs and once we 've got those up and running we 'll be able to use those as as a separate button i would assume a button or an access point through the uh through the shoalhaven city council website for people that can use uh and who aren 't actually uh in need of necessarily going to the information hub to get it um i think we 've killed most of the questions i don 't know who presumed the community engagement will include what can be very local factors oh brilliant yeah so that 's a great question uh roger lucas um the community engagement that that michael and his team will be uh will be seeking from you with um with the help of prof professor sanderson is that the screens are designed they are so you 'll see at the kala bay site the first screen will be you know welcome to kalala here 's where the rfs chair is here 's where the nearest ambo is here 's the points of contact here 's your most important numbers and it 'll move from that from the from the very highly localized to the big broader picture big hand small map type stuff some of which will be feed from the new south wales resilience disaster dashboard which which very shortly uh the shoalhaven city council will be going live with as one of the test sites for uh for an 18-month trial program so there 's a great deal of information that we can get to these things the real challenge is going to be making sure we don 't get too much information out because the idea of this is to be readily accessible readily interpretable so lots of lots of pictures rather than many many words and to make sure that it 's a rolling screen of four or five screens with the just breaking news as a ribbon cnn hopefully that answers your question roger um okay it 's trevor smith uh how does the upgraded assets dovetail into the categorization existing neighborhood safe to place this example the kalala beach community hall is not categorized enabled safer place the nsp for kala beach is at parks crescent which is about 800 meters away from the hall there will there will and has been a natural inclination for people to assume that the community hall is a location regulate around during an emergency the upgrading of the hall will further reinforce this um great question trevor and what we might do is take that one offline not because i 'm frightened of answering it but because there 's quite a bit of um of discussion in there not everything that we 'll be fitting these screens to and fitting the the link back to the council and and vice versa will be necessarily neighborhood safer places some of the halls that we 'll be fitting them to are just that they 're just community places where traditionally it 's you know the local football club 21st birthday party for uh for social activities so it 's a way of of reaching the extremities of our city and you 've got to remember we 're four thousand six hundred square kilometers we 've got a huge number of um of um of isolated uh folks in all sorts of parts of our city this is trying to reach those places without them having to necessarily get into a car and make a day trip of it to get to one of the main rural among one of the main urban centers so they 're not all neighborhood safety places they 're not all evacuation centers in fact that 's definitely the case but they are providing a level of communication with the right information from the right people throughout the year um just working down the list of questions here so how are we going to recall with infoc and not just send an email sorry i don 't understand that question but i 'll happily uh happily try and answer it with an email will there be a facebook page or replay information shop i think we 've can we have input to where they go okay great question absolutely we have already consulted with a number of uh local community hall management and community um um key people to ask for their advice we have made significant significant inroads to making sure that the community 's desires and wishes for where the screens are is is honored and for that reason for example i acknowledge the kalala bay site we had a view of it going on one particular part of the building and thanks to the uh the input from the the team down at kalala and the community hall um uh management folks they said no no it should be here and in fact it was directly opposite on the other side of the building and that 's exactly what we 're after we 're not trying to you know enforce this this thing onto anybody we 're trying to provide an amenity and as a long-term resident of the shoalhaven can i just say that the uh the council is really bending over as much as it possibly can backwards to to to get um it 's a terrific opportunity so the answer is yes you can have inputs where they go uh who has control over the info and goes onto the hub and can they be used for community info outside emergency times that 's a terrific question too so the information can be can only be loaded by people who will be authorized to do so that will be something that 's got to be worked through the local emergency management committee and it 's also got to be worked through the uh the council communications and i t team and so the information will is not something that 's uh that 's going to be um accessible and loadable by anybody it 's got to be it 's got to remain authoritative and it 's got to remain it 's got to remain accurate um can it be used outside emergency times the answer is yes we 're going to have to have the batteries being active and used for obvious uh well-being of the battery itself it 's not something you can just leave to fully charged for a end of it the battery needs to cycle and one of the great things about this project is that because it is provided with power from renewable sources there is no reason why we can 't have those screens displaying things that you would currently enjoy for example when you 're sitting in the queue in the shoalhaven entertainment centre at the cafe there is no reason why we couldn 't display down there what 's on in the next uh you know in the coming weeks in terms of shows uh what 's happening in um in uh in terms of activities inside council which affect the community there is absolutely no reason why these things can 't_''_3767.28 be used in fact they will be used to uh to issue or relay important council information to the community um you said communities just say by scrolling down would have authorized personal input information from each local area will that be by email by phone okay the information on the screens will be will be entered and and owned by the authorities that have to make sure that what they there is an input from the community which informs that process and updates that equipment having gone through the right channel inside the emergency emergency uh system then that will be updated accordingly um you have a council asset to assembly hub what are their options that 's a great question i think that has to be split into two parts i do know that there are some communities that are very active and concerned that they don 't have a um a local council amenity that they can they can call home inverted commerce that is something that i would urge communities to take up through their local council laws and uh and to process in business as usual to see if we can can remedy that having said that there are places which are not owned by council that may be in a great position to allow us to at least put the screen up that is going to be very much sort of phase two and three of this if we 've got budget left over and we 've got some time to spare but again this have a location where we can do that we can approach it well not necessarily as a part of this project but we can approach it and ask if we can fit a screen and then find the appropriate funding to do so um rescue screen usage down the line could we display local trades and services as a paid advert look i i can 't answer to answer that um the money has been allocated by the state and federal government for a specific purpose which is for uh community information and by that it means authoritative information i think my personal view and i emphasize this is my personal view this is something to be discussed well down track once we 've got the thing up and running my personal view is that once you open that particular avenue there 's all sorts of things that can end up effectively clogging up a screen or a system which is designed specifically for the benefit of the whole community but that 's uh that 's for that 's a discussion for late for down track um can the community wedding on man if we had a wedding that 'd be a bloody good thing at the moment wouldn 't it but um but can we turn the screen off the answer is yes um the community hall management folks will have the remote to uh to dim they 'll turn off the screen if for whatever reason we need to get the screen back up and quickly that can be done remotely from council so um so so the answer is you know we 're not gonna we 're not going to um interrupt the uh the best man 's speech with news of wind weather and tides um okey-dokey let 's keep moving um okay i think i 've answered as many as i can i think we 're just about done if anybody uh and i 'll ask i 'll ask the uh the council team behind the scenes here have i missed any and if i have could you just flip them up for me because if not i reckon um i may hand back to you jane terrific thank you vince and some great questions sharing your questions with us and for vince to giving such comprehensive answers and that information will also be posted on council 's website too and if you 've still got questions um please uh forward them to council and we will certainly um get back to you on those a big thank you to all our presenters today tamara amanda ceo stephen vince anthony mike and david and particularly to you thank you very much

also then to recognize that on australia day there are so many migrants in this country a wonderful multicultural country a migrant such as myself who appreciate the opportunity to live here in this beautiful place and call it now our our australians some of our wonderful volunteers here in the shoalhaven there are many many people doing fantastic deeds and they do these deeds with love in their hearts for a care for their community and a care for people and it 's so great to be able to celebrate them even though we 're doing it in this new digital platform it 's just a highlight of how we

know would be so proud of what they have done for their community and foundation that has a mission to promote kindness and to care for our community can we please welcome kathy and ralph kelly and listen to their beautiful message around australia day today welcome everyone my name is kathy kelly my husband ralph and i are delighted to be joining you today we are humbled to have received the invitation to be the australia day ambassadors in the shoalhaven thank you to mayor amanda finley and councillors we 've only recently moved from sydney to the shoalhaven in october last year it 's such a beautiful area of new south wales with locals warmly welcoming us making us feel like family we felt like it was meant to be the theme for australia day 2021 is the story of australia this calls on us to reflect respect and to celebrate on australia day the campaign acknowledges the story of our extraordinary nation highlighting that australia day is a day to reflect on our history and its highs and lows while we celebrate our nation its achievements and our people we reflect on our nation 's past which began more than 65 the first australians our national day is a time above all for inclusion and respect it enables us to pause listen and gain a great understanding of australia 's first peoples aboriginal culture and heritage and continue to work towards reconciliation we respect the contributions of all australians and we celebrate our achievements by coming together and connecting with family friends and community australia day is an opportunity to celebrate our cultural diversity and rich migrant heritage which is very much a part of our unique australian identity this diversity shines on australia and is celebrated and re respected in a myriad of ways in new south wales and across the nation many migrants and refugees will mark australia in special citizenship ceremonies pledging their allegiance to our community and their commitment to australia as citizens australia day 2021 activities and events will be different previous years the day will focus more on recognising the efforts of many australians who put others well-beings before their own this includes our heroic front-line workers who continue to support their communities in times of need and stand up to the challenges of these difficulties firstly with the bushfires then drought followed by covert 19. what a year it has been about 80 of the land area of the shoalhaven was impacted or burned in some way with 280 houses destroyed and many more damage by fire you see each and every one of us is important we are social beings we need human interaction yet in this fast-moving world of technology it 's easy to forget others within our communities mobile phones facebook instagram twitter tiktok are not only consuming our time and our lives but worth still they are shutting people out of our lives altogether we all crave human interaction and with this naturally comes the need for open dialogue with family friends neighbors and sometimes strangers who we come into contact and meet every day we all have a story do we take the time to listen this is our story stay kind is a movement that promotes and encourages more kindness in everyday life the stakeholder movement in australia evolved from two tragic circumstances the death of thomas kelly aged 18 in 2012 from an unprovoked attack on the brother stuart in 2016 four years later also aged 18 who took his own life both boys are our sons we set up a not-for-profit in december 2013 and ralph 's now going to tell you a little bit more about this thank you so a year later we set up a new initiative in sydney called the take care safe spaces and its care with a k after thomas 's last name we launched the initiative in in december 2014 at sydney town hall closely followed by king 's cross and by darling and then darling harbour our teams of volunteers stretch out across the streets of sydney every weekend from friday to saturday night from 10 p.m or 4 a.m they look for people who are vulnerable people who are subject to self-harm violence and theft we also provide wayfinding services for international tourists and domestic tourists as well as locals to help them find their way through the city since we opened that first safe space in december we 've now had 72 000 interventions and we call these interventions sliding door moments the difference between someone something worse like thomas since we started the safe spaces we 've formed partnerships with four universities the university of new south wales the university of technology sydney the charles sturt university and the university of newcastle recently a study was was was conducted over the last two years by unsw where they looked into the community benefit of the safe spaces the results were released just recently showing that every dollar put into the program you have a 2.67 saving over the period from december 2014 to april 2019 that equates to 7.5 million dollars in harm reduction it 's a fantastic program saving people 's lives over covered we 've had to hide had to hibernate the safe spaces but we are looking to reopen mid-january and we are looking for support with new volunteers coming on board if you 'd like to volunteer and do something kind um you know please visit our website which is steakhound.org_``_533.76 we were contacted by the westminster city council in london who 'd heard about our safe space and wanted to replicate the program in soho which is a part of providing all of our ip and experiences over the last few years and it was fantastic when they opened up the site and really bit of sweet for myself because i was born in london and so therefore to have london replicate the program that we have here in sydney was um was really warming for me um from a real relatively simple idea we were able to provide the city and and the amenity of sydney 's nightlife with a safe a safe area where people could go out at night to the theater or drinks or nightclubs and be safe the founder foundation works very closely with the liquor accord to the aha the venues the pubs new south wales police the city of sydney and the new south wales state government following stuart 's death in 2016 we reached a bit of a tipping point whether or not we should continue with the foundation or shut it down after stu 's death a lot of people depended on the foundation for the work in the city on the weekends but we started to look at some global people violence what made people haze and why are young people taking their lives more and more one young person on australia takes their life every day the figures are awful so we decided we looked at we looked at that global research and there was one underlying value that if you don 't have means that you will bully and you will be violent and do other terrible things to other people and that value is kindness so if we all had kindness and showed kindness to other people then we wouldn 't have all those other terrible things that happen on a day-to-day basis so we changed the name of the foundation to stay kind in july 2019 the purpose is to promote the prevention of those you know those key areas around bullying and violence and to really put to the forefront in everybody 's minds about staying kind and that 's been kind every day so that 's when you get out of out of bed each morning you know that you 're going to do something kind and to do something kind you have to who 's struggling or just a simple act like opening a door you 're going to stop and you 're going to go over to them reach out and say am i able to help you if each and every one of the 25 million australians did one act of kindness every day it 's 9.1 billion acts of kindness a year just imagine what a great country we would be really fantastic in july we have we have a month which is called kind july so both the boys lost their lives in july so we use um really july as the month to really get it out there and again if we all did an act of kindness in july that 's 775 million acts of kindness today there are mums and dads through the work of our foundation and today kind who have their sons and daughters at home with them over this important period over christmas and new year and australia day through acts of generosity of other people to be kind to them and so we 're urging all australians to really think about others your part in being kind it can be as simple as smiling and saying hello or good morning to a stranger walking down the street as simple as it sounds a smile and a greeting can change someone 's life can certainly change their day give praise to others wherever possible i guarantee you that any positive praise will be meaningful to the person that you say it to always stop at a lemonade stand not only kids um will get excited about their their efforts being recognized by you but that happiness will also make your day pay for the person 's coffee behind you most likely they will pay that that kind act forward so think of the ripple effect of um your act of kindness or that one act of kindness so all of us can make a difference and active kindness can improve not only the person receiving the act but also your own well-being do something kind stay kind thanks so much kathy and ralph for delivering your beautiful message to us this australia day and thank you for sharing it 's really important that of australia to encapsulate what it means to be part of this great nation

what challenge that you have and many of us do have challenges are living here homeless and rough we have people who need assistance with food hampers and with weekly guidance and assistance and no one has given that better assistance to the people of the northern shoalhaven and beyond than peter dover he is a completely selfless person and i met him a lot a long time ago now probably when he first started his work with salt ministries and he 's worked so tirelessly in the safe shelter project he 's worked so tirelessly in providing meals comfort and finding helping people to find accommodation in the northern shoalhaven it 's just incredible the amount of hours that he puts in and i know that he would uh attribute that to having a wonderful community around him who lift him up and support him and i know how deeply he appreciates having his wife meg by his side peter dover i 'm really pleased to be able to present to you this award for an inclusive shoalhaven congratulations hi my name is peter dover i 'd like to thank you and i 'm really honored to receive this award today staff and volunteers at salt ministries salt care safe shelter shoulde haven and sultan ko who tirelessly work to help people that are suffering from disadvantage we started salt in 2012 but with a simple mandate of simply just loving god and loving people without a gender or without judgment and we started by doing this by just giving out food and clothing to those in need and that led to us working with council churches business and community to start safe shelter shoalhaven and that was an amazing initiative to help the homeless of the region and all over the shoalhaven and so we then launched saltcare which started with salt-assisted housing where we started to help people that were homeless move from homelessness into self-sufficient living in their own houses so much has happened in the last 12 months in the in the recent bushfires we started a response team to go out into the areas of nara neriga and cajola park just to stand and be with people giving them food clothing and support where they just needed someone to stand by them and then at the salt co is a social enterprise where we 're working with young people who are wanting to break the cycle of unemployment so we train them we employ them into the areas of hospitality everything we do is to help break the divide between those that have and those that have not we want make we want to make sure people know that they belong we want to make sure people know that they are loved and they are cared for and there is nothing separating them from the rest of society we realize that the trauma people suffer isn 't the defining moment of their life but there is much more behind the scenes you know we 're i 'm reminded of what mother teresa said she said that life is so much better when we are able to give to people and expect nothing in return we stand with those that have been on the outside of the social divide we imagine a circle with no one standing on the outside it 's not them and us it 's just us and we hope that we we hope 's mindsets so we realize that our whole fabric of the shoalhaven is about inclusiveness it 's about giving to those in need so thank you so much thank you peter this year 's been really challenging for our young people and i 'm really proud of the young people of the shoalhaven who have shown some fantastic resilience in the face of so many challenges this year often our young people get a bad rap but we really need to support them that 's why i really love giving out the young citizen of the year award and this young citizen of the year has had an exceptional year violent then she 's only 15 years of age and wow if this young woman is doing the things that she 's doing right now at such a young age imagine where she 's going to be in her 20s and our 30s and this is why i think that our future 's in good hands with our young people because violet 's been working on bringing the environmental issues that our country faces to the attention of our leaders president of the youth for change movement and she has organised climate strikes climate youth strikes and she has petitioned shoalhaven city councillors to get them to understand the issues that our environment face she 's shown great skills and great leadership and community engagement and academia she 's a wonderful young role model and i 'm really pleased to be able to give this award to you violet this year congratulations and well done hello my name is violet van im 15 years old and a student at bombing area high school i grew up in england and that 's where i got my first taste of what it 's like to be a leader i was chosen as a sixer in my local brownie group when i was around eight years old i 've always loved developing and learning new leadership skills when i moved to australia in 2014 i continued my journey by joining first down guides i achieved a lot while attending girl guides such as organizing a working bee in marriott park to plant more trees in community spaces another being a giving tree for businesses and my school at the time bombing public school to gather donations in year five i was determined to be the school captain at bombing public school so i put a lot of time and effort into my into preparing my speech and presentation and that hard work paid off as i was elected the 2017 female bominary public school captain through this role i got to make a lot of connections to members of the community and members of parliament one of these people being gareth ward who selected my school to represent the kyama electorate at the 2017 children 's parliamentary learning experience my principal chose me to represent this school i was the only primary age student that selected to go i went to a three-day camp in sydney where i enjoyed workshops about leadership teamwork and writing skills i learned how bills are passed and how laws are made we each got to write speeches to present at parliament house moments about homelessness and how we can tackle the issue at local levels this was my first major leadership experience when where i made friends made me aware of how politics works and the best way to create change this is where i became interested in politics and i even attended post-electoral meetings in nara after the may 2019 federal election and i was one of the very few under-18s there in october 2018 i started an instagram page called plastic is not fantastic to raise awareness around the overuse of plastic in the community and how to reduce your plastic intake by recommending products and sharing tips and tricks to reduce your carbon footprint during lockdown my mum and i started our own small online business selling upcycled items made from old books and papers called the vintage paper shack we recently started selling our items in a cafe that i work at called arthas located import kembla since year seven i 've volunteered to be a part of the bombing high school sound crew and next year i will be head of the sound and lighting team because of this i 've been awarded the bobbinery high school citizenship award for outstanding contributions to school activities in 2018 2019 and 2020. outside of players to teach a drama class of primary aids school students i love being a mentor to the group and inspiring and encouraging those students who aren 't quite as confident as others seeing my students learn and grow as performers is the reason i volunteer my time there every thursday i volunteer at the community radio triple u fm as a youth amplified presenter as well as my two co-hosts we have an hour-long program once a week where we play music and talk about current topics after attending youth for change show haven for over a year i was recently elected vice president at the beginning of term four which is something i 'm very proud of achieving youth for change is a non-political group in the show haven that have monthly meetings to discuss issues that we are passionate about such as the environment equality mental health and we develop community-based projects to create positive change in the show haven i 'm one of the lead organizers for the shaw haven school strike for climate but obviously due to covert 19 we haven 't been able to we hope that 2021 and near future we will achieve a lot more two weeks ago i completed the 2020 bombing high peer support training and have been selected to be a 2021 peer support leader for next year 's year sevens at the beginning of november this year i attended the south coast leadership forum aka skilf we participated in lots of workshops some being how to recycle properly what racism means and of course leadership skills such as communication and teamwork we also took part in the impact challenge where we had to create an idea to tackle a local issue my group 's idea was to raise awareness around the destruction that sea urchins are causing in java 's bay in 2021 i hope to make this idea a reality through sonder youth 's change makers program i hope that 2021 will be a year of learning growing and achieving for myself and everybody around me i would like to thank everyone involved for the opportunity to be here and a massive thank you to nina and tequisa for nominating me now i hope you feel inspired our young people all the time and the other people that i feel inspired by are all of our volunteers all across the city so i just want to take a moment now for us all to just pause and to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of hours that people spend in service to our city and it would be so great to be able to acknowledge every single one of them with an award because they all deserve it and many do this work without awards in their mind or in their hearts they do it because they love what they do they either love the people that they 're serving or the part of the community that they 're serving so let 's give thanks to all of those people who spend some of their time volunteering in our community and this brings me now to the final award for this year 's australia day awards the citizen of the year and this year 's citizen of the year has been volunteering for over 25 years on many many levels he has volunteered with the canberwara ratepayers association the shoalhaven river and for the shoalhaven landcare fox control program he 's always there to help his neighbors he 's helped out with engineering problems and he 's come up with solutions he 's lent equipment and he is just an all-round fantastic guy and if you 've come across peter jurgens then you will know who i 'm talking about he 's fondly and affectionately known to vet to many people and peter i 've got the greatest pleasure in giving this award to you congratulations and thank you so much for all of the exceptional work that you have done for the shoalhaven over so many years i 'd just like to thank sheldon city council for um for this award um and it 's a great recognition for uh community groups for the work they do in in shy haven this this recognition also is shows that i 'm part of i 'm just part of a uh a team and uh without the team we wouldn 't be doing too much thank you very much for this opportunity it 's just um i feel very us and i know that behind so many of our volunteers there are fantastic teams of people who are working with them but i just want to point out too that your humility in this in your acceptance is also one of those fantastic traits that we see in so many of our volunteers across the shoalhaven and these peer awards they often are hard to accept when you know that you 've worked side by side with many others who you feel are equally as able to receive the type of awards that are given out in the shoalhaven but to all of our award recipients i hope that next year that you pick up the application form and fill it in for someone that you know is equally as special as you are and is also one of those silent achievers that needs to be recognized by our fantastic city i 'm really you know every year when i stand on the stage and give out these awards this year i sit in front of a camera and i still feel the enormity of what it is that thank each and every one of you for the contributions that you have given in this year and all of the years before 2020 has been a 2020 was a challenging year and i do feel optimistic that 21 and this australia day is just part of this 21 it 's going to be a much better proposition for all of us here in the shoalhaven i hope that your australia day has been whatever it is that you want it to be for you whether you 're a migrant who 's celebrating being in a new country or whether you 've someone who 's been here for many many generations and can we again at the end of this ceremony reflect on our first australians who have been here for thousands of years and what today also means to them i thank you for your attention thank you for sharing this this occasion with us and congratulate all of those nominees and all of the recipients of our awards _"

    "text": "come with me i want to show you something okay here it is this is my strawberry patch and it 's going absolutely nuts again what it does is when it gets big enough it starts throwing off all these little offshoots which try and find soil or anything you can see they 're trying to grow down onto the ground and that 'll try and start us another strawberry plant down there problem is i come along with the whipper snipper and chop them all off so i 've just been throwing them back into there but a couple of weeks ago you come and have a look in here i actually used some single-use coffee cups put a bit of soil in there and then i 've set the new growth in there so they 're ready now i can just snip them off from the mother plant and there 's my new seedling and that 's exactly what i want to show you today i want to show you what you can use out of your recycle bin to actually make pots for seedlings rather than going right as you can see we 've raided the recycle bin and found any little container that we can pop some seeds into and create some seedlings so i 've already got soil in all of these oh also rated the garbage bin there 's a couple of single-use coffee cups they don 't go in the recycle bin i know how many times i 've bang on about that this one came out of the garden i 'd already used this one and as you see it 's got no paper left in the bottom just a plastic lining that 's the reason they don 't go in the recycle bin because they 're lined with plastic that can 't_''_92.0 be separated at the recycling facility but i tell you what they make decent little um little pots i got sidetracked then see you got me on the coffee cups one of my pet hates anyway these are all my containers the other ones i 've got here that was a milk carton or a milk bottle and i 've only put soil in the bottom half of it to grow up it still can get the sunshine but it 's protected from the elements from the side like the wind and things like that that 's like its own little greenhouse that 's kind of cool that 's a bottom of a milk milk carton yogurt container that one 's a nutlex container that 's a punnet that probably had um cherry tomatoes or something like that in it now that 's that 's pretty big i 'm probably gonna get four in that like one two three four right because a seedling doesn 't need much soil around it like these are pretty big normally they come in a thing called a plug it 's about as big as your thumb right and probably half this when they grow up they 're about half the size that that 's when you plant them on b because these are a bit bigger you could leave them in there a little bit longer down the front i 've got two tetra packs cut the top out of that one and then i thought hey why don 't i cut that way i can fit like four one two three four and they 'll be easy to break apart and plant into my garden later on even better than that was the milk milk carton was an egg carton right made of cardboard so with this i 'm going to pop a seed in each one so i 'm going to get 12 but i 'm actually going to put two seeds because when you 're planting seeds out right not all of them are going to germinate not all of them are going to grow so if you put two in each right and then as they grow you keep the strongest one and you cut the other one off someone might only get one in each but when they do grow with this thing i can just cut through it with a pair of scissors cut them all off separately and put the whole thing in the ground because it 's just cardboard right there 's no there 's no silky lined plastic lining or whatever or no shiny stuff on on an egg carton so it can yeah that 'll be great i 'm stoked on that one that 's probably one of the best i think to use because it 's perfect good size you get 12 in there whatever with the rest of these i haven 't put holes in them yet for good reason i like to grow mine on the windowsill to start with because um when they 're little you know and they 're just starting to do their thing they 're a bit more susceptible to the bugs i think that 's the word susceptible anyway they 're a bit more open to all the bugs and things like that also my dog loves to dig in the garden all right and if they 're just little seedlings she 'll just go to town but if there 's something that 's like this big and then i tend to put something over him anyway she stays away from them so i like to grow them up on the windowsill the other good thing is you can do it inside with the kids all right and then they can watch them so seconds or in the middle of night see if the plants have grown in bigger they can just look at them on the windowsill and then when they 're big enough you can pop them out in the garden okay so i 've got my soil my own soil here didn 't have to go anywhere for it i 've got my pots they all come out of the recycle bin and the garbage bin so i 'm reduced reuse recycle perfect way to do it didn 't have to go anywhere for them what i need now is some seeds i bought mine online okay because we 're not meant to leave the house at the moment well you can leave the house but look supermarkets and hardwares are selling out of seeds and if you 're gonna go out and buy seeds make sure you can buy something you can plant now because everyone 's running out going you know i 'm going to start my own veggie gardener they 're buying everything that they need they 're buying every variety of vegetables they can think of and _''_309.84 of them at the same time you can only grow certain plants and seeds at certain times of the year so make sure you read the packets and obviously grow the things that your family like to eat otherwise there 's absolutely no point to it apart from that look after each other enjoy the gardening if you 've got everything and you didn 't have to leave the house even better try and stop the spread of this thing and uh happy gardening [Music] you _"

and dread at the shoalhaven regional gallery [Music] because i 'm more of a visual person i said just draw something and then send it to me then we 'll go from there and the young kenyan years but she drew me i had to send her a picture of my father 's painting and that 's where it just it just went the connection the connection was the form full connection [Music] it was yeah there was some really strong um similarities between the sketch and to me so then we were like right well we know where to take the inspiration for this work from which was auntie dude with his father 's painting i was going to ask you to specifically talk about fire and the way we 've talked about that shift from how fire is experienced today and how what this work is saying plants around this area and and further i feel too working with the parks and everything like that so we incorporated as many of the native plants around this area that were related as well to the fire and regenerative or um you know ways that mob would have used plants with fire like even the paper bark using it for cooking and things like that so sort of using it the broader spectrum of how fire can regenerate be used for cooking yeah in american culture the way when fire did happen to the to the land is that we didn 't we didn 't fear it because what we 've done is we actually moved away from it and let it take its pathway but now we have to look after what 's in the line of the fire and that 's the houses and everything that come today fire wasn 't just a negative kind of uh connotation that was something we were just scared of that would take over the bush we like worked with fire to like cold burn areas and we would carry fire like it was a resource it wasn 't like a um this horrible thing that happens to the land it was part of the land and the regeneration of land and the blossoming and the self-propagation and all of those things that are actually a positive thing sort of i could imagine what would have been seen fire and be like oh yeah the bush is gonna bloom again that 's awesome we 'll just go over here but yeah and then you know it 's like it doesn 't have to be this scary thing we 're so possession focused now that it 's all about holding on to our possessions but like fire knows where it wants to go so i just got the knowledge of what needs to burn and so it follows that path and you know with the practices that have been sort of like i said transplanted onto this country you know and allowed the bush to get into the state that it 's in is what has caused all of this you know the reason why we had such a bad bad fire took it took care of it and whenever the fire was tried to be redirected she took another part and then um you know that 's how we throughout those fights which is sad but at the same time that 's just him looking after the garden in the western sort of ontology humans put themselves at the top of that chain and so it 's about humans in this thing and not country and what country needs and like what country needs to do to keep itself going and we need country as much as country you know so it 's about that connection and that interconnection and that weaving together of story and this is place and how it 's all how it 's all connected you know because and you know we 've lived it with that for a long time people are starting to understand that um understand that way that we need to learn how to live with that [Music] when you look at the flowers and cycles of the flowers and average people we 've been [Music] our seasons were depicted on the um all of them you know banksias and the grass trees all of them veils they needed needed to fight so it 's not it 's not that they didn 't need it they they did all of the land needed the fire it 's just it was happy yeah [Music] [Music] the temporal nature of the connection to the land so it 's not like on a certain date the season change it 's like when the water works that 's when the season changes you know like it 's that real connection to country and knowing what country is saying by just listening to it you listen to everything that 's around you and that 's what i do and i do go walking in the bush i don 't just walk in the bush to walk in it i just walk in it till you have that because that 's what my father always said to me if you walk through the bush in the evil animals you know that it 's alive but if you don 't eat the animals you know it 's sick it 's a keith francis stewart he was born here in nara on the 12th of december 1929 and his legacy to keep telling that story the most beautiful painting it 's yeah an auntie sister 's house and a prided position on the wall so they always talk about it and you know it 's a big part of their family and their story so i feel really honored to be able to be part of this and here and to tell the story from this actual place his birthday is the day this exhibition opens so there 's quite a lot of connections going on all the dots are coming yeah most of our navy plants need to have that fire to regenerate and also with the fires that actually put through the other plants that have not been been able to be seen before because of the overgrown i think one of the lovely things you talked about was when people approach the work you want them to feel like they 're walking through the country yeah yeah [Music]

you like for one of it a better term to talk about the get ready shoalhaven campaign and an information that we would like to get through to as many people as we possibly can to uh to prepare for the the next fire season now we 've been through an awful lot of the last 12 months um and the most uh the most drastic things of the last seven or eight months are still largely with us and complicated by covert 19. but thanks to the technology of facebook and today in two previous sessions the webinar that we learned ran across a microsoft teams software we were able to reach about 150 people and we 're hoping to get that if not more this evening with that with facebook now to begin with could i please acknowledge the traditional people of the land on which we meet today within the uh with all parts past present and emergence emerging i also extend that respect to aboriginal and torres strait islanders who may be with us online today i also acknowledge that there is a significant impact and a lingering impact that the recent bushfires and floods have had on the indigenous community their well-being culture and history within our area of shoalhaven we do understand exactly what damage has been done to the land and how that translates culturally to our first nation peoples and are very sensitive to that fact i 'd like to uh kick off this evening by uh by seeking uh the mayor 's indulgence to uh to formally welcome all participants and uh and to give us her views especially on the on the matter of well-being and health during this seminar for the folks that may be experiencing some challenge as a result of their memories and experiences of the last year um thank you vince for your opening words and welcome everyone this evening to this first time that council 's tried to do a facebook live event so bear with us we 've got some very helping us out with our technical difficulties and keeping the panel on track and who your panel are this evening i have ray steins who will be sitting to my left for narrow police who acts as our leocon whenever the emergencies are on our local emergency operations controller and of course the the well-known and well-loved uh mark williams from the rfs he 's no stranger to speaking on microphones and i 'm sure you do remember both gentlemen really clearly who led us through the the worst time of our lives and has continued to roll on into the nine months that we 've been experiencing uh that has been unprecedented i know that that word 's been overused but it 's certainly been a time that we didn 't expect um so in acknowledging um yourselves for joining us this evening i just want to make make it really clear that if anything that 's spoken about this evening drags up feelings that are not making you comfortable to press pause please just press pause and move away from the screen because going through the time that look after our own mental health and of course there 's lots of fun fantastic you know opportunities out there to connect into services whether it 's the black dog institute whether it 's beyond blue or whether it 's the lifeline line that 's been dedicated to the fire impact of the shoalhaven through the new south wales health i ask you to reach out and absolutely take control of your mental health and use whatever is available for you just on that it was just this week that i was advised by the national mental health coordinator that only four percent of the nation 's packages your ten sessions with a counsellor that you can get through medicare have been taken up they 're really valuable pieces of time that you can spend if you 're feeling that way inclined to to really get some professional help so if you need it please take it but i hope that you find this evening instructive and that you um you hang in there with us over the next 45 minutes to 50 minutes and yeah come out the other your friends as part of our getting prepared for the fire season ahead ahead thank you [Music] thanks amanda um just a few words about where we 're meeting tonight this is the integrated emergency management centre now as uh as ratepayers and residents of the shoalhaven you should rightly be proud of this uh the next time you 're in town in nara drive down past 92 albatross road and you 'll see the building on your left as you 're driving towards the uh the air base inside this building is an integrated management center incorporating the the headquarters of the rural fire service the state emergency services and the room that we 're transmitting from right now during the fires and other emergencies this is the emergency operations uh center for poor council and in the tables around this room which you unfortunately can 't see but around us arranged a number of tables which will include all sorts of government agencies council defense land services police welfare agencies city engineers but this is not actually the the scene of most of the action believe it or where all of the information that comes off the fire ground or the flood area gets synthesized across a great number of people everything from weather analysts and and people who observe the unfolding climate as it 's happening all the way through to those that manage the air assets those that do the radio communications and across the front wall of that particular facility are a number of screens where all of the information that gets synthesized from human resources on the ground getting the intelligence and seeing where the danger and the problems are all the way through to other reports received by members of the community where all of that is synthesized and put into uh into a neat parcel and then moved up the chain before it actually appears on the fires near me app as one particular source for example on those screens are infrared traces bureau of meteorology real-time news reports because sometimes the media is in places a lot faster than we 've been able to get information from the field and it 's an amazing thing to watch and the reason it years in uniform that is as as high tech and as capable and competent an emergency ops room as i 've seen and the the people of shoalhaven can be really proud of this investment because it is a council-owned facility and it was put here for the express purpose of responding to emergencies that we might experience from time to time it came into its own in the last nine months it has drawn an awful lot of attention and positive comment from people who visit all other local government areas under under some level of stress and this place is is probably one of the best that they 've seen now to that end it 's uh it 's my duty tonight to uh to represent the chair of the local emergency management committee who 's also the chief executive officer of the council mr stephen dunshead and he 's asked me to reload a few things first council works in partnership with emergency services state and federal government agencies charities and others to support the community through the recovery phase of impact 's experience from the most future cholhaven city council secondly is part of the local emergency management committee this committee is constituted under the state emergency and rescue management act of 1989 and is responsible for preparing plans for response and recovery from emergencies thirdly the shoalhaven city council ceo mr dunchey chairs this committee and members of the committee include police rural fire service fire and rescue ses surf life saving marine rescue supporting agencies include welfare health new south wales ambulance transport for new south wales and department of primary industries there are many different work areas within council that aim to assist in the response and recovery from emergencies and these are engineering services communication services transport services and facilitating activation of the emergency operations centre in which we 're currently sitting right now it 's important to note that council supports emergencies in a variety of ways but are not the lead agencies in not the lead agency and combating emergencies for that we 're about to hand over to the two experts in that field and it 's with that note that i passed the microphone to to inspector ray also the chief of police here in nara and uh and throughout all of the fire emergency he 's been effectively located in the office about six six six paces from where i 'm currently sitting over to you ray thanks vince um yeah my name 's ray steins i 'm the inspector at nara police station i 'm the austrian charger at that police station and part of my role is to undertake the leo conroll or the local emergency operations control um i share that position with another inspector dave cochran and between the two of us we look after this room and the roles and responsibilities of the people that are in this within this room um in saying that the we refer to the people in this room as representatives of functional areas um and like being said that includes the police new south wales ambulance i 'll just work my way around the room so i can enjoy my memory police ambulance welfare new south wales fire brigade and ncs uh communications engineering which is the council arm of of the eoc um and maritime defence welfare lands and animals and environmental services so you can see there 's a a number of agencies that form up the eoc and my role is to ensure the coordination of their agencies in support of the combat agency so if we put it into the bushfire context the rfs and mark is looking after the fire we 're supporting them to do what they need to do to stop the fire so if they need to the communication between both myself and mark well we have known each other for a long time and it makes it a lot easier um but the fact that the communication is is a two-way street so if mark needs a hand with a certain aspect of the response to the fire who is come and see me and then i 'll allocate it to a function area to undertake and it 's it can happen pretty much immediately and um eventually 100 right this facility that has been built um is the envy of a lot of councils a lot of lgas and i 've had since the fires were and ask to be shown around the place because they want to replicate what we 've got here it 's a testament to the rfs to the council for what they 've provided and thank you very much for that my role primarily is to support mark and the rfs that 's in the nutshell and we do it through an immense amount of cooperation and coordination and without that cooperation coordination just doesn 't work um we were lucky enough that through the lemc there was a large number a large amount of landing had gone into the shoalhaven and as soon as mark gave you the phone call to say that we had a major major fire happening we opened up the eoc and as soon as we open up the eoc we have a creed that every agency takes their head off and it 's not agency specific we all work together as a team it doesn 't work if we don 't do it that way and as soon as the door 's open for the eoc it goes into preparation and recovery mode recovery for had power integral energy or endeavour jump straight in and start repatriating the power in relation to preparation we use the forecasters from the rfs to tell us where the fire 's going so then we can start preparing towns ready for possible impact that that preparation also includes a number of community meetings that we held prior to or during the event of last summer and and mark and mike was instrumental in all that with the information we 've prepared and disseminated out to the out to the community and that along with these type of webinar webinars that we 've been participating in today um i feel been a great advantage to the community for that exact role apart from the eoc the police response in relation to an emergency will always be the same regardless of what the emergency is our creed is to protect wealth and property and we make no make no um apologies for the way it 's done if during a fire mark says the fire 's going to impact on the highway at this point it 's up to us to 'll block it the only reason we 're blocking it by twofold is one is to protect life and property and two is to protect the lives and and enable the fire regard the fieries to go and do their job that they need to do um i think that 's about all vince um unless any other panel got a question we 'll get the questions in a moment thanks very much ray and um unfortunately i got that out of sequence it was supposed to be going to uh to mark williams next but actually it 's probably a better segue in the way it 's just been done why because now mark 's going to get it down to um a finer point of what it is we need to be preparing and how individuals can actually get themselves ready and then on completion of mark 's presentation we 'll just have a quick quick wander and look at the mayor 's emergency kit before we actually get a little bit more into into the detail of things that people can prepare we 're getting a few 't hesitate to ask anything if there 's something that you think we might be able to do and to re-emphasize that this this meeting is about trying to get as much information to you to a put your mind at ease that there is system there is process and there are plans which have been drawn and have been considered the local emergency management committee meets quarterly to to make sure that those plans stay relevant and as the emergency unpacks and these fine fine folks from from police and the first responders and the rfs leap and uh swing into action we then just really need to be able to support them as best we can but without further ado i 'll pass it over to mark williams and he 'll be able to walk us through what actually looks uh looks and feels like the job and role of his own zone manager and incident controller thanks vince and good evening everybody thanks very much for joining us tonight and it 's a pleasure to be here and be able to explain a little bit from the uh some bones on how you can help yourself in uh prior to any other future event that may happen so last year as uh amanda said uh we 've seen that unprecedented activity throughout the state with the bushfire disaster and obviously the shoalhaven was severely affected by that tragically moving on from that but we need to look forward we need to look at how we 're going to combat future incidents and work out how individuals can assist themselves locally here um we 've just uh talked about nauseam about our local centre here our two echo the status that we 've got here we are the apple of the eye of a lot of people around the state who are very envious of what we 've got here locally the ability for me as an incident controller or anyone in that position to be able to literally walk across a hallway and be able to engage yourself uh with the other support mechanisms through radi 's emergency management committee is second to none it 's a literal uh 20-second step stepping stone across rather than having that which as we all know in emergency situation time is at the essence um so moving forward what we 've got here locally is uh we look after the entire shoalhaven lga here the rfs within the district has 36 brigades locally in rough numbers it fluctuates a little bit we 're sitting at about 1500 members across those 36 brigades as a result of recent fires we 've seen over 250 new applications and we 're currently working through getting all those people trained up and he integrated integrated within the uh the brigades ready to be able to respond obviously covert restrictions are having some effect on us as well we have to make sure that we do it all safely so those taking a bit of extra time to get through but we are in effect ready to go for the next emergency and it 's not just the big emergencies that the rfs does we look after everything within the district apart from the major townships of uh nara berry and old dollar and we do anything fire related or emergency related that we 're garbage means a lot cat 's up trees you name it uh whatever we get called to assist uh we 'll often respond as i 'm sure you all as locals uh out there would see the uh the trucks out there and the crews out there and those crews are all made up of the volunteers as i said and they 're all local members of the community they 're members of the community who are volunteering their time to assist other members of their community so without them we wouldn 't have a service i wouldn 't have a job that 's for sure and we wouldn 't have the effective service that we provide to the community right across the board but we are prepared we 've seen uh some significant rainfall in the last couple of weeks which is uh for myself as a firefighter being fairly pleasing uh all be that we 've got a little bit too much on both occasions what it has seen is the fuel moisture content or the grant the soil moisture content come up to saturation level and that coming into the new fire season which starts on the first of september once we get into that fire season it won 't take long if the weather changes if we don 't end up into the la nina as what the bureau of meteorology is calling uh things can grow up fairly smartly so we are ahead of the game we are constantly watching the weather we 're in constant hookups with the bureau of meteorology as to which way the season is looking at and we 're keeping ourselves prepared to go out and respond to those emergencies if need be but more along i guess now for how you can help yourselves and ultimately help us and all the other emergency services help you down the line so as we 've mentioned in the previous webinars today the one biggest thing that i can implore on everybody and we import on it during the fire season as well is the bushfire survival plan everybody in the shoalhaven who lives within the shoalhaven now should at least have known about this document if not created one and if is the time to start looking at this document and start at least understanding what 's within the document and what we mean by a bushfire survival plan things to consider within that survival plan is what you 're going to do and how you 're going to prepare your own property for defense of a fire or for that matter any other emergency that might come your way knowing the alert levels knowing the alert levels that the rfs uses when we get a small fire or any fire we put it on the website we put it out on fires near me and we advertise it that it 's an advice level and that 's the initial stages of an incident if a bushfire continues to grow and enlarge you may see the warning level change to watch and act and that means exactly what it says it 's time to start watching that incident start listening to other media channels start paying attention to fires near me for updates and start enacting your bushfire survival plan and start putting it at the front of your mind as to develop in and around your area ultimately if a fire gets to the stage where it 's necessary necessary we 'll move that warning up to emergency warning with emergency warnings we do often send out an emergency alert those emergency alerts can come out across mobile phones they can come across into land lines they may actually be delivered by firefighters like police or ses other crews in person across the board what 's dirty important and what we continually to try to get across to everybody is don 't rely on those emergency alerts to let you know what to do it is certainly a tool that we use it is certainly a way that we get that message across that it is not the be all and end all and it is not a single source of truth so therefore we ask people to continue to monitor the rfs website continue to monitor fires near me continue to listen to the obc illawarra locally here where we 'll do the updates of any emergency warnings or any warnings that go out and you 'll actually be best of our ability by relying on a single resource if that single resource falls over that then effectively means you may not get that warning so please look at the big picture try and expand your horizons about making sure you keep situationally aware from anything that i 've just mentioned but even looking out the window and looking at what 's going on around yourself in relation to whether you 're going to stay and defend or leave you would have heard us many times saying if you 're going to leave leave early what time is leave early as soon as you start fearing that you are not in a safe location or you may not wish to be in that location that 's the time to start preparing to leave and that may well be two or three days in advance of a fire getting into your local area we will give you as much notice as we possibly can but when those emergency alerts come out and if it says shelter in place that is not the time to decide that it is time to if you are going to choose to stay and defend your property you must have your property prepared and you must be prepared yourself there 's a lot of things people can do to properly prepare their house removing vegetation around your property itself the structures keeping your lawns made making sure you have ultimate alternate sources of water available many many things that are available for you at any time by reading this document or contacting your local fire control centre or local brigade so again making yourself familiar with that is going to assist you in the long run but the big thing about staying in defending is being mentally and physically prepared what we see during these major events such as caroline that we saw is absolutely horrific it is not somewhere to be if you 're not prepared and that is a huge impact on people mentally and if you 're in any doubt and a lot of the conversations we were having during the fire if there was any doubt our recommendation was to get out so in closing i would just like to say their attention during the last emergency the attention to the police the attention to all the emergency services and especially those warnings for people heeding that advice and making our job a lot safer when we get out there to try and do what we can do to help thanks very much mark and um what we 're going to do now is a little bit a little bit offbeat but um we 've asked the mayor and she was very happy to oblige to bring in her own personal emergency kit mark spoke very very broadly at a sort of a very strong preparatory level of what you can do to uh to be ready and and your planning and the like what i thought would be a really good idea is to see a practical application of what that looks like and who better than to show us than mirror amanda over to you thanks vince and look i 've got to reiterate what mark was saying about the fire your fire plan and don 't just talk about it in your household talk about it with your and you 've got maybe five or six neighbors talking to your neighbors and sharing your plan could be the thing that saves your life if they 're if tragedy hits but the other thing that you need to do is be prepared i know it 's a good girl scout boy scout kind of position to be in we talk about communications this little beauty is a radio you know and for some people they don 't know what a radio is but for old schoolers like me they know exactly what it is check the batteries make sure it works before you put it in your box or even better still grab some extra batteries pop them in your box as well and what frequency amended it 's 97.3 abc in the illawarra on the fm station that 's around the 600s on the 9am on the am but yeah check it out at 97.3 you 're going to need a torch you don 't know how dark it 's going to be when the fire clouds are overhead many of our people do they really experience that has a little bit of a solar panel on it to recharge itself my preference is my trusty old head torch that 's so great to be able to do other things so head torch comes with me everywhere in fact most time it lives in my handbag passport well we don 't they 're kind of obsolete at the moment aren 't they but it 's really good to have some id you can see poking out the top of mine is some cash and you 're going to need some cash because quite often comms go down you can 't use your card to pay for your fuel or to get some food so make sure you put some cash in there it 's a little um cutting kit too so you might need to rate it a couple of times before you actually need it for the uh for the misadventures asthma puffer if you 're asthmatic get your asthma puffer in there and your medications make sure you 've got enough to last for a you know put two to three weeks in there because you to get back to your place so of course a little bit of personal hygiene i mean obviously you can pack your toiletry bag but if you put some new things in your box then you know that you 've got them and you don 't have to worry about forgetting your toiletry bag i love this little gadget it goes in the cigarette lighter one of those old school things in a car i 've got an old car there 's a couple of usb ports in there to charge your phone or any other gadget like your extra batteries and whenever your car 's running that 's a you know the car is a great way to get some extra power on site um if you 've got kids remember to pack their little favorites as well they want to have them in their hand but a little favorite for a kid is always a good thing and with comms out maybe even a pack of cards because you never know how long you 're going to be stuck at the side of the road or anywhere so 's going on this little thing i don 't know if you 've got one of these but this is my little doodad to use the online banking and i always lose it at home but make sure you put it in your box whenever you 're preparing to go away first aid kit and in these times maybe some hand sanitizer a face mask and you didn 't see me do that and that 's not a product placement but you know some people really like to have a good cup of tea or a good cup of coffee put some bits in there that you appreciate so you feel a bit better but then the really important things and these are the things that i would be absolutely lost without so they 're my mementos from my family and if i left these behind i 'd be feeling pretty sad and wondering where they were to make sure that they go in and then whoops don 't do that but they 're in a really really good spot last of all your hard drive how many hundreds of you may lose put them on your hard drive but also put your copies of your insurance take photos of your other important documents you can store them all on here so you 've got access to them when you need need the most that 's a really simple kit and you 'll have something else that you need to add in there but it 's really good to have on hand right near the door so that you can put it in the boot of your car if you need to go if it 's time to go or you can leave it in the boot of your car for a few weeks because that 's what it was like over the summer that we just had with people who are in and out with their emergency kids so they 're pretty important pack one for yourself um that 's uh not an exhaustive list but it 's a really great example and just a couple of things that the mayor has in that emergency pack-up kit are things that have just clicked in my mind that okay maybe rewind a little bit just a few moments to mark williams presentation that 's what the plan is all about and this is the sort of thing that you ought to be discussing right now in cool nights or you know lovely sunny days where there 's no danger and no threat just sit down have a conversation amongst your family and your neighbours and work out how you 're going to keep in touch with all of them and make sure that everybody is on the same wavelength speaking of wavelength we mentioned 97.3 abc illawarra is probably the most authoritative and accurate communication tool during any of these emergencies whether it be fire or flood or heavy winds or storms and the reason it 's so accurate for us is because unlike commercial stations whenever they receive formal warning or official notification from authority authoritative sources that something needs to be done or announced they are obliged under the communications act to transmit that firsthand immediately so they don 't have the commercial imperative to delay when they 've got a space in the transmission they 're obliged use that use the shoalhaven website if you have access to uh to the internet use the shoalhaven facebook page if you have access to that but most importantly the reason for the radio is because when we saw in the fires those things go down with the communications masks masts those the radio still worked so with that we 'll just go to questions now we 've got about 15 minutes to uh 20 minutes to uh to answer some questions um the first one is uh is for the mayor so amanda do you have special powers in an emergency uh in our region there 's some days when i wish that i had special powers full stop but in an emergency all of the powers are handed over to the combat agency so the special powers that i have are the powers of communication and trying to make sure that the messages are delivered as clearly as possible to the community within the shoalhaven other than that the all other powers are put on hold because they 're given over to the combat agency and to the commented that it 's very hard when there is only one road in and one road out and we have no safe area to gather so perhaps i might might just ask um leocon to help us with that and also attach to that is who declares an evacuation centre to open and who mans the council or ses so would you like to take that on please rain just in relation to the first part of the question in tonight uh for the one rounded one right out of towns um we obviously live in a beautiful place here in the shoalhaven and a lot of our towns are on the coastal fringe and that necessitates for one road in one road out as it stands at the moment the best advice i can give to those residents of those coastal towns is listen to the warnings that the rfs put out and respond to those warnings as a matter of urgency so if if your plan is to leave and the warning is leave consider leaving and you 're not you don 't feel safe well consider where fact that you 've got one right in one right here that is very that there 's nothing more vital than that if you need to leave that 's when that 's the time to leave in relation to the second part of the question the evacuation centers who bans them council or ses it 's actually welfare agency that means them they will be activated after discussions with the combat agency and myself and nearest people within the eoc and once it gets to an emergency warning and people are leaving their home we will open up an evacuation centre man by the welfare uh welfare agency and police will also be there to take records for disaster victim registration where you supply your details so that we know who 's who 's left their homes and where they 're going or if they 're going to be housed at the evacuation center okay thanks um thanks very much ray okay the next question um is do we have water bombing aircraft at hmas albatross all year round i can answer quite categorically the answer to that is no that is absolutely yes so we had a pretty well little squadron of a single-engined aircraft up there otherwise they look a little bit like crop dusters but they were able to refuel and turn around very quickly and um and support on on the ground fire crews um using their their pontoons to scoop water up and do effectively a circuit of continuous firebombing we also had a couple of piston engine machines cessnas that were operated from from a couple of places further north and as president of the local aero club i can vouch that we were providing those with uh with aviation gasoline to be able to uh to do their little part in the uh in in fighting the fire as well can it take bigger machines the the problem with the bigger machines is that they are extremely heavy aircraft given what 's what 's known or aircraft weight is accepted by a runway depending on its low classification number low classification number of runway is the bit that says that the runway can actually withstand the weight of something heavier now big airliners any sort of weight to them we have on the odd occasions that air shows enjoyed things like 767 or 737 flying but um but that 's not a not something that could be sustained at a runway which is effectively built for a light military aircraft um to mark senpai um so yeah echoing what then says the rfs has done a significant amount of work uh in conjunction with hmas albatross uh and the australian military uh we 've got the air base uh permanently set up at albatross now where we have the capability of not only reloading with fuel and water but we also now have retardant tanks there so that 's the the red diacon stuff that you see come out of a lot of the firefighting aircraft uh we 've got the capability now holding that intake there and loading that in we do the large air tankers that the rfs uses being the c130 hercules and the 737s are capable and have been used in the last fire season uh working out of the albatross as well and the ability that we 've normal turnaround time where they used to have to go out to richmond just west of sydney and come back down is effectively half so we get a very quick turnaround time and we get that resource back out of the fire in short succession which is a great benefit for local communities so a big thank you from myself to uh hnos albatross and defence for their hosting us out there they 've always uh assisted wherever we 've requested whether it 's been aviation assistance parking aircraft overnight through to even accommodating some of our firefighters during the last campaign so we are held in very good state with a great relationship between the both of us don 't give it up um i hope you can hear me the question is is any hazard reduction planned before the fire season and given the amount of destruction already are we in for a similar summer with fires in the shoalhaven area okay good question um so our fire season as i said mentions uh starts on the 1st of september crews have been busy uh planning and and east coast lows and the other subsequent rainfall that we 've had has prevented us from doing any burning uh in the in the months since the uh the last fire season but we do have a number of burns ready to go as soon as what we call that weather window opens to us so as soon as the fuel moisture so the leaves the twigs and all those sort of stuff on the forest wall that allows us to do this this back burning prescribed burning as we call it dries out to the point where we can safely do it and effectively do it we will be ready to go now in saying that it doesn 't look like that 's going to be likely at least for another few weeks yet and it all depends on whether we get any further rainfall so it is a constant monitoring situation uh but we do have a number of those uh ready to go in relation to the uh the forecast weather conditions i think i mentioned it uh or briefly touched on it we are looking uh event for the the summer period around the shoalhaven and the southern part of new south wales and what that will usually see and i am definitely not a meteorologist but the information that i have is what we usually see out of the la nina and that is the opposite of an el nino is we get increased rainfall so we could be up for a wetter than average summer uh which will in turn not only assist us with the you know keeping that fuel moisture up and not holding those fires but it may also continue to prevent us from actually getting those prescribed burns actually done as well thanks mark um the next question i think has two very distinct parts to it although it 's only one question um and for that i 'd just put amanda and ray on on notice but the question is what happens when you have a large elderly community who will not leave without ses or rfs doorknocks so that 's a really difficult question because we have to take responsibility as a broader community in making our elderly disaster will there be a knock on the door that that knock on the door may not be from a uniform but that knock on the door could be from a neighbor so it really is up to us as neighbours and as communities to make sure that the older people within our community are cared for but they understand the the gravity of the situation and that someone in our community takes responsibility whether it 's you in a street because you know that your neighbor is 94 and has mobility issues you can do that you can be that person that welfare person to make sure that that person knows what 's going on you can also ask that person who is their contact that you can make that phone call too and ask them to come and extract an elderly person and take them to their home elsewhere so being really well networked in our communities is important and if you don 't know who the people are in your street can i say that you know maybe some of that street it 's more difficult with with people in your street gives you the opportunity to help out an elderly neighborhood the question was um what happens when you have a large elderly community who will not leave without ses or rfs or knox um in relation to elderly communities they are one of our key priorities for the eoc as a vulnerable community we work quite extensively throughout the year through the lemc and in particular a health functional area um to identify the nursing homes and the the old old person 's home for one of the better trades um and they have unique contacts with those with those areas and you might amanda 's exactly right you might not get a doorknob from a policeman or a policewoman or an ses operative it might be from a phone call from the house representative here in eoc to the contact at the home to say we need to get you out and it 's as simple as that it could just be a phone call if it 's a neighbor i 100 agree with amanda we have to look after each other so if hand you can ring a triple zero and we will arrange a medium vacuum if need be of that person to a safe area where they can be looked after and that could be another hospital or another um another person thanks very much ray um thank you also i understand from the uh from the team that meaning the uh the line here that there 's an awful lot of great feedback coming back from the community and uh and nice nice nice words thank you very much indeed for those that have taken the time to do that um we 're we 're approaching the end of the uh the transmission and there are don 't appear to be a great deal of questions left but perhaps if we can do a bit of summing up um at the personal level the things that i 'm hearing tonight and what i 've what i 've learned from from uh listening to amanda what 's in what 's in her emergency kit and also from the planning aspects of it is the big things are make sure we all said on numerous occasions abc radio illawarra being heard through a through a radio that is not dependent on power from the wall and is not dependent on on any sort of internet or digital connection is a really good place to start i 've also heard that if you 've got any sort of medication requirements or potentially need ongoing supplies of medicines it 's a really smart thing to enter the season with with sufficient stocks to be able to uh to see you over for one or two weeks also important to have a little bit of money tucked away somewhere and by that i mean cash please don 't listen too much the rumors of cashless society the reality is when the power goes down all the comms links are down fps machines and and holes in the wall atms will not work and so if you 've got to stop somewhere to buy petrol or food or provisions you need to have some cash in your uh in your um as we say in the navy put put some 20 bucks in your sock for right now it 's actually quite fun to hook onto the bureau of meteorology website also the arcgis is one that i enjoy arc gis that 's a terrific website to have a look at where um where concentrations of heat are and uh they 're managed in terms of time lapsed since the heat was recorded they 're just good good source of information along with fires near me make some arrangements to get your mobile phone charger and uh work out ways of charging that either by a separate power power um power source or with the appropriate plug that you can plug into your car or a usb port that can plug into into the into a connection in your car a torch um other things that that we had fed to us by a member of the public earlier for an earlier webinar was if you do have a generator make sure it 's high and as in off the ground and make sure you have extra fuel for it in case you need it things to have in your in your kit to take away wills and anything that that might assist you to set up somewhere else should you need to so your your passwords your service new south wales and mygov account details a list of phone numbers because if your phone goes down or the phone towers are down and your phone memory is in the cloud you may lose all of your phone numbers so have the ones that matter to you written down somewhere or in at least memorized amanda spoke well about uh about photos use use the amenity of mass storage devices or if you 're like me still got millions of photo albums buy a bigger car and put the photo albums in the back um dog and cat animal leash lots of animals survived but then the owners had nothing to tie them up with that 's pretty important and um and if you uh if your animals do get away in in the confusion of fire or smoke uh they can actually make um some some unhappy times for wildlife and on wildlife i think there was one question there about did council support or the fires the answer to that is yes there 's a wonderful photo on online of mayor amanda in the back of an mrh90 helicopter delivering i think it was a 800 kilograms of various various bits of sweet potatoes and food that the the local foreigner could could survive on so the answer to that is yes we also have a terrific ranger network and an environmental team at council who also are very focused on those on those very important aspects of recovery you 'll note that if you 've seen the recovery web infographic one of the one of the factoids that we put on the front of that that document was that this area lost 14 200 beehives that might sound significant but when you 're trying to re-pollinate forests and native vegetation that 's mostly done by by bees and small birds so it was a significant loss that 's about all we have oh reading glasses spare car keys medical scripts make sure you 've got them with you um and uh there 's all sorts of other good tips on here which we list online after the uh after this um this transmission and we 'll put them up on the shoalhaven city council website so you can just have a look down the list and say well that doesn 't apply to me or that does because there 's a couple of rippers here like pool noodles they are very good flotation tools for folks who who might be the strongest swimmers it 's not the sort of thing that people would actually tuck away but it makes a hell of a lot of sense the other thing we 'll put online is we spent a bit of time tonight talking about what this center looks like we 've got a terrific bit of footage that was run by uh by brad the the rfs community liaison person here in december before the fire peak actually occurred and we showed it on the two live webinars um this afternoon and it was well received and we 'll put that on our on our website as well so you can see what this place looks like when it 's up and running and ratepayers residents and and townspeople to know that whatever can be done is being done we are focusing a great deal of energies on resilience in the future we are also focusing a great deal of effort on making sure that our planning is as thorough as it can possibly be we suffered a significant blow 80 percent of 4 600 square kilometers was affected by the fires that 's a huge area nonetheless it 's uh it is survivable and we will make sure that we can do whatever we can to survive in the future that puts us up to about the closure of the uh of the facebook live stream thank you very much indeed mayor amanda ray and mark thank you so much for taking the time out of uh of what i know is already very hectic and busy days and um thank you to the team that have manned the uh man the uh the lions behind the scenes and uh to all who 've helped us prepare for these webinars and most importantly thank you to you members of our city who have to be president to support us thank you very much i wish everybody a great night _"

    "text": "good afternoon everyone and welcome to the conjolla connected communities master plan and urala bay concept plan webinar i wish to advise you that this webinar is being recorded and will be made available on the get involved page and therefore can be reviewed by you at a time that is suitable and also accessible to any others who are interested and were unable to attend my name is jane lewis and i 'm the interim director of city lifestyles at shoalhaven city council i would firstly like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet today within all parts of the shoalhaven and pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging i extend that respect to aboriginal and torres strait island people here with us today online i would also like to acknowledge the significant impact the recent bushfires and floods have had on the indigenous community their well-being culture and history within the shoalhaven 2020 has been an extremely difficult year for the shoalhaven and one of our significantly affected communities is that of congola park and lake congola new year 's when the corowam bush fire had made its way to the coastal town this was followed by the impact of several floods since and the ongoing covid 19 pandemic we have seen an incredible amount of resilience and perseverance from our community members and we are here today to talk about one project that has emerged from a dedicated community group being the condola community recovery association in march of this year the recovery association sought the expertise of tact studio for architecture to develop a master plan for the area to rebuild and enhance aspects of the open space and be a key part of the community 's recovery and healing process the ccra subsequently engaged tact studio for architecture who along with council staff and with other community representatives have coordinated this process today we have brent and dunn and katarina hendell from tact studio for architecture who will be running through a presentation of the draft condola connected communities master plan and the draft urala bay concept plan i also have council staff with us susan edwards the community and recreation manager and jessica volkanovsky our senior and invite any questions via the web chat any questions we do not get to answer today will be put up as frequently asked questions on the get involved website along with all questions received and the recording of today 's meeting i will now hand over to brent and katarina thank you jane good afternoon everyone thanks for um joining us for this webinar um i think um i might start with just quickly introducing ourselves in the sense of how we got to be involved this project um brent and i we actually founded our practice down in conjoiner 10 years ago and so we 've got family as many people know and so we after the fires we were there around christmas and then we were furthering south coast and after the fires we came back to help out at the recovery center and while being there we 've spoken to many people particularly the members of the recovery committee and a lot of questions came up and a lot of things that the community wish they had and also how they wished the place to be a visualist of things wouldn 't that be great if out of this disaster something positive could come and so then we actually if you go to the next slide put together a um [Music] could you do that please did you go to the yeah that 's it so we put together an um initial master plan which the idea was really to collate a number of those ideas that were floating around about what conjolla could be and could become in this rebuilding process um and to collate that into a single document that then allow people to comment on and to give input and to collate ideas so this is um this is really about ideas it 's not about an actual plan as such which is why it 's quite loose and on this plane there 's a number of components that had come up in our conversations with both the committee and some members of the community and that was the sort of long-standing actually desire for connection between um condola park and lake conjolla including um bike path possibly is what we discussed with that and then um some other key components were some shelters or meeting points possibly community building a memorial um playground new playground equipment um skate park so it became the sort of larger picture big picture image of what the community might be in another five ten years from now and um we believe that it makes sense to bring that all together um so because otherwise once there 's something on paper we 're all able to talk about it and comment on it before that is very hard to pin down and it 's very hard to get opinions and so that was this initial document that we just put together in order to help people to sort of have some input into the process of might what might happen into the future um because it 's quite a complex process obviously um in that sort of first phase after the fires we also ran a rebuilding workshop at the recovery center and i think that was also one of the key points where we 've got a little bit more insight into what may be needed specifically for us to be engaged to then be paid a small sum to put together a more detailed master plan which then could be used to to actually take to stakeholders to take to investors to take to private companies and to so next slightly sorry um to then look at donations look at council 's view on things and basically get a little bit more detail into this so if you could change slides please i think it takes a little while so that that plan which you know it looked simple but it was actually quite um a long consultation process um it 's trying to put together a big picture that has a little bit more detail and determine some location of possible facilities this is obviously not it 's a suggestion it 's by no means what 's going to happen um but it 's trying to make collate sort of a plan for the cycleway in particular this possible route and locate some facilities that might be um happening in this rebuilding process which then enabled the recovery center to seek donations for some things it locates the cycle and as i said it notes some possibilities of path of exploring the national park areas and the council-owned [Music] reserve areas it shows some of the facilities at lake controller and then or importantly at condola park where most of the devastation obviously has happened um and it makes some there 's some destinations basically is what we called it and it shows where they are and the colored areas they basically just give an overview on the ownership of the lots of land because the hardest thing in navigating this whole proposal of the psychopaths in particular is obviously the fact that it goes across community land crown land council owned land and private poverty and that 's what this plan tries to clarify so that we can start to talk about ideas next slide please and in as part of this sort of as a further development of this initial plan um we 've then put together the the components of the project um at this point they weren 't ordered by greatest importance or anything they 're just parts of a driver behind this in the beginning has been that shared pathway so that we can make sure that controller park and light control become a more connected community which you know is particularly important during emergencies but also in terms of um how residents move between the two communities how services are accessed i think that connection is something that that should be looked at um so there 's the pathway and those images are just um other um projects and suggestions of what the capacity of this could be um one thing that came up pretty early was a some sort of community facility at condola park and this will be the the second part of this presentation that we 're going to be talking about and that basically came from this sense that as uh after particularly after the fires that there wasn 't really a gathering point a meeting point to exchange information there was nowhere to store shared um facilities and things for example generator donated generators there was no storage and so a some sort of community building facility at um controller park was one this um then there 's the memorial shelter possibly at conjolla beach for the similar purpose playground as the playground had burned down um skate park because that 's something had been discussed for a while um the thought of maybe opening some of the other areas of controlling national park um for mountain biking not in a in a big scale but for children of the communities to actually just have some tracks to run through there which is something that 's sort of already happening but possibly a more formal way um fishing platforms and some signage at the entry to canjola and some new road alignments and linguistic linkages so that 's all things we looked at in the process and that are located in that final master plan so next slide please and then once we discussed all of those things um we got um council got involved at some point because obviously all of those projects need to be approved by council and they need to be approved by a number of different departments because of the complexity of the fact that we 're dealing on and environmental issues um and so what we then did as the the next step is to put together a set of recording modules so groups of projects that could be completed one by one because obviously um this is a big picture vision over many years potentially and not all of this is going to happen at once um and so we 've looked at how they can be most logically grouped together um and so it shows different sections of the cycleway but it shows some for example module c is uvala bay area and that includes the cycle by connecting to the new boat ramp for example and module b if you say that the red one at the fronted urala bay is the community building and the other facilities at um at conjona park and so this also then helped to define where to start because that 's always the big question um and there seemed to be consensus that the area that needed most systems quite obviously was controller path and so module b is the one that everyone decided that needed to be that to come up with a concept plan for module b the controller park area so if you go to the next slide please um the other thing um just to add that i think because we know this is a long-term project and there 's going to be many parties involved and there might be other other architects other planners other other entities involved we 've tried to put together a set of design principles that then could guide other further projects and they have to do with community well-being natural beauty environment resilience economic development and beauty and delight and i think they are things that we feel are important to assess against each project each rebuilding project that have that of a public character um that happens in the community so this is just asking a number of questions and i think um any project that 's being attempted in the era should should answer positively to those so that we can make sure that anything that 's being built now is not just being rebuilt or built but build better um next please so i think of the master plan for purella bay i might get brent to talk about that yeah so essentially what um caterina 's been sort of referring to is the fact that the first part of the process was collating all the information about what potentially could this community build back better and how could we how could we build it back better and so in the focus obviously due to the devastation was in was in your urala bay in this part of cajola lake um this is kind of a drilling down into a bit more detail about a specific area and we imagine that a similar process might happen for each of the other areas of the lake and then that allows the community in these kind of forums to then have this have further say into it so the the beginning of this um process is to have a look at the site analysis which is something that we also talked a lot about you know a rebuilding workshop for the individual houses but all of this work is focused squarely on understanding what the potential is here at where the existing um where you know where the views were coming from where the sunlight was coming from where the um water was moving across the site um and we 've gone to and we 've mapped that onto these site plans with the water supplies and services so if you move on to the next site please um this gets overlaid this information um and and so we start to get a picture of you know where are the opportunities and where the constraints so for example down in the in the park there 's an area that does you know it stays quite quite muddy after flooding quite wet and there 's a bit of drainage that needs to be done so the idea being that if we can identify the problems in an area the possibilities in an area whatever we do can address the problems and and take advantage of the opportunities so next slide please so these are the components of the um of the of the concept plan um and and again all these concept ideas are here for everybody 's perhaps at one that 's the that 's the shared bikeway that 's a an idea that this continual link goes from the around the waterfront around the natural warding the natural walking path that 's already there um linking the new boat ramp and and this new facility so it 's easy to move around for young families it 's it 's it 's a defined pathway which then keeps um the rest of the sensitive environment sort of looked after um then number two is this community building the community building should perhaps be um i guess seen in the it 's a shelter um it 's it 's we 'll talk about what it 's got in a minute um it 's basically a barbecue area with some facilities um and then some kind of um reflection seat within maybe that 's integrated within the community building there 's a pontoon fishing point um an upgrade to the existing one memorial garden number five that 's been already started work on by the community we understand the other components are a basketball half quarter playground which has play area adventure play kayak jetty maybe um and a larger scale memorial which we 'll talk about in a minute so next slide please the general components that we and all of those came from um hearing people um who were um involved in the area they came from us walking around seeing some of the events after the you know the gatherings after the bushfires they came from us walking the site and listening to feedback from the from the community um consultation particularly mr allen in the in that area in the beginning so then um the core of this um proposal here is this is this community building um the idea of this is that every community needs a place to come together whether it 's in good times or bad times and and to be able to um accommodate that we 're proposing essentially a sheltering roof um with a couple of platforms and some amenities and toilets um a store room for community facilities and then potentially another room that could be used as a kiosk or whatever else it needs to be used 's just gathering and giving out information and that 's come to degree also from the fact that after the fires we could see how valuable to community building at lake controller was in coordinating the efforts to to help people and to store donations and so on but obviously um that was at lake controller whereas controller park really could have done with um a base if you want um to to manage that sort of process and just store a few things and have some generators ready for people so that 's the intention of this much smaller scale community building that in in um in an emergency situation could be used for this it will allow the community to have some facilities for um you know for storage particularly but also to um it 's a really small kitchen that was of the kitchen that basically that we thought might be incredibly helpful in the aftermath of anything happening but also more importantly in looking into the future hoping that this won 't ever happen again um something that that could be used for um a kid and it 's actually um fairly small scale but i think what 's also important to say is that this is really a collation from from a number of comments that that sort of or in briefing that 's been given to us but that um this is just a concept um it can change it will change those things always do and this is what this webinar is for to get feedback on what scale that is actually desired by the community um we simply looked at the scale in the sense of um could we accommodate two kids birthday parties with two families there that 's sort of the scale if you imagine um and it 's it 's existing it sort of tucks on to the existing jetty um where it is now so that that can be upgraded and used for um fishing a but also for better access during emergencies um and so look it should be it should be really um said that there 's been a lot a fair bit of thought given to its location here and this photograph on the left the lake which is something extraordinary in this area and the idea being that once you 're inside this building that 's what you can enjoy it 's not about the building per se but about providing sheltered spaces in in what is currently quite an exposed edge of the light that has no vegetation on it needs a bit of rehabilitation anyway so it made sense at that location we could actually lift the levels up a little bit you know we still got a bit of um there 's there 's quite a lot of work to be done on getting the exact level for the flooding and things but it gives us a good basis to begin it 's a east facing location it enjoys the lake it 's it 's a place that um you know would be perfect for a barbecue and in addition to that it 's the really the only location that gives decent access for boats because the rest of the bay is um probably too shallow for that and it also sits below the fairly steep hill behind it so that any residential buildings and i think that was really important to us as well next place yeah so this just shows the the section of the building so i cut through the buildings in in that hill sowing that it 's intended that it sits below the view over the top there um that it it has a zone um at the back of it where the path can go past the council 's asked that to be a bit wider so that we can get maintenance vehicles in from council to come and come and um clean up in there if needed and then in the front um is is the view after the lake and that steps down at the bottom there to the to the so you can enjoy the edge of the edge of the lake um yeah i mean you can read it across there and at the exact levels they will be determined in the in the continuing process because this is obviously sketch only so once um there 's more surveyed survey detail and more flood investigation then those levels can be can storage areas are above any flood levels so then the next one please so this is this is an idea of of how it might find itself being used um there 's a couple of picnic tables on each side the um the building opens on the on the north side so that it gets winter sun that is the exact winter sun angle coming in there shown sketched um and so there can be there can be winter sun coming through the center and so there is two two sides um with two tables um that would then function as a place to meet for a community gathering to me somebody could sit there quietly in the sun in the mornings uh in the afternoon it 's protected the idea is that we actually build up a handrail at the front rather than having it directly open to that breeze coming across the lake so you can sit behind that and get a little bit of shelter from the wind but the idea is that it 's quite clear all the way through its construction is ideally something robust 're going to catch on fire again it 's it 's got to be yeah robust quite easy to maintain but it 's also got to age well and gracefully over time like the rest of the lake so the intention being that it activates a previously unused or unactivated area revitalizes the jetty and then you know perhaps forms a place where people can enjoy a celebration of a live event or something like that and it 's um it obviously is all in relationship to the other parts of that little master plan for the area the the playground um it 's got a visual relationship to the playground that 's already built um and and there is some funding available if the community um desires to to build the the basketball court and the little bike play area so that that all comes together as um something that that makes a bit of a little town center basically for controller park and that 's something that like controller has enjoyed for a while there 's some facilities there and we think that controller park in terms of of their own facilities particularly for families as well next one please yeah so and then the other component that we heard a lot about um in various scales is is the idea that there might be something to memorialize that kind of traumatic event um and and the idea that there might be something that celebrates the lake um is is something you know we i i think it needs to be a memorialization in in in a number of different scales and i think it can have the the event was so um it was such such a large-scale event that it it it does just this is the ict bushfire memorial um and it does allow people to touch base with that um over time um and so the intention behind all of these is to simply look at if if the community wanted to memorialize this event if they wanted to you know have something that they could see that there 's a recovery process happening um over time that you know this would be a simple the suggestion here is that we simply place a a place in the lake that 's that 's out of the way um that could be seen um from far away as a as an art object in itself so the idea is that it could it could reflect and it could take on all of those characters off the you know that something floated in the water um beautifully does reflections and uh refractions and that it also provides you know a bit of um these kind of burnt logs have always been a real symbol of recovery from the fires and from those bark comes that regrowth and in this case the idea is that we integrate regrowth of symbols of some of the indigenous dreaming some of the stories of this place can so we can use this opportunity as a way to help everybody learn more about the place help everybody understand that the lake is the key to this you know the well-being here we need to look after it it 's quite a densely layered you know memorial in a simple gesture so that 's something that we feel it could um offer 's not necessarily you know if this is natural materials over time in another 50 years this this could be gone this could also have evolved and moved on and no longer do we need to remember because we may have learned from that and move on so well there 's there 's many layers i think that 's something that would require a lot more um discussion um with many people um and we 've sort of reached out to both authorities but also to some of the indigenous um groups in the area but i think that 's something that shouldn 't and won 't happen quickly and that you know needs time to to be thought about carefully and i think that concludes the presentation for now obviously um what we 've taken you through just now is actually only a small part of the the the two documents that came out of the process the bigger master plan which also contains um a large section of research into the history and international environment and then the the rollerblade concept plan as well and you can um and so i think they need to be looked at um together so we do encourage a reading of them and if there 's any questions the point of this is to put something down that we that the community can now respond respond to and you know if if some things have more um importance than others then then it 'll take on a life of its own and the idea of a concept is that really it is the first stroke of a pencil um to show to perform a basis of discussion and to test um um available possibilities basically to you know we can 't obviously um discuss the impact of something without having first drawn up an idea for it so debbie den can interrogate it and that 's the purpose of those poisonous documents one more to guide the future process and the other one to put an idea out of what could be that 's it i think if we could change to q a now maybe thank you brent and katarina please stay with us as we move into our question and like to welcome council staff members susan edwards and jessica volkonovsky to join with us now first up i might throw this one over to brenton katarina we 've got some questions coming in already which is terrific um was the community building at urala bay inspired by another community building of a similar style and location what was your inspiration there look it wasn 't directly inspired by a particular building but there are many great examples of buildings of similar scale that have been successfully built and integrated in the community and one that 's come up and that we showed an image before in the initial master plan was a um i have to look up it 's for lake macquarie council it 's the um regatta foreshore kiosk and amenities that was built there and um so i encourage everyone if you 're interested just have a look at it i think that 's something that 's architecturally lovely but modest um in this case it 's all timber so i think that would be slightly different consideration being given to the to the fire proneness in terms of scale and modesty i think it 's a good example to look at and there 's there is actually many others but the idea overall for the actual community building has always been that it 's um something that is of a vernacular nature that sort of fits within the environment rather than something that goes as a big beacon but that doesn 't mean it can 't be good architecture thank you for that katarina uh we 've got one now which i might put over to the council staff what are the next steps after consultation okay i can take that um hi even my name 's susan edwards i 'm the manager of community and recreation um so what we 're going to do with the consultation is we 're hoping that lots of people make comments on it and provide us some input then we will be collating all them and providing responses and then reporting them to council so that council then can make a decision on how we move this forward terrific thank you very much susan um there 's another the anticipated timing for implementing the plans well that 's a lovely question i love that one well i guess um it depends on how long it takes us to actually get plans that the community are happy with so that would obviously be our first point and then once we have those plans we then be in a position to seek funding so obviously it 's reliant on us finding funding to um to implement them but obviously we need to get to that point where we have plans that are endorsed by the community and council thank you for that susan um this perhaps is wonderful for um for for all of you to perhaps answer have the impacts of the community building been assessed and then what environmental studies will be done or will be needed i might start off with that um look i think um again i think it 's important to say that this is a concept plan and that the assessment of those impacts is part of the continuing process from here because obviously an assessment can only happen once there 's concrete 't locate it entirely but obviously in designing the building we have made sure that we that we 've thought about all those things and that 's why the building for example has moved from an initial idea of it being further down further south in the park area has moved up the top because we have undertaken some consultation with council the environmental department with rms and we 've all met on site and discussed the merits of of different areas and scales there and so that is a the beginning of a longer process i would say and the fact is that in the um in the process of then seeking council approval and there will be then more intensive consultation on those particular issues i think where the building itself is located now um it is you know it 's out of any view corridors it 's um as away from residential buildings as it can be possibly and we don 't anticipate a great deal of noise from it in the first place it 's just a community shelter with some barbecues um and some storage the members of the community and so we 're we 're we 're open to any suggestions and where we 're sort of looking forward to engaging with that more i mean the other part is obviously that there was quite a few parts to the puzzle in terms of the the playground which were already located but then there 's the basketball court and the skatepark well in lake conjolla and the um the bike play area they need to be assessed on the same terms obviously in the process and things may be moving or probably will be moving around as we go in response i thank you and council staff is there something that you can add to what environmental studies or other studies might be required please yes i can take that one jane um so as uh following on from what katarina said as part of the design process um after we get to a point of having an adopted master plan um we would obviously need to continue to a review of environmental factors stage and some of the considerations there will be flora as some other items that might come up throughout the process but we will certainly look at the various submissions that are provided through this process to see if there are other uh matches which may need to be reviewed and considered as part of the subsequent stages thank you for that jessica there have been a number of questions have come in about funding for the project and grant so i might uh add add um what i can to that at this stage we are in the initial concepts and the consultation stage and yes i think there have been some observations that it 's a it 's a it 's a grand plan and a huge concept um however there are a range of grant funding available particularly for areas that have been hit by the bushfires and more recently with with covid too and the condola community recovery association have also been fundraising so we anticipate there will be some seed funding to get this project moving forward when the elements have been decided upon and the various studies have been done however i think we of of modules so that does allow it to be worked through in stages dependent on what the community wants and what the community identifies as its priorities um now there is a question here that 's come through um in relation to a consultation with the aboriginal community and asking what consultation has or will be undertaken and will there be a recognition of aboriginal culture um through the project um we might sort of say a few words look i think that 's a that 's a longer process actually and we 've reached out to the land council and to some other members of the indigenous community locally um we 've agreed that we would meet on site um but we haven 't been able to actually make a date for that yet i mean covet has made this not not exactly easier but our intention um and the the recovery association 's intention is that that will be part of the process and particularly yeah a very important part um and we 've done a fair bit of research ourselves and trying to understand the landscape the memorial i think there 's an intention that that we may be able to get some aboriginal artists if they 're interested directly involved in creating this so the answer is basically yes um but that 's something that 's sensitive and it 's not something that can be rushed so hopefully in the process we 'll be able to to sort of share a little bit more about this as well thank you for that katarina a number of comments have come through asking were other locations considered for the bbq uh community building and i think you highlighted the beautiful view that is uh offered where the current location is but in in deciding that were there any other spots around the lake in canjola park that you initially considered yes there were jane we initially had thought that it might make sense to start the community building down near the playground on the flatter area however that um it wasn 't getting a lot of sun and a lot of a lot of um area for it meant that if we wanted to get any connection of removal of the of the she oaks that were there the preference was to avoid that so then we also had a look at the flatter area which as it turns out is a bit more a bit more marshy bit more flood prone around to the around to the south a bit further so we basically tested it and this is with council staff with waterways and um with the environment officer um and and discussed each of those options and the um the fact is that the the location that it is proposed in now um it is the area that does most need rehabilitation so it gives us an opportunity to use the building to kind of think through some of those and resolve some of those issues and then um other things that played into this location are the the access to the lake um because we we wanted this to be able to be used as a point of arriving and leaving and because obviously during the fires the lake was an evacuation route and as although the building itself is a shelter not allows people to to get onto boats and leave the area so that was important and the other thing is that it 's now located below a fairly steep hill which means there 's far less impact visually on on neighboring houses so that 's also something that was important because everywhere else in the park and houses are sort of at the same level so there would have invariably some impact on use and we 're trying to avoid that obviously as well i think it 's important too to say that the the building and all of these facilities are designed to be accessible so that there can be wheeled access throughout the things down to the lake edge as well now yeah thank you very much for that explanation um it 's great we 've got many questions coming in here and i want to reassure people if we don 't get to your question we will answer all of these and put them up on the faqs we 've got a question here with regard to barbecues about how many barbecues there may be um and restrictions so our advice there is to check with the new south wales health site about the current uh uh advice however our park facilities are open and our barbecue facilities are able to be used we obviously encourage you to observe the social distancing and make sure that the number of people that you you have is within what the new south wales health guidelines are advising so the good news is yes our barbecues and our parks are open um and with regard to the number of barbecues perhaps i could ask katarina or brent just to sit to identify what 's in the proposed concept at this stage look if we do you want to go back to the plan maybe so we can um have a look at that just briefly um in the slides um look um obviously just on your sketch so it 's pretty loose but um there 's two areas with two barbecues right now if you go one further back um just plain thinking that it might be two different groups who could be using it at the same time um six if that helps and then to table sort of associate with each barbecue um obviously that could be one it could be more i 'm not sure but um when we came to controller park and one of the sort of events to come together which was sort of a bbq um i think it was in march um there was actually quite a few people so the scale is really relating to the families we saw come together there yeah but this could change i i think the other thing to say about this in general is that if this this isn 't intended as as a public facility for the residents of congola park so you know it 's its scale should be suitable so that it can be used by that that 's what the brief for this project is to make sure that it 's primarily serving a function and providing a function that doesn 't exist currently in in the area yeah thank you for that um we 've had some comments come through on the bike and the cycle way with some alternate part of the feedback we 've got um this one um suggests that it could run along the entrance road and provide some lookout options and would connect lake anjola and congola park could potentially be less intrusive to visitors but could also connect to the narrow wally creek reserve so we 'll certainly take on board on board those comments as we review the feedback that we 've got um a number of comments have come through um regarding will the bbq areas be lit and perhaps some concerns about noise or intrusion to some of the residents there so again they 're all valid comments that that we will take on board and the things in connection with lighting and stuff comes round to detail further down the line when we 've got to the position of deciding um exactly what it is that the community wants there and and how they would like to see those spaces used um been some a question here about have there been any ecological studies um on on on the lake and the flooding which may impact um on the building pass that one over to council staff just to clarify some of the the processes that we 'll go through and some of the studies that will need to be undertaken yeah i 'll take that if you want jess sorry let 's just jump in there um yeah so in relation to that obviously we 've done some preliminary work in relation to flooding council has that those flood mappings currently in our mapping system so we have a look at initially but obviously until we actually determine what works are being proposed it 's a bit hard to do that more deeply and that will be something that that does continue as the plans are determined thank you does that answer the question and we can always provide further information um through our faqs another question here who is it envisioned the main users of these facilities might be is it for the locals seniors young families tourists or visitors i 'd say yes all of the above the above and i certainly noted that brent earlier said that uh everything will be designed to be inclusive including are ultimately agreed on by the community so we will meet any of our dda requirements there there too just bear with me as i uh some comments here about um it would seem the perfect location to for a party um and some concern about jet skiers who may be on the on the lake at night seeking to use this and destroying the peace and the tranquility so again all valid comments that we will take on board as part of a part of this process and some comments here about um the memorial and um just some concerns as to whether this this is a good idea and it would be interesting to get the community feedback on that as to whether it is is a reminder of something that they would prefer not to not to frequently see or whether it 's a good place for reflection so again through the community consultation we certainly appreciate your your thoughts on that um some comments here about how many residents were consulted at this initial stage so i think it might be helpful just to clarify the now and where that moves forward so perhaps um susan or jessica might be able to elaborate on that further i can take that question jane thank you jess so we opened uh community feedback or the community consultation period on the 3rd of august and that is continues to be open and it will close this coming monday on the 28th of september so as part of that process of commencing that consultation period we um undertook a mail out to uh the landowners within the area of cajola park as well as letters to specific community groups like the community condola community association as well as getting them to provide links to our council 's get involved page which is the main platform for consultation that we are using for this particular consultation period uh so through the get involved page um we have been able to provide copies of both of the plans which tact have prepared and we have been able to hear about today we have also been using social media to get the word out on this particular project as well we 've had within cajola park and lake canjola as well as other people from other areas of shorehaven who frequent the area as well so we do know that people are hearing about it and they are definitely interested in providing their comments on the project so we will continue to use the get involved page to receive feedback as well as provide updates in the coming stages of this particular project as well thank you jessica um some more comments coming through just concerns from the residents about the use of the reserve and an increase in waste and will additional waste collections be uh be planned and how will the reserve be kept clean i think they 're all comments that we can take on board as part of the consultation and yes they 're very important in terms of rema maintaining the uh the appearance of the reserve and also that the health of the lake so thank you for for those comments um another comment coming here a couple of these um is there going to be a commercial interest in the proposed community building i think there canteen is that something that um could be uh uh clarified yeah um look the um what we 've sort of proposed was simply something that came from some feedback in that it was um tricky to run some of the recovery work in just providing people with a cup of tea and a bottle of water because there 's no location so a lot of the donations were handed out from under gazebo on the road so the the the small sort of kitchenette there is simply for the community use and then um so that say a kids birthday party could have a place where the cakes could be put out and a pot of coffee be made but um if the community who would be running this in what i imagine depending on what community wants um they could then decide to also run say a fundraiser for for something by on a saturday even the weather 's nice and there might be some tourists around at this end of the lake um to sell some cupcakes it 's really as small as that um the intention unless someone puts their hand up and says we want that yeah in which case in which case it 's good opportunities for local kids to learn how to pull a cafe or coffee or but it 's it 's really up it 's really more a little community kitchen that that can be used when needed for i 'll just say you know i presume that maybe particularly in this process of rebuilding there might be some community events and meetings just to get people together to talk about how to deal with the repairs that are happening to some public facilities and so on so it could just be little coffee kitchen thank you for for clarifying that i 'm just having a scan through further questions that have have come in um we 've had some further questions here on on consultation and uh i think um jessica and susan have spoken about the consultation process that is is currently taking place um [Music] some comments here have the safety aspects of a memorial in the water being con being considered um some concerns that it may so we 'll certainly take that on board but all of those types of factors would be considered um when when when planning anything that uh that that maybe does or doesn 't uh get yet built yes we um on that one that we have been talking to transport new south wales about that exact um issue and so the idea is that we try and find a location which um is not in the channels and not in in the navigation um course because it would require lights and things as well thank you for that um there 's a question here about proposed deep water boat ramp that probably doesn 't form part of this project but we will aim to get an answer to you about that one um from from the relevant relevant staff this looks like it 's in relation to haviland street um a question here about would additional car parking been required is that one maybe council staff might be able to respond to yeah i can respond to that one um obviously depending on what ends up being in the community about the park here not generally um depending on what ends up being in there and the amount of take-up of it there may be potential that council need to look to provide parking but a lot of it we 're considering it to be for the locals i mean it 's a local park we 're hoping the people will walk to their park or ride their bike to the park and i guess that 's also the plan behind having the connectivity with a pathway so that people from other areas can get there but it 's definitely something that we 'll be considering as we move forward thank you susan comment here a great starting plan to go from um where would the skate park mentioned be near and when would that start is that one that um i think you might be able to talk about the location of the skate park yeah look um because a skate park was something that sort of generally came up in the in the early discussions on the wish list for particularly the older kids in the area at there 's already some facilities there with a playground the tennis courts in that area then at the community center because some from memory some initial feedback was that that wasn 't necessarily something that the controller park residents would want there um because and we sort of concentrated in the master plan on facilities for for younger kids particularly except for the basketball court which um there 's obviously each of those facilities as beautiful as they are as much as amenity they add to the to the community there 's always also impacts from it and they 're well aware of that so but there 's a playground there 's noise but you know does that mean you don 't go the playground no it means you consider where the playground is um and the same for um say the basketball court so for example there have been some offers of a special material to be used for a half court so that the ball noise would be quieter so that 's all there 's all considerations going into that and so the skate park was initially envisaged summer there 's also a lot of older kids there that would have something to do then thank you i might move now to our last question because we 're we 're coming towards a close um with the memorial um would you consider speaking to some local sculptors that live in the community to to make works is that an option most definitely um in fact that 's that 's what we would like to do and as we said before we 've really we 're hoping to maybe be able to involve the indigenous community in particular for this particular idea but there 's also the memory garden already happening and hopefully there can be some sculptures integrated in that as well so i think generally for any of those projects um it would be lovely to be able to involve local businesses artists and so on in every step of the of the process thank you katarina that 's good to hear i will draw things to a close now but i 'd like to take an opportunity to thank you all for your attendance today _"

    "text": "good afternoon everybody um welcome to the first of three public meetings organized through the zoom medium or facebook this evening at seven o 'clock my name is vince di pietro and i 'm most recently the recovery coordinator for the shoalhaven and i 'm very uh very excited to be able to run these three sessions today with very important panelists who can actually inform the community as best as possible in readiness for the coming fire season now we 've been through a lot together in the last 12 months and it hasn 't let up there 's still an awful lot a long way to go but one thing we 're able to do is with the assistance of this technology is rather than community meetings in separate locations is we can reach out to as many people as possible across three separate sessions and hopefully we 'll capture the questions and concerns of people uh as accurately as we possibly can those that we can 't answer live during the session we 'll make sure we get answers posted on through the shoalhaven city council website of the land on which we meet today and across all the locations in which we 're meeting within all parts of the shoalhaven and pay my respects to their elders past present and emergent i extend that respect to aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples who are also participating online today i 'd also like to acknowledge very importantly the impact that the recent bushfires and flood and continuing emergency emergency um residual effects have had on the indigenous community their well-being to their culture and their history within the shoalhaven as it has directly impacted upon their lands without further ado i would like to please invite uh mayor amanda findlay to officially welcome participants over to you amanda thanks vince and thank you for the fantastic work that you 've been doing on behalf of our shoalhaven over the last nine months and helping to guide us through that recovery project and welcome to all of you that are here today a beautiful shoalhaven day to welcome you to this uh live event i 'm sure that you 'll be very pleased with the panel that we me apart from vince we have ray steins who 's our local emergency controller we have mark williams from the rfs and stephen dunchey our ceo from shoalhaven city council warren goodell who 's our regional emergency manager officer kim white our local emergency management officer and bronwyn from new south wales health and i 'm really pleased that everyone 's been able to bring forward this important message to you today and because if you 're like me that the thought of facing another fire season so quickly after the last one it certainly doesn 't feel like 12 months since we last got ready and and were prepared and the one big message that i have for you today is please listen tightly to this if you can 't if it 's causing you problems and you 're feeling that there 's issues rising from this please switch off and come back we will take this so that you can come back at a later time when you feel more comfortable um but remember that the number one thing that you can do to get ready this year plan but that will be reiterated over over the course of the day so thank you for being here thank you thank you amanda thank you very much uh amanda and um it 's uh it 's it 's really important to understand the linkages that we 've established um and re really reinforced over the recovery period one of them very importantly has been the new south wales government health agencies and we 're lucky today to have um bronwyn lund from new south wales help health sorry to um to speak about health and well-being over to you please bondwin thanks vince um as vince said i 'm working for new south wales health as a mental health bush fire recovery coordinator for the shoalhaven and today i simply want to emphasize the need for us to pay attention to our self-care both as we navigate our way forward and today during this session um as we go through today 's session you might find that it brings up some uncomfortable feelings and memories please take care of yourself if you start to feel at all overwhelmed take breathe or as amanda has just said please feel free to turn the presentation off altogether these sessions and all the information from today will be available on the council website so you can come back to it when you feel ready or when you 've got somebody supportive with you if that helps as a result of these fires some of us are probably going through the toughest experiences of our lives and experiencing really intense emotions so it 's really important to take time out to replenish your energies to refill your buffet if you like means putting the focus back on yourself um now that 's a little different for everybody but there 's some common elements that we know boosts our well-being uh that help us to refuel so we can tackle what life treasures so try to have regular contact with other people people that make you feel good that might be for somebody joining a social group or others it might just be having family and friends around that you can shoot degrees with we know that regular physical activity is benefit beneficial for might be making a commitment to taking the dog for a walk every day or going for a swim or playing a sport but perhaps most importantly just spend some time regularly doing something that you really enjoy that isn 't fire related um or flood related or any other of our crises at the moment um initially you might have got through on adrenaline on willpower you 'll see grit and determination um that 's the sort of thing that worked in the beginning but we can 't_''_366.16 do that for forever without paying attention to our self-care before it starts to take a toll on us physically and mentally and psychologically as time goes on you might notice some things for yourself you might notice that you 're feeling more run down or fatigued maybe not sleeping as well as you normally do or getting more health complaints more colds you might notice that your moods aren 't as easy to control or that you respond to things with emotions that are probably out of character for you uh you might be worried about things that never used also it can be hard to concentrate and think clearly you might have to be focusing or remembering things they 're really normal responses but they 're also signs that your mind and your body are under stress so if you notice those changes hanging around or becoming more frequent or if they 're interfering with your ability to do what you normally do in your day then it 's worth seeking out some support you don 't have to cope with it on your own it can be helpful to get support from a counsellor or a health professional just to work out what 's going on for you and to develop some strategies that might work for you all the support lines and the services that are shown on the slides uh they 're all free and they bulk bill or you could just give us a call um as myself and my colleague um it really doesn 't matter how big or small your issue is we 're happy to listen and assist and you can we can talk through options together we can simply try to can give more detailed and individualized assistance um and we can connect with other supports as well so if in doubt feel free to give us a call but as we move forward and move on to the next presentations and move through this presentation i 'd like you just to take a moment at home or wherever you are just to breathe and just to arrive with today 's session and after a few deep breaths funny just to take care of yourself through the session keep track of where you 're going and how you 're feeling um feel free to turn off if you need to and just remember to take care of yourself now and into the future thank you guys thanks very much bronwyn really really timely uh advice and and i know that there 'll be a lot of folks that that will will benefit from it um we now uh move forward into the presentation proper and uh and it 's very appropriate that the first uh panelist on today 's session is not only the chief executive officer of the shoalhaven city the the chair of the local emergency management committee so uh over to you please stephen look thanks very much for that vince really appreciate that um can i also pass on my my thanks to yourself vince for the uh the outstanding work that you did in in helping the shoalhaven uh through the recovery phase of the the devastating carawan fire uh as we said at the time it was a beast of a fire and to uh to respond to that and to recover from that we needed some significant assistance from uh right across a whole range of agencies and i have to say as ceo of the council it was uh was very comforting to know that i i had you working alongside me through that uh that recovery phase so a public thank you for your uh your help vince but um my presentation today the first point i want to make [Music] is that i think we all have to accept that it 's inevitable that emergencies will happen these things will happen and as we all know they can and as we environmental impact across across the areas affected uh we saw that through the carawan fire um just on that last season 's bushfire we 've got the recent flood events the wind events and of course we 're still in the midst of the global coronavirus crisis and all these things emphasize the need for all of us to have prepared appropriate and effective prevention preparation response and recovery strategies and plans in place for these emergency situations and we need that right across our local government area and we need it within all our local communities so in that regard shoalhaven city council works in partnership with the emergency services with state and federal government agencies with charities and other support uh agencies to uh to help our community through the recovery phase of those emergencies as we have just done and continuing to do similarly we work with these agencies to prepare for future emergencies including what we know is the coming next bushfire season and that work that we 're doing in preparing for is part of what we 're here for today is helping our community the pending uh bushfire season so uh as as ceo general manager of the council one of my roles is to chair as vince referred to is the the local emergency management committee and that emergency management committee its role is to is to prepare as we said before to prepare respond to and or have strategies in place to respond to those emergencies and so it 's a it 's made up of a number of agencies um the emergency services membership of that are the rural fire services fire and rescue new south wales the state emergency services ambulance police surf life saving australia the defence marine rescue the local emergency management officer kim white has vince introduced earlier the the remo or the regional emergency management officer and warren goodall 's here with us today is the remo the leo con is the local emergency operations controller represented here today by ray steins on inspector ray steins from new south wales police is with us there 's a range of supporting agencies as well the illawarra shoalhaven local health the environmental protection authority a range of utilities services welfare services national parks shoalhaven water most importantly or very importantly is abc media and they were very efficient and very effective through the the carawan fire a range of telecommunications services and jervis bay territory are also represented on that local emergency management committee next slide please is the next slide okay shoalhaven council has a role as i said our role in that is to support the members of that committee so uh as i said as the uh as the ceo of council i chair that committee the committee meets on a quarterly basis i think that 's important to realize that the the whether there 's a misconception that the local emergency management committee actually runs the emergency situations from the emergency operations center during emergencies that 's not the case it 's the role of the combat agencies to uh to run the emergency and under the leadership of the leo con so our council 's role in that is uh is to support as i said and we support that through a range of services in that emergency operations centre we 'll have managing transport logistics matters engineering services environmental services and and extremely importantly the media and communication aspects to make sure message of getting images are getting out there as quickly as possible through a range of uh media opportunities so the other role of the local emergency management committee as i said meeting quarterly is to uh it has responsibility for preparing what 's called the local emergency management plan or the m plan so that plan records what are the agreed arrangements for the control of emergency situations and uh for coordinating the resources that i needed during emergency situations uh the implant is it is a public document and is available for viewing on council 's website should you wish to go and have a look the preparation the implant is based on a number of principles firstly that uh responsibility and it 's important to note the responsibility for preparing response and recovery in relation to emergencies rests initially at the local level secondly that the control of emergencies the response and recovery operations is conducted at the lowest effective level those on the ground best place i said before it 's not the local emergency management committee 's role to manage the emergencies the emergencies are managed by the appropriate agency and that 's that principle but it 's the lowest effective level that is responsible for dealing with that emergency the local emergency operations controller or the leocon as i mentioned earlier and ray steins is here with us today uh is responsible when requested by a combat agency to coordinate the provision of resources and the support needed to deal with that emergency situation the emergency preparation response and recovery operations should be conducted with all agencies carrying out their normal functions wherever possible and also the another principle in relation to that m plan is the prevention measures remain the responsibility of the authority or the agencies charged by statute with that responsibility so uh as i said shoalhaven city council has many responsibilities under the four phases of the emergency those four phases being planning response prevention and recovery and as i said council 's specific responsibilities include the engineering services water sewer transport media environment communications and transport services as i council undertakes in those emergency situations is to facilitate the full or partial activation of an emergency evacuation center or evacuation centers if needed and in doing so council follows the shoalhaven emergency operations center standard operating procedures and in this regard council supports the local emergency operations controller and in accordance with the new south wales emergency operations center policy is there another slide i think that 's uh that 's it from the events at this point in time sorry vince you 're on mute okay it 's just cost me uh quite a sizable sum of money that because i was pleading with everybody not be caught out um what you 've just heard about is the organizational uh aspects of um of the the committee and the planning level i wanted to take a few moments of video time of this of this webinar to be able to share with with the my fellow residents of the shoalhaven a fantastic facility which which we have all contributed to as rate payers and is quite unique in in most uh if not all local government areas uh center in albatross road on in nara here the reason i think the video is important is because it 's valuable for every member of the community to see where these operations come together and how the various personalities that are the various um panelists that you 're hearing today where it is that they actually go to um for most of their waking hours in any emergency when the center is activated so if we could perhaps play that video please good morning bradley chill royal fire service this is the shoalhaven fire control center this is where the incident management team is working from to support the ongoing fires here in the batemans bay shoalhaven area this is the logistics cell in here so we 've got volunteers and agency representatives assisting with taking phone calls and answering messages also coordinating resources such as fire units strike teams is our operations section so this is where the operations team are coordinating the resources that are moving around including aircraft this is our fire behavior analysts so they look at the weather they look at the fuel availability they rate of spread around the community we have national parks people here assisting with the coordination of um planning so we have a planning team here so they 're looking four or five days in advance as to what we can do to bring this fire to a successful resolution we have specialist gis mapping operators here so they 're trying to do all the mapping and keep it up to date that flows on to our firefighters but also who fires near me etc they 're going to see the extent in the scale of the fire down here we have our radio communications section so they communicate with the resources that are in the field so we push information to them we pull information back as required and we use that to help officially inform the community for our community messaging this is the community liaison team so the role is to take phone calls and assist members of the public this section here is our aviation section they 're not too busy at the moment because the aviation resources haven 't launched just yet so they 're to 12 aircraft available to us at the moment including the large air tanker as required okay so this is the emergency operations centre where we have all of our support agencies across new zealand well so department health police local council ses we have rms and that 's supporting the ongoing operation here and helping to keep the community safe thank you thanks very much indeed and i think that 's a good segue before i do um pass over to uh to mark williams from from the rfs um we 've just had one of the one of the participants in the webinar asking if we 're actually going to get down to speaking about what individuals can do to prepare the answer to that is absolutely yes um the reason we 're working through this from the top down is because this is about getting ready looking through the windscreen and if we can build a picture of what 's available in the shoalhaven and what residents can actually be confident is working behind the scenes that is a big part of the i think of the to manage uh what might be coming at us from left or right field in the near future with that i hand over to uh mark williams and uh you 'll you 'll certainly start to hear a bit more about what you can do as individuals to start preparing for the season over to you mark thanks vince and good afternoon everybody and uh thanks for having us along this afternoon in this very important briefing obviously with the covert restrictions that are affecting us all this is probably the easiest and best format to get this message out as wide as possible uh throughout the all of our community uh from what stephen 's just mentioned and also that short video presentation you can see how our operations center runs uh in nara here and that covers all of the shoalhaven district a little bit of history for the rural fire service likely we look after the shoalhaven local government area out of here we have 36 brigades within the district on an average of about 1500 members uh all volunteers throughout each of those 36 brigades and uh coordinate with each of the brigades and assist them in uh managing day-to-day responses whether it be something as significant as the caraway and fire or our day-to-day operations which is everything from a garbage bin a light to a motor vehicle accident or a structure fire in effect those 1 500 volunteers are the rural fire service they are all members of our community and we enjoy the support that we get from people like yourselves around the community who who do also participate in uh activities but also can do a lot for yourselves to protect sorry to prepare yourselves for the the seasons as we go forward so a few things just to quickly run through obviously our fire season is fast approaching us again in shoalhaven it does start on the 1st of september this year as it does every year we 've had a wetter than normal start and winter period which is great as far as we can see we have full soil moisture around the area a lot of standing water and obviously those wet weather events have actually caused us other a great start for us we 're going to capitalize on that however and continue to encourage everybody to prepare for when that weather does turn and it will turn as we 've seen over the history and we need everybody to to have their preparations in place so i 'll get a bit more into that shortly during a fire such as a caroline fire major emergencies the rural fire service does everything we possibly can not only to combat the fire itself but also to inform the community about what 's going on and the the warning processes that we have in place to allow people to remain situationally aware so you know where the fires are around you so apps such as the fires near me up we have social media that we manage locally for our own facebook pages and twitter accounts but we also have the formal warnings uh the three the advice levels that the fires go through being that there is an advice so you 'll get a advice that there is a bushfire or an incident in your area it 'll then and you 'll go to watch and act and what that watch and act means is it 's time to start paying attention to that incident start knowing where it is and start thinking about what you are going to do if the situation worsens or that fire is in very close proximity to you and then ultimately we can go into emergency warning status and in that emergency warning status that is exactly what we need people to pay attention to people have to have their preparations in place and need to act on those plans that they 've already been working to associated with emergency warnings sometimes not every time there will be an emergency alert those emergency alerts are put out not only through our social media and those other avenues such as fires near me but we have the capability to send it out via telecommunications efforts uh pager messages phone calls to residential house lines and the likes of that what is really important out of all these things there isn 't just one avenue of the warning system what we encourage everybody to do one particular form of warning what you also need to do in conjunction with having your plan properly prepared is monitor multiple areas for those warnings as well as looking at your front door and having a look at what 's around you and the conditions on the day so what can you do to benefit yourself and your family and or ultimately ourselves as emergency services is to have you pushed by a survival plan these things are available either through the fire control center through your local fire rural fire brigade or you can download them online at the rfs website they are free and we encourage every residents to have one of these in place and it 's not only important for your own place but also important if you 're going to visit an area such as the many tourists that come into our area we implore the people have those available so you can actually have those plans in place those plans go into everything it 's not only what you are going to do during an incident but it 's what you 're going members what are you going to do with animals what are you going to do and where are you going to go and what is also important is making sure you have an ulterior option should your first initial plan not come to fruition because of the emergency itself developing beyond your needs things that you can also do yourself is have your property prepared a well-prepared property is a good place for people to stay in effect and protect yourself should you get to that point one of the things we 'll often talk about is for people that are staying and defending to get enact their plan whilst other times will tell people to get out if they 're not properly prepared and leave early if you are going to stay and defend it is imperative that you are properly prepared it 's imperative that your place is properly prepared removal of vegetation around your house clearing of gutters having water available having other services available making sure you 've got a transistor radio or a car or another form of means to charge your mobile phone so is also imperative if you 're going to leave you leave early and then why early that means days in advance if that is the case with something as what was serious as what we 've seen previously again back onto staying and defending if you 're going to stay and defend you need to be prepared and you need to be prepared and think outside the box and understand the things such as power and water could and may go down and what are you going to do prepare yourself it is not just a simple case of being physically able but it is a mental stress and the trauma that many people have to go through such as a serious event as some of these fires have been leading into our fire season the local district is well prepared as i said with our brigades they 're all ready for the next season albeit that hopefully we 're going to have a much slower start and hopefully might not actually see a fire season at all generate locally added to that a lot of our brigades are going open days in some locations where covert conditions permit in other areas brigades will be doing stuff online so i ask everybody if you 're in the local area touch base with your local rfs brigade go down and see them when they 're open on the weekend or during the weekday if you find that you can 't get in contact with them contact through council or through the fire control center here and we 'll put you in touch with your local brigade and if you want to continue to help yourselves and help the rest of your community the rfs is always open for new memberships and it 's not just firefighters we need we need communications people we need welfare assistance we need transport people you name it if you 've got the time we 've got the job for you so please avail yourselves of preparing yourselves for this fire season and future fire seasons and don 't hesitate to reach out if you need assistance thanks thanks very much thanks very much mark all all very very helpful and useful information and we 're going from the big slowly zeroing down to the very specific about how we can we can prepare along this route probably the most important person to hear from in terms of the organizational and how the emergencies are played out and led is the local area emergency operations controller and uh that 's inspector ray steins from the from the new south wales police over to you please ray thanks vince um then my name 's ray steins i 'm the inspector in charge of narrow police station um i also do the leocon or the local emergency operations controller role along with inspector dave cochran um another inspector at nara and we 're appointed as leo cons by a region commander and it 's the legislative position that has to be implemented um the biggest key or the biggest the role that i 've got is to basically coordinate everything else around the emergency apart from the actual combating the emergency so with the caravan fire mark was the incident controller he looked after combating the fire it was my mine and dave roll we were to look so that meant anything in relation to evacuation centers to roadblocks making sure that asset protection zones were looked after and all the functional areas that were mentioned by steve earlier were up to speed with their requirements in relation to that i mentioned the word coordination that is probably the most important thing that i am in in charge of it 's coordination of a lot of resources a lot of agencies to make sure we get a desired outcome and to assist the combat agency it doesn 't matter what the emergency is um there 's a variety of resources at our disposal um a large number of assets and resources but unfortunately it 's not an infinite number of resources so to for me to be activated or to me to activate the eoc it 's a matter of receiving a phone call from the uh incident controller and if i use the carowind fire as an example on the 26th of november mark rang me on my way back from sydney and said basically we 've got a fire and it 's running lots of clappers so he rang me asked me to activate the eoc to a certain degree in relation to several agencies and areas that he needed supporting we did that straight away um and it went to there 's a number of variety levels that i 'll get to um and it just went from there and we stayed operational basically for the next 72 days um our operational status there 's white green yellow and red um white is just stand down as it is at the moment and green is to just sort of for one of a better phrase hurry up and wait yellow is a is we 've got resources in the field and then red it 's all hands on deck um we were at red for quite a lengthy period of time during the carowind fire um and the only person that can activate the eac is myself or dave so we 're the um if if the combat agency needs our help we will ring the limo kim white and then she will act she will just basically press the the button to activate all emergency management center in the eoc um in relation to the eoc itself it 's as far as i 'm concerned and we were identified as an area of better practice throughout the carowind fire and throughout all the fire emergencies throughout the state um our community engagement throughout the throughout the emergency um with the um the meetings that we held at the various locations and that is paramount in relation to not just informing the community of where the fire is at in this instance but also to reinforce the preparation of their plans and just to reinforce what mark said the plans that the community make or for themselves for each residence which should be has to go down to the more new detail so if you think that you 're physically ready and mentally ready but you need something like you 're on medication and this in an emergency can go for a number of days or a number of weeks and you 're going to be isolated and you 're happy to stay you have to make sure that part of your plan is that you need it 's got to be down to that more new detail um just quickly the police role in relation to emergencies will always be as it always is to protect life and property all right to do that we may have to block off roads we may have to evacuate people we may um and we might have to relocate them um we 're happy to do that if we have to all right but like i said our primary role and it will always be is to protect life and property um i think that 's about about it vince unless anyone 's got any specific questions hello okay thanks thanks thanks very much ray uh we 'll hold questions for a moment um we 're just going to hear from the last uh the last panelist to speak before we go into into questions and we 've got a good stream of questions have come in um is to listen to the regional emergency management officer who will now bring us down to a fine point so what are the things that we can be doing 's been a couple already mentioned like have enough supplies of routine medications make sure you prepare your home and the surrounds be ready to have a plan with an alternative plan know where you 're going to go but we 're going to bring all that to a head now before we go into the questions and with that i 'll invite the regional emergency management officer uh warren goodall who who was again in the eoc throughout the last emergency um from more than dawn to dusk most of his waking days over to you warren thanks vince and uh good afternoon everybody uh as vince said my name is warren goodall i 'm the regional emergency management officer for the illawarra south coast and i help support the local councils from wollongong down to the victorian border i 'm a civilian employee with new south wales police and my my functional role is to provide advice and guidance to a whole range of organizations including local government on emergency management functionality as uh vins has indicated uh it was pretty busy during the fire season um with and certainly by my local council uh coordinators uh the local emergency management officers who have a very integral part of the um the emergency management process within council they are and you 've got kim white in the shallow haven a particularly good employee who is very dedicated to the role and her role is to provide that office management i uh to the eoc to make sure it functions and supports the the leacon and the combat agency as best it can so what can you do during during an emergency to to prepare yourself first and foremost the situational awareness is an important part of of being ready for things whilst we have a lot of plans that rely on agencies doing certain things to support the community it does boil down to what mark was saying earlier on what can you do to prepare yourself and we call that situational awareness we know that different emergencies affect different people in different ways what might impact on you might be very different from your neighbor or from a person down the road you know your personal circumstances are prepared to to meet the emergency and be aware of what 's going on around you as best you can there are a number of devices and apps that can be downloaded free of charge some are government based and some are private corporation based things for example like the emergency plus app that can help you in any sort of emergency it tells people where you are and allows you to contact triple zero uh fairly quickly through your smart device there 's applications like fires near me which is run by new south wales rural fire service and it gives you reasonably up-to-date information on the conditions of the fires and certainly the the recent uh inquiry has suggested some further additions to that process which hopefully won 't be too far away there is a flood safe app there 's live traffic applications that you can look at to see what is happening on the road situations around you the live traffic is only focusing on state government roads during high level emergencies it may well show some local roads but your best source of information are a whole range of these these apps that can assist you in preparing and being ready for the various types of emergencies but as has been alluded to before it 's about what you know is your capability to respond to certain situations our friend in all this is abc abc is a designated national emergency broadcaster they have permission from all the jurisdictions in in australia from local council up to federal government to assist in the delivery of emergency information so if nothing else if you don 't have a smartphone if nothing else if you get a battery operated radio the old transistor radio that we used to have when we 're a lot younger if you can get one of them tune it into your local abc for azure war and shale haven it 's 97.3 they will keep you up to date with all the emergency information you need they are an integral part of our communication system and any advice they give comes from the proper authorities whether it be the combat agency with for example the rural fire service or the state police or local government that 's about it from me for now okay okay thanks very much warren so just uh just in that few moments i noted down a few things in the last minutes of what a good good kit bag might look like for you to throw in the car ready to go one will be a mobile phone charger that isn 't one that relies on 240 volts on a wall wall plug something you can plug into your into your car either a usb port or a um or a cigarette lighter a good transistor radio with the old 9 volt battery or something and just have that ready to go and tuned to 97.3 perhaps a torch um have cash have a standby of cash in your wallet because one of the things we do know that went down in recent dimes was uh was the atm machines because his power went so too the ability to perhaps draw out money so have it have a little uh a little uh a little bit of extra cash tucked into your wallet ready to go on medications make sure you 've got a good enough supply to last you a week or two and uh and in all of that if you need some um sort of more focused guidance on uh on where to look um i remind folks that the uh the emergency helpline in council or the the shoalhaven council helpline is still active and will be for the duration and that 's number four four two nine five triple eight now having said that we 've got um we 've got a few questions here and i think probably the best person to answer the first two that i 'll pose is uh is warren goodall in his capacity as the regional emergency management officer and i 'll ask both questions at once the first is how will evacuation centres be managed with the covid situation in force and that 's a terrific question because it goes to the point um and i 'll let warren elaborate but it goes to the point of when asked to leave or advise to leave it 's probably a better place to be leaving with other people if you can avoid it so there 's that and the second question is just wondering what the plans to advise emergency updates to local community radio stations within the local government area and in the case of alerting the community so uh there 's two questions how do we manage covet in the evacuation warren and secondly how do we how do we update local local radios thanks vince two good questions there so the first one the evacuation centres evacuation centres are an integral part of our process and certainly covert has introduced some challenges that we had that are interesting for us to work through the state government announced back in about two months ago now some changes to the evacuation center process and within the local illawarra shell haven area we 've implemented some practical interpretations of that so it works reasonably well first and foremost we are reluctant to open up an evacuation center because of the coveted environment part of the evacuations process is that we want people to remain safe so sending to an area that is full of people that so our first call at this stage is to advise people to go to family and friends that they are now that they know are healthy themselves and take support from those family and friends if that 's not possible for whatever reason we 're establishing a series of phone numbers which will be broadcasted at the time of the emergency and allow people to register and then be provided with assistance for emergency accommodation now we use that same principle during the recent floods and it worked reasonably well uh no system is perfect but we do the best we can to support the the evacuation processes accepting the covet is a particular challenge at the moment now i didn 't quite get the second question vince but if i 'm correct it was about how do we get information to abc radio is that the gist of the conversation um and local community radio stations sure so um we have uh normally we put abc radio either into the eoc the emergency operation center or we had them on speed dial and through the combat agency so ses and through the emergency operations centre we have a direct line to the various media channels so not just while we focus on abc we have that same communication go to all the media channels to give that information as quickly as we can in most cases we can get it to them literally within a few minutes of the decision being made they can be broadcasting that information the reason we focus on abc is that they have an obligation to to quote word for word exactly what we send them at the time we send it to them we don 't have that same luxury with the commercial tv stations and radio stations who may slot it in at the next convenient spot now more often than not they do do the right thing buyers but we have a guaranteed assurance from abc that they will broadcast that information when we require it to be broadcast and it is sent to them as quickly as possible as soon as possible after the decision has been made i hope that answers the question i think i think that are some authoritative sources of information the abc radio is certainly one um the fire is near me app um the next question relates to that and it 's probably a good a good segue um the question here is and i think it 's probably either to mark or to warren and i 'll let you both toss a coin but fires near me app wasn 't functional during 2019-25s abc radio was great and the three emergency warning levels have proven to be ambiguous and hard to decipher in the heat of the moment people need simple thinking plans not written plans that guide actions during an emergency situation so who would like to uh who would like to take that well i guess i can probably initially and warren can wrap up anything that i happen to miss if that 's okay um yeah so i 'll take that one initially and maura can catch up if need be anything i happen to miss out um in general yes i agree uh abc radio did an outstanding job uh we were in direct communications with them very the incident controller as well as broadcasting a lot of our messages out contrary to popular belief fires nearly was working a lot of the time issues that people saw with fires near me was either the telecommunications issues where a local tower may have gone down and people 's connectivity to the app may have suffered as a result or in some cases the effect that a lot of the information that we put on fires near me has to go through a chain of hands before it gets publicized now one of the things we 're going to continue to work on in the future is to further improve that but at the moment the mapping on a fires near me app that mapping data has to come into the emergency control center here we have to ratify that and we have to upload it into a mapping software format which is then portrayed on files near me so as that information comes in as we decipher that information and as we get to put that information in and we have dedicated officers constantly working on that it it is a human interaction process it is not just automatic and it takes some time to do but fires near me is certainly a a huge benefit tool that we 've seen been put in place over the last 10 or 15 years it is a great level of information to the general public out there but as i mentioned before it shouldn 't be relied on as the only source of truth relying on other things as well such as abc radio our social media pages the rfs website and other activities that you 'll see going around is the uh the best way for people to stay situationally aware warren anything to add to that thanks vince um just to to add to what marx just said whilst all this technology is really great for giving us situational awareness community members need to understand that if we lose communication towers we lose information and they will lose information as well if you know that you are in a particular area that 's for example a poor reception area for for um your iphone connectivity whatever it might area from the from the radio stations you need to build that into your personal plan to to allow you to recognize that so if you understand that things are going things could go bad and you 're going to be impacted by loss of telecommunications infrastructure because that normally happens in your area anyway you need to have that part of you need to have that is part of your plan to uh to allow you to make more informed decisions thanks warren um the next question i think we 'll uh we 'll again go to uh mark uh are there additional aerial resources available this coming fire season yeah sure thanks vincent just to wrap that last question up i didn 't i failed to mention the very end part was in relation to the confusion uh revolving around the warning levels as i as i mentioned at the beginning of the discussion today part of the bushfire survival plan is becoming aware and knowing those three alert levels so the advice uh the the watch and act and the emergency warning and knowing the differences for individuals is to learn what those are and understand what you 're going to do at each one of those steps along the way plans themselves the more detailed the better but at the very very least have that discussion amongst your family about what you are going to do and where you 're going to go to and what you 're going to take is a better plan than not having anything at all more detail the better but don 't make them too over the top because you won 't remember it the heat of the time moving on to the question about aerial resources yes the answer is yes the rural fire service the new south wales state government uh recently and we had it in place for last year has purchased a 737 uh large air tanker which we used uh very regularly during the carowind fire this year during the off season we 've seen an increase uh just recently as last week uh and another uh what they call a four one two helicopter which is a medium-sized bucket machine uh that is allowing pace has been uh secured through the sponsorship of goodman uh five and a half million dollars has bought that airframe and the rfs will be equipping that with uh strategic equipment and personnel to be able to attack fires and get into remote locations early and then as the fire develops if a fire continues to develop that aircraft can continue to bucket as well additionally there will be another two uh aircraft coming into the rural fire service fleet over the next period of time increasing our fleet uh substantially but also increasing in that is we 're constantly monitoring and trying to work on uh further development of additional resources coming out of the northern hemisphere on a contract basis and availability to us what we saw last fire season i hate using the word unprecedented but it was we saw a vast proportion of new south wales a lot at the time and it stretched every single resource not just aviation but all of our firefighters throughout the throughout the state and for that matter all of australia thanks mark we 've got a question regarding well placed here our evacuation centers for livestock still going to be offered thanks vince another good question certainly when we decide about evacuations and we start planning for evacuations we do consider the um our local pets our little cats and dogs and so forth as well as livestock in the area now it is not possible to evacuate every bit of livestock and every bit of cattle and so on from a community area and most farmers uh understand and appreciate that but where we have a small numbers of of livestock uh for example you might have one or two horses as part of a family just a large pet so to say we do make accommodation for that now we do that in conjunction with local council and we utilize resources that council own and they may well be for example your local showground now the downside to that is there is some requirement for the pet owner to move that animal themselves we can 't guarantee that we 're going to be able to move those animals for you and there 's some reliance on once we get you to once you get to the large animal evacuation centre whether it be in berry uh whether it be in milton or it doesn 't matter where it might be and sometimes we use facilities outside the local government area depending on what 's safest for the for the environment and we will then provide some level of support to you in that environment we will put we will assist with through our local land services uh partners we will assist with food and water for those animals and even in where necessary some assistance with veterinary checks and so forth but we do have it as part of our plan and it 's a very important part of our planning system thanks warren um one of the um there 's a great question here which i think actually deserves a little bit more thought a bit consideration but it reads and i 'll just put all of us on notice here because we need to perhaps include some information in this in the uh solham city council website and the question is in very in of emergency private accommodation and then match people needing it it was fantastic what information support could be given to potential accommodation providers around covid 's safety to support such officer offers again especially if evacuation centres aren 't going to be operational i think that 's actually a really good a really good question to sit with a whiteboard and work out consequential management of what the risk is not only to the person doing being evacuated or finding somewhere else to be but in particular the person offering out of the kindness and goodness of their heart their own home to uh to accommodate so if anybody 's got any initial thoughts on that please please chime in now but otherwise i 'd like to take that one on notice and feed it out to the uh to the the person who asked the question uh and more broadly on the shoalhaven city council 's website can i stick my hand up there vince for that for this one to share experience rather than offer really sage advice and that shared experience was of course that you know the offers of private accommodation can 't_''_3484.079 be dealt with by government agencies government agencies don 't want to take the risk of matching people up private with private providers and it 's it 's not in the remit the government agencies wanted to put people into paid accommodation which of course comes in with that you know the cleaning regime of paid accommodation so in the respect of us taking responsibility for evacuations for family and friends or opening outdoors to strangers i think that if we uh you know look online and look at the the things that show haven city council are offering to businesses around covert safety and we allow householders to apply those same kind of regimes to their place during an evacuation if they 're taking in strangers then that would be a great starting point for people to deal with um you know not knowing what was happening and obviously then if people were coming from outside _"

afternoon 's webinar i 'm very uh very pleased that you have done so um it 's actually great pride that i have to uh present this program an operational plan for 2021 and i say draft because that 's what we 're doing we 're launching it today for public exhibition uh officially and uh and seeking your feedback on what 's contained within that plan next thursday it 's actually one week away will mark my uh my official 12 months as appointment as the new ceo of shoalhaven city council and i have to say certainly the shoalhaven has faced many challenges over that 12-month period from the uh the devastating carowind bushfire that quickly moved into the the flood that we had and now the current coronavirus pandemic and i have to say the resilience of our community has been truly remarkable through what has been an extremely challenging 12-month period these adverse adversities have created many challenges for the council of course as an organization but i 'm very pleased at how we 've risen above and particularly how i 've witnessed our community growing even stronger in this recovery process it 's time likes times like this that we all must come together and whilst also meeting our commitment to strong greater efficiency in the way that the council as an organization deliver the services to you our valued shoalhaven community financial tier year 2021 will see one of the largest financial support packages that council has ever offered to uh to this community and we 're doing this in the unprecedented times uh and we in response to the uh the devastating economic impacts of the covert crisis thankfully the uh the shoalhaven has been spared very much so the uh the health impacts of the crisis but we 're not spared by the economic impacts of it and and council uh has risen to that challenge very much so in 2021 the council is committed to a relief package and recovery stimulate stimulus package that exceeds 22 million dollars that comprises various support measures such as reductions in fees and charges financial subsidies for your rates water and sewer charges and a range of incentives to the development industry particularly to kick-start the shoalhaven economy through fast-track building activity the council is very much committed to seeing economic stimulus through building activity development activity that provides great opportunities for and keep our economy moving in addition to the local emergency response and the bushfire recovery council continues to work very hard through these times delivering on a range of works services and programs and ensuring that stalhaven council remains to be and continues to be a great place now and well into the future the draft delivery program and operational plan for next year sets out a transparent scope of works for the shoalhaven over the next 12 months council is very much committed to working towards these planned outcomes with a number of temporary adaptations in place of course to ensure the safety of staff and their customers in line with federal and state government health advice whilst this does present some challenges to our workflows in our best practices as much as possible we have managed to continue with business very much as usual although as said with some adaptations so very much i 'm looking forward to the completion of several significant activities throughout next financial year and progressing with the design and planning of many other projects social infrastructure continues to be a key focus provide the community with long-term ways to stay healthy connected and to foster the sense of community in our growing regional hubs scheduled works for next year includes skate park improvements at aladella and sanctuary point croquet courts installation that uh aladala much awaited the ongoing development of the uh the fantastic new bungari district park in berry and getting underway with uh certainly the detailed design and moving into construction of what would be a fabulous new library for the bay and basin district in sanctuary pointe looking longer towards the future the shoalhaven community and recreational precinct at bomberberry is a long-term public works project i am very much at meeting growing population needs as well as bringing great benefits for health and wellness council will continue to take steps to realize this plan ensuring that we are well placed to support a healthy and connected community into the future thank you that 's great thank you so much stephen now thank you for your message today um it 's passed over to me just to talk a little bit about what actually are our plans um so call the delivery program and operational plan and budget would have seen that we 've stepped it out in a different way this year ultimately our plans are ways in which the council is delivering on the commitments for the community these commitments are outlined in our community strategic plan so you can see here that there 's a number of different priority themes in our community strategic plan and they include the things that you told us back in 2017 we undertook a process to develop the community strategic plan and these are the types of themes of the city that you want to see we heard from you so the delivery program and operational plan steps out what council 's role is with these plans and if you review the documents you 'll see them stepped out in a way that makes it easier to understand what are the types of work that council will undertake what 's new years this year uh well we 've tried to make it clearer in the plan to show you what council will be undertaking and these are stepped out in year is that we 've also included the ways in which we 'll report against those actions so you can see that each of the actions have a reporting measure and a target or time frame so that 's about how we are kept accountable for the things that we promise to do for you in the shoalhaven community to keep making it a great place to live work and play and stay so you 'll also find in the draft documents that uh include a listing of our capital works programs for the year now these are outlined in the following way based on planning areas and you 'll hear a little bit more today about some of the things that are happening in your neighborhood and what we 're doing about delivering for you whether it be capital works projects like roads footpaths waterways or even sport and wreck facilities so there 's one way that you can have a look and see what 's happening in your area based on where you live across the beautiful region here of the shoalhaven but as stephen mentioned we 've the various disasters that have affected the community including the current covert 19 response and pandemic what we 've done with our operational plan this year is we 've tried to enhance some of the activities we 're doing with the community in regards to becoming more resilient to recover from these disasters and to build community resilience into the future so here 's a couple of the actions that are included in the the operational plan this year they 'll include responding to the recent bushfire in regards to building people back in the communities we 're also going to be undertaking some social mapping with communities to to look at their needs with a focus on improving the resilience into the future our council 's also tasked us with advocating for legislative change to try to make sure that we can assist in the protection of our shoalhaven bushfire areas from future bushfire attack so that we can be more resilient as we build into the future not forgetting the community support so we 're also as a council we 'll be focused on encouraging our community to encourage them to go and seek help we also have very strong economic recovery focus so our economic development team will be focused on training activities and enhancing and recovering across our different labor force capabilities and also the financial assistance package that stephen mentioned earlier we 'll hear a little bit more about that later on this afternoon so now i 'd like to hand over to elena to belinska she 's our chief financial officer and she 'll be stepping you through some of the aspects to do with our budget thank you jim hello everyone um yeah if you can change the slightly um as per the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal news as well next year our council can increase rates by up to five percent this includes two point six percent rate back plus two point four percent special rates variation considering unprecedented times of government pandemic are draft budgets recommendation not to take up maximum increase of five percent and to increase rates by three point four percent on average three point four percent rate increase equivalent to eleven dollars twenty five cents increase will generate an additional 2.7 million of revenue for the council which can be used to renew infrastructure assets for example this additional revenue could be used to reuse three kilometers of council roads or to renew 10 amenity buildings um next slide please the proposed next year budget sorry jim could you change to the next slide please the proposed next year 's budget is a balanced budget this means that it confirms to the requirement for no cash deficit maintaining a healthy level of working capital was also taken into consideration in a 2021 budget the operating results for 2021 financial year excluding capital grants is a deficit of 3 million for general fund 371 thousand dollars over the fund and a surplus of 7.4 million for sewer fund our consolidated net operating results before capital is 1.8 million to note that ongoing business disrupt options might have significant financial consequences for our next year budget we assess in the situation and any necessary adjustments will be considered through the quarterly budget review process uh next slide please um as steven mentioned before to assist uh the residents recovery of the region council has endorsed very extensive financial relief package that supports local businesses residents sporting and community groups this relief package comprises of ratepay financial relief 300 per assessment rental and fee waivers 50 discount on development contributions and additional community grants as listed the estimated total value of the package is over twenty two and a half million billion and the biggest assistance offered by the councils in new south wales next slide please uh come still utilize this a mix of internal and external reserves along with external borrowings to deliver its capital works program in order to fund the delivery of our key strategic projects next year and to maintain a healthy level of working capital the following new borrowings are proposed for the financial year the proposed loan program is based on the principles of sound financial management that was endorsed by our council we are boring only to fund activities according to council 's agreed priorities and we do not borrow to fund an operating deficit we also ensured that our debt service cover ratio and that service ratio remain within industry renovation of entertainment center four million for women gary park 15 million for waste processing facilities 3.6 million for upgrade in tourist parks and 2.4 million for business systems implementation in the council it 's important to know that next year budget also provides for additional 10 million loans provision this provision will be taken up to fund infrastructure projects only if needed and if the situation changes also this provision will support uh funding of the council contributions to the

exciting area of operations this year two big initiatives in terms of recycling being pursued this year the yellow lidded bin we 're looking at actually developing facilities where we can process the yellow litter bin contents and recycle those where possible sell the material or use the materials ourselves and and therefore value add to to products that we would be buying otherwise glass is a good example of that trying to turn glass into a sand replacement product the months ago we accepted a tender in principle and agreed to negotiate the detail that tender in good faith that negotiation good faith tender arrangement uh has come to an end and uh we 're still um comfortable that um that there 's potential left to occur so within the next 90 days we 're hoping that if everybody meets their objectives and their promises that they 've made so far we 'll be in a situation we 'll be able to sign up to that contract that will allow us to take our red litter bin and the 90 of the contents of that from landfill to recycled markets so that 's quite an exciting project that will kick in next year um next one jim so i just uh took the opportunity to try and highlight some of the larger projects in the different planning areas it 's not necessarily saying that one planning area is getting more work than other but i just wanted to point out some of the more noteworthy ones in

a central focus over the next 12 months and beyond and there are a number of new initiatives that we are introducing or have introduced and will continue one of these is the web chat which was an added service that we introduced during the covid 19 situation to assist in connecting with our community this has been a really well received service and we currently have about a hundred people a

track the bowie wetlands and walking tracks in sanctuary pointe hyams beach muramarang coastal walk and the aladella headland walking trails these are all significant uh tourism attractions to the shoalhaven and this investment will really take them to the next level back to you jim thank you very much that 's great thank you so much jane for your presentation on what 's happening in the area of community services now i 'd like to welcome robert horner the acting director of shoalhaven water to speak to us about some of the projects and good afternoon everyone um yeah so a couple of the the projects that we 're either proceeding with now or proposing for next year um we 're getting towards the end of our sewerage connections to all properties in the um willamer area and we 've also just completed um connection of properties in san andreas way in berry 's bay so that 's been a significant project that 's continuing into next financial year we 're also proposing to upgrade do a major upgrade of synan 's pumping station so that 's a pumping station in sunan street and we 're also replacing an old rising main that 's been giving us a few issues over the over the past couple of years so that 's a major project um as a result of uh not only the bush fires but uh the floods the drought and the coronavirus situation we 've undertaken some lessons learned workshops and we 've identified a number of projects that 'll improve our resilience over over time and give us more resilience should we be impacted by further disasters so there 's that paul mentioned the mossval road urban release areas uh there 's some major projects that we need to complete in shoalhaven water um to be able to provide water and storage services to that that area so um there 'll be significant money spent over the next few financial years thanks jim next slide um also we 're looking at our energy management in relation to our water supply and sewage infrastructure a significant expense is uh required to keep these facilities running with electricity a number of millions of dollars per year is expended on electricity so we 're getting very serious about our energy management so we have a number of projects already on the books ready to kick off next financial year um just something that shoalhaven water is very proud of we get audited every financial year for our compliance with best practice management and we 're also ranked against all other water utilities in the country and um that 's part of their national performance reporting and um yeah we can proudly say that we are ranking in the top 10 um in most before we do have a significant capital works program 43 million dollars over the next financial year that 's what we 're proposing um yes and and significant uh capital works certainly over the next four years the the term of the dpop um thanks jim next slide uh so i thought i 'd just um people would be aware that your water bill is um separate to your rates bill so i just thought i 'd go through the charges proposed charges for the next financial year so in the water fund the residential availability charge is to raise by one dollar proposed to raise by one dollar per year from 82 to 83 dollars and the usage charge is um proposed to rise by five cents per kiloliter from 1.70 to 1.75 so that those rises are per the current dpop there aren 't any proposed changes to that similarly with the sewer fund no proposed changes from the current dpop um the increase in the sewer availability charge is proposed to be 12 per year from from next financial year so from 864 to 876 so based around 146 kiloliters per year your average water bill would rise by about 20 dollars per year or 1.7 thanks very much jim that 's great thank you so much for your presentation rob now i 'd like to invite phil costello to speak on the planning and environment and development services group uh thanks jim and uh good afternoon everyone um the planning environment and development group we work across basically five sections within council the first of those um being our planning and development area the principal focus for this particular section of council during the year will be on our da process that 's the the core function of this area it 's certainly been identified by council the elected council is an area that will be the focus going ahead and particularly in regards to the um the assistance they 've granted through the the covert resolution of council and assistance to the development industry as part of this we 'll be looking at the installation of some software which is what we call the tech 1 regulation module this is much anticipated in council because gains pardon me uh yeah it offers some scanned offers significant efficiency gains and make the process a lot clearer for our customers in that space too we 're also looking at the implementation of the da review panel which has recently commenced within council this particular panel will deal with larger employment generating development applications um it 's a panel that 's made up from representatives of each group within council with the idea that these will come to people will come together on a regular basis um in collaboration they will look at each development application and as a group they will go back to applicants um you know identifying any of the issues and working through the actual application to hasten these particular developments to the approvals process so that 's a new initiative council that said you know these people will be able to deal with all the issues associated with an application um and form basically one point of contact for those dealing with councils for the applicants um we 'll also be looking at in conjunction with the state government a new initiative from we have undertaken to be part of this program and certainly the state government and department of planning are looking to shuld haven to be a leader in regards to this accelerated assessment program so we 're looking forward to that and part of that too will also be to introduce centralized dna lodgement um by the new south wales planning portal again this will be aimed at the the lodgement process of development applications but it will certainly hasten that uh development and we 're looking for that to work in with tech 1 and that will require some resourcing through council another aspect within the group is our strategic planning area which is basically our future planning you know with regards to growth management and the policies that support growth management a number of significant projects there uh to strengthen shoalhaven 's town centre and the the main one being there the shoalhaven riverfront precinct so we 're certainly looking throughout the year to get to advance that riverfront precinct program uh get some aspects of that shovel ready so that we can take those forward you know also be putting forward the local strategic planning statement which we hope to go on exhibition uh throughout july that will be reported to council at the next council meeting so that will be going out in july on public exhibition hopefully um and that 's a statement that looks at a 20-year planning horizon you know for the shoalhaven i will be focusing on advancing the the new urban release areas as paul mentioned earlier it 's gratifying to see that we 've already had one subdivision application in the mosfail road south area that 's been approved we 've got another application in the wings there which is a fairly significant application in the mosfet road south area and we 're working with proponents in the mossvale road north area to advance their the work in that space and of course we 've got the uh the business as usual part with um updates to the shoalhaven lep and various development plans and contributions plans in the environmental space i think that it 's fair to say that the major activity or the major focus will be on to go forward with the coastal management program during this year for the open coast for jarvis bay and for lake canjola which is a very large body of work in itself with those three significant coastlines and and uh lake systems within the shoalhaven so they 're very significant and in conjunction with that we will also be looking at the lower shoalhaven and the georgia space and sussex inlet areas to advance those as well we 'll be looking at some delivery of our natural area tourism grants particularly in river road at shoalhaven heads and some of our strategic beach access points um we 'll be continuing our work with flood studies and our floodplain risk management plans which is an ongoing program within the shoalhaven and also in our environmental regulation and protection particularly in regards to soil and water management we 've received some grant funding in the very recent time to allow us to focus on the regeneration and re-establishment of some of our bushfire affected catchments so that will certainly be a major focus throughout this coming year and our work still within security and natural area management and our last areas in regards to ranger and compliance services in our certification services basically looking at meeting the community needs responding to over 5000 complaints from the community annually that 's a really significant number of interactions that we have with the community um so we 'll be looking um at keeping those um actions in that space you know timely and getting out into the community and reacting to those investigating non-approved development which has been significant over the past year and again they usually come through complaint from the general community we 'll be certainly focusing on additional beach patrols and on our dog off leash areas addressing illegal camping promoting responsible pet ownership we 'll be running some programs throughout the year for the general community general community on that um and we 'll continue to develop and implement strategic strategies for our illegal dumping and that wraps that up thank you that 's great thank you so much phil for your overview of what 's happening in your space um it 's great to see people online and our have a number of questions that have come in so to finish off our session today i 'll be posing a few questions to our panel of presenters from the questions that have come through and i just asked that our presenters unmute themselves when i asked them a question i 've got a question here for paul in the first instance we have a question asking is the capital is the is the listing of capital projects for the next four years part of the dpip package this year uh yeah jim um my understanding is that we were going to put together the fine print on our 10-year plan in the end of september we had a whole lot of issues this year just in the preparation of the budget and so the priority became to get the current year 's budget out and get that considered and what we would normally have done is done the other stuff at the same time but i think there 's just a little lag a little bit of a lag that 's my understanding where we 're at that 's having a capital listing project in september as you can imagine there 's issues with pulling a budget together in the current climate so thank you for your answer on that paul i have another question here for jane in regards to the sanctuary point library has the sanctuary point library site being chosen as this wasn 't mentioned in the library survey so jane would you be able to answer that question yes certainly jim yes the site has been chosen it 's the corner of paradise beach road and kerry street in sanctuary pointe so that 's the precinct where there are the shops as well we have information about that on the get involved page on council 's website and that provides that information so i 'd encourage anyone that wants to know more to sign up to the get involved page and receive regular updates on that project as it progresses excellent thank you so much jane for that um the next few questions i 'll ask to stephen um we 've got a couple of questions coming in about the covert 19 assistance package um 19 financial assistant to rate payers stephen uh in the short answer that question is no um and i 'll comment on two aspects of that but the finance team uh in putting together the the financial package to support the three hundred dollar uh relief we 'll be making full provision for that three hundred dollars per uh per property assessment in the accounts for council as at the 30th of june 2010 so uh it won 't reach the accounts uh for 2021 and and has no impact on the budget as presented in the draft delivery program for uh 2021 the second aspect of comment on in relation to that was through the whole covert crisis uh the council uh as the elected body made it very clear that uh the job retention was a primary focus for the council and uh we put in response to that we put in a range of redeployment strategies for staff particularly casual staff that uh that where their their substantive roles were no longer needed due to the closure of various facilities we actually managed to redeploy many of council has been committed to the retention of jobs so there is no uh no impact on jobs as a result of the 300 covered package great thank you for that stephen um i 've got another one here that 's come in for you uh councillors in may 2020 have voted on a naught percent increase in rates for 2021 but the uh the budget overview states that there is an ipad rate increase can you please explain uh certainly ken jim the uh there was discussion there was debate at the meeting in may in relation to what went on exhibition as part of this delivery program and operational plan and the budget the budget as presented in draft form was based around the 3.4 percent being as elena said earlier the 2.6 percent bypass uh rate peg plus 0.8 of what could have been a 2.4 percent special variation uh increase as well uh the council did the debate that the report that went up had a range of options for the council to consider the 3.2 and 3.4 as was drafted or a just a rate or something between from three point four percent or from five percent as the maximum possible to back to a zero increase there was an alternate motion put forward that the budget be exhibited with a uh nil rate increase but that motion was defeated and the budget was exhibited as is at 3.4 percent um as i mentioned earlier in my initial comments the budget is or the delivery program and budget is out on public exhibition it 's due to come back to council an extraordinary meeting on the 30th of june and it 's at that point that the council will make a final decision in relation to the adoption of the delivery program and operational plan including the budget and the rating structure that uh that will accompany the budget great thank you for the clarification on that stephen um we 've got another one that 's come in it 's a little bit long so i 'll try to get this one read out to you i 'll pose it to you in the first place stephen previously residents were able to access a snap illegal dumping potholes etc i believe this app is no longer used which makes it hard for residents to report issues is there any funding allocated in the 2029 budget to reactivate this app do you know much about that one stephen i actually do know about that jim so i 'm happy to explain that the snap send solve app has been around for a number of years uh it 's not a it 's not a new innovation it 's been out in the market uh as a free download from the app store for a number of years and council was a participant in that program the model for snap send and solve throughout the course of last year changed in that it was a free service over that period the change that occurred last year was that the council was advised that a pricing mechanism would be attached to that and it our assessment was that based on the volume that we we received of inquiries uh or our service requests through the snap send in and solve the cost benefit analysis didn 't uh stack what we did in response to that however was to develop uh the functionality some of the functionality on the council 's website and the website you can access from mobile devices uh anywhere anyhow so uh our strong message was for efficiency for the council and uh and continued ease of access through your mobile phone to notify council of issues and service requests is to uh is to work through on your mobile phone uh the council 's website and it 's very clear on that website as to how you go through to lodge a service request as a a free alternative to the council and ultimately then to the shoalhaven community as a free service in in replacement of the snapsend solve app thank you for that stephen that 's great um we 'll include a link to that in the uh responses so i 'm we 're running out of time to answer all the questions today but we will be posting up the answers to the questions that we didn 't get to today up on the get involved page for all of those to you today um we will be posting that up along with the recording of this webinar if there 's anyone interested in watching so the next steps um deadline is for the feedback to be submitted by the 24th of june um it will be considered so all of the submissions will be included in the documents going out to the council report i know it 's weird uh jane 's um live so um what we will do um is then uh have those uh council meeting streams live fire council 's website for those that are interested in listening in on council 's deliberations on this but i did want to say thank you so much for joining us today on behalf of the shoalhaven city council team we do appreciate you putting time in to join us today on our webinar and thanks very much _"

    "text": "hello my name is travis hartley my wife and i are the owners of 148 iron point road which you can see right now i 'm doing a quick reputation regarding the cl20 [Music] the compensation for section 94 the coronavirus now my business has gone through a lot in the last 12 months we 've had a flood on this building site we 've had bushfires we have had coronavirus we 've also had four years of pain to get our da approved in april some almost seven months ago there was a motion put through council to reimburse half of section 93 obligations for commercial premises that will employ people now section 94 is basically a tax on commercial development or a tax on employment so if you go through with this motion tonight and approve it that means that i will get back half of the tax i 've had to pay to develop my land keeping in mind that my land will employ people during the process of this build we have employed on average three full-time employees every day since june 1. these include companies bricklayers local excavator drivers basement view nursery sam hughes constructions tomeron quarry and the list goes on we also once we open we 'll continue to employ up to the five full-time staff i finally have and any casuals like three i have at the moment which could increase with section 94 obligations council decides that they want to build a nice pretty park or a library or something like that they then go we 'll get the developer to pay for it it 'll be nice but why should we pay by giving back half of our section 94 as coronavirus support means that council is going to go halves in developing the services and the facilities they want and they consider to be important so please consider tonight the motion to return half of our section 94 give us 20 000 which might be the catalyst for us to finish our build so we can employ people please consider this motion thank you _"

    "text": "well good afternoon everybody and thank you very much indeed for joining this hour-long webinar run from the the shoalhaven city council in conjunction with a number of very key and important panelists which amanda finlay the mayor will introduce but from my perspective my name 's vince dietro and the local recovery coordinator for the shoalhaven post bushfires and the we 've been through a lot together in the last year um and it 's fair to say that uh there 's an awful lot of very very vivid memory of some of the things that we 're going to be talking and preparing people around you 'll shortly hear from an expert in the field from new south wales health but before catherine comes on i just urge people to be ready to turn off and switch this off if it 's causing any undue or unexpected reaction or or or unhappy memories for any of the listeners it 's really important that we get the message out to see exactly what we have in place the mechanisms that are that are that are ready to go and as individuals in the shoalhaven but if that generates any sort of banks be ready to uh and be very very comfortable turning this off because you can access it later we 're recording all sessions and putting them on the shoalhaven city council website you can access this later at your own leisure but for the moment can i please uh first acknowledge the traditional papers people of the land on which we meet today within all parts of the shoalhaven and further afield who may be listening and pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging i extend that respect to any torres strait islander and aboriginal people who are here with us online today i also acknowledge that a significant um effect and if and uh and outcome has been experienced by all those people in so far that fires and floods have had a an incredible impact on the indigenous community in and their well-being culture and history within the shoalhaven because of the effect that these emergencies have had on the land that said um i 'd like to start this uh ball uh mayor amanda finley uh over to you amanda thanks vince and i 'd like to acknowledge country as well and to acknowledge all the the elders of the past present and those that are emerging and also to all of you in the shoalhaven it 's been a cracker of a shoalhaven day and i thank you for taking the time out of your schedules to join um this sustained panel that i believe in a steam panel that 's come together to get you ready for the next season because who can believe that nine months has gone by and who can believe what we 've been through it 's certainly been the uh the rolling disaster season for the shoalhaven but on the panel this afternoon um you 've heard from vince vince has been ably leading up the recovery and i 'm really appreciative of his time and he 's spent in the shoalhaven over the last nine months um i was thinking before about how what 's the hierarchy but there 's no hierarchy here because in an emergency everybody just mucks in and everyone our leo con from the police and also we have warren goodall who 's our regional emergency management officer who will be joining us this afternoon kim white our local emergency management officer mark williams a well-known face in the shoalhaven from the rfs and of course we 've got our good friend catherine coming in from health our ceo stephen dunchey from shoalhaven city council and i 'm sure that by the end of this hour you 'll feel more informed i 'm hope you 'll feel more informed and better prepared for the summer that we have ahead thanks for being here thanks vince thanks very much amanda just uh to to elaborate on that a little um the agenda this afternoon over the next hour we want to be able to give um all participants in this webinar a a bird 's eye view of the emergency management committee and structure that oversees uh the the preparation and the planning we want to be able to take in a walk through the emergency operations center and the integrated emergency management centre which has rate payers in the shoalhaven city council amenity or facility and then we 're going to walk through with the leocon the rfs and the regional emergency management officer just walking it down progressively getting to the the really really minut nuts and bolts that we can uh inform the the folks listening of how they can best prepare themselves individually so the idea of this is to make sure people see what is in place what is available to us and how best we can we can actually meet the uh the challenge of the the imminent bushfire season and so with that i would like to um i 'd like to uh just um introduce uh catherine thorpe from um from from new south wales uh government uh and uh and to talk about mental health and uh and just to give a few words of encouragement about uh about the the forthcoming season so over to you please catherine thank you so much thanks for having me today so i 'm i 'm catherine as vince mentioned i work for new south wales health as a mental health clinician in the emphasize the need for all of us to pay attention to our self-care both as we navigate our way forward but also during the webinar sessions today so as mentioned already by vince please take care of yourself today during the sessions some of us might start to experience uncomfortable feelings or memories from the last bushfires or other events that have recently occurred or in the past if you start to feel at all overwhelmed please take a break step away take a moment to breathe and turn off the presentation they will be available as mitch mentioned on the council website can so you can go back to them when you 're feeling ready as a result of the bushfires some of us are going through the toughest experiences of our lives and might be experiencing new or intense emotions it 's very important to take time out regularly to replenish your energy to refill your bucket this means putting the focus back onto yourself occasionally now that 's going to look slightly different for everyone but there 's some common elements that we know boost our well-being throws at us so try to have regular contact with people who make you feel good that might be joining a social group it might be having some friends or family members over or you can shoot the breeze with having a barbecue that sort of thing regular physical activity is beneficial both for our bodies and our brains so maybe make a commitment to what we 're doing each day we 'll go for a swim a surf enjoy our beautiful local region and play sport perhaps most importantly spend time doing something you enjoy something that brings you some amount of pleasure so initially people might have got through days and the weeks on adrenaline willpower sheer grit and determination but we can only do that for so long without paying attention to our self-care before it starts to take a toll on us physically mentally and psychologically so as time goes on people might find you 're more run down or feeling fatigued not sleeping well or maybe getting colds or other health complaints you might notice that your moods aren 't as easy to control or of character for you you might be worried about things that you never use to concern you or maybe you 're worried about the future it can also be hard to concentrate and think clearly so you might have difficulty focusing or remembering things these are actually all normal responses but they are also a sign that your mind and body are under stress so if you notice that these things are hanging around or becoming more frequent or that they 're interfering with your ability to do your normal day-to-day activities it 's actually worth seeking out some support you don 't have to cope with this on your own it can help to work with a professional or a counselor to work out what 's going on and also to develop some strategies that work for you the support lines and services you can see on the slide are all free or bulk billed or you can just give us a call it doesn 't really matter how small big you feel your issue is the shell heaven bush by recovery service team are happy to listen and mind at ease or give you some more detailed and individual assistance and we can also connect you with other supports so now as we move forward into the rest of the webinar sessions i 'd like to invite everyone to take a moment wherever you are to take a couple of deep slow breaths so let 's breathe in deep and long and slow and now breathe out slow and deep and repeat so deep breath in slow deep breath out and that 's just one strategy we can use during the day when we 're feeling a little bit distressed thanks everyone for taking time to listen please take care of yourself during this session and into the future bye for now thanks very much catherine that 's uh that that was terrific and um and and at any point please i i really emphasize if this isn 't if this is causing you any distress at all just just turn it off and we 'll if you need to speak to someone you can call the council helpline five triple eight and we 'll be able to just wanna talk talk to someone in in slower time and prior that as well it 's now a pleasure to introduce um the chief executive officer of the shoalhaven um not so much in that role but more importantly excuse me in his role as the uh as the chair of the local emergency management committee uh over to you stephen dunchey please and thanks very much vince for that uh for that introduction um firstly can i just thank uh passing my thanks to the whole team that have worked so hard to put this uh these webinars together today uh this is this is one strategy that the um that the council in consultation and collaboration with the emergency agencies have um have developed to uh to raise awareness in the shoalhaven about the uh the upcoming bushfire season and it 's a it 's it 's difficult in these covered circumstances to get this information out as effectively as as we would like to but uh i think i think the team have done an excellent job in putting together this webinar so and also thank afternoon to to join in so welcome welcome along i suppose the first point i 'd like to uh to make this afternoon is that um we all have to accept that emergencies are inevitable and as we know they can and they do have significant social economic and environmental consequences in impacts we just go back to the other slide just firstly let 's flick that back please um so and we 've seen that very dramatically across the across the shoalhaven during the uh the summer of 1920 and the uh the devastating carowind fire followed by floods and um and now the covert situation so so that uh that bus fire the recent floods and the wind events uh let 's not forget the winds that attacked us so severely in recent weeks and as i said of course the global coronavirus crisis all these things emphasize the need for all of us to have prepared appropriate and effective prevention preparation response and recovery strategies and plans and to have those in place to help us through these emergency situations that we 've lived through across our and communities of the shoalhaven of which we have 49 towns and villages all of which have their unique challenges in dealing with these emergency situations so shoalhaven city council works in partnership with the emergency services both the state and federal government agencies with charities and others other organizations to support our community through the recovery phase of emergencies similarly council works with these agencies to prepare for future emergencies including the coming bushfire season and part of which that preparation is what we 're doing today and as i said in collaboration with the emergency agencies on emergency authorities and you 'll hear from others later on so as uh chief executive officer slash general manager of the council one of my roles is to chair what 's what 's called the local emergency management committee and so that 's really what i particularly want to talk to you about today is is the role of the emergency management committee where that fits into the emergency response structure and uh and particularly what its role is so if i can move to that other slide thank you so according to the state emergency and rescue management act of 19 1989 and that committee is responsible for the shoalhaven emergency management plan this is a document prepared by or with the assistance or through that that committee the local emergency management committee and that uh that plan is made publicly available and is available on council 's website would you uh should you choose to go and have a look at that and i would encourage i would encourage you to do that as an outcome of today 's uh today 's webinar so the local emergency management committee is responsible for preparing plans in relation to the prevention of preparation for response to and the recovery from emergencies within the shoalhaven and if you look at that diagram on that screen and the blue docs boxes to the left so the lemc the local emergency management committee is responsible to back up the hierarchy to what 's called a regional emergency management committee which in turn then is responsible to the state emergency management committee and that committee meets on a quarterly basis or more regularly if needed in recent months of the of the local emergency management committee more informal meetings as as we 've worked collaboratively council with uh with police health and other agencies in uh in dealing with the uh the covert 19 crisis and its impacts on the shoalhaven and preparing the shoalhaven for that so as i said it meets on a quarterly basis and important to note that the local emergency management committee is not responsible and doesn 't have the role for leading the response to emergencies it has those particular functions as i 've mentioned so i 've removed on the next slide so the local emergency management plan as i said records the agreed arrangements for the control of emergency situations and the coordination of resources during those emergencies and as i said that 's a public document available on council 's website the implant if i can refer to it that way e-m-p-l is based on the following principles firstly that the responsibility for preparation response and recovery rests at the local level initially secondly that the control of emergency response and recovery operations is conducted at i said before it 's not the local emergency management committee that 's running emergencies and responding to emergencies it 's the lead agency be that rfs be that ses be that police be it whoever be at new south wales health so emergency preparation uh the other principle sorry emergency preparation response and recovery operations should be conducted with all agencies carrying out their normal functions wherever possible and that 's what we aim to do when we get together in these emergency situations build it into our normal operations as best we can and the other principle prevention measures remain the responsibility of the authorities agencies charged by statute within that responsibility so members who who is flick back if you could please the other slide a little bit quick for me um so who are the members of the local emergency management committee we have on three levels we have emergency service members we have supporting agency members and of course we have council so if i just go through those briefly the emergency services members being rural fire service fire and rescue new south wales the police royal surf life saving australia defence marine rescue the local emergency management officer which is a council position a position within council kim white is our local emergency management officer the remo or the regional emergency management officer uh warren goodell is the remo and warren will talk to you shortly and the leo con the local emergency operations controller and we 're represented today by inspector ray steins from new south wales police who is the the leo con and ray will talk to you shortly as well so they 're the emergency service members the supporting agency members uh on the current uh committee illawarra shoalhaven local health environmental protection authority a range of utilities transport for new south wales local land services uh engineering services welfare national parks shoalhaven water at the table uh abc media telecommunications services and the jervis bay territory aurora or also members council uh next slide please so council shoalhaven council 's role in addition to me the general manager ceo as the chair of the committee council 's role is to provide support to the emergency and those other support that attend the emergency situations out at the uh the integrated management center and the emergency operations centre uh in the areas of our water and sewer operations across the shoalhaven coordinating transport needs whether that 's road closures or whatever else needs to happen or alternate transport routes engineering services environmental services and very importantly we have a media and communications team out there through all emergencies so also one of our prime functions at at those emergency situations is to facilitate the full or partial activation of what 's referred to as an emergency evacuation center or emergency evacuation centers and in doing so council is required to follow the shoalhaven emergency operations center standard operating procedures which actually define what is an emergency evacuation center and the implant actually notes and advises or determines where those emergency evacuation centers are so in that regard council supports the local emergency operations controller and we do that in accordance with the new south wales emergency operations center policy so that 's uh that 's really what i wanted to get across today is the role of the local emergency alluded to there 's going to be a brief tour via video through the emergency operations center so um thank you very much vince that 's all from me at this point thanks stephen thanks steven um we 're just going to take a very short video break now um one of the really important things is that is we 're trying to go from the big picture down to the small so and this is about getting ready and part of that getting ready is being confident and understanding the mechanisms and the places and the people in place that are involved and engaged in in basically keeping our city well and safe now what we 've got is a video of the integrated emergency management center now for those that aren 't familiar with it we 're really lucky in the shoalhaven and we 're one of the very few local government areas to have such a facility it 's been paid for and established by the shoalhaven city council so our rates at work it 's an amazing facility which i can assure you after many years setup that i 've ever seen but it 's where a whole number of agencies come together and so come the actual time of the emergency everybody is located in the one place we we conduct almost every one of our emergency committee meetings or our recovery action team meetings everything happens in the one place but what we 've got here is a young fellow called brad from the rfs who who made this video up in uh in early december during the last five years but it 's a great insight into the amenity here at 92 albatross road which you as taxpayers own and the center from which the resources are allocated to uh to get to the places we need to be in the time of in time of emergency so over the video please share good morning bradley stewart rural fire service this is the shoalhaven fire control center this is where the incident management team is working from to support the ongoing fires here in the batemans bay shoalhaven area this is the logistics cell in here so we 've got volunteers and agency coordinating resources such as fire units strike teams firefighters hotel bookings and uh food is our operations section so this is where the operations team are coordinating the resources that are moving around the fiber including aircraft this is our fire behavior analysts so they look at the weather they look at the fuel availability they look at the topography they make predictions as to the rate of spread around the community we have national parks people here assisting with the coordination of um planning so we have a planning team here so they 're looking four five days in advance as to what we can do to bring this fire to a successful resolution we have specialist gis mapping operators here so they 're trying to do all the mapping and keep it up to date that flows onto our firefighters but also through fires near me etc they 're going to see the extent in the scale of fire down here we have our radio communication section so they communicate with the resources that are in the field so we push information to them we pull information back the community for our community messaging this is the community liaison team so the role is to take phone calls and assist members of the public this section here is our aviation section they 're not too busy at the moment because aviation resources haven 't launched just yet so they 're out doing some briefings so we 've got up to 12 aircraft available to us at the moment including the large air tanker as required okay so this is the emergency operations centre where we have all of our support agencies across new zealand so department health police local council ses we have rms and they 're supporting the ongoing operation here and helping to keep the community safe thank you and that um that is a terrific segue into the next speaker who who most will be very familiar with from from the fire season and that 's um inspector mark williams from the rfs over to you mark thanks vince and uh thanks everybody for uh coming along this afternoon and the invite uh obviously to be here and give this presentation in uh preparation of the integrated emergency center that we have here within shoalhaven has been said is uh one of the the best if not the best in the state we are held in very high esteem around the state and we 're very very fortunate to have such a good facility keenly supported by all the agencies and obviously council as well to have the emergency operations center right next door to our operations centre literally across the hallway uh was imperative and vital in the fact that we actually had that connection between the communications of both the uh the combat agency and that of the the support from the emergency management committee so rest assured uh we have the best of facilities in the state here and they were put into full effect and full use during the recent campaign and in campaign since such as the flooding and also covered to a degree last season as we 've mentioned and as we all remember uh was extremely serious uh and devastating to everybody concerned and i won 't harp on that and instead today we 're focusing on where starting to get down into a bit of the nuts and bolts of what we have here and how you can start to prepare yourselves ready for the not only this season but any future seasons and any other future events that may occur locally we run the local government area of shoalhaven out of this district office we have 36 rural fire brigades within the district and in approximate numbers about 1500 volunteers at any one time within those brigades locally here within the district office on a day-to-day basis we have a number of full-time staff including myself to assist in the management of those brigades and also to work in the operations aspect for our brigades to attend not only the major incidents such as the caroline fire but also the other day-to-day incidents which you 'd see the brigades out doing uh regularly being anything from a garbage bin a light to a cutter up a tree through to flood assistance and assisting our other agencies as need be as well as structural fires and motor vehicle accidents since the fires we 've had over 250 as best we can through the covered restrictions to get them trained up ready to also join the ranks and be able to respond during the upcoming season so that is a work on going and it 's something that we 're continuing to implore for people anybody who 's wishing to further assist their local community uh that our doors are always open for new members and we 'll go into a bit of extra detail shortly about how you can make contact with those brigades and register your interests should you so choose those brigades and ourselves here hopefully are looking at a season a lot more benign than what we were seeing this time last year at this time last year we were already you fighting fires significant fires up in the northern tablelands and new south wales and it continued down and through the state over the rest of the season what we 're seeing locally here with the a couple of east coast lows is the our soil moisture is certainly increased the point that we are now at saturation levels and that will stead the fire season which starts on the 1st of september in saying that we can 't be complacent we need to be aware of our situation and it doesn 't take very long for the ground to dry out extreme winds can come through and assist in that drying out process and as we all know as a summer heat period comes through that will also dry out the area and we could well end up with a fire season still so how do yourself prepare the one thing that you would have heard us harping on about regularly ad breaks you name it and even threw out the fire it was ensuring that asking people to ensure that they have a bushfire survival plan now that that plan is available either in hard copy uh through the any of your brigade local brigades or the district office here in in nara or you can get it online through the rfs website i really implore and in fact i almost expect that every resident in the shoalhaven should already have one of those plans if you don 't i implore at the the material that 's in it and it is this very simple procedure to get you underway for starting to consider how and what you are going to do should an emergency come in and around your area such things as preparing your own house knowing what uh flammable objects you 've got around your house that you can have cleared away making sure fuel is fuel such as firewood stacks aren 't stacked up against the house making sure your lawns are kept mowed making sure you have water supplies available making sure you know exactly what you 're going to do in the event of an emergency are you going to leave if you 're going to leave where are you going to go and what are you going to take with you i know vince will go into a little bit more detail a bit later about what you can take with you just as to some examples so please download that out have a have a look through that program and actually start looking and having that discussion with your family about what you all the other agencies are here to help wherever we possibly can and we always will but the self-help program for yourselves is paramount for everybody and don 't rely on the single source of information the fires near me up the emergency warnings that we have to set out from time to time our social media posts are all avenues to keep yourself up to date with the emergency situation as it develops but don 't rely on a single source of truth if you rely on the fires near me out and they happens to go down or you lose power where is your next source of truth going to come from abc illawarra is our radio station our network of abc channels around the state which we will promulgate all of our emergency warnings through so have a number of different avenues that you can rely on including your own situational awareness of what 's going on around you by looking outside your doorstep to guess i 'll not guess but understand what you are facing and what you were going to do so without any further said more than welcome to take some questions later on thanks very much mark thanks very much mark um and that 's a good uh a good segue into the local emergency um operational controller um inspector ray steins from narrow police over to you please ray yeah thanks vince um my name 's ray steins i 'm the inspector at nara police station um i 'm the officer in charge now of police and part of my role is that it 's the leo condo the local emergency operation controller there 's another leo khan at nara as well which is inspector dave cochran and together our job is to manage and coordinate the eoc um to coordinate the aic involves a number of agencies coming together and the main role or the primary role is to support the combat agency in their efforts to fight or combat the emergency it 's not our role as an aic to do that role for them but anything that they need to help them undertake that role we coordinate for them and supply it for them that can be in relation um roadblocks you know we will do it whatever we need to do to help them achieve their goal we will attempt to do um a big thing about the when i open up in a an emergency operations centre the first thing that i decree is that everybody leaves their hats at the door right we all work together to achieve the goal of helping the combat agency and part of that is as soon as the eoc opens its front door we go into recovery and preparation at the same time recovery will be to get communities back to some form of normality as soon as possible um if that means arranging with the rfs for a bushfire for example to have power put back on with the integral energy or endeavour energy we will do it um and in saying that for the preparation part with the forecasters of the fire um they 'll they 'll tell us where the forecast fire is going to go and we 'll prepare that area as best we can to reduce the impact of that fire along with the rfs our role in its entirety is to protect life and property and it doesn 't matter what type of day or emergency it is we will always do that and that is just exacerbated during an emergency we will do whatever we have to do in line with the combat agency to undertake that task if that means getting people out of houses we will do that that means putting up roadblocks and preventing people accessing areas we will do that if that means stopping people going back into their homes we will do that like i said our primary goal is life protection of life and property and i 'll make no excuses for that um if i can just reiterate one thing that mark said in that the preparation of your plan um when you are preparing a plan and like mark said um vince will go into something a little bit more in-depth later on um think about the more new thing that you 've got that you need if you need long-term medication and your plan is to stay make sure you 've got enough medication that degree it 's simple if you can 't manage to stay with the medication or have that a sufficient medication to last you a little i would suggest you your plan should be to leave the area um well that 's about it for me at the moment um unless anyone 's got some questions that i 'm happy to answer later um all good okay thanks very much ray and now we 're um we 're coming down to a fine point and uh and and now starting to focus on the things that that you should be considering yourselves uh in readiness for the fire and to help us uh navigate through that and the regional emergency management officer and local emergency management officers are both in place to to do just that and so at this point i 'll hand over to warren goodall and uh and and over to you please warren thanks vince and uh good afternoon everybody as vin said i 'm the regional emergency management officer and i 'm a civilian employee within new south wales police my role is to provide to not only new south wales police but a whole range of government and non-government organizations when it comes to things to do with emergencies and every aspect of the emergency is part of that process and i 'm assisted uh as part of my teams uh the people who are embedded in local council the local emergency management officers in in your case for show haven it 's kim white and kim 's role when we have an eoc operating is to effectively be the office manager for the emergency operations centre and make sure that all the aims and objectives required by the combat agency and the leocon are done as best as we can do them so how does this move on to what you can do as members of the community we all know that emergencies impact different people in different ways what might be an impact on you may not be an impact on your neighborhood or to the same level of severity to your neighbor or the person across the road so it 's really imperative that individuals maintain what we call situational awareness 's happening around you be aware of the the weather conditions and so forth if you know that we 've got three or four days of rain forecast or there 's fires 50 kilometers or 20 kilometers or 10 kilometers away you should have that on your radar and be working with your individual plans to see how that event will impact on you personally now if you 're in a position where you can look after yourself and manage your own circumstances and bearing in mind things like mark alluded to earlier on where you may be isolated from serious hop for multiple days at a time if not weeks at a time if you 're able to do that that 's fine manage your plan and follow your plan but if you require assistance in any way shape or form your plan needs to be reviewed and modified to allow that to occur so that you can move out earlier than maybe your neighbor moves out that you can go to a place of safety the emergency services will often give you enough information to assist you in place of safety the challenge we have with some individuals is that they often see their place of safety as being the community hall at the end of the street i challenge you to think that if we want you to leave an area we don 't want you to stay down the road we want you to go to a completely safe area and that may well mean traveling a number of kilometers if your plan requires that to occur there may be processes in places in place that we can assist you with that depending on the circumstances at the time but we can 't guarantee it so there 's a whole range of things that will assist you in having that situational awareness and a lot of these are free applications that can be downloaded onto your various smart devices emergency plus app is one device that can be one one application that can be used and it 's really great for telling emergency services where you are and allowing you to quickly coordinate or contact the triple zero uh lifeline system we have the rfs fires junior recent fire events and it was able to provide you with some good core information on what was happening with the fire event scs have a similar application called flood safe obviously it deals with floods there 's live traffic which concentrates on government new south wales government based roads so it may not have all the details on the local council roads for that information you probably need to go to your local council website to see where where those roads are impacted so there are a range of applications out there we encourage you to to use them the best way you can accepting that during some emergencies and we saw that in the 2019-2020 fires there will be times when telecommunications are down so as part of your preparation and planning you should consider having a the old transistor radio battery operate operated radio that allows you to tune into our local abc 97.3 and get up-to-date information from that abc channel on what 's happening in your area the key to all this is early planning you know what 's going to impact on you what your liabilities are we don 't have all that information you need to plan for this you need to be aware of what 's going on around you and you need to follow the advice and guidance that is offered by the various emergency services of the events thanks warren there are there are some really good important and simple messages in there what we might do is just move to a couple of questions that we 've got from uh from participants online and um and then we 'll just slowly build up perhaps um towards the end of the uh of the hour uh just to sim consider before we put um suggested lists of what to get ready and how to you know physically prepare what things to have in a bag towards the end of the uh of the webinar so the first question uh worth worth exploring is we 've had someone say why isn 't there a neighborhood safer place or assembly area in my village well rather than ask which village perhaps we might just have a more broad view uh warren and and how we define what can and can cannot be one and how an evacuation centre is determined so perhaps mark if we start with you what could just explain how we come to a designation of a neighborhood safer place mark williams yes certainly thanks vince um so firstly uh with neighborhoods safer places i guess the explanation needs to go with those and it is listed on all the signs that you will see where these uh locations are identified and that is that it is a place of last resort and whilst that seems like a bit of a contradiction in terms it is exactly what it means a neighborhood safer place shouldn 't be relied on as the place to go to get information a place to go to be looked after in any way shape or form it is a place that 's identified it 's identified by the rural fire service it has to meet certain specifications now those specifications need to allow us to adequately and happily advise you that if you get to a place like that you should be okay guarantee but it is the best place that you can possibly be if your plan and that bushfire plan that you have developed fails so it is a place of last resort if everything else fails that 's the place you can go and it 's at that location you should be okay there 's 28 of those within the shoalhaven at present we are we continually monitor that we 're continually trying to improve that and get more in some of them are simply a paddock in the field which has got enough open space there you should be okay others are actually within a identified structure with certain parameters around it that meet the specifications so that 's a what a neighborhood safer places and as i said we 'll continue to roll those out as much as we possibly can where we can find locations that meet that specification thanks mark warren would you like to tackle the evacuation center uh sort of parameters what we look for and and what what deems something to be a suitable evacuation center or not certainly thanks vince evacuation centers it is a little bit paradoxical sometimes to have an evacuation center in the town or village that you are trying to evacuate what we 've done in the shoalhaven in fact the whole of the south coast is pre-identify preferred locations that can accommodate large volumes of people and even more so now with the covert 19 challenges that we have in front of us so we 've pre-identified and the shoulder haven 't done it pretty well they 've pre-identified a number of recommended locations that can accommodate a large number of people in a safe environment that is extremely unlikely to be at threat in the future because of that particular event that 's going on so the places we choose for a fire may well be different from the places we choose for a flood for obvious reasons the challenge we have with all that is that we have an obligation to provide certain facilities to those evacuation centres and those facilities around the general terms of welfare so we need to provide accommodation access to accommodation preferably in hotels or something similar rather than having accommodate uh domestic pets we need to be able to accommodate medical needs of people and the resources needed to provide those uh those those things for the community so whilst in an ideal world every community would have their own evacuation center the practical reality of that is just unfortunately not there the challenges are as i said we need to move you to a place of safety or get you to move to a space of safety where you 're not going to be impacted by that event if it if it goes pear-shaped again and be able to provide you with a whole range of resources at those evacuation centers the centers are reviewed on a regular basis they are checked every minimum of every 12 months and the locations are checked and reviewed about every one or two years based on the circumstances and the predictions of the weather after you vince thanks warren that 's probably a good segue it 's it 's a bit of a snowball effect if the if the direction is to to leave now and for whatever reason people do where our populations can at times multiply by factors of 10 means that the ability of evacuation centers to actually hold people even you know even some of the population in a safe way becomes significantly diminished now that 's going to take on a whole new dimension in the covet era because obviously we don 't want to be putting people into further harm 's way in in close proximity if social distancing is still required but it 's probably a good segue to perhaps if someone could explain what the terms mean so what is what is leave now what is watch and act what does watch and act mean what does uh you know um find children in a safe place what are the what are the warnings we get what do they actually mean so could perhaps either warren or um or uh or jenna or mark take that on yeah i 'm sure i can probably lead into the first of the three warnings that uh relate specifically to bushfire that we work uh as most people will know under a bushfire we we have there is a fire in an area so on the fires near me app or other methods of communication you 'll see advice and that 's general just advice letting you know that that 's in the area the next one 's watch and act watching actors meaning that the situation is getting more serious uh it is a developing situation and it means exactly as it says we want people to start watching we want people starting to act on their bushfire plan if they 're in the close proximity of that incident and then thirdly goes to emergency warning status and that emergency warning status is exactly as it says also and that 's the fire or the event has got to a significant proportion where we have life and property directly under threat with those emergency warnings once we get to that stage often we will put an emergency alert out now that alert is uh something that we can do either via door knocking if it 's a very small area that we can get in there earlier or in some cases as many people would or the phone call that gets made to your landline at home the messages that come across for that will be specifically related to the incident at hand and it will be specifically related to the area concerned so examples such as shelter in place _"

Young said the knock was down towards the floor mahadji do you need a being an open gate position or if you have a little more mobility through the shoulders you might bring your palms together and squeeze the elbows towards one another behind press the knuckles down think about the chest and the heart opening to the ceiling so we find that space to the front way you don 't have to go any further unless you start to lose the pinkies away from the back of the body even ball keep the lake through smart gonna start to just hinge from the hip ever so slightly you might at least be a little too much on the shoulders coming here too far forward as you can lift the knuckles towards the ceiling you might come into a more open gate to add more opening opening through the shoulders thousands

up into the chest round the back so lies the biggest along your back as you bring yourself up roll the shoulders at the very top three stack realign the body and bring them some boxes in to finish that will love in the Nazis in half and have that through top set up we 're gonna look into a little money now that should feel nice we 're gonna grab a strap or our rope or our tie anything that you have now what I 'm going to ask if you have a block we 've got a place to eat under SC folks if you don 't have a block maybe a couple of books or a couple of pillows you can roll up some towels just to elevate the hips a little more that 's going to get into the hip socket and into the back of the legs so doesn 't feel comfortable if you prefer to be grounded please make sure we do or whatever we 've got we 're going to place it around the balls of the feet that you need to bend the knees these parts please Bethany otherwise we 're just going to soften through the legs make sure that the muscles are away from the sit bones so we wanted to have the pelvis in the right alignment draw the shoulders back and just bring yourself so that you 're even up right L position pull the belly in take a nice deep in breath and as you exhale pull gently so just elbows keep the chest elevated and we 're going to tip it so what we want to avoid is birthing of the back so everything we do is from our joint and you might stop their breath in how you live it 's how you might walk a little further down and again just depending on your flexibility all you know my ability to 2 by using but the mind the body studies around and I want you to bring yourself back in and so again just opinion you might come and grab your feet remember we don 't want to compromise our alignment or our technique prevent and that 's really really important through yoga alignment and technique is key to everything it 's how we create flexibility and is how we create strength in the body by doing it correctly and weighting injuries enclose in belly blow ups a little further down the body and out we should really start to feel that debt happening in the back of the legs I 'll be to the low back the back of the rib cage beautiful back body stretch here and then wherever you have landed we 're just going to stay for a moment I want you to really think about during the toast that now press the heels forward draw the toes back that 's what automatically deepen that stretch where they going to keep that also in this position we 're not going to move but we 're going to let go of our strap will let go of the feet and just let the elbows pain directly in underneath the shoulders these days I 'm going to let you drown to make connective tissue reliefs and you get a really tingly fuzzy feeling created in the body you 're going to take your chin and as low as you possibly can we 're gonna be in hell we 're gonna exhale start to draw the chin into the chest it 's a really slow movement pull the clothes back at the same time and I want you to create a lollipop shape with your upper body so the shoulders start to round forward we start to really create around an upper body which is what we were avoiding in the beginning and you want to think about the crown of the head searching up the thighs we should feel this tingling feeling from the soles of that feet out the back of the legs right up through the each side the spine right to the third eye between the eyebrows and I want you to just release now it 's not a normal feeling it 's quite uncomfortable sensation but I want you to breathe into it let the shoulders round with each exhale tucking deep and a little more it 's not just the muscles in our body we 're allowing blood flow to completely flood the body but it 's not going fast to put a little bit more so round draw up a little higher yeah drop pull back a little more yeah feel it now yeah pull back a little bit more if it 's not going a pass to a bum crawl back so create like a key shape of a capital P we 're going to stay for two more full breaths in and out slow the breath right down and I 'm login keep the toys really thrown back and out and now it 's slowly gonna remove ourselves now really slowly we 're gonna push the sit bones back flatten from the belly button the ribcage draw the shoulders back take your eye gaze to your toes flatten your spine and then from the hip we slowly see you 're like a little buddy take a nice deep breath all right exhale deaf Club we 're going to bring the soles of the feet together staying elevated on that block just let our feet like a book so our thumbs come onto the balls of the feet hands back around we open those feet as much as we possibly can draw the shoulders back take a nice deep breath in and then as you exhale I want you to think that your elbows searching back to the creases of your face so they search back as we bring the chest or whether our sit bones actively turn backwards so you want your sip bottle is up and behind you yeah now if you have hip issues bring the legs slightly forward forward or even a little bit wider or you can come back into a more wider bullet-hole lifting writer so keeping a flat spine again so we 're working through those couple of different movements we 're going to take the elbows a little wider now so we 've drawn them back and then we 're gonna search them out so we 're going to slide them along the inner thighs we 're opening those feet like a book so you can see the soles and then we 're going to is remaining as flat as we possibly can so what we 're trying to do is we 're actually trying to get our chest as close to the soles of the feet as we can not our head we inhale and exhale taking one more full breath in but they 're gonna start to walk the elbows towards the front of the shins this is where I 'm gonna let you come into that rounded body again so we start flat we curl and this time you 're thinking about the crown of the head coming into the soles of the feet yeah so just letting the body tuk ride in under blasting through the spine look back towards the fact that you use your elbows with gentle press against jeans and you try and search a little further forward and then bring yourself up lastly we 're gonna remove all the pillows if you want to stay elevated you can 't where they going to take the legs out a little wider so if you need to if you 're really feeling the body come into a rounded position up or work whatever you 've got just to add a little more movement then you might need to bring the legs in that 'll help you pull forward otherwise your hands can come behind you so again it just depends on your mobility your flexibility you don 't mean the strap you don 't have to use it so we 're gonna take the hands full with our home top straps find that nice alone buddy pull the toes back so flex the feet in half now went down on the ground you should feel a little more open through the back with the white back pull on the strap pull it otherwise you can start to settle between the hips you might have a couple of cushions you might rest your elbows on you if you get to that spot instead you might rest your chin you might rest your forehead but what we want to do is we want to maintain and it 's flat back as we can see you know the old-fashioned pancake things to pull up the pancake that 's so we 're walking to ran the nose into the floor the first thing that should come down is the belly button then the text then the chin so the last thing to touch the floor should be our chin really trying to walk the body through shoulders are back and down and again everything we do is search forward so we 're reaching towards the front of our mat as far forward as we can really pull those clothes back deepening into the hips the back of the legs one more full breath in as you exhale one more release I 've never known around ourselves slowly drag as we bring ourselves back up and reset the plate I 'm gonna get you bring your left leg in so just feel left leg now if you put a tie or a piece of rope you 're gonna just create a little knot around your foot if you have this strap you 're just going to take a single thread through the right foot so all you want to do is create a loop so that it will go over the yeah now if really feel this stretch yeah something with a little bit more length you have a little bit more leeway yeah so we 're going to come into a beautiful side body stretch really leave this session about two centimeters taller we 're gonna take our left arm and we 're going to come as high as we can so straight up here so if you got something a little bit shorter you 'll find you 'll be in a slightly more side body stretch straight away which is completely fine so what I want you to aim for is drawing the elbow backwards now if you go straight up we 're going to take our right arm to the inside of the right leg where they going to turn the body to the left knee so we turn and we want the left back of the hand to fall as far back as we possibly can so I 'm opening through the chest here that if you can do this with your arm then you need to move further down the strap we want to get to the stage you back your arm can 't_''_1772.19 go any further but we 've got as great as we possibly can we draw the knee down we draw the hip down and we 're trying to open the front of the ribs and the chest to the ceiling so using that right elbow crease against the inside of the leg so you should feel that right through but I 'm going to grab our strap without right hand wrap the strap with the right hand yeah let the strap pull behind we 're going to reach down the stretch even further so you might bring the elbow forward that 's fine bring me over boy where they going to lift the elbows high as we can just to let the strap go be the right arm lift the elbow as tight as you can and try to raise yourself down that 's my body yep use your right well I do have audience their kind pull that elbow right that the dinghy and they pull down and I want you to breathe into your left side of the body so I want you muscles and just opening fine tip and add more rotation with each exhale one more full breath yep we 're gonna bring the left elbow down slowly bring yourself up we 're gonna turn the body towards that right leg we 're going to keep the left hand on the strap our right hand just goes sit behind us yeah and try to as much as you can and we 're going to pull the center of the body back now again depending on your mobility you might be able to grab the foot to do this otherwise just holding on to the strap you might give it a little twist so you 've got more grit and then you 're gonna actively pull back and I want you to pull back up on a diagonal so employees back and we should feel that underneath the shoulder blade and going right down the back of the erecta muscle which runs along the left side of the spine a little external rotation of that left shoulder so we 're trying to open the chest slightly towards the front of the body here at the same time one more full breath drop the shoulder flatten look up relief solution well done from here we 're going to lengthen out sorry so I 'm going to cross so you don 't have to worry about strap you can take it off if you like but then go across the right leg all the way over the left hugging nice and tight and if you can we 're then going to take the left foot across the right a little more we 're going to wrap all the way down so that the fingertips run down along the side and we got to move the root page to the outside so we 're going to pull back and move around grab the wrist for a little bit of extra come down and then just blew off your right shoulder now if you want a little bit more again you can that bottom leg under and makes your boots sit bones are drawn to the ground so I 'm just looking through the different levels we can then take our right hand behind and move further over top of each other extending the arm down to the mat lifting up and then external rotation hallway from so you go boy sit bones grounded we 're trying to get the knees stacked this far across one another is possible lifting up slowly releasing the bring yourself back to sit up sheep to awake and we 're going to unravel the legs bringing ourselves back up

    "text": "okay here it is this is the monster draw berry patch and it 's going absolutely nuts again what it does is when it gets big enough it starts throwing off all of these little offshoots which try and find soil or anything in see they 're trying to grow down onto the ground and that 'll try and start us know the strawberry plant down there problem is I come along with the whipper snipper and chop them all off they 'll just been throwing them back into their butt a couple of weeks ago you come and have a look in here actually use some single-use coffee cups put a bit of soil in there and then I 've set the the new growth in there so they 're ready now I can just snip them off from the mother plant and there 's my new seedling and that 's exactly what I want to show you today I want to show you what you can use out of your recycle bin to actually make pots for seedlings rather than going out and buying little pots to put raided the recycle bin and found any little container the we can pop some seeds into and create some seedlings so I 've already got soil in all of these oh also rated the garbage bin there 's a couple of single-use coffee cups they don 't go in the recycle bin I don 't know how many times I banging on about that and this is the reason as you can see I 've already thrown some in the single-use coffee cups now at the moment you can 't get a cup of coffee in a reusable cup and if you drink coffee you 're gonna end up with a whole bunch of these so that 's what you can use them for this one come out of the garden I 'd already use this one and then you see it 's got no paper left on the bottom just a plastic lining that 's the reason they don 't go in there a cycle because they 're lined with plastic that can 't_''_104.97 be separated at the recycling facilities but I tell you what they make decent little me on the coffee cups one of my pet hates anyway these are all my containers the other ones I 've got here that was a milk carton or a milk bottle and I 've only put soil in the bottom half of it because if I put a seed in there it starts to grow up it still can get the sunshine but it 's protected from the elements from the side like the wind things like that that 's like a tone little greenhouse that 's kind of cool that 's a bottom of a milk milk carton yolk container that one 's a nut Works container that 's a Punnett that probably had cherry tomatoes or something like that in it now that 's that 's pretty big I 'm probably gonna get four in that but one two three four right because a seedling doesn 't need much soil around it these are pretty big normally they come in a theme called a plug it 's about as big as your thumb right and probably half this when they grow up they 're about half the because these are a bit bigger you could leave them in there a little bit longer down the front of got to tetra Paks cut the top out of that one and then I thought hey one and a cut the side out of that one make it longer and that way I can fit like four one two three four and there 'll be easy to break apart and plan into my garden later on even better than that was the milk of milk carton was an egg carton right made of cardboard so with Pierce I 'm gonna pop a seed in each one so only at 12 but I 'm actually gonna put two seeds because when you 're planting seeds out all right not all the Magana germinate not all when we 're going to grow so if you put two in each alright and then as they grow you keep the strongest one and you cut the other one or someone might only get one in each but when they do grow with this thing I can just cut through it with a pair of thing in the ground because it 's just cardboard right there 's no there 's no silky line plastic lining or whatever or no shiny stuff on on an egg egg carton so it can go straight into the ground no worries about that yeah and that 'll be great I 'm stoked on that one that 's probably one of the best I think to use because it 's perfect good size you get twelve in there whatever with the rest of these I haven 't put holes in them yet for good reason I like to grow mine on the windowsill to start with because when they 're little you know and they 're just starting to do their thing they 're a bit more acceptable to the bugs I think that 's the word subset the wolf anyway they 're a bit more open to all the bugs and things like that also my dog loves to dig in the garden alright and if they 're just little seedlings she 'll just go to town but if there 's something that 's like this big and then away from so I like to grow them up on the windowsill the other good thing is you can do it inside with the kids and then they can watch them so they 're not running out into the backyard every five seconds they 're in the middle of lights if plants are grown in bigger they can just look at it on the windowsill and then when they 're big enough you can pop them out in the garden okay so I 've got my soil my own soil he didn 't have to go anywhere for it I 've got my pots they all come in the recycle bin and the garbage means some reduced reuse recycle perfect way to do it didn 't have to go in here for them what I need now is some seeds I bought mine online okay because we 're not meant to leave the house at the moment well you can leave the house but look supermarkets and hardware 's are selling out of seeds and if you 're going to go out and buy seeds make sure you can buy going you know I 'm gonna start my own veggie garden are they buying everything that they need they bought every variety of vegetable they can think of and fruit but the problem is you can 't_''_322.77 grow all of them at the same time you can only grow certain plants and seeds at certain times of the year so make sure you read the packets and obviously grow the things that your family like to eat otherwise there 's absolutely no point to it unless you 're gonna trade it what that 's a good thing about this stuff what one day maybe in the not so distant future this thing could be currency where you trade with people as long as you don 't get too close but you trade out like off I 'm good at grow on strawberries so I 'll give them to you you would have crown carrots so you 're giving the me you know anything apart from that look after each other enjoy the garden if you 've got everything and you didn 't have to leave the house even there try [Music] _"

    "text": "good evening mayor and councillors I 'm John Ferguson and I 'm taking the opportunity to talk to you in regard to this item on the business paper regarding the formerly tapes of George and cook Haven here 's lighthouse mantle I would like to speak in support of the recommendation and I would like to make these particular points looking back historically I just want to point out that the site at Cape st. George was originally named by cook when he sold past the Endeavour in 1770 and subsequently the lighthouse was built there in the 1850s and in fact one of the early lighthouses on the coast and indeed the mantle was part of a an industrial artifact that was brought out from the UK at that time reassembled on site when that lighthouse was decommissioned in the 1880s the mantle was retained and it was repurposed for the Craven heads lighthouse in 1904 we remained in continuous use until the 1960s as you may recall I had an involvement with the retention of the restoration of the crook claim in his lighthouse that ultimately was not and the like the amount was removed by the Navy under the support of the then mayor Paul green and myself through the crook Haven heads lighthouse steering committee demanda was recovered and restored by Crown lands and they have decided that we would be to keep in place for this object into the future I referred to the council staff business paper the conclusion is the written submission provided by the applicant is considered to satisfy the requirements of four of clauses four point six three four and five which other clauses relate to variations to the planning instrument I further go to the comments in the council report and it says the height of the steel frame structure has been reduced and most of the structure is open the impact of developments not considered to be a significant in regard to the area the structures are scoped to reference to a historical lighthouse structure and considered cited within the Jervis Bay at the Maritime complex again any visual impact to combine creek and the coastline will be reduced as a structure up this proposed below the maximum height further adverse impact on the overshadowing the loss of use from public places and the foreshore and other visual amenity the mantle is a one offering rare surviving example in Australia it referencing the height of the original capes of Georgia lighthouse we are providing historical and critical link to the tragic history of 32 shipwrecks over a 30-year period the mantle and its siding with the architectural reference to the caps of Georgia lighthouse is the sighting of a significant cultural object and asset to the Shoalhaven it will enrich the community its understanding of the history and commercial activity of the city and I would recommend that you support the motion if you have any further questions please call me on my mobile I look forward to answering them if you require thank you _"

    "text": "here but what i would like to talk to you about briefly in this video today is the changes that we have proposed in relation to the amount of car parking that this council requires for ground floor office space that 's new office space in cbd locations at the moment shoalhaven council requires one car space for every 24 square metres of new office space on the ground floor in cbd locations we think this needs to be changed we think that this amount of car parking is too high and it serves as a disincentive for the provision of new office space in the shoalhaven particularly compared to our neighbouring councils what we propose is that the amount of car parking required for ground floor office space is changed to one car space for every 40 square metres of floor area remember the current requirement is one car space for every 24 square metres of floor area we 'd like this change to one car space for every 40 square meters of floor area why the change well your current requirements of one car space for every 24 rms guide for traffic generating developments it is also inconsistent with our neighbouring councils for example goulburn council and winter caribbean council their car parking code only requires one car space for every 40 square metres of office space shell harbour council only requires one car space for every 40 square metres and wollongong council in their cbd requires one car space for every 60 square metres and everywhere else in the illawarra that 's one space per 40 square meters so we think it 's reasonable for this council to bring its guidelines in line with our adjoining and in some ways competing local government areas this council is doing a fantastic job with all of its incentive provisions in place i believe you are doing all you can to encourage new development particularly within the narrow cbd but this is just a small tweak that will go even further towards making new developments in the cbd more viable it will bring our council in line with other councils and the shoalhaven won 't be disadvantaged when it comes to attracting new development within our cbd areas councillors thank my written submission which has been emailed to each one of you thank you _"

    "text": "[Music] hi there this is fiona from shell heaven regional gallery welcome back to courtyard creation i 've been thinking lately about what to do with all the cardboard boxes i 've got around the place my recycle bin is getting a bit full cardboard is a great material to use to make small models of larger work this got me thinking about architects and sculptors who both work from drawings generally and they finish with three-dimensional pieces today we 're going to look at the architectural model they make scale models of their large buildings so they can show the clients what the ideas are that they think their clients would like let 's get going it 's a lot of fun to get your ideas into an actual finished piece so i 'm going to show you how i do that the materials we 're using today are quite simple paper pencil ruler and of course masking tape you can use glue but make sure it 's an instant drying one a fast drying one a fork and also some sharp scissors and of course our main material can see between the flat layers there 's a corrugated surface and this is a really easy way to get rid of that top surface of cardboard just using a fork of any type really get it into the ridges of the corrugation and pull it off lifting it up and then you 've got a whole piece with a different texture which will provide some really lovely shadows to your design often once you start working with the materials that really generate some other ideas i 'm going to keep this piece for later because i 've got some thoughts on what i might be able to use that one for it 's now time to get our design ideas down what sort of house shape are you going to make will it be tall and skinny low and long or high at one end and perhaps low at the other what sort of roof will it have where will the light enter your building is there going to be a garden space the next step is to draw three views of your design a side view the front very very good advice go back to your drawing and check all your measurements and make sure all the adjoining walls are the same size this will make it really easy when we scale up you just need to double the amounts and you 'll have a good size model to work with the way to scale up is to increase all the measurements by exactly the same amount so for instance if one wall is five centimeters in your drawing and you want to double the size for your model we simply do our measurements double so for the five centimeter we go up to 10 centimeters for seven centimeters we go to 14. i 'm starting with the front view of my model building and i 'm measuring it up but i 'm making sure i leave one centimeter on either side of the walls so the height of my walls is now 10 and the length of my wall is now 14. i 'm being sure to measure one centimeter on either side of the wall so i can cut little tabs which will help me to simply cut just along the lines that i 've made in those one centimeter borders the next step is to draw onto my front view the front door i check my drawing again just to make sure the scale is correct then i start to cut it out by bending up the cardboard i 'll be able to pull it out enough to cut that bit out for now the side view i need to double check my plan again to make sure i 've doubled the scale so that i know that at the back where it 's three centimeters it 's dotted at six draw up the line and i 'm going to get the second side ready before i cut just to make sure they match i like to lay it out side by side to the front so that i have the textured side the corrugated cardboard on the outside i don 't accidentally put it on the inside once i 've double checked all my measurements and drawn the lines and checked that they do match in shape and size i carefully cut along the i like to keep my construction pretty simple but nice and strong if your construction is not strong guess what your house is going to fall down so along those tabs we made i 've applied a long piece of masking tape the next thing i 'm going to do is pick up the side wall and insert it so a couple of the tabs are on the other side from the tape and this will give you a really strong platform to create a nice strong corner get in there with your fingers and really work that masking tape against the cardboard to create a really strong join right i 'm going to pick up the speed of the video just so i can show you quickly how i construct my model house and all the different steps so doing the second wall once again make sure it 's really strong with the back of the house from that little piece that i had in my drawing push it up against the back side wall and really make it nice and strong after a quick adjustment to my front build the roof now this is a divider from a cardboard box that one 's not quite big enough i think then my house might leak and it has no shade this larger piece comes with built-in skylights as well so that allows me to have more light coming into the building quickly just trim it off because i want to keep it nice and straight for this roof design so i make some little marks to figure out where the tabs are cut them along the marks and i take my ruler and bend that cardboard up against the ruler then i get a nice straight edge now i have the tabs ready to attach i 've taken the ruler again just to create another elevation on my roof line so i 've got a little bit sticking up above the front view of the house so another long piece of masking tape across the tabs firmly attach it to the tabs and then lay it on its front and you 'll be able to poke it in there and attach it to the inside of the model house rub that masking tape up against the cardboard so it 's nice and strong this is the part i really enjoy when your thoughts and ideas start to turn into a 3d piece it 's looking pretty good i 've only attached one side of the roof so that i can access the interior of the house later on in my design by building my model house i 've discovered that i haven 't made the back section of my house strong enough i really wanted a big open space to let as much light into this building as i could but i haven 't allowed enough strength along that back section so i 'm going to fix that by adding another bar of cardboard it 'd be like a supporting beam so i 've cut a piece to measure to fit into that space added a couple of pieces of masking tape and insert it to the interior walls of the house as you can see it 's going to be a lot stronger looking it 's much sturdier in its shape and form now 's the time to put mine to the side so i 've got some outdoor space to design with later on in this project i 'm just using masking tape catching the side of the interior wall and then using the other part of it to push it against the platform once i 've made my way all the way around with the masking tape i just checked that it 's nicely attached and it feels sturdy and strong now it 's time to apply a bit more design to my building i really love the texture that i chose for the side it 's created great shadows i also love the funky floorboards that i 've inserted into the interior of my model house i have gathered some more materials from around the house the wrapping from the loo paper some more packaging material i 've just got a glue stick and a pipe cleaner remember that white piece of cardboard i had in the materials section way back then well i made a little plunge pull out of it when you are designing often when you start using materials your ideas really is just a little um table to go by the pool along with a little sun chair i 'm going to use this little bit of bubble wrap to make a little lilo kind of pool toy because who doesn 't love lying in a pool on one of those have a lot of fun designing and creating your own model house and remember you can draw it up in a sketch or simply just start exploring your materials i 'm really excited to see what your model houses look like so don 't forget to post them on our facebook page or via our instagram bye for now you _"

fluttered wings go drifting by to share their peaceful lullaby can you see the tree folks yes even they 'd down through noontime heat these tummies round and twitching beat the devil pups all sweetly sleep snuggled in a cassowary cassowary in the dust settles in the nest of brush cheeks all dressed in feathered stripes cuddle with him through the night water dragon towards the creek basking on my stone to sleep well now just on a leafy line dream forest noise is king coasting silent through the dim back hunting a hollow dog is cool and snug it keep this full of apps and bugs dozing through the steamy hours and heavy swish of tropical showers right gliding through the soft moonlight when golden silent replaces moon sugar gliders resting suit in forest the gentle air with creaky boughs in rushing rain thank you everyone for listening this morning that 's been great and we 'll see you next time and I live down the story time [Music] _"

    "text": "thank you for the opportunity of responding to the inter report that 's before you tonight in regard to dogs at South era well adventure persecutors specifically the track that 's providing an access point to the dog area I 'm proposing tonight that the the trial is not working it 's not working in terms of the rules being of aid is not working in terms of being an appropriate access point for the designated off leash on leash area undone there most mornings between 00 and 00 for about 20 minutes for a walk exercise and often for a swim and there 's hardly a morning where I do not see someone using the surface over new steps as accept points with their dog and walking across the beach in the wrong spot and that 's clearly seen and an upcoming tide you can see paw prints in the sand where people who have been deliberately not obeying the rules they 're accessing the off leash area and it 's been an area that council have designated as both on leash off leash depending on the time and needs to be direct and specific and without conflict for the rest of the beach users and behind that area reserve a very suitable access point plenty of car parking tracks that are already in place and people can move their dogs in and out there without conflict with the rest of the beach public narrow wali Beach in the southern corn has traditionally been a swimming beach it is already designated as an O dog area because of that people come down there with their families they have young children they have extended all the family members and they want to come down knowing that it 's a safe area for them to be know that it 's healthy they don 't want to put their towel and their gear down on the sand and have half a thought that maybe a dog has been urinating or defecating there in that particular spot they want it to be safe they want it to be healthy and they want to be without conflict they do not want unsolicited dog advances they do not want the dog bounding up to them children or people in their group you 're apprehensive with dogs they want to know that they can be on the beach enjoying the beach without that conflict so is the whole thing working well in terms of obeying the rules it clearly isn 't the logs clearly show that is it working in terms of an appropriate access point for all people no it 's not there is conflict there is confusion and in terms of it being an ongoing suitable facility to have for dog owners when there is a very simple solution to remove the conflict I don 't think it 's an appropriate access point thank you very much _"

    "text": "hi there this is Fiona from Michelle Haven Regional Gallery welcome back to my courtyard it 's a little wet today so we 're going to take today 's session into my studio we will be looking at Georgie nose Moran leaves work today and he was artistic process I 'll guide you through a process of making your still life which I hope you will enjoy Giorgio Morandi was an Italian artist he was born in Bologna Italy where he lived most of his life he taught at the Academy of Fine Arts Bologna in the morning returning to his bedroom studio to work every afternoon Moroni spent a long time selecting an arranging objects stored in his studio he was interested in observation what we see what we are seeing each object becomes a character on a stage Miranda creates relationships between objects and space Miranda 's work focused on artistic process and reflection the act of painting followed by reflection being the final stage gather some objects and consider the shapes in the space between the shapes as you make your selection with the window on the this process requires slowing down carefully observing the objects then tearing paper into the shapes of what you see you can use any paper at hand be mindful that different types of paper will tear differently I have all my shapes ready so I 'm going to arrange them and paste them onto my surface keep observing your still life as you place the paper shapes this will help to capture details of your composition apply a good coverage of glue onto your surface then place the paper down use your fingers to smooth out any little air bubbles at this stage you could head off in your own direction perhaps utilizing the color and pattern of the paper shapes in this session I 'm using a reduced palette based around the colors Australian Sienna and Australian yellow-green I will be using unbleached titanium white which is a creamier color for mixing tints and black to mix shades I 'm starting with the background i speeded this up a little bit I don 't paint this fast generally yeah just getting the background sort of in and around the objects are still quite a few layers to go you can deepen your color to start knocking in a few tones and shadows try to keep your brushstrokes loose and apply a thick texture of paint to your work I have let the painting dry a little and I 'm now using a brown Conte pencil to create a stronger structure in my shapes and composition observing the still life set up and refining the shapes in my painting allowed me to observe the tonal changes in each object one of the benefits of the process of tearing paper shapes while observing the objects is I 'm now really familiar with the shapes of each piece the next stage is to create three shades that I can use to record the tone changes in each object creating three shades of your color dark mid and light will allow you to work quickly applying simple tones as you see them as you work your way through the tones as you see them your stone identifying shadows and light in the objects and the spaces in between you may have noticed I 've little pop of color amongst all those arms soft tones [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] as I have started to knock in some shallows my still life study is beginning to have a depth of field separating the group of objects and allowing for their own space on the stage of the setting at this stage upon reflection I have made a decision to change the coffeepot lead to the same color as the pot I think having only one object in my still life in a color not in my reduced palette creates a more powerful composition not quite the beautiful simplicity of a Miranda still life however I was definitely influenced by Miranda 's artistic practice of observation and reflection thanks for watching _"

    "text": "good morning everyone hope you are all well my name is Kate for those who are joining me for the first time today we will be working through our yoga flow so we 're going to start with a little bit of pranayama pretty allah translate into breath so if you can finding any space on the floor if you have a match otherwise of course just the ground you might use a couple of cushions i 've got a block right now so I 've got a block ii if you have one or two blocks I would definitely suggest grabbing them you could also use a couple of thicker books what the blocks do is they help elevate the ground a little closer to the body so they help with certain postures and positions just to ensure that our alignment is correct we are also in Oprah Hamilton I can speak properly in our pranayama I do suggest you sitting either on your blog or maybe cut grabbing a couple of cushions off the lounge or pillows from your bed just to elevate the hips slightly open the of our tension so if we can be as open as possible through the hips we 're going to feel a sense a release of anxiety stress all those kind of things so you don 't have to be on your knees you can come into a cross-legged position you might have your legs out if you want to lay down on the floor for this first part of your practice you are more than I 'm going to take you through a variety of different levels and I want you to listen to your body now if you practice yoga before you 've probably heard many teachers tell you to listen to your body and basically what we want you to do there 's any point throughout the class if something doesn 't feel right that 's your body telling you that something isn 't right we 'll definitely feel a sense of slight discomfort a little bit of muscle burning but we should never feel any sharp joint pain so anytime throughout your class if you feel that make sure you modify the pose or the the flow you feel today and at any time throughout the class if you 're feeling like you need to have a rest you more than welcome to coming to your recovery position your Child 's Pose and then when you 're ready to join back in so let 's grab your cushion or your blocks whatever you have we 're going to place of underneath the hips we 'll finish our practice at the very end with a shavasana our meditation relaxation and let me tell you it is one of the most important parts of our practice so if you can hang around for that you will definitely think yourself at the end so let 's bring ourselves into our pranayama we 're going to slow the body down and prepare ourselves for the next 60 minutes of so I 'm going to come into a nice cross leg position I 've just placed the block underneath my sit bones just to elevate the body away from the earth slightly realign the spine so I want you to sit as tall as you possibly can I want you to allow settled here either placing the hands on the knees in the lap wherever it feels good for you I 'm going to ask you to close down your eyes so let the eyes soften the shoulders draw back and down and we 're going to come into a nice gentle in and out breath through the nose now I don 't want you to think too much about it in releasing the breath through the nose and you 're just going to maintain a nice city rhythm here with this breath I want you to decide to bring a little awareness into your body into the movement that the breath is creating your body that gentle expansion of the email and the softening and release of the exhale we keep the awareness of the breath and the movement is creating the body and we bring focus into that posture you might feel a little closed off and you might notice that the shoulders are slightly rounded forward but upper back is slightly hunched and you 're slightly tucked through your root chakra or through your pelvis again I want you tall sit proud we find energy from our sit bones Abunda muscles and deep pelvic floor muscles we pull them up towards our heart we feel a little bit of lift as we lift away from the sit bones the belly button draw is gently back towards the spine we start to create a sense of balance and strength through our midsection as we draw the rib cage gently in towards one another the shoulders soften down as we start to find more length through the spine we realign the skull over the neck with a gentle tug very slightly of the chin we reach up and out through the crown of the head just adding a little more length to the body the collar bones are drawn away from one another and we create that space you 're hot bro and then we bring ourselves back into our breath as we maintain this beautiful posture is higher to this strength we bring a little more length and a little more depth into our breath we start to send the breath deep into our belly and get this sensation of and then as he asks how you draw that belly back towards the spine the very base of that ribcage settles back heel in and the warmth of the breath exhale and surrenders through the nose right head on the belly so you can feel the lift of the belly as you breathe in and the releases and draw out and at anytime throughout the day if you start to feel a sense of anxiety or stress start to flow through the body allow yourself to slow down bring yourself into this deep belly breath unfortunately in today 's society we 've all become top breathers where we breathe into the upper part of our chest into muscles that weren 't designed to help us breathe efficiently and this causes that stress that anxiety in the body so all we need to do is slow down retrain the body to breathe properly just in your own time we 're going to draw the chin in towards the chest we want to find a little bit of leg through the back of the neck here so we 're just starting to not jamming the chin down into the chest just using a little bit of gravity here from the middle of the chest it 's a belly button we 're going to pull in the shoulders are going to start to round forward and I start to feel this beautiful release right through the back of the body and the chins going to draw a little deeper into the chest here as we search the middle of the spine back behind our mat the head drops just a little more we tuck that tail creating a beautiful C shape with the back of the body and I want you to take a nice deep breath in here is to take that inhale you 're going to exhale draw the body forward a gentle squeeze of the shoulder blades as we start to lift the chimney I gaze up we open through the front of the body and I want you to elongate through the abdominals open that chest we 're going to inhale roll so just coming into a little seated spine release and then exhale open two more just like in how to take those hands high overhead we exhale just let them float down the thumbs drawback behind the body we feel that opening through the chest one more time we inhale we 're going to exhale lace the hint behind the back send the knuckles down to the sit bones behind the body and really draw those shoulders back create that space right through the chest through the heart so to lift the thumbs away from the back opening through that shoulder and we 're going to think about drawing the right head across to the left ribcage so they 're going to come across rappers fart around press the palms together in a prayer like position laced fingers draw their shoulders back and down and then we 're going to take the left ear and settle it down onto the left shoulder we 're gonna keep that right hand so then I release the lasing of the figures keep the right hand wrapped around the ribcage up reset the head take the left hand straight up so if finding that height take a deep breath in and right you 're going to pull that right elbow back away from the body and we take the left hand down to the outside of the leg so just coming into a gentle spinal twist now if this is too much with this right hand release the right hand and place it on the floor behind you so it 's up and then we if you 're out breath you want to think about rotating through the waistline so not from the hips we 're gently bringing massaging out all those internal organs in the body and any movement we do we do with breath in half the height that 's how deep and into that rotation two more in and last one in we 're gonna take our time the left hand is going to draw back to the right palm we roll the shoulders back press the knuckles down open right up here see if you can lift the thumbs up and away from the back of the body and you can stay here you don 't have to go any further otherwise we 're gonna draw the from the hip as we bring ourselves forward so slowly coming in the crown of the head is gonna dip down just keep your sit bones connected to your block your mat or your cushion as we bring ourselves as far down as we can opening I 'm start to come back to this you folks I want you to take your eye gaze forward lengthen through the back of the body we 're gonna release the hand inhale come up exhale come down through to heart center beautiful and again in how come up now as we exhale we 're going to open that the right hand is going to thread underneath the left so we 're gonna wrap as far as we can keep the hands and then in how draw up as high as you can coming into a beautiful Eagle set up find that height that elbows gently press forward so we 're going to come up and the elbows move out breathe one more full breath in as we exhale we 're going to open nice and wide lace those hands behind send your knuckles the back of the body and then we 're gonna move through to the right side so we 're gonna pull the left hand across to the right press the palms together move as far around as you possibly can draw the shoulders back and down so are the body 's gonna be beautiful and open in just a moment then we 're gonna take that right yeah down onto the right shoulder for that beautiful length through the left side of the neck down the left shoulder into the arm just gonna release the bind of the fingers or the lace cup wrap that left hand around the waist resent to the head and we 're going to take that right arm up so fine height lift up nice and tall as you exhale we 're going to take a little rotation and you 'll notice the elbow moves away from the body so you create space here take that right hand down to the outside of the leg just to give yourself a little bit of leverage inhale lift up and then as you exhale start to draw from the hip we don 't want to offset those skips realign them keep strong through that root chakra or that cool and then really exhale pull the shoulders back and around two more full breaths in and laughs one in and out we 're going to take that right hand back

stay here otherwise that right arm comes down beautiful release into those hips they keeping strong through the body so we 're not collapsing anywhere we 're pulling up and out of the elbows shoulders

thigh we draw up reach that right hand reset top of the back toe under pick up the back knee and I want you to take your time to get yourself back into your downward facing dog lengthen if you need to

arms come around let the shoulders roll forward take breath yeah and in your own time we 're going to roll ourselves over onto our back we 're going to finish the last few moments in a shavasana just taking a little bit of a little bit of time out of our day to bring ourselves into a place of stillness a place of quiet as quiet as it can be if you 've got kids running around we 're gonna lay ourselves down now a couple of different positions if you have a block you 're more than welcome to sit answer not in the arch at the back just above the bum cheeks you can rest the block I like tucking the tail creating that connection with the back of the body you can keep the knees up feet move to the side the knees knock together if you have any lower back issues you might bring the feet together place pillows under the knees and take the knees out just to release into the hips even more otherwise are going to lengthen the legs toes roll away from the midline we draw the shoulders back and down and we take the arms down by outsides with our palms facing up we start to come back into the fullness of our breath that pranayama we began our practice with we take that deep inhale through the nose and we feel that gentle sensation of the very base of the ribcage over the belly lifts as we rise and way from the earth beneath us we hold the breath for just a moment and then as you exhale the belly button draws back to the spine the base of the ribcage exhale warmth the breath out through the notes and as we start to bring our focus back into the movement and the life that the breath creates in our body allow yourself to come into a place of complete stillness now I 'm not asking you to completely shut down mind that takes time and it takes practice but I am asking you to allow yourself to be still and allow yourself to be present in this moment bringing your awareness into your breath into the movement that the breath is creating in your body and as you start to come into a sense of relaxation you 'll feel that sense of calm float through the body you might find your mind to start to wander and that 's okay but if it does acknowledge where the mind went to place it on pause and bring yourself back into your breath we take this time to think about what we are grateful for the life of our breath the movement we just created with our bodies the strength and the mobility that we 've gained grateful for this lamprey with of relaxation sets of flood the body starts to feel weightless [Music] we have this deep connection with the earth beneath us [Music] and just allow yourself to surrender into a shavasana I am Samia manzara yoga 's advocate practice santosha translates into contentment always getting ready there is a Chinese proverb which states here tool in the West are always getting ready to live there is a remarkable truth to this proverb when we are little we can 't wait to get big when we are big we can 't wait to get out of the house then we can 't wait to get through school get a job then we can 't_''_3656.459 wait until our holidays and finally we can 't_''_3660.299 wait until our retirement as the Chinese proverb States we never really live we just get ready along with getting ready for the next thing we tend to look at other people 's lives and see what it 's missing in our own we look across the fence and we see what we don 't have rather than looking inside the fence and enjoying what we do into a place of lack Deborah Dell author writes a friend tells the story about how NPS one of her sisters was of her during the time my friend led wilderness adventure one day the sister decided to go on one of these trips on a particularly hard day she found herself sitting miserable on a beach it was cold and windy and her legs were extremely Sol she looked at my friend and calmly said I 'm not jealous of you anymore when we expect the well to meet our needs we turn outside of ourselves to find sustenance and completion we expect our partners to fulfill us our jobs to meet our needs and success to solve all of our problems and when it doesn 't we continue to play the if only game looking for that one more thing or we play the planning and regretting game we let our come we let our contentment be managed by all these uncontrollable things as long as we think satisfaction comes from an external source we can never truly be content because looking outward for fulfillment will always disappoint starting to bring yourself back into the fullness of your breath that gentle expansion of the inhale your softening release of the exhale start to reawaken our senses with a gentle wriggle of toes and fingers and as you come into your next deep breath still on your back I want you to inhale reach the hands overhead and as you exhale stretch your fingertips right down through to your toes find that length in the body then draw the knees one at a time into the chest give yourself a great big hug a gentle little squeeze and a rock side to side gentle massage of the muscles a little spine I 'm going to ask you just to fall to one side and just say that for just a moment we gathering your thoughts and in your time we bring ourselves up into a seated position let the shoulders draw back and down find length and height right through to the crown of the head we finished our practice with our last few deep breaths we inhale we exhale down through to heart center taking one more full bring santosha contentment into our lives we come to our third items namaste everyone thank you all so much for

    "text": "good morning everyone I hope we 're all well welcome to our Tuesday morning bar fitness class now we have done our previous bar fitness class it was completely equipment free so it was just ourselves in a chair however in today 's class we are going to use a set of hand weights now with these Henrichs really small so you don 't actually have to have hand weights if you don 't want

    "text": "everybody to this month 's local heritage talk and this month we 're going to have a look at some of the minerals that are found in the Shoalhaven and we might start off just by saying there 's gold in them there hills this golden a lot of hills around Australia actually gold in Australia was officially discovered on February the 15th 1823 at fish river located between Riedel and Bathurst then in 1839 Paul Edmond stress Leakey discovered small amounts of gold in silicate at the Vale of Khalid near Hartley and in 1841 Reverend W B Clark found gold on the Coxes River both locations on the road to Bathurst the finds were suppressed by the colonial government to avoid a likely dislocation of the relatively small community it was feared that the convicts and free settlers would leave their assigned work locations to rush to the new finds to seek their fortunes in particular damaging the new pastoral industry reportedly Governor George Gibbs said to Clark when he exhibited his gold put it away mr. Clark or we shall all have our throats cut these concerns and immediately people began to leave Australia for California to stem the exodus the New South Wales colonial government decided to alter its position and encouraged the search for payable gold in 18-49 the colonial government sought approval of the Colonial Office in England to allow the exploitation of the mineral resources of New South Wales a geologist was requested and this led to the appointment of Samuel such bury a reward was offered for the first person to find Payable gold the discovery of gold was the discovery that changed her nation 28 years after the fish River discovery a man named Edward Hargreaves discovered a grain of gold in a Billabong near Bathurst in 1851 the find was proclaimed on the 14th of May and within days the first Australian Gold Rush began with 100 diggers searching for their gold by June there were over 2,000 people digging around Bathurst and thousands more were on the way the Great Western Road to Bathurst became choked with men from all walks of life with all they could carry to live and mine the newspaper Bathurst Free Press reported on to have seized almost every member of the community there has been a universal rush to the diggings ten years after the start of the gold rush in 1851 the population of New South Wales had grown from 200,000 to 357 thousand people an increase of 78 percent early in the 1870s the shell havens main Goldfield opened up at yawol 25 kilometers west of Nara the field was situated at the junction of the Dan JIRA and Yarra Moonman creeks which joined the shall Haven River a few kilometres east of the junction of the Shoalhaven and kangaroo rivers the yawol strike was rather late on the scene but the possibilities of gold Isle had been recognized early on the ruggedness and inaccessibility of the country west of Berea discouraged European exploration and occupation until the early to mid 1830s it was in 1833 that the surveyor Frances residen surveyed the automa region north of pigeon-house Mountain and it is likely that Yael and Dan jira creeks were surveyed in this period too certainly in 1837 map of New South Wales by surveyor Robert Dixon depicts the two watercourses surveyed by this time the Commissioner of crown lands for the county of sink Benson a kmac I was struck by the similarity of the countryside to the Terron gold field near Bathurst and he tried around 1852 to interest some of the locals in the possibility the geologist WB Clark that 's him there with that nice bushy trendy beard recognized the possibilities of the yawol field and ported them in his southern goldfields paper I do not doubt that there is some gold to yet be found in the ravines and all along the broken country between the mouth of the Yael Creek and the head of the Mangala River Clarke also predicted that gold would be one but it from the hillsides but that it will require the processes of science for the extraction of the metal how true this proved to be the earliest recorded prospecting was carried out in 1870 mrs. J 's sieve right J break well and s Donovan worked alluvial deposits along the dandera just above its junction with the Yarra Moonman they had 107 meters of sluice boxes operating which were deterrent over the next 30 years some eight claims were worked with over by today 's values six point five million dollars worth of gold being extracted anyone could and still can go painting for alluvial gold found in the river banks in bed buried insults and Clay 's and light shales the precious metal has to be separated there are a variety of methods employed to achieve this the most common of these being the previously mentioned sluice and the cradle the alluvial or is shoveled onto the Machine and the Clay 's etc are dispersed with water a last small separation is achieved by panning when diggers collect a gold that was too fine to pan they would use a method called tinning this involved rubbing mercury in their pans to trap the gold the digger then placed his pan in the fire to melt the resulting amalgam which would then be placed in a hollowed-out potato wired together and thrown into the fire the spud would be cooked until it was black on the outside at this point the mercury was absorbed by the potato leaving the which has to be crushed to release the gold caught in the seams after crushing the all goes through a screen with the assistance of water and runs over a flat area that is treated with firstly copper sheet cyanide paste and then mercury mercury has a chemical affinity with gold silver and other metals as the process door runs over this area the gold attaches itself to the mercury with the rest of the oil passing through the tailings dump eventually the cyanide mercury and gold are scraped up and placed in a retort where the mixture is heated until the cyanide and mercury evaporate off and a recycled leaving the gold behind the cyanide paste acts as a buffer so that the scrapings of copper do not contaminate the separated gold the extraction is a dirty process often doing environmental damage and causing lung damage and deafness to the workers as well as the dangers of mercury and cyanide poisoning so you really have to want that gold and they did two years after John Henry sieve Wright first found alluvial gold in danjiri Creek he achieved hard-won this prompted others to search and in 1872 Methos eldest and cuddle discovered gold in surface stone on what would become the pioneer claim by 1873 various parties had taken out mining leases to a total of 69 acres in the owl area among them were the homeward bound eclipse golden crown golden quarry Poorman star Caledonian and saw pitt gully claims a mixture thereof were who we 're going to strike it rich and I really don 't know why I 'm doing this from the outset a number of interrelated factors including a slowness to understand the character of the local or burying body Urals inaccessibility insufficient development capital and a lack of mining expertise hampered the productivity of the yawol field it became clear in a very early stage that the quality of the yahwah or bearing stone was quite variable it was to be many years before the yawol miners fully understood this and appreciated its implications indeed towards the end of the goldfields life many mines were being open cut to access the gold-bearing quartz access to yahwah depended on negotiation of the bush tract extremely rough track the descent from the gap into yahwah was so steep that Teamsters bringing Bullock wagons into the valley were forced at one section to lower the wagons down on ropes the shale Haven news of June the 14th 1873 reported the route to yawol is anything but a pleasant one over sandstone ridges and alongside links over rotten patches of ground where a horse may be at any time bobbed without a moment 's notice at last the gap is reached a cleft in the sandstone mountain and to reach the valley a precipitous Hill has to be descended actually the narrow road wound down the side of the mountain with no safety fences until it reached a ridge down which it was taken with steep drops and dense tall timber on either side until the floor of the valley was reached the gap could not be avoided three routes to the goldfields had been considered from Nara and Tarara but all ended at the gap deviation of the gap was again considered in 1899 but considered too costly to construct while the tractor yaw will made 's operating in the area in the early days was so undercapitalized that they could not afford in any case to purchase proper equipment this shortage of capital was a direct consequence of the character of the field in its early years typically the lease holders were local shall Haven residents most of them farmers for them mining was the secondary activity to be undertaken as they wished or were able between 1882 and 1900 the homeward bound mine produced 24,000 ounces of gold mining continued at a number of other sites but workings declined after 1900 finally being abandoned in 1938 Michele Haven also has its gold legends in this case Billy blue Billie had been seen in towns from nary Goethe Wollongong but most of the stories Centre on his visits Tudor era to exchange his gold for supplies while there are no official records to be found there are ample references to Billy and his gold in contemporary newspapers as recently as 2018 the south coast register featured a story about Billy blue Billy blue is a 19th century legendary character from the shell Haven an indigenous of his tribe on the Marulan side of the Shoalhaven River he made trips to Tarara and paid his way with nuggets or gold the source of which created much interest the name of Billy blue is a mystery as it does not appear in official documents such as a census of muster some indigenous people adopted the names of the Europeans they worked for and it is possible Billy blue took the name of a character who lived in the rocks up until his death in 1834 according to the article written by Bill Morton for the south coast registers back to Shoalhaven week in 1926 the Billy blue of the district was known to now as first mare Henry moss well before he became involved in local government moss during the 1850s explored many parts of the district and had an interest in geology Moss is said to have had the confidence of blue and there was the perception in the community that he knew the location of the gold sauce there are other suggestions with one record stating in the course of his wanderings along with shell the river was low he stored his findings in a pickle bottle and carried the gold either to Marulan or Nara Alf dare a subtler and Bushman with an interest in history a little later wrote about the legend in articles for the show Aven and narrow news that was published in four issues in 1939 as a young man living in Canberra his neighbor Charlie Moffat had a fascination for Billy blues reef and so engaged a clairvoyant Madame Wallace to help him find it she asserted that blue used to get his gold over the cliff in a wet marshy place and gave various other clues to satisfy Moffitt 's enquiring mind with this knowledge Moffat with Jim Flannery Errol lumsden Jim and Alf dare went on several expeditions to search for the reef taking with them provisions on their pack horses on one trip Alf found evidence of tomahawk marks on the tree of the type that Madame Wallace had mentioned would lead to the reef however the prutte search proved fruitless many years later Alf shared a campfire on the Jervis Bay Road with a man and gleaned 450 pounds worth of gold from it whether the story is true is anyone 's guess for many people know that gold was discovered in mind at Yahoo may come as a surprise however to learn that during nineteen hundred and four silver copper tin lead and zinc ores were discovered at toll one on the west east western edge of Morton National Park and toll one mining company was active there until its liquidation in 1912 the toll on copper tin arsenic deposits were discovered by our four mentioned friend John sieve right as he exposed outcrops in the eastern tributary of the Shoalhaven Gorge being narrow rich loads these deposits represented the style of mineralization favourable for the low capital labor-intensive type of copper tin mining of the early part of the 20th century in 1907 the toll Wong mineral company was formed to exploit the deposits for arsenic copper and tin between 1907 and 1909 the main toll Wang lode was explored and opened up by numerous small workings underlay shafts and several interconnected tunnels in a report to the directors of the company in the deposit and its future he concluded the property as it now stands is a highly payable one from which heavy dividends can be expected but the possibilities are so great that I would hardly care to venture an opinion as to the future developments I can only say that I have never inspected or seen a property that shows such great promise that 's what they were getting excited about I don 't know difficulties with the steep terrain were overcome by using two aerial tram ways one from the top of the shoal Haven gorge to a treatment plant 520 meters below on the opposite side of the river and a second design to transport oil from the mines high up the tributary toll Wong Gorge to the plant all production commenced in 1910 and at this stage the average number of men employed at the site was 60 the miners were working three shifts a day and a small tent settlement was established around the works production from the Taiwan mines continued spur until June 1912 when the toll Wong mineral company went into liquidation since then mid-1960s and the Broken Hill proprietary company in 1971 aka bhp have assessed the prospective ti of the toll wang loads and surrounding area the size and style of the known mineralization have been considered unsuitable for large-scale modern mining thank goodness this opinion would also appear to run true for other mineral deposits found in the area during nineteen hundred and seven loads of zinc copper tin lead and arsenic sulfides were discovered in Jones Creek Gorge along with a deposit of silver or the silver deposit was worked to some extent but was said to be a complex or very difficult to treat under then existing methods this led to the establishment of the Etra mines which extracted but did not treat the various ores between 1908 and 1914 the ore of a complex character and situated in such an inaccessible location did not lead to the expected development of the area although Jones Creek gorge was excluded from the gazette all of the Morton National Park finally for today mining for silica seems to have begun at Flint point around 1917 the rock being broken up manually bold silica firebrick company at Newcastle when the easiest one material was worked out operations were transferred to other sites and loading for shipment was made from a jetty constructed on the north side of Bannister 's point reached by a railway running on hardwood rails after mining began at Patti Moore 's Lagoon the railway was continued over the narrow Walley Inlet and then for another five kilometres just short of the lake controller settlement it 's believed at least three locomotives were used at different times the Bannister 's point location had stories facilities a crusher and various workshops it remained in use until 1943 when operations were transferred to redhead where the loading facilities have been constructed in 1924 this continued until 1947 when one crusher was removed to Yatta Yatta and the oil transported by Road both loading jetties were demolished later because the structures had become dangerous that at Bannister 's point in 1961 and the redhead jetty in 1968 mining continued until 1975 when the pattern more quarry was considered worked out gold mining in the shale Haven was intense but short-lived with the 1900s two events brought mining to a halt at yawol in the late 1930s the first was a devastating bushfire that ripped through the valley and what was left of the town on Black Saturday 14th of January 1939 the second event that put paid to mining was the outbreak of World War two in September 1939 great numbers of men left their civilian occupations to enlist in the services there was little labour available and not much incentive either to continue mining operations at yawa mining of minerals further west was never a success due to the low economic yields and the insurmountable terrain finally the shale Haven Shire Council finished construction of the danjiri dam which flooded most of the former town site and lower mines in 1972 oops I missed uh some slides that 's red head we 've got a huge collection of photos from red head that we got donated about five years ago which is great that 's the railway and now we 'll go back to where we were so yes we constructed a dam that flooded most of the former town site settlement now are the graveyard and mine workings in the surrounding area some mine shafts and other diggings the graveyard and a stamping battery can still be seen of the 35 or so mine workings accessible by foot or canoe some are safe enough for a young child to walk and climb through whilst others are extremely dangerous if in doubt don 't enter the main mine workings are about 15 minutes walk from the carpark and can entertain the whole the entire day now I referred to an earlier count of Billy blues reef it 's quite interesting so I 'm going to finish off by reading that to you the lure of Shoalhaven Gold the true story of Billy blues reef and this is written by a tame journalist I don 't know what a wild journalist looks like but this guy 's a tame journalist the story of Billy blues reef is an epic story of an Eldorado that never existed the talc of an outcrop of pure gold alleged to exist somewhere in the gorges of the Shoalhaven has been told the world over the writer by vivvy vivvy yak fires beneath the shadows of the Sphinx and in the forecastle during the watch below the whole matter is easier explanation Billy blue was just the ordinary monkey cunning Aboriginal please bear in mind this was written back in 1939 and in the course of his wanderings along the shil haven he occasionally obtained fair specimens from potholes when the river was low he stored his findings in a pickle bottle and the whites did the rest creating an El Dorado that was not when the truth of the situation dawn on blue he naturally enough assumed an air of solid mystery accepting meanwhile all the libations of rum and contributions of cash that were lavished on him all in the vain hope that he would disclose the whereabouts of the reef for liquid and monetary consideration Billy would consent to leave annex lead an expedition such an expedition would set out in good order only to find that friend Billy was missing from the first night 's camp theories were advanced from time to time only to be exploded when put into practice a blaze of blazed trees spelled near success that ended in dreary failure the appearance of Billy at marelul and on one occasion dripping with water gave rise to the conclusion that he 's fine could only be reached by means of a swim underwater to a mysterious cavern diving suits and subterranean exploration then became the order of the day none realized more than Billy that the true meaning of the old adage silent is golden to him it was more golden than gold he wanted for nothing that a gold fever victim could supply him with and there were many the late Henry Moss of Nara a geologist and Explorer of some attainments had the confidence of blue and knew that he had nothing to tell off save his own duplicity vainly mr. Moss strove to delusion be seekers of the reef but usually only succeeded in convincing them that he knew of the location and was endeavouring to put them off the scent down the years gold hunters called in at the old Inn and demanded the secret from the relatives of the late mr. and mrs. moss and the reef it is safe to say that somewhere in the Hills today weather shall Haven winds its way there are lonely hunters diligently searching patiently hoping to find the lost El Dorado of Billy blue and that search will be carried on whilst ever red blood runs in Australian veins so if you 're a hardy out store doors man or woman and gold fever has bitten you may yet strike it lucky Billy 's reef if it did exist was probably located in one of the eastern shell Haven River gullies upstream from Fordham Canyon good luck you _"

    "text": "good afternoon and welcome to this month 's local heritage Talk my name is darlin and I 'm the local heritage librarian at Shoalhaven libraries this month I thought we 'd take a look at wine moonshine and a little of the history of some of the hotels in the Shoalhaven region I hope you enjoy in 1869 Marcus Clark said of Australians they are not a nation of snobs like the English or of extravagant posters like the Americans or of reckless profligate slike the French they are simply a nation of drunkards at the time Clark 's observation was understandable during Australia 's penal era rum had been used as a currency and it is believed that the colonies inhabitants drank more alcohol per capita than in any other time in human history this month 's talk takes us from one end of the spectrum to the other from wine to moonshine we will also look at the history of shell havens hotels and their publicans it is believed that the first grapes on the south coast of New South Wales were grown on the foothills of Cullen was not the only estate owner to invest in the good drop an article published in the South Coast Register on December the 13th 2014 reports that the de Mestre family conducted the terreiro estate east of Nara from the 1840s and while Etienne became a notable horse race trainer his brother Andre established a successful vineyard the vineyard Golf Links in this vicinity have taken the name in the area that in the de Mestral day was known either as boring or wara wara displayed floods and droughts in this era by the early 1860s he was enjoying success with his crop specific details were revealed in February 1886 when the Shoalhaven telegraph reported on a section of vineyard that had been down for six years there are about three acres under Isabella and Shiraz grape they 're being about 2,000 vines they cannot be less than five or six tons of grapes on the three acres as each vine we feel sure averages over five pound by 1891 Herrmann Conrad II Javie vineyard and he continued the tradition advertising grapes now ripe splendid samples for sale visitors supplied same as in de Mestral time when he put the 235 acre property on the market the following year there were 10 acres of vineyard with six in full production and an orchard of 300 trees Fred Morrison was the new owner of the warawara vineyard and he completed with honors a winemaking course at Sydney Technical College with the assistance of a Sydney nurserymen he remodeled the vineyard and improved his methods at harvest time the grounds were opened free of charge and visitors were able to purchase grapes in any quantity by the turn of the century Morrison had stepped up the marketing of his product and the Telegraph editor enjoyed a hamper of his number one wine for Christmas 1900 a sequester a sin the desert with the vineyard occupying 4 acres and the 800 tree orchard of many fruit types the Isabella grape was still favored and the 700 gallons of wine produced during the year were valued at 350 pound described as having a rich flavor in bouquet the wine was absolutely pure but because of the demand Morrison was not able to keep stock opened a wine depot and refreshment rooms in Junction Street in error it was noted in the Telegraph that his celebrated wara wara wine pure juice of the grape could be purchased for threatened sir glass all by the bottle for 1 3 2 6 later in the decade the property was taken over by Edward big B who dispensed with the grapes and grew potatoes in addition with his variety of fruits how ironic that after a lapse of 100 years the shale Haven now hosts a number of vineyards and wineries and possibly the first vineyard now reestablished a cool and Gator estate rotgut white lightning bathtub gin pop skull Panthers breath corn Lacroix or just plain shine it has many names but a couple of things are always true about moonshine It 's Made in secret and it 's illegal moonshine is any kind of alcohol though usually whiskey or rum that is made in secret to avoid taxes or outright bans on alcoholic drinks the term moonshine comes from Britain where it originally was a verb moonshining that referred to any job or activity that was still had to conduct their business out of sight of legal authorities these backwoods brews masters became known as moonshiners and the term became exclusively theirs and the place to go to find moonshine in the Shoalhaven just as we did last month it 's time to head for the hills this time the mountain ridge between berry and the southern highlands around Robertson for some time past the customs authorities have had a suspicion that an illicit still has been erected in the vicinity of the Kangaroo Valley on Thursday one of the officers visited the district and from the inquiries he made he decided to make an arrest the man was taken to now a police court and reminded until Friday he officer again visited the district on Saturday and yesterday found a complete still in a gully between berry and kangaroo Valley but still which was of an elaborate character appeared to have been in use for some time a number of casks were also found in the vicinity this brief report taken from The Sydney Morning Herald is dated Monday March the 16th 1903 it was media of the day to moonshine in the valley this illustration accompanies an article published in The Australian Town Country journal on Saturday November the 11th 1882 titled southern pencil inks the article reads the berry estate I have stated that Broughton village is almost entirely shut in by Rangers these the principle of which are known as the Kangaroo Valley and camber wara Rangers being in reality a continuation of the Saddleback or coast range are now eclis settled by the free selector under whose acts they are fast changing their appearance space will not allow my recounting an excursion made up in these ranges in company with mr. James Wilson of Broughton village who owns one or two thousand acres of the most elevated land there neither can i for the same reason enlarge upon the coal seams the Magnificent McFarland waterfall several hundred feet in height the wonderful Springs of crystal water with their beds of watercress which I saw nor of the difficulty we experienced here in finding our way through the scrub jaw relic of bygone days namely the remains of an illicit still by to honour and a name there had already been settlers in the district for 60 years given the isolation of the area it is probably no surprise that some more surprising individuals took the production of liquid comfort into their own hands still as the country opened up I suspect the inaccessibility of the area became a positive rather than a negative for reports appeared in various newspapers toward the end of August 1892 mentioning bruger 's Creek as a hot spot for distillation whilst only one still was discovered the police felt that other stills exist in the locality and oh dear the man found guilty of being in possession of an illicit still and fined 100 pounds hmm let 's just say it is a family name I am familiar with that was just the tip of the iceberg though 21 reports appeared in the newspapers between December 27th 1895 and January 11th 1896 most in local or sydney editions but some as far afield as Port Macquarie Lismore and Aubrey events appeared to quieten down after this for seven or so years and then during 1903 production a two-page report may be read in the Shoalhaven news and South Coast districts advertiser describing the illicit still case what Amala whiskey it reads the transcript of the court proceedings and some familiar names are included such as mr. Marriott one of two legal representatives for the accused and a witness by the name of Henry Russell a commercial real estate agent residing at kangaroo valley that familiar family name I mentioned earlier hmm lessee of a neighboring property the accused was found guilty and counsel for the prosecution mr. Darcy Irvine then asked that a substantial penalty be imposed in order to act as a deterrent as he was informed the illicit still at distillation was not uncommon in this district and the revenue was in consequence being greatly defrauded with regard to excise duty as well as licenses perhaps the deterrent worked it is 20 years before bootleggers are mentioned again illicit stills on south coast discovery of waverly sydney of one of the most elaborate illicit stills ever found in New South Wales is proof that the days of moonshine whiskey making her far from dead of mountain Jew is carried out extensively in various parts of New South Wales particularly on the south coast along the mountainside near borough Wong and along the torturous trail of the Kangaroo River near baragas Creek and mahjongg whiskey rum and what is called honey beer a brew deliciously as often as is necessary to satisfy the requirements of local residents who Bork at the 15 to 20 miles trip from their homes to the authorized rendezvous for a nip a few months ago a rabbit er was located a spot where one of these Mountain stills had been working and found a five gallon keg of white whiskey on a ledge of rock where it had been placed to maturer needless to say there were no bunnies trapped around there until the rabbit er had felt the last drop of mountain jus trickled down his swallow hotels in the shale Haven were numerous as most villagers though not all had at least one establishment what follows is a sample and most of them are still trading today the kangaroo in was one of the first two buildings when berry a man by the name of John Howard would be the first licensee seven licenses later the hotel was being managed by Jonathan Goldsmith Lambert it was he who decided to change the name of the hotel to that of the commercial hotel it must have been a wise decision as mr. Lambert was publican there for over eleven years a number of interesting stories may be told of the hotel including the following robbery at the berry commercial hotel a rather daring robbery was perpetrated at the commercial hotel berry on Wednesday night at about 20 somebody after two attempts lifted up the window of one of the bedrooms at the back of the hotel occupied by mrs. Robinson of Kangaroo Valley and her daughter he thrust in his head and seized a handbag belonging to mrs. Robinson containing a silver watch gold chain a pair of elastic-sided boots and mrs. Robinson 's marriage certificate when she saw the intruder mrs. Robinson exclaimed how dare you open the window and come in like that he replied shut your mouth he speedily got over the fence and he camped name occurred on Tuesday November the 12th 1935 the commercial hotel became the hotel berry the name under which it is still trading today another commercial hotel was also operating in the district on the other side of the mountains to Barry this was kangaroo valleys second hotel located across the road from the first rather convenient for a rather brief pub crawl the hotel opened during 1892 and was designed for a well-known architect Cyril Blackett it comes as no surprise that work as a publican may be dangerous however did you know that one of the hazards might be opening a bottle of lemonade while fulfilling her duties mrs. Dickens suffered a painful injury while opening a bottle of lemonade which burst and severely cut three fingers on her left hand causing her to faint she was not the only she 'll Haven publican to have that experience it was during 1948 that the licensing court granted permission to change the hotel 's name to the friendly in a mein the name the hotel is still trading under today one hotel that is no longer trading is the are no longer any of the old hotels in the main street of Nara especially a hotel as grand as the Prince of Wales built during 1883 a representative of the Shoalhaven Telegraph described the hotel as a colossal structure presenting quite an imposing figure given the following description I think it might just have been on a rubble stone foundation and roofed with corrugated iron the stud and weatherboard building has its main frontage of 76 feet 23 meters to Junction Street with the bar being in the angle between two thoroughfares highlight of the main hall was a beautifully paneled of Gothic door flanked by stained-glass lights into this beautifully crafted building then arrived a most unusual guest many of us have heard the phrase bull in a china shop this is a story with a novel twist from the Braidwood dispatch and mining journal January the 10th 1930 Fort Lee after breakfast on New Year 's Day guests at the Prince of Wales Hotel Nara received quite a shock when a man leading a ball calmly passed through the luxuriously appointed lounge into the hotel yard some eyes and wondered if they were dreaming the majority however made a hasty retreat while the man went to look for the bar he tethered the ball to a post but during his absence hotel attendants ejected the Beast from the premises I remember not the building but I guess the smell of the beer drunk in the building sent it as I passed by with my parents or grandparents I also remember turning away hotel patrons as they began their pub crawl wandering into the newly-opened best and less on a Thursday evening from the last remaining Junction Street hotel opposite another magnificent structure the building we know today as the husky pub was constructed during 1929 Allen Clark 's book early years of narrow district pubs contains a detailed description written up in the narrow a leader of the Jervis Bay Hotel upon its completion prior to 1929 another hotel stood upon the site and had done so since 1895 when George Dent became owner and licensee juris at Huskisson and nothing new and George Dent which to take advantage of the day trippers by offering a chance venture with reports of 400 visitors to Jervis Bay on New Year 's Day 1898 and 102 guests at the hotel itself at one point during 1921 when further a guests arrived that day nearby cottages were rented to cater for the numbers it would appear that the popularity of Jervis Bay and its white sands has never diminished a hotel at Tama wrong may have the honor of being the first in our district named the Travelers Rest it was located on the northeastern corner of the Nara to Ala dala Road and the self Huskisson Road now known as Hawken road and pine forest road the hotel was opened by John Parnell on the 1st of April 1857 the positioning on the road between Nara and Ala dalla and at the only Junction to access Jervis Bay met Tom wrong became a focal point for travelers heading north and south the Travelers Rest provided just that a stopping point at which to stretch one 's legs and take some refreshment granted a liquor license in 1858 John Parnell was also granted a license to sell liquor at the a hotel was opened Thomas Mooney became the licensee in 1890 after John Parnell retired at the age of 87 years but the building itself was starting to fall into disrepair and despite the assurances from the owner and the current licensee to rebuild the hotel after an inspection by the licensing board and a scathing report on the hotel 's condition the decision of the board was to not renew the lease after 33 years of operation the hotel was closed the hotel was eventually rebuilt and reopened in 1898 as the commercial hotel despite staunch opposition from locals and other hotel owners at wand and ian 's there was a majority of the licensing board bench in favor of the application which was accordingly granted the hotel operated until its final closure in June 1911 the original single-level timber slab style hotel was built in 1860 by Edward teittleman an idea of the fragility of the building may be gained by the following report published in the ulla dollar in Milton Times on Saturday October the 7th 1893 narrow escape of the star hotel late on Monday night hotel was discovered to be on fire fortunately the fire had not obtained a good hold and the prompt issue displayed were several persons who providentially happened to be on the spot prevented what would otherwise have been a terrible conflagration resulting in considerable loss of property the hotel is an old building of wood the inside walls are lined with canvas and papered and it can be imagined how it would burn if it got a fair start the fire when discovered must have only started but the flames spread from the floor to the ceiling burning the window-curtain damaging a couch and picture cracking the glass in the window and burning a portion of the flooring the damage done was not heavy but it was a remark we narrow escape from entire demolition of the building and adjoining block of wooden structures the circumstances of the fire were of such a character as to induce the coroner dr. Ryan to hold an inquiry details of this inquiry are reported in the continuation of the article a piece that takes up two-thirds of the front page a second-story addition by Tom cork apparently a renowned teetotaler and his wife Louise during their ownership between 1906 and 1924 starting in 1924 the facade of the star hotel had been very much altered with an extension at its southern end windows bricked in the removal of the balcony and veranda and addition of a cantilever awning and only in the past year or so has the star hotel undergone once more a major innovation ensuring its service for another generation the Marlin hotel at ala dalla is a relative late comer but this is not to say that a la jolla had no public houses prior to this Kathy Dunn 's book Marlin tales a history of hotels in Oh Lord Allah makes mention of the George Inn Royal Hotel and Harbor View Hotel still there was a dry period through the 1920s 30s and 40s then a gentleman by the name of les Pittman made a bold move building owning and managing the Marlin hotel from 1948 yet another magnificent structure the building showed many features of the post-war period it has been suggested that it 's stained glass windows Two just over and building materials in short supply the Marlin hotel was considered luxurious premesis furnished on a most sumptuous scale and representing the last word holidaymakers there was hot and cold water in all bedrooms two dining rooms and provision for up to 125 guests for just over 25 years from 1950 the hotel was owned by Ann set and its subsidiary company pioneer Taurus and pioneer Hotels tourism was big business and the Marlin hotel provided the best the dining room was silver service catering for travelers making their way between Melbourne and Sydney the same standards were observed as for Ann sets first-class hotels in the capital cities it sounds like a far cry from the Marlin hotel of the 1970s and 80s when the Marlin hotel was a top spot for popular music acts and developed a rather rougher reputation regardless the motor Milan hotel as with so many others remains true to the role of a public house a place where the community gathers stories are told reputations made and broken join us again next month when we will be visiting a handful of the historic houses situated in the Shoalhaven _"

    "text": "hi there this is the owner from shell Haven regional gallery today we 're going to spend a bit of time in my studio and have a look at a surface to work on and this surface today is plywood I like working with plywood it 's inexpensive and also readily available at your hardware shops the top piece here is from a plank of wood you 'll notice the curves and the other two are different depths of plywood the basic rule more layers equals a stronger surface something to consider if your project is large colored pencils are a great medium to use with plywood as you 're working you 'll find that the surface really grabs hold of the medium and it leaves a really beautiful transparency through to the wood grain the main difference you 'll find when working with watercolor or gouache is that what a color it 's very transparent and gouache is opaque both mediums are almost identical in makeup pigment and water-soluble binder gouache has a white pigment called chalk added which makes it less transparent than watercolors working with ink on and once that 's dry you 'll be able to add detail and shadow using waterproof or felt-tip pens plywood is quite soft and lends itself well to carving it is important to consider selling your plywood on both surfaces front and back this helps to avoid warping I applied a couple of coats of gesso after sailing the apply to this work this created a smoother surface to work on I loved working on ply with oils it felt like the board pushed back I was able to use stronger and looser brushstrokes I find plywood a really versatile surface there is a couple of things you need to think about before you use it one of the things is if you 're going to use a medium on it which is quite wish you 've got to be a little bit cautious about how thick your own pliers because it very easily can walk especially if you 're having a watery base to it because that will break down the binder that glues all the pieces of wood together now I 'm going to show you now how love about working on plywood is the way that some of these grains and things capture the pigment that you 're working with and it 's really nice to fall into that zone where you 're actually responding to the surface rather than trying to control it okay you can see I 've started to add some paint some watercolor with the touch of white gouache at the moment all I 'm doing is just picking little areas where I can see changes in the tone of the wood and applying my water color now because I haven 't sealed it it 's sucking in very quickly and it will dry a little bit softer bearing in mind I don 't want to add too much water so I 'm trying to work a little bit more with the pigment of the watercolor paint rather than relying on the water if you 're using paper you sort of tend to do the lighter wash it and then build up one day at my studio I just picked up a piece of ply and then I had lying around and started of it and I found it really liked it because the the surface takes the medium very quickly and it 's a little bit in charge but once it slowed down into your layers and brushstrokes you start to respond to your surface rather than trying to control it [Music] a quick study of an expressive landscape informed entirely by the surface I was working on I hope you enjoy exploring plywood thanks for watching [Music] you _"

    "text": "[Music] [Music] hi everybody it 's sue here and welcome to a bit of a different rhyme time at the narrow library today before we start all our singing and dancing and songs together i thought that i 'd take a few minutes to talk to the grown-ups and just to give you guys a big pat on the back and a thank you for taking the time to be part of rhyme time and story time and exposing your children to music rhymes and books today our runtime is all about classic old nursery rhymes and when i say old i really mean old the most recent song we 're going to do today is old macdonald had a farm and it is just over 100 years old the oldest song we 're going to sing is barbara black sheep it dates back to 1730 and that means that it is almost 300 years old and it 's got its roots in paying taxes to the master so that 's something that we can still relate to on one level today so besides the fact that nursery rhymes are them over and over and over and over again why would we bother with these old-fashioned rhymes based on pseudo-history for instance was ring-a-ring or rosie 's really written about a pandemic perhaps probably not but you never know why bother with songs that don 't even make much sense in today 's society and often without some tweaking they may not even be politically correct i mean we 've got some great kids songs around now but i would like to be a fly on the wall in the future if somebody was trying to decode the deep meaning behind songs like hot potato hot potato we all know frogs go la de da de da da da i mean do they really i wonder what a david attenborough of the future will make of those lyrics so old nursery rhymes should we bother well here are some well researched reasons why i think we should repetition and rhyme is good for your child 's brain development practicing language and speech and building up their memory capabilities nursery rhymes also expose children to an enriched vocabulary another old favorite crown tumbling trot caper and even some first aid advice for head injuries that you can mend with vinegar around brown paper which they used to apparently actually do phonemic skill development from the humble nursery rhyme has been shown to significantly help children in reading and spelling and as a primary school teacher myself i 've seen firsthand how being able to distinguish sounds and rhymes really helps children with their reading and writing nursery rhymes promote listening skills and expand your child 's imagination they listen to the pitch or the volume of the words and they act them out if you 're going on a bear hunt i 'm not scared what a beautiful day oh oh lots of imagination and acting happening there lots of nursery rhymes involve maths vocabulary and counting sequences forwards and backwards one of the songs we 're going to do today is five little monkeys jumping on the bed nursery rhymes also contribute to social development songs like here we go around the mulberry bush from 1850 is all about getting dressed and personal hygiene nursery rhymes are a connection to easily with their 90 year old great-grandparents it 's perhaps this social aspect of being together to sing and dance and play that i think i love the most so we 're going to start our rhyme time now with here we go around the mobby bush here we go around the mob we push the mulberry bush the mulberry bush here we go around the mulberry bush on a cold and frosty morning so first we might wash our hands very important that we wash our hands isn 't it everybody this is the way we wash our hands wash our hands wash our hands this is the way we wash our hands on a cold and frosty morning what about brushing your hair you 've got a brush or a comb this is the way we brush our hair brush our hair brush our hair this is the way we brush our hair on a cold and frosty morning maybe we should clean our teeth get your toothbrush out squeeze some toothpaste on ready this is the way we brush our teeth brush your teeth brush our teeth cold and frosty morning maybe you 'd like to give your mummys a big hug you ready this is the way we hug our mummies mummies this is the way we hug their mummies on a cold and frosty morning well it might get cold and frosty soon but still it 's pretty sunny so that 's lovely now the next songs we 're going to do are examples of rhyme and alliteration we 've got humpty dumpty we 've got wee willy winky hickory dickory dock and hey devil diddle so let 's see if we can have a look at some of these ones the first one we 're going to do is humpty dumpty it 's from england from 1803 so we 'll be seeing humpty dumpty together you might be on your mom 's lap for that one oh look it 's humpty sitting on his wall [Music] humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty oh dear all the king 's horses and all the king 's men couldn 't put humpty together again [Music] humpty dumpty oh no all the king 's horses and all we 're going to do is we willy winky it 's from scotland from 1841 it 's the wii and it was translated from squats into english but lots of these songs that have moved around so we willy winky that 's like this wee willy winky runs

through the town upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown tapping at the windows crying through the locks are the children in their beds it 's past eight o 'clock i wonder what time your bedtime is the next one that we 're going to do is hickory dickory dock it 's from about 1744 i might need some help from my friend little mouse for this one sorry ready for hickory dickory dock i think you know

    "text": "[Music] and another one please not the chocolate what I 'm after is the team fool because this stuff can be recycled obviously that 's too small if you put it in the recycle bin at that size it just gets lost account for your song what you need to do is add it to any more tin foil you 've got hanging around the house what you do is scrunch it into a ball and keep adding to it so the more riester easily the bigger the ball gets because when it 's about the size of a tennis ball it actually goes through the recital system and get magnetized and putting the right thing so my challenge to you is see how many eggs you can make and how big a ball you can get bigger the better as long as it fits in the recycle bin happy easter everyone [Music] [Music] _"

    "text": "everybody my name is Geralyn and I 'm the local heritage librarian here at Shoalhaven libraries today I thought we 'd do a little talk about researching your military ancestors let 's enjoy welcome to this month 's family history talk we 're coming up to Anzac Day it 's going to be a very different Anzac Day this year of course but we 're still going to be able to have a look at our families have a look at whether we have any uncles aunts grandmas grandpas who served in the military being a military area with HMAS albatross and HMAS Creswell we do have a lot of military in the area and I 'm going to take us through some resources give you some ideas as to how you might be able to find family members military records and what 's the best place to start when you 're looking for Australian military records there 's actually two places the best place to start is the Australian War Memorial which other unfortunately keeps updating its website every time I go in I have to redo this PowerPoint but the information stays the same there 's a number of options there 's a number of ways you can get to the records that you 're after best way this is our front page the best way is to go to collection and if we click on collection then it will give us some options such as understanding our collection and once you get to that point then it 's right there in front of you researching a person and that will give you some great step-by-step ideas as to how to go about this search researching a person so that 's one option your other option because there are many roads to get to the same point in other world war memorials website the other option is you 've scrolled all the way down your front page you 've got some options across the bottom one of which is explore the collection and that takes you right into the nitty-gritty and the meat of what you 're after military events military units places that campaigns made have occurred people people themselves articles about said campaigns and last but page to do your standard keyword search I 'm going to focus on a gentleman by the name of Walter host he was a local and he fought in World War one so I 'm just going to pop his name in there it 's as simple as that two words two names first name let 's see what we come up with what we come up with is eleven matches two people records two matches to place records so hopefully that will give you a hint that you 've got the right person I can look at that myself and go yes he did come from justice brush and yes he did fight in France so I 'm fairly confident I 'm on the right track there got a little bit deeper and we can narrow the down the search a little bit more we can narrow it down do we want records when he was a sergeant records when he was a lieutenant we know he fought in World War one we 've already looked at the places we 've got some information there such as yes he when you go searching for soldiers it 's a unique number to that person so nobody else has or ever will be service number 702 it 's given us his unit and there 's probably some more information there too if we keep scrolling down as I said we can just keep going deeper and deeper as we go into the layers in this case this records going to lead us through to world war embarkation roles so every soldier that stepped foot on a ship they would have been listed on an impartation role you would hope anyway and so we 've got their digitization of the embarkation role record in this case the page that 's pertinent to Walter it 's really not giving us a lot more than we already knew except as we 've gotten down the bottom there now it 's telling us that he left Sydney place of embarkation on the 18th of October 1914 and he sailed on the HM 80 Suffolk which I 'm going to guess is Her Majesty 's Australian Transport as opposed to HMAS which is Her Majesty 's into is the Australian Red Cross wounded and missing files they 're really good they 're also quite distressing so in this case Walter was spoiler alert but he didn 't make it back he was killed overseas we 've always had some difference of opinion within my family as to what happened just minor details we can now get into the wet Red Cross missing files and we can see live so to speak reports on what happened which as I said can be really sad can also be quite distressing but also fascinating so a little bit further and we download a PDF so for example there was a lot of paperwork in this file for example we have a letter here from a mr. I see will done I think it 's actually Wilson this is a report this is his report as to what he thought happened I knew Mr host he was in this division and I saw him lying wounded shot through the stomach at posi years by a bullet on the 24th of July 19 Steen that is the the mainly held story he was killed by a stray bullet so very sad especially that last life I do not know where he was buried but it does as you read through the letters and reports it does go to make up a picture which sad as it is is also very interesting to go back to the Australian War Memorial you can have a look at things like the role of honor again not probably telling us much more than we already know but it has to corroborate and back up the information that you 're pulling together which is always good this does have a little bit more this one is telling us that yes place of death date of death died of wounds and the report that we read said he did not know where he was buried well in this case we now do know where it was buried which again will take us a step further so lots and lots of things that you can find again nominal rolls every war has a nominal role that will give us a little bit more information of a different sort he was 19 when he enlisted he was a carpenter he was single and he was the son of LC host of Barrie and he was Church of England so you 're more bits of pieces of information there from that nominal role so that 's stuff from the Australian War Memorial I said there are two places to go to the other place that you had to is the Australian archives the majority of your records are going to be with the Australian archives not the state archives because apart from the Boer War our conflicts have been fought as a federation so we 're looking at Australian records when it comes to defense records and if you go to the National Archives which also changed its website in the last 12 months you can find what we call personal dossiers again there 's a few different ways and means to get into the actual meet of the records and again lots of arm information and helpful hints and background information to work through or you can just go straight to your records search discover the National Archives and to record search again really easy to use we 're just going to put in two words first name last name I am also going to put some dates in to narrow it down because we 've been a federation for over a hundred years that 's a lot of Records to troll through looking for water host I know it was World War one conflict so I 'm going to put in 1950 into 1918 which is going to bring up our records again make sure you 've got the right one that 's looking pretty good service number matches place of birth matches next of kin works what we 're really excited to see is up in the top right hand corner view digital copy most of the World War one records have been digitized now that was a big project done for the World War 1 centenary so with a bit of luck particularly at the moment when we aren 't we 're all staying home we can search those records and read through them without leaving the comfort of our own home this particular Dozier has quite small it depends on what action the soldier may have seen how high up in the rankings they were perhaps so yes in this case we can make our way through 18 pages the front page is usually the enlistment paperwork and yes typically a service record package contains attestation papers statement of service casualty forms correspondence and other miscellaneous paperwork so that 's a really good thing to find we might come back to that other things you can find whilst you 're at the Australian archive again the role of honor we looked at that at the Australian War Memorial commemorative role debt of honour register and one that we are interested in particularly the office of Australian War grades so we can jump to another website we can go to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission again we can search for Walter host I 'm gonna stick his middle name in there since we now know it and we 've got our results there lieutenant host Walter Joseph date of death the regimen he served with the Australian infantry because this is an overseas grave so you people it 's going to give us things like the transcription that has gone on his gravestone over in France that 's given us a little bit more information we 've got his father 's name and his mother 's name there and also the inscription that they asked do you have written on that grave and I haven 't been to France I 'm probably not likely to get there any time soon either but I can visit online which is really good so we 've got location of where that particular grave is so the Somme how many casualties were buried there a few more details and we can even go for a virtual tour also in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission archives more paperwork some original records as to which men were buried there bit more detail this is a bit concerning that he 's has actually been written in over someone that was typed not too sure about that and and then we 've got the official gazetted version as well you can also find things like the medals that were awarded and there 's various if you 're lucky a lot of the men did have photos taken when they were over there another good way to build out your information is to research your unit we 've gone back to the War Memorial for here so the War Memorial has a lot of information on the various units and of course is always good old Wikipedia which is not a bad resource as long as you check your references last but not least trove newspapers with the National Library again you 'll find death notices even just community information notices it was again interesting but rather sad so when I went through the newspapers looking for any references to Walter we found a little paragraph that he was reported missing to begin with and then a few months later good news mr. mrs. host have received four field cards and a letter which states that he is still in the trenches but well in health so hopes are up again now boys okay but then unfortunately we get the official letter from France stating that he has been killed that was interesting in that might not get that lucky so again sad but good to find you might also be lucky if you go to the State Library of New South Wales in this instance the state library for their centenary celebrations celebrations commemorations they made an effort to pull together a lot of personal Diaries and letters from what the First World War I have had a gentleman in here who was lucky enough to have an own family members Diaries at the State State Library and he was able to access them from here and transcribe them and print them out which was great and then something new that they 've just put up for the current times we 've got some podcast series or just a little bit of a side there another interesting thing you can find at the War Memorial so that 's well we 'll one moving along we can also have a look for people who served in World War two in this instance I 'm gonna have a look for a World War two prisoner of war now if not all the World War two records next project as we get closer to that 100 year anniversary fit more of a deep dive here I 'm taking a chance Roberts is fairly common name apparently so let 's see what happens let 's see how many when we pull up just putting in Roberts I actually couldn 't remember my great-great uncle 's name but once I found the right matching initials I knew we had a number of names I figured I was at the right place go a bit deeper and see if I 've made the right decision so there he is lance sergeant LHS Roberts serving in Malaya prisoner of war and again that all-important service number now that I 've got the service number even though I 've still only got his initials I can go to the archives and I can pop that service number into my search box so I can say Roberts I can say World War two and I can put that unique number in and hopefully yes that 's the right person we 've got his record bear Roberts Lloyd Henry Schofield that matches that 's kin I know is correct as well so I think I 've got the right person there and again happy days we can view a digital copy so again we can look at his enlistment forms he 's only got 16 pieces of paper in his dossier so not as much possibly because he spent a large portion of the war in a prisoner of war camp not much paperwork to be made at that point yes and as you can fit as a service and casualty form there and yes 15th of Feb 19 42 prisoner of war not knowing much about this side of the family I thought I 'd do another trove search and I 'd have a look for sergeant Lloyd Roberts I didn 't know this but it was good to get some further information he did make it back unlike Paul Walter and yes as this says having endured indescribable Horrors at the hands of the Japanese in prison camps sergeant Lloyd Henry Schofield is attempting to enter parliament he did he was a Queensland parliamentary member and he didn 't do too bad was returning servicemen of course so again we go into trove we can build a picture of the man more information there Federal Elections okay so uh see I thought it was state it 's actually federal and again we can go back into good old Google we know where he served what battalion he served with now that we 've had a look at his records we can look up his battalion and see if we can get some more information on the battalion itself information there a lot of the battalions a lot of the men and service women have put together websites about their particular battalions which is great if you 're really lucky I love photographs there 's a photograph there and it wasn 't hard to spot him actually he looks just like my dad so that was that was a wonderful find there that someone 's actually thought to include a photo there in that with website and also if I head over to the Department of Veteran Affairs I can print out a service certificate which is nice keep moving forward again I don 't have any family members that served at Korea do you have family members that served in Vietnam so we 'll give this a shot we 're back to the Australian War Memorial at this point you can see there 's a lot of listings for various conflicts down the side there if you want to do filter search in that instance I 'm going to look for a cousin or my mum 's cousin in this case and again I 'd forgotten the name dreadful of me I knew the surname so we 'll put the surname in and I knew I wanted Vietnam so we 'll narrow it down to that I 've got some results again are they were the right results let 's see they actually were not the right results I looked at that when I don 't think that names right and um lovely as my mum 's cousin was I don 't think he was he got any awards or recommendations in that respect so what do we do when you have a look at a different website let 's try going roles and seeing what we can find so we 've gone to the Veterans Affairs we 've gone to the nominal roles we 've put in what we know which is very little unfortunately a surname and a conflict but this time we 've had a bit more success so I 've run my eye down that list of Bennett 's and I 've come to Edwin Ernest and gone that 's right his name 's Teddy and Ernest is after great grandpa so I 'm fairly certain I 've got the right person now I 've got the service number their date of birth looks right 1946 and yes Penrith is the right area I 'm fairly confident I 've got the right person this time so I can go back to well actually like a stay at the Department of Veteran Affairs go in a little bit deeper still got that number there mmm haven 't really picked up much more information we know he 's a private now we can head back to the National Archives I 'm just going to go straight in from my google they 've updated the website and now they 've got all this lovely extra information that you can play around with which is great and I had to work out a different way of searching because it didn 't look like this last time I went in I was like oh okay now what do I do have a play you 're not going to break anything the best way to learn is just to explore through these websites I 've ended up back at records search because that 's the best way to go we 've put Bennett in and I haven 't worried about a service number at this point I 've refined the search or I will refine the search because there 's far too many Bennett 's there at that moment now I 'm going to put in the footer first in a second name narrow it down and this time we 've got the record dead that 's great we 've got the right person this time unfortunately we haven 't got a digital copy that we can access we can request a copy which inaccessible to request a copy it does cost you a little bit of money and the powers that be we 'll probably have to go through and make sure it 's okay to release probably not high on their priorities but we can still go into the back to the War Memorial have a look at the battalion he served with again it 's got a lovely website as well that somebody 's put together I 've got a few extra resources there there 's actually a book that someone 's written about that battalion service in Vietnam might be interesting and again we can go back to the Veterans Affairs and print out a service record sometimes you can get lucky I couldn 't access cousin Teddy 's record for whatever reason I could however and this really surprised me when I came across this or a few years ago now I can access my dad 's Navy record I 'm guessing that 's because there 's nothing really confidential or anything in there it kind of blew me away really so yeah I 've got his service card let 's see where he served where he was when he 's enlisted so yeah few interesting points there he did serve in Vietnam albeit not actually in the country he was on one of the ships that was escorting soldiers to Vietnam so he does have Vietnam record possibly he is able to be accessed because he wasn 't actually in the country and so again we can download a lovely war service certificate and finally we 've been to the National Archives we 've been to the War Memorial we 've done all the federal level stuff but don 't forget your local area information don 't forget your local Historical Society particularly as we 've just been through the centenary of well well one most societies will have done a lot of research and put a lot of things together in regards to the local soldiers and also in our case here in this area we 're very lucky we have the Fleet Air Arm Museum so um that 's always another option to explore ah thank you very much hopefully that will give you some ideas 're searching military ancestors _"

    "text": "hi my name 's Shawn Zimmerman work for darling constructions this is just a quick overview in a demonstration of a typical a1 simplex unit in one of our current projects typically we 've installed over 4,000 units around New South Wales in various parts of New South Wales we have a good working relationship with a1 which is specialized in putting in 81 units by something behind me is about all of our loca which is one of those count projects as you can see it 's one of the largest an sort of towns left actually on the east coast of New South Wales consisting of about 45 hours of straight layers and 1100 units basically this video will demonstrate how we install units and you 'll see the way we do things as well as you 'll see at the end of the film will demonstrate how we 're commissioning and our procedures also up here we have a community shop from which I 'm standing in at the moment now basically we manage the public quite well through maintaining this shop front it 's easy but stuff available and also we have a lady in the office three days a week making appointments and in organizing the streets and where we 're heading with the boys in approvals to actually enter people 's properties to carry out the work the next fall you so we 're at number 15 Spencer Street I looka this is a typical installation we 're drilling in 40 mil discharge life see our boys are setting up the drug to do so it 's a lot easier especially if you 're in tight spaces or close proximity to sighs and digging and trenching with an excavator also save on a restoration the ground is virtually untouched there 's a small entry hole in a small exit hole [Applause] [Music] at the moment you can say that just set up there but they go fighting in and the Gaza in front a with a lot of data so you can actually the hit of the unit all the way through the backyard also they take measurements every three meters from the rods which base it becomes work the next part of the the boys are currently drawing the sidelines in and the boys are now preparing the backyard for the precious to it unit installation as well as the electrical insulation and the plumbing works as you do the boys head start at first focus and this properly installation into the vehicle proximity of where the field is going to toiletry we weren 't getting it another machine in let 's do it so as you can see we but it 's more bigger you 'll see that we 'll have a series of digitized images inside past but 20 estimators ranging from one of our I 'm sorry from half the time out to do five ton on the project [Music] the boys will disconnect it and I 'll put a a pulling head back and I 'll pull the 40-mile back all the way back to the bottom of the band boys are left over [Music] I also see that I 've set up Kosovar beautiful place a while back with the 40-mile lines as well to make it easier later on for anyone tracing the lineup or locating a the back cutter on the drill rig and they 're pulling the 40mm discharge line back through the bore hole the process is relatively quick just a matter of pulling the length of pop back the distance they drove [Music] especially in Italy because we have preformed their concrete [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I 've been down at avoid you convey yeah it 's been in the bunch now sales I have a house like back though by father Randleman [Applause] you also notice that we have a soccer truck besides the jewelry developer any excess fluid or any observed is tucked away and taken away and also we have a duo niala to keep that machine clean and clean up any four parts that may get covered in life [Music] boys over flood the Sun stand back around there 's a backfilling like he 's off to a heart where the penetration that the tank will be done [Applause] Benny Diploma is near in the process of doing the penetration of the tank which is a 127 hole [Music] so the maximum tips on these things you can go grommet in place that 's the penetration into the tank completed as part of this project we only buy a maximum of two moves so we do the penetration in the tank the o goes on and a piece of pipe at about 2 meters and left for the plumbing to come back later on and off the system up we 're in the process now of um pennies are installing the electrical cable as you can see through the conduit back up to the PCB on the wall and Mark on this side is hooking the discharge line up that was bought in previously to the tank so you can see we use fusion couplers all the way back to the tank with an inch and a quarter adapter into the tank you can say that must mark the fittings so we know when as well to make sure that they haven 't moves and then he is now feeding the cable up to punch it up to the BCP [Applause] having a bottle size of a slice of a back door in bye-bye [Music] back to the front where the pipe was obviously brought in from it 'll be hooked up to the boundary box which you can see and also there 's a food inside that so we will fusion cut that and well that 's with a poly pot and then it becomes live back to the street name [Music] as you can see we 've specially designed an all-terrain comes installer basically with the larger wheels due to the gaming conditions it might be hard to get the the contine and [Music] we fill the tank out up to a fun level to women we didn 't know that option and the consultant been effective the corner I hope as I explained before markers now in the final process of hooking the boundaries get up as you can see there 's a flute and a couple of bends to bring it back up to the correct height to the flute as per this is on once again using twos and coupling Ben and Michael mark their fittings as well to make sure that there 's no movement during world just started doing the electrical installation the con Jude and bracelet and is just put the wire through the grommets and about sworen up once you finished that will make the system live and run through our checklist as you can see the whys and air all terminated in the control panel you 'll notice that there is a break from the panel to the con jute that 's to ensure that there 's no gas coming back from the tank and can enter the switch the PCP to any corrosion so that is a highly important then the method we use is endorsed by e1 and we will soon make the board light now at Chris now I 'm out to make the panel live so the fat lunch will go off because we 've filled it up with water as you can see the sawing goes off and the light on top is on our second check on the system is testing the pub against the clothes head to make sure the control panel switches it off which is in the process of building up amps and it has worked as well once we we flush the water into the main and then we refill the tank to make sure that it stops and starts at the correct levels now the bandage box open the units turn back off and turn back on again and the alarm will go off once again will silence alarm and we will monitor the ants as it pumps out obviously it 'll take a few minutes as the tank is full the tank was filled up as well is doing the alarm test but also making sure there 's no leakage on the penetrations into the tank as you can see thank you for the water and we take anywhere up to two minutes as you can see on the control panel we 're using one of the latest control panels when they want it gives you the amperage that the pump is pulling so if it 's running somewhere between five and six it 's running within the manufacturers requirements pump has now started again a screen here there 's only a small noise then arose from the top which will cut out very shortly that 's on this project in particular we 're not leaving the console and it seems we remove the call put the lid on and that completes our commissioning phase [Music] here 's a sample of our ATP 's this is the one we use for our inspection and test planned for the actual pump unit itself and then we have another one which the electrician 's use for their checklist as well they 're both go together with a property plan and obviously become part of the workers X program here 's the finished product basically the pot is left like that you can see we 've noted we 've left a part of seen we give the homeowners the option to keep the excess material if they wish to keep it they saw on a release form if they don 't we take a little small array we can see and this is the Vantage box the front after being completed and hooked up well this concludes our demonstration of a standard simplex unit in one of our current jobs before our ladies I 'd like to introduce you to was in America and had a visit of the ebon Factory and a torso only a few closing words sure as Sean said I 'm just recently in America overseas there 's no hole that I happened to get a tour of the a1 Factory and I think it was quite quite interesting to see how how it all comes together the pumps and the control panels the production line and how organized the companies and also the people that worked very won obviously they really know how to come on board and are willing to take advice and you 're sort of willing to learn and improve the product consistently we 've done quite a bit of work with them you know the ease and developed a good relationship with them and I think that 's that shows what kind of people we are and what kind of people they are hopefully we can continue to do the same thing in the future and keep doing what we 're doing I guess yeah thanks _"

    "text": "I was looking for inspiration and I checked out the Internet there 's so many great ideas but I wanted to make something just a little bit unique now a muse is something that can inspire you when you 're making something creative something or someone I checked out our chalks I checked out our fish and then I came across our dogs please meet Shankly and Lexie I 'm going to use them as my muses let 's get started the materials were using today are quite simple a small egg carton some small craft scissors an outline textile and also some masking tape the first thing I 'm going to do is cut the egg carton in half we are going to use the flat part of the egg carton as a base the next thing we 're going to do is cut some shapes out of this top part of that flat base to make some ear shapes this one is going to have floppy ears so I 'm just using my text art to mark out the ear shape so I can start to see how marked out some places on this part of the egg carton so that I can cut out carefully and make a really good shape for the brow and the eyes of the dog oh yeah I think this is starting to look a little bit like a dog now I 'm cutting some other little pieces which I 'm going to turn into the middle of the eye so that we can make a really interesting looking expression on our dog now I 'm looking at the shapes on the bottom side of the egg carton and I think there 's round shapes really resembled that of a dog and the dog 's nose the next thing I 'm going to do is cut out of another shape that will form the bottom part the dog 's mouth and this fits in really well together just by poking it in to make that good-sized snout like when the dogs barking and happy the next stage we need to do is make a little tongue for our dog I 've just used a little piece of the O cotton that had got all our shapes ready and all together we 're just going to do a little bit of finishing touches with the black textile firstly we 're going to do the pupils of the eyes just on the top of the little pointy bits the next thing we need to do is make the nose of our puppy portrait nice and black black and shiny so we know they 're nice and healthy we attach the little red tongue with tape and then put the mouth together using a little bit of tape around the back to hold it together and you can make the expression to suit this sort of dog that you want to show in your portrait next step is just bend the tongue a little bit so that it pops out of the dog 's mouth now we have all our pieces made I 'm going to show you how I put them all together take another piece of masking tape and roll it over on itself so that you 've got stickiness on both sides push it onto the bottom part of the eye shape sticky side and pop that into the eye socket shape take some more masking tape and apply it to the bottom of the mouth trimming it down to fit and then push it against the bottom part of the egg carton next just run a couple of other pieces up to a secure in the nose pop in the eyes and the eyebrow and you 'll find it sits in pretty well just grab a couple of little pieces rolled over to place behind in between the egg carton base and the shapes and push them together now it 's your turn to get creative post your egg carton animals on our Facebook page or Instagram so we can have a look thanks for watching see you next time _"

    "text": "hello everyone and welcome to a very special story time from shale open libraries we are so sad that we could not have new here with us today however we have decided to bring our story times to you so today we have a very special story time about rainbows let 's get ready to begin first we 're going to sing our hallowed song and our Lord song goes like this do you wanna hear some stories wanna hear some stories wanna hear some stories is what we do the first thing that we do is we sit down on our bottoms stick down on our bottoms sit down on our bottoms that 's what we do and then we listen and be quiet listen and be quiet listen and be quiet that 's what we do and we 're also going to have lots of fun have lots of fun have lots of fun that 's what we 'll do so good job with the Hello song everyone let 's put our listening ears on and start our first story and our first story today please called the at all anywhere no green grass or blue sky no Yellow Sun or red flowers it made everyone sad that is the very colorless world summit just lots of gray from his lonely mountain top was up gazed longingly at the distant planet in the night sky it sparkled with brilliant colour and you will see that there that beautiful looks a little bit like zot thought it must be a very happy place he decided to go there and find happiness for himself there is a spaceship pretty sots journey to the colorful planet was a long one when he arrived he was amazed by everything he saw there was just so much color everywhere perhaps he could stay here forever and be happy but then he thought about all his friends he had an idea he would take the color back to his planet zop opened his mouth and called out in a strange language in reply all the red soared through the air and into his open bag going into this bag he 's going to steal all the red this lot walked to a hilltop he again he called and the blue rushed into his bag it 's a lot of blue he dissolves back there isn 't it next soft stole the greeny the leaves were now gray and the grass was almost black zot stole all the colors calling them to him until every last color had disappeared it 's all in the purple and the yellow apart from one a boy came bouncing along with a balloon an orange balloon shot wanted that color too and he took it do you little boy looks a little bit beside doesn 't he then he climbed into his spacecraft and took off but when he looked down at the gray planet and the boy who looks so sad thought knew he must go back carefully gently he returned all the beautiful colors to the boys world that goes flying out the boy watched his opt client sadly into the issue and he held out his orange balloon azad pressed that tightly to his chest at last he was truly happy and he turned his ship for home it does look very happy doesn 't he a balloon slops friends greeted him and the warm glow from the boys balloon lit them up and they were happy a little color can go a long long way they are very happy out there and that is the end of the story that was a beautiful story about beautiful colors and there is a song about colors I think and let 's sing that song together but first let 's learn a little bit about a language called Auslan we are going to learn a few colors in Auslan so that we can sing our song together so I want us to practice first let 's practice our first color is red so we 're going to make our finger into a little R and put it up here at our cheese red next color is yellow and we 're going to make my fingers into the a okay symbol and we 're gonna put it up here and take our hat twice that is yellow our next color is pink and we 're going to take our finger and draw a pink on our cheeks pink people to brush the grass off our green purple we 're going to rub some purple into our hands there are fingers that are two fingers rub your purpley orange is our next color an orange we 're going to squeeze our orange juice the orange into our mouth and we do that twice orange beautiful juicy orange and then we have blue and blue is we 're going to flip our hand over from bubble and we 're going to talk about hands without fingers I 'm saying alright now that we know all of our colors let 's sing our song red and yellow and pink and green purple and orange and blue I can sing a rainbow sing a rainbow sing a rainbow too listen with your eyes listen with your eyes and sing everything you do see I can sing a rainbow sing a rainbow sing along with me red and yellow and pink and green purple and orange and blue I can sing a rainbow sing a rainbow sing a rainbow too beautiful what a beautiful song all right let 's read our second book now different records by safety Messi and Michael McMahon beneath my window there is a street above the street there is a cloud what 's peeking out of the cloud there against the cloud there is a rain eat is a city rainbow see the buildings underneath the rainbow lots of buildings probably need to sleep it is not like the rainbow on our farm there 's not a lot of buildings in this one is father that must mean it 's a farm in the city red is the postbox down the road here it is have you seen a red post box on our farm red was the tractor working in the field lots of other red there too and a robin popping on a branch can you find the Robin yeah teeny tiny little Robin in the city orange is a curl of Peel in the gutter there it is can hardly see it indigo on the farm orange was the color of sunset and a twine tied around hay bales that is a very big sunset in the city yellow is the barrier around a hole in farm yellow was the ducklings in our yard and the ripe wheat in the fields Oh somebody else in the fields she is this scarecrow not doing a very good job though in the city Green is the poster at the bus stop on the farm brings the color of fresh grass after a rain and the moss on the rocks by the river lots of green in the farm in the city blue is the paint of our neighbors fence on the farm blue was our sheepdog Billy 's eyes and the Shema of a dragonfly can you find the dragonfly tiny blue shimmery dragonfly in the city indigo is the color of my backpack on the far indigo was as velvet as a month and the star spangled night sky is very big skies lots of stars in the city there are no starry nights but here the buildings touch the sky on the farm violet was the edge of storm clouds over the mountains in the city there are clouds be gray clouds big cloud storm clouds blowing in from the sea storm clouds edged with violet that story all right I think we will have another rainbow song now sing along if you know the words to this [Music] [Music] and dreams that you dare to dream really do come true someday I wish upon a star wake up with clouds far behind me where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops that 's where you [Music] [Music] fly [Music] if happy little bluebirds fly above the rainbow Oh [Music] that 's the end of our story time today and now stay tuned for a rainbow craft alright today we are going to make our own and there is a wonderful Facebook site that I have been following called the rainbow trail Australia so children from all over Australia and I think even think of in the world now it actually might just be called rainbow trade or our making rainbows to put in their windows and making rainbow chalk rainbows on their driveways so that when everybody goes out of an afternoon and has their wonderful walk for exercise and for their mental health they always see our rainbows everywhere see if rainbows you can spot in people 's windows and on people 's driveways so today we 're going to make our very own rainbow to put in our very own window and what we need are a few things you probably have at home if you don 't you can use different things and you might need some help from your mum or dad or Nana pop we can use some scissors so here 's what we need we need a pair of scissors we need some glue or some sticky tape you can use some sticky tape we need some crepe paper in different colors if you don 't have crepe paper you can use colorful magazines that you could cut up or you could use different colors of fabric or felt or try it and look around and see what different rainbowy things that you have that you could cut off and a paper plate if you don 't have any paper plates you could just use a bit of cardboard bit of scrap cardboard and maybe instead we 're not using cotton balls today because our plate a cloud but you might like to stick some cotton balls on your cardboard so the first thing that we 're going to do is we 're going to cut out all of our rainbow strips and I 've cut out most of them here but I 'll just cut out my last one a nice rainbow strip you probably want to cut it about an inch or an inch and a half wide remember to get some help with the scissors and remember to be careful using them with your fingers all right so we 've put our rainbow strips and this is the best part we are going to get our rainbow strips and hold them by one end and we 're going to go weave and uncurl them so let 's do that with all of them we might even say we every time let 's do green next and what 's the color orange orange orange didn 't really want to play today oh that was a great one let 's try that again let 's switch it over got to the side with the yellow our beautiful rainbow strips to make our rainbow and all we 're going to do now is very going to cut but you could fold it to that we 're going to cut our paper plate again getting some cope with the scissors if you need it and be very careful of our fingers all right so we 've got our paper Pete cloud that was hard to say paper plate to cloud and all we 're going to do is we 're going to get our glue stick take our glue stick and cover the back of our cloud with a big gooey layer of glue stick glue or any glue that you have really you don 't have a place to get home however it really well it 's lots of glue one nail it 's a sticky gooey gooey glue who should have you probably can 't see but we put a big line of sticky gooey glue and then all we 're going to do is we 're going to find the end of our rainbow rainbow strips and stick them on there 's some blue order that you like or you might like to have a look and see if there is a particular order I think there is a particular order for a rainbow this is the order that I 'm going to do my rainbow in today yellow shiny got some orange lovely juicy orange Oh red vibrant red you might get a little bit of glue on your fingers that 's okay getting messy is all part of the fun and all right so once you have all your rainbow strips stuck you turn it around and you have a beautiful long you could cut it down if you like but I kind of like that it is a flirty flowy rainbow you have a beautiful big rainbow that you can put in your window or you might like to hang it up in your room or you might like to you could stick it on the fridge but I don 't know that you 'd be able to open the fridge anymore now when I go for my walk this afternoon I 'd love to see lots of wonderful beautiful rainbows chalk on your on your driveways and you can take a picture of them and post them to the rainbow trail Australia Facebook page and if you do please post them to the shop heibon library 's Facebook page too because we would love to see them thank you so much everyone for coming to our very first virtual storytime we wish you all well and we 'll see you next time bye _"

    "text": "welcome to the gallery this evening for what I 'm sure will be a conversation the best thing you haven 't had my students meeting for my name 's Brock my manager Eric Stratton Regional Gallery so absolute cliff to welcome you here this evening and the tour from our two special guests we 've had quite few conversations over the last 12-18 months accretion has led for us we 've Arthur 's personalities the curators and others anchor each time richard manages to pull out some rather wonderful insights discussion and stories so I know to make with the history Rex has in the art world who is incredible connections knowledge background I know that you 're going to hear something fascinating delightful [Music] thank you very much Ron when you have indeed thrown down the gauntlet sure that Rex and I will do our very best to to respond but welcome to everybody who is it 's wonderful to see so many people here tonight that this is more than a packed house and it 's lovely that you all we know who come along to join this you can tell probably I 'm not using a microphone can everybody hear me reasonably clearly and Rick 's I might get you to kind of step you and rank and serial number or something like this or just make a general greeting just to say that everyone can hear you as well think that this is the portrait of an unknown old man do do whatever long details today everybody get that little bit of self-deprecation excellent all right look let 's get under my arm of other halves of counter that with a little bit of flattery to begin with because it 's appropriate because it is a great pleasure tonight to be able to have someone and I know this word is overused but if not inappropriate I to have someone who is an icon of the Australian art world and has been caught oh just several dates I won 't tell you what he whispered but it was a lot of years so Rick zuman is somebody who has had the most extraordinary life in art in Australia and through his gallery at Rick 's Irwin in Australia but also for so many enthusiastic clients quite extraordinary contacts with the world of art with the world of Australia now but perhaps even sometimes more excitingly in the scale of the contact some international if you wanted to buy a Picasso in Australia you went to see Rex if you wanted to buy a Lucien Freud in Australia you went to see Rex if you wanted to buy a David Hockney in Australia you went to see Rex but if you wanted to buy Great Australian artists like the temple or Nicholas Hardy you also went to see breaks or Fred Williams or any number of names that we might hear tonight so the people that Rex is dealt with and the experiences that these head our experiences which those of us who have and I 'm sure everybody here tonight does have an enthusiasm to the world of visual art there are experiences that are almost beyond our wildest dreams and it 's wonderful that Rex has come along to like to share some of those and hopefully I can tease them out of him but essentially a local he has retired from his gallery and he 's now the be in kangaroo valley so I 've been welcome to you Rex thank you both for coming along tonight and look let 's let 's go to just a particular moment straight away which is when David Hockney rang you up and said I want to do your portrait will be busy yes coffee when he comes to Australia has an unnerving habit of just ringing you as a ello and you don 't know whether he is in Bradford or he 's innocent anyhow he said this wonderful thing and he said can you come tomorrow morning at nine o 'clock and I heard myself saying well I 'm terribly sorry but I 've had the hair and he said cancel it and so I didn 't and and he did and he said oh did he give it to you because when people do portraits of other people they can 't give them away because they have to sell them to other people so he gave me a copy which is a exact life-sized copy by a baton so what is it like to sit down in front of yeah one of the great international artists of this century and have your portrait captured by that person what you do you look into their eyes you look aside but do you have conversation what happens this was a particular period of David Hockney when he was using a prism and I don 't know if any of you followed it but he 's been exploring the use of prisms and lenses of the history of art and if you use in prison you put it above your sheet of paper and I can look at you and your image appears on the paper so he can trace around it but there is actually no image on the paper it 's within the prison so I had a slightly in name smile on my face because everybody sits well on her face when they 're having their portrait done but I realized the reason is you got people in a smiling face forever however David being one of the great draftsman deep I think a great man he 's unbelievably generous and in fact I spoke to him why emailed him yesterday Nichols pardon the wonderful use of quotation of is about drawing and generalization he said of course you could have copyright so he 's a kind generous thoughtful man he might drive for people who were around him demented because every time he has a new project he wants a tell everyone and it 's wonderful when you will be everyone but when you 've been around for the last fortnight of what will drive you mad here 's a particularly special yes and it 's wonderful to have been able to develop as you can have three or your professional career contact with internationally recognized artists but there 's probably no single name that resonates in the art world for everybody after system and perhaps non-lover alike as Picasso and you were invited to the Picasso estate all and then to have a look at what works you would like to bring back to your gallery in Australia what what was it like to be in a room full of work by 've probably all seen films of English the Nazi gold walls a sort of stored underground in Switzerland and I went into one of these walls and I think we went down eight floors into his extraordinary space and on each side there were what appear to be enormous walls with drawers this thick and we went into one and there were Picasso 's from 1908 through to the year before he died which I think was 1972 and they were drawings and I was told make an exhibition from what you do I mean I just went through them as I would is if you were a young artist I fish that pictures I liked and discovered them 200 of them or something and I was about 25 then went back and put together a show but it was one thing particularly interesting we went into the sculpture studio where there were bronzes and there were plaster casts and there was a wonderful wonderful plaster head of his young lover Mary Torres back there and he kept fallin over and her rather extraordinary Grecian nose like a sausage snapped of mine and when we were at the cow so show the art gallery South Wales this is the plaster because you can see the main facility and you 'd see that it 's broken my decisions where it goes down you will see quite a lot of things they 're broken occasionally plants who are up against it and we have to come back so when you were when you were in this vault looking at Picasso 's 11 almost movie scenario can you imagine back in the day when you were in a military college that there would be an any connection between your the young Ranger one the Rick 's that got to choose because O 's none at all I 'm the first person in my family first male in a family in 300 years not to go into the army or the Navy so it was a surprise for them as it was for me was in a very difficult life if my father was that sort of person he would have been upset but he was one of those soldiers who was shaken about so I think he didn 't understand certainly when I said Irish a Makassar he said oh the man that does three eyes so the journey obviously when you when you went to to Military College as a as a youngster did you have a sense of the you 're likely life your preferred life ahead of you my preferred life I was of Naval College and I assumed it was going to be in the army or the Navy the fact that I wasn 't bright enough or I love the army or the Navy that would take some doing we were given two minutes so give us a thumbnail sketch of how you got from being a as you modestly couldn 't maybe not a know who were performing young military ensued how did you get first of all to Australia and and secondly to find yourself in a position of the world of art if I found before that I proposed school I have a very nice French friend that we were talking and the person we were within a range is very well educated well John so I was really offended because when I was in London I was in the wine business because I had no idea what I was going to do and I my aunt who was the only person in the family who have any connections to the real world will tell me what you like and I said food wine and music and she said go in the wine trade I have a friend so I did and then I was in the wine for two or three years starting at the bottom dear boy it 's good for you when they don 't have to pay him very much and I had an Australian friend that was quite a celebrated Australian I think he was a great swimmer of his today in Michael Allen Walker but not the man from the Wayside Chapel and he said why don 't you go to Australia they grow wine nasarah billion five pounds a week even up 10 pounds a week basically but but you make your own way here I had prepared because I am actually Canadian author not an Englishman so on one and the thing that really pissed me off I paid money and I was Zinta Northern California completely froze logic with stuff so when you think when you arrived in Australia and saw this new lucky country you weren 't that impressed us out we were called it I made my first aesthetic decision I thought it was it is I have never made a nice nasty pretty ugly decision you 'll get to like rates a bit better like survived in 1962 I have to say Sydney was a different place and it was a rainy September day and it was also my 21st birthday and the whole thing was rather miserable and I said to a taxi driver I had a hundred pounds my birthday and I said please check into a glamorous hotel near a beach he took me to somewhere called the Astor at Bondi later became a bordello and it 's now I 've got flats species so those were your first impressions of Australia but if any of us have been around at the time and in the same place as you think in Israeli a heavy what would what would we have seen what would we have heard they thought that was an upper-class Wagner I think and in those days there were less people who spoke English like I do and then there were less people who spoke English like the Greeks the Italians do so I stood out of it but now we all speak our own version of Australian and I 'm forgiven indeed well at least in part because of the extraordinary job that you have done and I indicated with some of those names were mentioned earlier the achievement of getting so much international art to Australia through your gallery as well of course as supporting some very significant Australian artists but but how difficult or table has been over the years to to get international people like David Hockney who we were talking about earlier realm people like others how do people decide to do it wasn 't strangely enough once I got there I was in Australia for 18 months and then went back to England and lived there for about five years came enough so that when I went back to England to meet very grand people I would say would you then be and because nobody had ever asked know usually said yes and so I thought the most extraordinary things more elaborated the Picasso shows a man in the West End of London shows Elizabethan portraits I went into his gallery there was a very pretty picture the window my sentence assistant man I have a gallery an Australian man asked how much savings because I wanted to know you know what thing is possible portrait like this of a young man and the young man and she said it was 15,000 pounds of something which even in those days wasn 't very much money and Susan oh I 'll introduce you to mr. Vyse and I met him and I told him I had a gallery and he said well why don 't we do the show together so I did a show of Elizabethan portraits in will are in I don 't know 25 30 years ago and we sell extraordin umber of things yeah and when I I to brand and I 've been here long enough to realize a note is really grand there are nice or nasty without you we only check which one Rick 's might think you are by asking him after the event please line up to everyone okay you know that whole process is you 've just been describing it I 'm getting international path to Australia is no small achievement that 's why the fact that you have you make it sound very straightforward because you know you have both works by evolution probably and Egon Schiele and Henry Muller and Francis Bacon a whole range of people who are really not often shown in Australia other than by major galleries what sort of hoops do you have to jump through to be able to do that is it really as simple as what you were just described no because Australian dealers in London in the winter they are 76 in the late seventies were thought to be slightly dishonest because in those days communications weren 't as easy and checks often what lost from the post and I discovered quite work Henry Sidney 's over Australia 's reputation until one day I can 't think who I was with but I lost my temper and I said I am NOT responsible for their deaths if you want to deal with me you have to decide whether I 'm going to be direct and honest or whatever and that happened and one thing that I promised myself when I started was that I was going to pay the artist very quickly and in those days when I didn 't cost a lot and nobody needed it and Richard said supporting artists I was wanting them to support me I want to make a living and I stopped selling their pictures but it was much more relaxed there were large amounts of money involved and people who are bad payers and I tried to make my reputation by being with and that was what I think worked and speaking event give them whole ugly subjective money how do you maybe know now but you know when you when you were closing deals in sometimes for very suitable sums of money what was to closing a deal with somebody who might be wavering versus you know I mean I know that there are quite a variety of approaches from different different galleries different dealers around Australia I went a names but one very prominently doesn 't he rental no sy we did literally he would someone 's lock the door and not allow the person out until their brief to see didn 't_''_1236.4 we do that no I don 't happen I 've never thought of really closing deals in that manner but there 's a there is a quite a nice example I had some loose in Freud prints that I was showing the new crime and his wife with new to the market and we love people who abuse the market and they were faffing about of it and it was a pile of money fifty or sixty thousand dollars and there was a woman who I had particularly chosen day 54 and she came I had an upstairs room and there was a moment when you can set period at the top of the stairs and see into the room I was saying museums were thinking he 's wonderful this second the other this is a head popped up the woman you may know off occasionally doll on O 'Donnell recently deceased wonderful difficult woman and she popped her head up and said what a nice addition yes of course miss appear romantic what 's that for sale they 're the ones we like to do so I 'm not sure how those deals one day I did have a very difficult customer being planted to look at some Jeffrey smart and I had a new puppy and I couldn 't leave it at home so I took it to the gallery and I left the man alone with the dog and when I go half they were both on all fours playing there and I saw that the Jeffrey smart 5,000 that was your lovely puppy it worth making a point it 's interesting you were just talking about closing deals and and the label as you 've always called yourself and your business was full Rick 's that dealer but there are other labels that you don 't I hate the most which is the new label is gallerist it 's a German invention and I think it makes me sound like a florist and I mainly have many attitudes of florists but I don 't like the name I wanted to actually call myself something nebulous like more work or Sydney or something but a friend of mine said in Australia you have to use your name so if you appear in the present its into prison the main missus and so that 's what I did but the art dealer thing I wanted to make it sort of professional serious rather than fluffy and wooly and I think people think art is fun but for those who make it those who serve it 's actually a profession and you know it 's one of our people don 't go to there 's a visitor for a meeting that may cost you say only 500 without making a point people come to me and spend seventy thousand dollars without taking it apart so it 's it 's a different world than I wanted it to be just were saying that relationship is is very important without a sudden we talked about some of those international artists that that you have represented well certainly that you 've represented here in Australia but you also have very very powerful very important relationships with Australian artists people like Nicholas having you mentioned a little bit earlier the estate of Fred Williams christened the Campbell who 's been hugely successful she has how do you have you build a really good relationship with an artist what is the key ingredient well my deep deep top is that a gallery is only good at those artists that they show and if you stop showing the certain sort of artists other artists are attracted to you and her this is a conversation that Nicholas having remained to me after the fact but he came to me and I saw his work 25 years ago and I thought it was interesting and I said we should probably show together and he said oh and I said what does that mean sir but I 've had to come to see you three times before and back when I better does that mean I 'm better so embarrassed so you literally forgotten that Museum I thought when he wasn 't although see you see doctor versus you know like five a week yes and you in there we have to say no to most of them and it 's easier now with emails I have to say in the old days we have to confront them first it must be awful for the artist just sitting in front of somebody 's desk and showing them their pictures like taking flowers down never burns up must have been it was distressing for us to have to say that okay I hope none of us here have taken their fancy every love there not recently but then aside I mean they may well actually be I know there are some who may be well represented already maybe some of whom are what would you now with that you know wisdom of hindsight say to an artist who 's perhaps not represented what would you say to them that they should do in a protein gallery one what 's you equipped a gallery is to enter every Fri as you can because they 're not surprises out there and there 's quite a lot of money out there and people get chosen even if you enter lots of things you may win nowadays it 's easier you can send any number of slide or whatever they call images to a dealer and you don 't have to confront them we look through them and we can say yes or no and so I think that side of it is easier but there are more people doing and in the end you actually have to each other because they name each cent on the screen all those looks one it 's crisp it 's clear it 's fresh but if it gets you in the door that 's what you should do but equally I think when you have a gallery as I did it may not apply now because there are a few galleries around you should actually go and see what they have over walls and quite an interesting story we have a young man who all the look at the exhibition 's and so when he came at the end and said may I show you my work I said yes because he had supported me by being at the least I could do was support him by the way his work it didn 't happen but he had took a space himself and haveth sure when I went to the first night and every dealer in Sydney was there because he had been to them and I thought why doesn 't every artist who 's at art school do it instead of wearing black having down before your show so when you come to me to say the reason I 've come to use you show Nicholas are aggressive it can be losing for a Picasso it 's flattering to know that they know what you do and we each have to live off each other so it 's nicer if it works so just expanding a little of that relationship between the artists I mean you mentioned prominent Australian artists like Nicholas having Christine Campbell what sort of relationship does the dealer that you yes with others what sort of relationship do you establish to begin with you 're a nanny and I have a younger one come to me and I said yes let 's do a show whenever and I rather start up there by saying do you have a partner we didn 't use the word in those days I think boyfriend or something and she don 't start all that I said yes and I said well you better whatever you 'll give me very hard to live with come down the show the covers you 're going to be tense you 're going to be making work if you 're not there to be cooking himself and the week before the show you came into being crystal I said what 's the matter and he said he left yesterday so we have to put up a little lot of that we have to nurse people those shows are easy in the way because they 're usually made before they come to you second shows like the second novels are very difficult people have an expectation of sales or whatever they don 't sell interest the pictures really sell themselves I present them I gave him the right people and it 's ok but it 's it 's very hard for the artist yes and and those artists as you say obviously over many years you build a powerful relationship with them but I actually want to go back quite a few years now because we were talking now you building a relationship with these artists many of them very prominent but we lived you at one stage here in Australia going my given while I hear but what was the process of you getting from that actually into the world of professional daily because it wasn 't something that you started doing when I think that the second time yes the first time I 've worked very briefly for the very stern yeah that 's right getting it wrong and when I was first here it was really quite difficult and I had no connections really and I left the wine failure after a short time because it didn 't quite work out for me and my knowledge such as wine came in cardboard boxes handy wasn 't the same as it is today so that finished and I did what everybody who was out of work in those days did I sold encyclopedias door-to-door_''_1883.999 and I was yes a convenience and it was my first son and I got heat stroke and well and I went to the doctor he said would you come work for more than three hours a day you can 't work for more than three days a week I said I have a friend who says about that and it was very stern and I went there and very out of the goodness of his heart because I must have been purple in the face river Sun white here and he gave me a job in the afternoons and in those days his gallery was in Paddington there 's a little bit rather in those days it is if he kept the door so people had to ring the bell and one would go to the door and give them a catalogue that the men and because as I mentioned my voice was more don 't speak I go to the door handle [Music] and it was a time when Frank Watters was working there who 's very celebrated dealer has just closed our generation and the sort of custom flowers and we used to sit in the back room and Barry would do the feet and it was then that I realized what it was to be an outsider finding the inside Barry was a young Jewish dealer and his clients were mostly the children of the people who had come as was out of the Holocaust and they were making their way to Sydney and they were loving the rag trade and they were doing terribly well and they were some reasonable kind to me because they had been expatriates than I was and so I thought that was made an honorary Jew which is rather wonderful the Jewish people coming from the ever came with a civilized background of music and theatre and coffee shops and conversation and they brought with them this to Sydney which was pretty world even in the sixties and very moody Coleman made this the beginning worked in 50 years well I mean I think that that message of positivity is one that we all do wonder here that there have been fantastic influences from all sorts of groups of people of all sorts of ethnicity and religious belief and sexual persuasion and all of that now has changed so much and so positively and as you were navigating your way you know through all of these things as a as a young relatively inexperienced person art-gallery environment what would you say were in that broader sense some of the most important things that you learned about about art and about why and how people decide to buy it and decide to enjoy it first of all I think I realized that we all do it differently but the most important thing was I think you have to be correct when you made a deal and you should count it was a deal an amount of money was involved but it was a deal a name-dropping story and when the first Australian painting got a million dollars at auction I had a telephone call from the pictures and I had just had a Gustav Klimt and England Sheela exhibition of drawings of such stolen with magic McCarthy and my capacitor was on and I thought mr. big is going to come and he 's going to buy a big mr. became said then I want to see Australian pictures so we went upstairs and we looked at younger artists but mr. Packard was said what was that picture the got a million dollars and I said it was Martha Street and he said that 's what I want to see it that 's it right give me a week and I will put together streets from all over so I went to Melbourne and borrow pictures from Joseph Brown from Australian galleries and I brought back ten or fifteen Roberts Street ins and converse from the 1880s to about the 1930s and those of you who know about this particular period forever Impressionism little pictures that were painted in 1889 there were three million dollars big shiny pictures of Sydney Harbour perfected in 1930 by arthur student were worth 30,000 and mr. Packard didn 't quite it and then I thought I 've had sort of lost him as a potential time and I saved he said perhaps is that the best price and I said well the best price is that there 's ten percent because that 's what I 'm working on and he said well I don 't like people who work for me working on Commission 's because the more I spend them all they get and I was feeling this golf and I said what do you have to pay me a feed then wouldn 't you said right how much do you want so I thought the vast amount of money I forty thousand dollars a year you said I 'll give you fifty out of that back best ten percent and he 'll hear jealous and he saved a whole lot in one hit and I worked with him for in whatever you like for some years and he was completely correct a deal was a deal immediately and that you hear all sorts of stories about it but those of us who 've done this is with him was in our world is because I will is ephemeral it 's only worth whatever you will pay for it whatever he is so the deal must be struck I hope about the close the deal of this star and that is terrible I mean you you were mentioning there you know some quite large figures of money done in all this ones in the art world but there are mind-boggling figures in the contemporary art world now what do you think about that whole concept of huge amounts of money millions of millions of millions and millions of dollars for contemporary artworks I don 't get it politic in the older and I started the older it 's early years and people successful people love us we 're successful very successful for art with their holiday in their pin money then money to treats now people see art as an investment as a form of teaching a market doing whatever and so I think it 's a little bit like house prices when you buy house to invest in rather than living you force the market into a different I don 't_''_2329.44 I just don 't get it you can buy the rulers something one of the greatest masters of all time for this money that you can buy Jeff Koons I don 't understand and that is partly what forced me out of the world because I can 't speak the money the language of money like that I don 't get it but you do have a wonderful collection of your own art I have a beautiful well getting yes exactly but we have another part that you do have and so how how important and what do you value in the art that actually surrounds you in your home well before I came to Kangaroo Valley it was different than it is now cycling I have invariably lived alone and so most of my art is strengthen up its pictures of people it 's German expressionist headaches it 's Nicolas carving portraits it 's very little of it is landscape and I just put it down to the fact that I was so difficult to live with at least are having an impact as are people when I came to Kangaroo Valley I discovered most of my really important pictures such as they are are on paper because I think paper is the most wonderful medium for an artist because it is in correctable once it 's there you can 't really get rid of it and that means there 's a sort of an Aegis II and excitement and if it 's a print by Picasso it 's 15 or 50 thousand dollars there 's opposed to five million dollars so it 's a wasn 't it 's affordable and when I came to Kangaroo Valley I discovered the house I live in which faces doodles and has an awful lot of Sun in it so I can 't_''_2447.38 put the pictures I want in the places I want and equally when you have gone up the bottom field garden doing whatever he does this it 's just so my damn equipment has changed I don 't know whether it means I may sell a picture instead of not but it will it 's victory the Sun on the one hand which of course is the literary the view whether it is the whole of kangaroo valley which I sort of look across at 3i which even if the rain is boring so beautiful it 's very hard for any inanimate object to compete does does that mean that your your lifetime feeling about art has actually shifted slightly coming to a beautiful place it 's changing yes before my things were the most important thing in my life I think what happens of not about maybe I 'm sure is doing a great job fashion breaks it you can tell you went enables who you 're very good at giving orders following suggestions we have a very good working relationship itself exactly and quick communication but speaking of some of the communication but in a slightly different way the value of documents and correspondence and a legacy I know that you you have accumulated much over your professional life and personal life as as individual wouldn 't we be done with them some years ago it was somebody said you should give your stuff to a gala for life and because in the in wrote to somebody a wrote back and so they were series of documents and some of us were more interesting than others I mean there 's one very celebrated Australian artist who lives in New York and one of his letters starts off no don 't put it in my Australian bank account with my Swiss bank account so when I gave my archive to the art gallery of New South Wales Edmund cable and Jeremy kept on library I said we should put an embargo back to these 10 years after that person was died and because I meant what the taxman going through this estate jewelry gifts well they shouldn 't but oh so I literally gave everything to the life to the library I think maybe even the invoices or copies of invoices certainly we get copies evaluations so we have letters from say Jeffrey smart this is a sample or from Frank Alva in London and when you give documents like that they are valued and the notional amount a sheet of paper regardless of what it is is 6% or something and then the more one of the things that I was given I written to I don 't show photography 30 years ago was great success so I wrote to I think the world 's greatest photographer of the period Ansel Adams in America and I this is asking questions like that Australian does I said dear mr. Adams I 've always loved your work if you ever considered showing in Australia I would love to show your work and I got a very nice coastguard back very quickly saying dear mr. Owen I have now retired from showing private galleries but I do wish you great luck with your gallery sign Ansel Adams on the back of his most famous photograph of the Yosemite Valley and when that went to the Art Gallery was valued for 10,000 everybody in the world we got rejected and make a really so that 's what I 'm the document and then because we of course will take clever we had a whatever they call one of those hard drives things what they are and I give those together too because recently all our correspondence has been 've done interestingly enough I did try to get into the National Library camera and I hope there 's nobody here the National Library camera but at one stage I did an exhibition is David Hockney of fax pictures David is the most fertile of minds he 's shown every time there 's a new thing he experiments with it and I would lovely be the recipient of some of his iPad and iPhone pictures which is his latest thing but he did the facts pictures and I asked him or he simply a couple of things as one of his friends he just got the fax machine separately and I said David can we do the show as well thanks pictures it won 't be for sale because they are ephemeral and we didn 't quite know how they actually and so at someone what we are like 7 o 'clock in the morning I think he was in Los Angeles I could stand by the fax machine and these things would come chugging through and I would tell him if there was one Dave 's it wasn 't I said please may I reprint these on acid-free paper rather than on fact bail so we were I was allowed to do that and so I put all the the facts the original things in you know what at like sensitive envelopes and we had the show and because they were of the ones we exhibited were on proper paper I have a whole exhibition David Hockney snapped pictures some this beam that had no real value I was the only commercial gallery in the world that did it because I asked so I wanted to give them the camera to the national library the 15 bits of paper I thought they would not have a couple six months are trying to get somebody to answer the telephone without a recording and get a reply I 'll go Iraq the art our new south wales library on a wet afternoon and the following wet morning they came around and said yes would that be wonderful thank you and it was it was wonderful and interesting enough I think we 're we 're here for exactly that it 's lovely retire that do you have any records that go back to the picture we walked 20 years ago I said I don 't they 're all in the library at the archaic New South Wales they may or may not have been catalogue have a go this man wrote send an email ten days later and said it was extraordinary I 've rang them up I told them what I wanted and they came back to me not only with my invoice as I was wanting for provenance of the picture but much more than I needed you will be pleased to know your things are in good hands and that was an extraordinary it was wonderful so any student can now go say what did you say to David Hockney did you have a fight with Nichols Harding is the reason that person came to you whatever whatever but going back to a previous question why people came to me as artists they often because their deals weren 't to pay them and an artist whose name we had mentioned that we work that she gave came to me how much you were those and I was told 40,000 and this was at a time where that was an enormous amount of money for anybody let alone a young artist and that 's my reputation they got me that happens well it 's a very fine reputation and it and it 's been lovely to share so much of the other perspectives that you 're both professional and personal life and I think we we will live with that wonderful image of you at one end of a fax line machine and and David might be across the world and the other end and those things going back and forth wonderful story so all those stories later please well more or less on the book because I do want to make sure that we have a at least just a couple of minutes of opportunity or you have to put a question on to the Rings so sweet no none at all I can 't throw straight under the ruler I was unable school we didn 't you are in big black we can see the chicken signals my me that I whipped me can we just keep down the conversations just until we do finally read past things I went to work from an ankle friend from the flu galleries which was in the forestry and he had shown Arthur wallop Drysdale everybody and he was looking back to show a group of Danny Emmanuel Phillips pops I worked for him for ten years so I got to understand the modern artists as well as the historical artists but in those days I don 't think we were selling quote-unquote art to the same degree we are now with the seven features with the mostly dealing with living people who who do things and in those days artists were just pretentious as they are happy they were sweet people who did things because they had to and came to me because they thought they might be able to sell so my experience was on the hoof I did little things like because of my English connection dog be in England and because of the three most important artists of the period frag our bar collision frying of the Jewish so I started to look at the Germans and I became a little bit known for doing some exhibitions of German expressions pictures in the last 10 years of my career so never with experience except on the booth but a lot of experience hi I appreciated working with how would you find out I think with when I was younger I might have been arrogant enough to take a stand but I wouldn 't the I think art like football or something when you confront it excites you a little bit and then you follow the excitement I still when I go to the greatest galleries in the world I don 't go to see if you 're Francesca or Picasso I wander around and look at the things that engaged me and if they engage me ideal I never said to them this is art I basically said this is something I like you might like it and some of course some of what I liked was bait based on what was in museums art history them I don 't think you can say what art is data these were the first people that were the cause of all horrible experiencing in the art was not when everything is art if you decide those are the grapes voice of Dada I think was Andre Breton wrote about as a young I think it was Man Ray a young photographer if he would photograph some of the Garber objects he 'd been given because he wanted to have a record well so this young photographer went to his house and he looked at these steers bits of stuff that everybody thought was absolute hell and he photographed them and I said of course I can 't afford to pay you but I will give you a lovely left so the photographer enjoyed the lovely lunch and then we 're done so and when they I seen the photographs music sorry I didn 't have my camera but as you know it 's the idea I hope so the answer is if it excites you that 's a stunt and then you look and you listen to other people because we ain 't always right thank you thanks Chris the last exhibitions you put on the various estates and really sublime and I was just wondering if you could comment on where you see Australian people at the back here that question yeah yep great they can I think in all honesty we don 't make the international scene very much and if you 've seen the show of Australian landscape painting at the Gotham Academy five years ago you would know why it was terrible but interesting enough before Williams became celebrated as he is now let 's say 25 years ago the people that in London would certainly have know the city number he the Great Australian painter but if you now go to the Tate and you go to the National the Pater they want to see his friend videos because freight Sid provided us with the icon with named Kelly which was extraordinary to love it was the easiest way of telling the Australian story and then Fred Williams will uh pastor there 's an awful lot of Australia and it has been looked at and it 's being realized in a realistic way which Fred made this short cab in fact he basically said there is nothing out there you have to make it in the studio so what his landscape painting is is really an invention from the mind but if you actually fly over Australia and you see these little beads of shadow flying all over the thing you realize was one of my friends said Fred Williams design Australia there is this extraordinary abstraction that it 's actually strangely visual and for those people who don 't know for it 's worth particularly their little as it were calls a pigeon all over the landscape but if you 've got a gum tree the only thing that 's tangible about it is the little shadow of the leaves at the top the trunk is almost invisible so you see just this little ball of stuff and when you see a strong line in fragrances paintings it 's where there has been a creek around which trees have grown and of course being Australia the creek is drying up and the trees have usually been burned and they fall so you get through droughts with these little and the walls of thing and they are so evocative that that 's you know the metropolitan New York has I think three or four big Williams 's which are often hanging among Lily York school of abstraction and he is the artist step more thoughtful people have roared their life and they still listening no strange enough they don 't know half of all at all London lives a bit about Arthur boy without the lived there and of course he lived here and interesting enough local knowledge the man I work for to Galus vault Thunderman and I would work for him during the week and he would try to get me to come down the weekend to blow his grass and I said Frank I 'm prepared to work for you for money but I don 't want to work for you for nothing so I didn 't come down and I actually find the bundle of landscape slightly intimidating it is that dry crisp Chauvet the landscape which is I don 't empathize with whereas I love the lushness of the down the coast from what I used to call tree Kiama and we couldn 't believe this I 'm sorry we are actually going to have to wrap it up though I 'm just going to say we couldn 't leave it at a better forties then the description of Malone howl and and on a war now that you have begun between between the well between everybody in the shop yes so we 've had some wonderful insights and some wonderful stories legs together please thank Richard and thank you all very much _"

they have to let go of warm-up and waning we have for the next week are to reach them if they hold on to the current bar or reach to the next bar the timing will be off and they can fall he said they sweet one trusting the timing of the swing not all of us turbulence but now experiences of letting go may feel very much like being suspended in air with nothing to hold on to it is wrong [Music] the practice of not clinging it is free a swing from bar bar and wordlessly in perfect trust and perfect timing many kind of honing forward the paragraph gives us the opportunity to let go and find some

    "text": "[Applause] thank you so much for the very I I think we would all agree having looked at this show that there is a remarkable degree of resonance of connection between these two bodies of work is a I think similar kind of thinking and attitude to process to thinking about a location and landscape in place so I 've got a few things that I 'd like to talk about I 'm going to also leave some time for you to ask questions because I 'm sure we 've probably got a few you can put to to the artists but I think one of the good places to start when you talk about a show like this that represents a pretty rule-based body of work is to get just a simple sense of where this work came from what some of the ideas were that led to its creation and I guess selection for this show so tomorrow perhaps we could start with you if you could just talk a little bit about the work that 's in the show whatever resistant terms of when you are making has selected for inclusion in the show Stan probably about a decade of Maya practice some of my earliest works Chism my Marissa works I guess across the entire time my works a boy is dealt with the idea or the things of humans and the way we relate to nature and over the course of that time my the way that I 've approached the shoots has has changed in the beginning I am I took people into a landscape that have had them you 're forming in a way and now I 've sort of evolved that thematically taken away the narrative a little bit from being within this shot itself and made it more whenever a broader narrative about humanity being a part of nature and I 'm just really trying to refine that idea in the way so just in terms of the works that this sequence through the show I think representative of one sequence of works or is this representative work overtime yeah so they sit quite comfortably together but there is I 've moved from through a very a variety of different I perhaps six different bodies of work represented so Richard had security showed when I called my trilogy of works which were the first three main series that I made for us drinking dimensions in the landscape and that 's the illumination which is the chandelier and apparitions which was working with the penny projector in the landscape and projecting historical paintings onto the actual landscape at different locations around Australia and then Eastern interiors which is the mirrored work where I traveled with that mirror from the edge of the Blue Mountains followed the pathways of the first explorers through what they called at that time when east of interior 's Australia which was a completely unknown down to all Brio movement Victorian quarter and place that area that locations that different explorers had written about dementia and so yeah there was a kind of evolution from the first series of the chandelier through to these series so it 's that 's 2015 and then the video web transformation was made in 2018 which is my latest installment of an ongoing series called my body works I used my figure to environment and the internal kind of landscape being reflected in the external and that 's biotic relationship between the north our ecology and the health of the environment that we coexist in what do you feel that when you tomorrow 's what resonates with you in the sense that some connects to what you knew I was just telling tomorrow that a friend of ours back in 2010 so I thought those works when I was doing a residency in Finland and you know I instantly recognized a similar you know exploration of creative narrative in landscape and kind of interrupting and to look at tomorrow 's welcome to the decade bold exploration that she achieved I really admire at the progression in the evolution that 's you know started with those building works at the back to these huge works here that 's beautiful and technique and also exploration including Morpheus and merging into so I 've enjoyed them well I have only recently been introduced to Nicole 's work through this exhibition which has been a beautiful way to come into it because our work sits so symbolism in the way that she 's really cool Nicole 's really refined what she says in these works without having to overburdened with much interference oh yeah really I love the aesthetic qualities and I love the way she references history and colonialism and the things that yeah that I find interesting I see I see a connection in the work that you 're both making when you engage with the landscape is a place that can stage a moment for the camera the actual stage and if you like by the way the mirrors and rejections inside saying your work with the finish and an action so that way we should now step into teasing out the differences so Nicole could you talk a little bit about how you conceive of a site for a series of works or for a single work and hanging sort of go through the idea of producing say windermere pieces I think I 've to go back to the illumination series residency at Hill and which it 's a gold-mining town but it 's quite a harsh landscape and when I went amount of ornate antique furniture that was still there in the houses and what struck me with the shanties in the houses and just the effort that they must have gone to in the 1890s to get centaurians across the mountains to have this sense of hire to have the sense of Europe or England or wherever it was that they 'd come from and so from that I imagined the idea of taking that thought and making it into a work by placing each entity the landscapes around that region so the elimination series these in and around like your land and Baptist do you do you remember the kind of that idea crystallized and you would take you do this they would take the chandelier and find this location I do yeah I do I get really vivid visuals about my work before I make it and I did I just basically I saw in Craig it 's called Cragen cottage which is this beautiful cottage in England that very wealthy miner built to resemble a hunting lodge from Scotland and it was sitting in the middle and still that and three we lived in it up until I think the 1960 [Music] and shade ELISA there and I just remember going through that and then contemplating and just seeing a shanty in the landscape then so [Music] peddle businesses so tow trucks are cranked so tomorrow you need is the location what comes first is the location location helps funnily enough I started my first series ritualism on a residency in Neyland so it is a nice little connection there often for me to make when I started making series work I had had my children I just had my kids and so for me to be able to get the time to make a body of work I needed to step outside of the lock domestic life and instead of like time to do it and so the location really did certainly in the beginning inform where I went it was like where are the series because I should have placed myself somewhere and then make a work I mean I guess they 're quite site responsive work certainly you know nature is and that was residency oh that would be where I would start and then I find to the people that I needed to make so in the beginning it was my friends they they would either be there or I 'd make friends in the area and and that they were my characters but then as my practice has evolved I 've kind of had to switch it around in some cases where I find the people and then I find the location the middle ground in that way but yeah how it starts yeah so you both go out and these ideas personalized me if you make them happen in different ways I wanted to talk to you both about a team selection of images for series what 's the Congressional to finish pieces complete sequence works it 's a challenge I guess in a series that we to get the final choices often when I can do that editing process it 's process of refinement so I kind of edit down in blocks and then ultimately I tend to choose the one that I have the most intuitive response to so small amount of photographs that end up on the wall compared to the process that it took to get to that place and often I 'm working in a process that leads to an exhibition and so there 's a certain amount of words that I would be able to kind of work in a space and yeah but sometimes it 's not quite as simple you know my name to the series has there were two exhibitions and kind of had a process that went in a different way do you work in a similar way I mean what about photography it 's the the room to fail so I will often read these it aside and because it 's experimental often I 'll do it two three times to work out the tick and and fail and Drive myself crazy going back to locations and experimenting but I love that about photography because you can take those photos and you can leave room to experiment and again a very tight selection around four ends up on the wall but then you know because of space and need to images in the catalog and graces tonight to those to those who just feel a bit orphaned from this series fee and you still got love for them they 're out of the sequence because sometimes they have something you know you need to offer and so I do you think about sometimes going back reworking do you work with the same ratio as tomorrow in terms of the number of shots I think for me because for instance if I 'm going and setting up a projection I 'll set it up at 00 p.m. and then shoot maybe from fall right through to 9 p.m. and because light and change and also the weather so I just yeah I shoot for several hours and I think something happened in terms of my career started jumping and when in terms of my process all of those photographs that I 'm taking I don 't expect to walk in and get the photograph that I 'm going to exhibit at the beginning of a shoot that then entire shoot with Joplin for me is a couple of hours also that process of actually warming the people up in the landscape but you know it 's a they 're not necessarily all being taken to be the final image they 're working towards a a moment where everything kind of comes together and so even though I 'm taking lots I 'm not necessarily thinking that every one of those could be the new images it 's a process of bringing that things together to a point do you know that moment I know when it 's passed it 's a very transition and then I know my hope that I 've achieved it but I know when it 's over as well and often that 's the light has dissipated so let 's talk a little bit other people will be in pictures who are kind of things do you get them to do know through that that war so these days I tend to put call-outs for my models on social media or through channels that I 'm able to access so they 're often just everyday people would be everyone in this room probably some people and what visual references to what what I 'm sort of trying to look for in a shoot and so that there 's some frame of reference that they 're ensuring the process with so for instance with this series image here I was trying to create an image where I had people underwater that were sort of looking like a tornado of fish those images of it so I said pretty better to that or paint only references not saying this is what I wanted to create but just funky but vague idea so that gives a framework for how they approach it and see themselves in relationship to the environment and so with this one also there was a lot of direction in terms of I didn 't want necessarily a frontal position I wanted it to be federal government their side flank so that I had more of a sense of them related to the fish shape and and finding the balance of nudity where I find it it 's it 's where the nudity 's the attention to itself which sounds weird but he don 't point that image itself holds a American were a space that doesn 't put it into a sexually charged we present a series of imaging sequence it does tense just even a very abstract story one perhaps that 's quite useful [Music] together they create this sense of completeness a series of talk a little bit about how you think about that series of in any sequence of having an exhibition I 'm engaging history and landscape the landscape trying to kind of make sense of that bloated what if it Australian in Australia it 's really fluid and reasoning history money came to my organization so there 's that and then there 's an argument placing an object you 've even the landscape we did the landscape to kind of draw that out or speak to that so for me it 's operating on two levels I 'm I 'm thinking about that the research the plains the history and then I 'm and then I 'm just trying to work it out you know how this is going to fit into the landscape and between my works between the series in sets of three call them trilogies there 's a narrative so the illumination series has an area that continues into the apparitions of many to the aged materials and then it kind of feels like Star Wars when you do a trilogy as a result so how do you think about the sequencing of all the works for series how things will progress there through that image processing this is the way to a little bit about hanging you go through that process it 's hard to speak broadly focus on finding the different series that are represented he have different ways of doing that just perhaps as a starting point so in a nature series I created this body of work as a as a site responsive work in the Adelaide Botanic Gardens for the biennial the 2018 and way Adelaide biennial from Australia and so I guess I went into that wanting to create a broad narrative of relating the human figure to natural forms and creating a relationship between the use tries to fuse those together to make the point that we are part of nature so kind of using the different ages and stages of the human life cycle and the life cycle of the plant so I went and revisited the gardener 's through each season I 'd arrived because there were so many changes in the garden period I 'd have to arrange all of the models that I was going to bring in based around age groups so I had like kids I had young people I had 80 plus group of people actually that 's three people but two excellent people and so I think that one I chose the models first because I had to define it or something I 'd arrived and I would just walk those Gardens like I 've never walked anywhere before just observing every single little thing trying to find relationships that have been all so that they 're able to represent the season and the human element so yeah the the narrative in those is a broader narrative and then I would try and find ways that I found kind of elegantly told that the story in summer I wanted an image that emphasises the left so it 's a sacred lotus pond at in a different part of its life cycle and that was in fact the this was the first pond that the first in first location I thought that inspired the whole series and I was walking through the garden once we laughs around my gallerist who 's yes and and we came across this pond and and it was just one of the best phenomenal things up seeing them so that kind of gave birth to the whole idea of the series and for that pond because of the flowers and the life and the feeling that I got from that from inside I wanted to create an image that was like kind of kind of stood a little bit out of my usual tonal range and Tenace summer-like feelings it was like youth and summer and kind of trying to represent it in that way so they 're like little narratives we need a bigger narrative that 's seasonal yes trying to be the structure that 's right yeah and I loved I mean the contrast between those two spring this image of that pond in spring as well and and which I went to do one of the other things that I raised before we we started today that maybe course devoted some concern was a credit was a question about I guess what I call an ethical consideration about intervention by that I meant a lot of photographers and artists have a philosophy of non-intervention completely unintentional recording but is marked by intervention into the place either through performers or with your scott 'll mirrors and protections and so on so it 's wondering if we could talk a little bit about your thinking about that I mean I guess one aspect impact in the intervention actually I think it 's a good question and it is something that is with me when I go into the landscape and creative intervention because I 'm talking about colonization and the force of that process culture and that history is has been played out on that landscape and so when I 'm thinking about the ethics of how I go in and create an intervention I 'm very conscious work and then I was speaking to and I really loved photography that is pure that there is an intervention just captured the landscape I 'm really inspired by the movements photographers and the way that they create connection to place through staying in a location and photographing it but I guess photography is intervention you know to use to set up a tripod and to caption something with a photograph that even self it 's a kind of intervention and so I I 'm taking it to the next level of making it very clear that I 'm creating a Jasta position by placing something into the landscape you know and I hope to through that juxtaposition to get people thinking about the way that thank you and respond and relate to and escaping the environment in this country beyond to appreciating it as a beautiful image and that 's why symbolism like earrings reflect that gilding which is the European kind of and that history that came the colonization to this country of let 's claim that stands let 's frame let 's turn it into a commodity all the journals many Flores they 're writing about you know it was all about whether this landscape could be made into a commodity to save the colony because they were running out of ferment and they have to get across the mountains and explore these two interior to to survive so yeah you know I think I understand what you say and landscape ancient history and residence doesn 't always need intuition but in my work I kind of get excited by innovation yeah the optical nature of it and I think we may even the landscape when walking through it we 're an innovation sure sure I just did obviously landscape is not a neutral tournaments related genres related to art history and even without physical intervention on the part of the photographer 's guys their students are composition and subject or culturally you know very imploded in terms of this election middle so in the history but I was this one thing tomorrow ago thinking about I guess it 's just in the process of making work there 's obviously a very significant moment I find I that we are a part of the landscape and that involves bringing people into the landscape because you know as humans and in this sort of society that will they begin today it 's so divorced and I I feel like I need in my work I 'm trying to remind myself and people that we are actually a part of this world that we see ourselves as they 're pretty so in in my works I sort of see the landscape as though that device to bring people together and to kind of try and become a part of visually but also as a character that the people in the to negotiate often people will get scratch dollars in a certain amount of discomfort the environment does impact on we impact on that environment they eating plants on the people so I find it what I think they have ethics I instantly go back to my my roots is working in the media and the code of ending except that that kind of photography is a photojournalist or a documentary photographer kind of demands and so it 's a this because sort of his code of ethics that I went I subscribed to so almost so fervently and then to actually start working the way that I have as represented on these walls I had to completely turn my back on that that approach and and I started seeing the landscape as a as a stage and so yeah I guess I 'm drawing on all of those art histories of the landscape but then kind of tryna tell my story within it well you provide me with perfect segue because you were mentioning your your career as a photojournalist one of the things that always strikes me about the house is that they look at other artists work so there 's wondering if you could both perhaps talk about some of the possible targets were influential than you you know if they can 't develop and so how you kind of move through that influence into your own if you like but I have to say I 'm mostly influenced by in cinema and staging and and I couldn 't name any particular come take a team I _''_2057.33 I still but I I love his nuance and whether he creates narrative and for photography I could name a lot of different photographers but I 'll go back to the first which was the year nine art class and study Tracy Moffat iconic series and having to you at the end yeah photography it 's a tricky one a lot of my early influences were from a photo journalistic well so Mary Ellen mark and a number of photographers mostly American who were really representing humanity and and the kind of an array of cultures and and socio-economic groups and just like getting this fundamental sense of humanity and I guess intimacy was something that I really looked for in my in my work and so that was the foundation in photography kind of way Tracie Moffitt 's work as well but painterly references are brutal even stronger strongly influences generally Waterhouse pre-raphaelites that would be where this is strongest aesthetic preference did you feel like there was a point in the progress of your workers and harvest is distinct from the other or if you would do I your influences that you yeah I felt really distinctly I feel that he might be now nature series for me that really I feel I feel like it 's a very hard thing to make original work and I feel like I really achieved at in that series and that 's not something I say lightly it 's taken a long time to be able to say that but I just really feel like bringing references together that are not neutral they 're not obvious necessarily but for me they 're resolved in the image this is there a similar point for you for me as a writer for whenever a lot of artists they 're influenced by people would inspire by people who we were working in an area that were working themselves one of the early work is very much regulation as much as that history and some say Tracy Moffat I feel to answer that question I feel that the transformation yeah nice one yeah yeah I feel that that 's tapped into something that is uniquely mines that comes from the the first series of photographs in 2010 with a scholarship on when that which was really about mortality at the life cycle in which the East really colonizing women men and children but for me that we so I was kind of connecting into that and I 've continued that series through and the transformation film is presented at the end me walking through the landscape and I think to be comfortable when I 'm making I enjoy my looking [Music] well to confront you have to at the end of the day creativity in its essence is a gift and a wonderful thing to do and I I just do it to it whatever way you want to do it main point it 's much less reduced to be by others or lock yourself down on whatever works to help that process happen I think um those mind viruses that you can get I mean I completely agree with everything the code says I personally just recently coming off the coming out of the series they 've been doing underwater and saying well what next we 're getting myself in there in a real some friends and their children very recently and just going out and taking photographs that just the act of that has now given me the momentum to move into a new work new series and so just yeah getting out there however you do work but actually just starting even if what you 're doing isn 't it where you imagine it will end up just starting this that 'll create its own momentum brilliant for us thank you so let 's let 's open it up to two questions yes if they did make it they 're not on the walls Bob is showing a bubble again at night I am I was very very fond of my meter so there was I would put them in foliage in what was called the wild western garden in a plant called dusty miller and it was the turns of it worked quite silvery and I had them actually had to move through the landscape you know a whole lot of different ways it was one of the most beautiful shoots I 've ever done as if you were standing I the image where they were sort of folding down into the landscape and their hair was sort of the same color as the fall the inch but there was some when you talk about the orphaned children of when you mentioned the photographs you leave behind there is a photograph that was within that shoot I hold very dear to my heart that has had no place in out in the world but I 've actually had my kids collect those helicopter seeds and I took the bag and these helicopter seeds over with me for that shoot because I wanted to have these seeds flying through the air while they were dancing in the landscape these George ends up but this incredibly light and I just it 's a very beautiful moment of George and Elizabeth dancing in their own little worlds together with these seeds falling in all their glory that was winter but that 's why yeah but that 's why I ended up choosing with the editing process now you I have to be very very particular with why I choose the images and the story chose where they went closer to the the foliage and folding down to enjoy this day I 've got a question for both of you I love both of your works there really resonated with me and I see a sense of Lee sublime in your works but not from a masculine and viewpoint more female feminine viewpoint and as you were saying earlier about that intervention into the landscape for me it 's a real sense of immersion even though you 've got objects within that there 's something feminine about it as well which I find really intriguing desert is having your work and or do you see yourself being a feminist voice I 'm aware I cannot representing myself you never see my face because I don 't want to be identify this name and it comes well for me it 's the romantic painters romanticism and often the pig is in a romantic painting you sing they 're back they 're not big banks and the idea of the sublime is both in their individual and so for me I 'm conscious that and bringing that the or inspiring power of nature which i think is really relevant now at a time when experiencing you know bush fires and all the climate change and the issues that I was also talking about you know nature 's make sure it 's wild and it really is at the end of the day in control like to mention that we are but in terms of feminine it 's not conscious but I 'm aware of how representing nothing and these works not so much did you want me to yeah so I guess from the beginnings of my work I was brought up in a family with very strong female my mom has been credible so an amazing role model with sisters much of my early work was just for women and I had to push myself to include men to challenge myself in fact it was my son that inspired me to do that because he was my first sort of introduction to the two boys really and and so there is definitely a feminine and feminist basis in my work this particular shoot I was intentionally know to be just all women in this shoot like a tornado showing the power of women in being a voice for climate change climate action I think as mothers there 's a I dunno I just think there 's a sense of care for the earth that women have to thank you good time for some more questions thank you very much for your time today I just wanted to get a sense of what was your biggest challenge that you feel you 've overcome to get your pieces to the stage because there 's so many levels of complexity and for young people today to see that it just doesn 't appeal you know that social media aspect of everything 's perfect what are your struggles what 's maked one thing you overcome okay to get to this amazing place that you now I think that happens really complicated we 're trying to resolve recently I 've shot a film in infrared 4,800 photos time-lapse but which is complex in a storm in infrared which is really complex so I can think of two very creative things so I joined the Sydney Morning Herald in my early days I had to go from being a photographer who sort of just hid around the edges of things trying to take pictures without people noticing to having to walk into a situation and direct grown adults thank and I can see myself as they 're grown out on at that point sorry just that transition from being I guess from pushing through to sort of be able to at least appear as though I was I knew what I was doing when I was in those situations and that was the biggest gift that I got from that entire over a decade with with better on being able to take a command in a situation if things aren 't going the right way appearing for the sake of my models that they are and yeah the other more recently which is another different level was I 'm actually quite scared of being in the ocean and not very confident and so in this entire series my endangered series was pushing myself into places that I was critically uncomfortable terrified sometimes just having the idea of what I wanted to achieve and just going okay well I 'm just going to suck it up and make this happen one last question you have basically now that you put some bodies work together have a structure where you have a most like a time table what you have to deliver the next series and if you do how does that impact on you know the pressure that they would put on you and you begin to do the knot I 'm incredibly fortunate to have Martin as my gallerist who is very has you know been working in this area for very long time and very understanding of the artisans process and I 've had no pressure on me whatsoever to be able to say I 'm doing this next so there are obviously the constraints of being a full-time artist and relying on that as an income that played to my you know my realistic ideas of how I 'm going to make a living in the world but in terms of coming up with it all the pressure for that the scheduling of showing this flexible it can get tricky if I 'm doing it for coming up with new work for a group show that I 've been curating into and there is exhibition date but like tomorrow it 's more the pressure that I put on myself and the expectations that I have around what it is that I 'm doing and creating and what it what it needs to be more so than any external pressure and I 'm really particular about not letting scheduled exhibitions interfere with the process and the work so I feel like I need to extend and push a sideshow to a later date because the work being experimentally nature needs more time then I 'll do that I think for me it 's really important to not be on a treadmill okay we 're really gonna have to in there please join me [Applause] _"

the car by my side as a result of a walking trail near a new car a great area will south of narrow down and totally acclaimed from the two mill area in general terms that point quickly to help what we have around the state is everybody 's acutely aware is to be drought conditions of ice conditions have been infested by the number a number of useful commodity she has to be likable and I put a huge amount of stress on reliably barns and vegetation commercially speaking I 'm sure you can all insist that changes to the local environment and we 've seen only the last two points to save significant in a triple and lake Bowl and vegetation stretch who 's assisting help well this is consuming career bar is currently sitting in one hundred thirty six thousand hectares is as I said they think there are just over a month now and despite every eight a text by all the agencies involved with his firefight has seen impossible to contain well I must say however it 's the amount of work that 's gone here by all the firefighting agencies not all of our service but all of our sister agencies Fire Rescue national parks and wildlife safe chorus as well as being supported by other agencies even around the state and also external to the state naturally as far as Victoria whiskers Freya also Northern Territory Tasmania and also easily locally we also have a benefit of having our specialist stills number of people coming from America another position needs to management team and special school such as planning an aviation supervision and management so it 's truly an international of it and he 's truly a unbelievable conglomeration of different people from different walks of life from all different agencies spoke through the needs of the management team itself and also their local communities that this fire is impacting one of the big things to point out is the fact that regardless of which agency where people are coming from is purely a bag of scenario what I mean by that because everybody has come together they 're not bringing with them any personal agendas or company into this organization agendas but everybody is proudly working together seamlessly in support of their child develops support that we 've had from the local community and all the organizations within the community is suspect second to none he made a support that the water services themselves are perceived out of a photograph it 's also singing tonight it is really pleasing as it 's been management that Hawaii control that I can stand up here and say he 's truly a unified team of his ladies event as well as the garden girls having a partner depending upon our soul so each of the actual incident that we 're dealing with the car ran far and their number of pieces a scene speed chipping progression of the vod 's the south as the 've experienced on numerous occasions to see that fire run across to the East Coast and he makes severely onto the coastal villages from Barriss frigid including like the barrier from that point always Wallace continued in blank '_''_642.6 progressing the bull alliteration crews managed to consign the body generally to the west of the faces long way they have to be thrown to slow boats and farmers well my worst and that continues as we speak today with a large number of qualifying effort they need a fire to the west of the pieces highway in Kentucky significant back cleaning operations over a 15 kilometer stretch the weather conditions to where it 's 50% over the next four days is horrible we currently got today but the worst seen gently over the next three days old lady by Monday we will see significant fire behavior occurring where each seeking to see upwards is doing it possibly into the 40 degree temperatures out around the area followed by on Tuesday a strong southerly change for anybody they can remember the Goswick to Saturday we had a significant traffic weather conditions why go to the compartment of change our baggage is also burning in the area become a baby may fire bar a keeping a spike vision which is a drive by the song sitting above the car itself that poverty newest also can generate and dust interacted the activity which can also sufficed and just like associated with any rainfall but it also creates erratic winds speeds and directions out on the fire ground making the firefighting effort even more treacherous someone already is the fire itself is experiencing up as I said we 've also had the comet Empire become an employer currently sits in the southeast now Jewish to the other across several it 's stickier than two and a half thousand hectares and it continues to burn internally we do have a contain twine around that last backfire however given the topography the vegetation and the dryness of the area it continues to cross spot fires outside that line and it 's also coated with in plate anybody who 's had anything to do with far any easy plate although that pete burns very much and birds root systems and it can come up up to 20 to 50 meters away from where actually we 're not the ground it 's a very beautiful fall upon me at ease it 's something we continue to monitor and to attend salute we 're using aviation assets as well as on the ground but these are not significant drying on the results of prefer already stretched to attend and the quality in the both conceives with the blown away slowly against northwesterly winds that we currently have two wars the Shoalhaven river at this point in time as far as I can estimate is about quite modest to the south of the Ohio River but it is likely that that fire will approach the Shoalhaven River and main cross at any time but the BOC I 'm here to exactly this you know each other but there 's just so many variables to actually dictate how and when that occurs that it is impossible for me to do so we do have a body a groundless constantly analyzing the weather conditions Assissi be estimated duration the fire paths and but as I said with so many variables with we screws changing with the cooler conditions overnight with vegetation changes even around the fire ground it 's unknown exactly when the fire will get to the dam or the river and if it 'll cross if so who sends us a light it is possible that they River main goal holes that contain one and we are attempting to use that as an example one now one of the big issues with fire body commissioning digits of spot priority me we have seen during this event smoke was very up as well kilometers in front of the fire cross that alone tells you that already that pull out you have post conditions exist that going to be spotting across the name so we watching them intently and we 'll be dealing with ice as soon as they occur if they occur so what does that mean that means that everybody in this community and every community north of the solvent River run through including the kangaroo valley area and all the outskirts you should be increasingly aware of the situation to get the upper hand and contained on this bottom line we will continue the work on the contain of strangers weeks behind including back waiting operations where sue but he 's doing that we 're also very mindful by lighting fires in front of the fire we can advance the five so he 's going to be done under very very strict conditions it 's going to be done under the right weather conditions and when will only leave we 're actually currently doing that along favorite money to have to kick the fire to the west of the south of our area furthers that the the day for everybody to be vigilant also comes the fact that everybody needs to be prepared as I said it is highly likely that this file across the northern side of the subway in that the fire part of the circle leads playing upbeat flute a very belly and then even further northwards up into the battery plateau and through up to Pedroia calls a resolute the bus around any sort of vegetative community whether it 's conducive and consistent with the vegetated area needs to have a bushfire plan in place and know what you are going to do and you think that you will be affected by this far for me choosing to stay the bigger property is a significant one debate for those of you who have ever beaten a fire front especially one of this magnitude it is a hammering invasive building it is not something easy and not something to take on board lightening your property must be birdie we know that we can you pouring that on you to have that plan in place to so protect yourself to have you got explain to read remove fuel and the likes of that what isn 't able to be told to you is just how basically prepared you must be yourselves to undertake that fire it is a potentially devastating thing to go through it is its own staining tonight if the extremely pleased strained voice they difficulty in breathing because of the smoke you have to be physically and mentally prepared to the other undertake that before you choose to stay in the big your property can provide anybody you can receive and asking themselves the question is if you are in doubt your question yourselves your best option is to leave and leave early the absolute last thing we want is the motor service whether it be the art piece or any of the emergency services is to have anybody on the ride at the point of the pot I actually give 90 mold esseker around the world for input people 's one of those straight watering vehicles and the locks and the city takes energy tonight priests come across waves prepping accidents happen you can 't turn around because the pipe runs behind you we end up having our people died or dying or severely Egypt from that sort of activity so again lady early is the best most regarded option for anybody that 's not prepared on the south side of the park we obviously have the vilest cross the Kings Highway that boy continues to burn and under the conditions that we received debating that northwesterly wind is pushing that fire down around the back end and never you again you will a mode warning home to watch tonight they specifically provide area of the fire-god area around Batemans Bay and all points south and I go in the moment could come out the impact in the current weather conditions over the next few days so again additional resources are being poured into the area and crews are currently working in that area as much as possible even the topography in nature to try and bring that fire and other control versus slow its progress as I said before we 're using aggregation assets on this fire and happy from the start we 're using the large energy because the many would have seen around the area maybe fish the aircraft as well as helicopters and we know very very well supported by the local defense being patronized albatross we have a fully scaled up any base operating base and they 're supporting is supporting the use of the basement and a magnetar am actually equipping the base and reloading of those aircrafts epitome concentration so where to from here what we 're looking at as the cities the possibility of the and around this area route bozos has the boat warnings that we move through the area we will give everybody as much notice is perfectly possible of any bigger than the fire in and around this area however it shouldn 't be your only means of saying abreast of the situation by for everybody finally push last of all planned transistor radios genes ABC no more and other local radio stations and listening to the advice and the break into the curve from time to time that 's why tonight 's service is increased and emergency warnings are issued wherever possible we will try and get as much notice to allow people to get up and give you the new positive if you are prepared and you were preparing to leave that now is the time to do so however the police again do not rely on it it is not always possible a spot by the decoder take hold very very quickly and the first message you get may be to shelter in place what I do ask is what those messages go about and it 's been very piece of people get updates about advice we do not issue that advice lightly but as I said before we don 't want people on the road at the time of any party taking a substance major if we say it 's children Westie needs shelter in place it is your safest option to be despite your own plans in that area what we know is that basically read some way either the old way the far east and where he 's running to what I 'll do is open up some questions have been in the room now and taking you guys on board if you have your own specific issues that you wish to discuss members of the team is standing by after the meeting and take those questions on one-on-one but if there 's any general ones you wish to have answered please feel free okay so relation to panel cuts we did not cut the power off power is only ever cut when a system infrastructure is down because of the fire order the likes of that so cleaning up tree falls across a power line it will be time we have as part of the Emergency Operations Center liaison officers from all of our companies on both they do have extra infrastructure in place on him to be able to deal with any section Magnusson either structure reflected infrastructure that they have that backing them so that part of Pakistan through the we declare excitedly the guys from sunny now may be up for a number of ales a number advising with bad situations but again we do not cut the power off the minute in the yes only question was in relation to when it and how the leave the valley should be choice to do so again lady early is the best option plan Eagle Road out is also in married it 's all being asked on the the ardèche website and also councils website and we will try and pick them up today by now as you may have as much as possible please be aware the rice flows at very short notice the princess always had to be placed on numerous occasions we 've had people stuck at motion and either in the cell close and that hard ways to tune the asking price upwards of the month because of the damage the Baris course is the right way and the embankments and the do stabilization of the the aprons of that fire in relation to the balanced pacifically and to the bar up and around the cube again that 's funny my screen and control but again apps such as the boys he made counter Miss website will tell you whether the highways open applies and again adhering to the Boston office and other additional services on the ground [Music] you talk it relaxes your own voice a little bit but things are made of resort the way you like itit in areas where we do have people that are gotta be affected by law we will set up a bank you bison sinners we haven 't_''_1470.66 during this slide I have posted up from time to time all the time off planets find a lot and they 'll be an X has to be their target list or not we need the value within other areas with either solvent are you 'll also see the terminology ripped on those side box he needs a place of last resort it is nice you can the guys who if you 're on Bush lost the bottle plane got as a boy you were stuck in between way you wanted to go and they do debate in an emergency situation it is a place for you begun when you can have some height and thing out with survival possible the man he 's not something where there 's going to be the puppy Trump refused to leave me be they just say he 's also a place that may not even have a car truck man we will try obviously get boy Preston in 84 and we will do everything we can to clean time the theis neighborhood cycle places will give you some pool and clearing around here too this rotation was possible with a natural clearing to actually smog the Bagram if you get stuck how much did you can release it what 's next okay question is related to what 's enacted at what size can we put the increase water exiting and the south where look like the by putting back like ally or people over to the houses around the area we considered and rice have a lot of other to watch tonight wait fully awake when we 're this far now it 's it 's it impossible the majority of the time when you guys for watching night is to give a hike precursor be to some angle or more vigilant attention to the fact that fires probably on the move and debris those main to follow a place to see where it 's moving to me that 's likely to affect you like nation as for the Titus again we will give as much practical notice as we can but again if it 's a spot RIT disappearing place or locality that may only be a matter of time yes minutes he whether they comment on whether we should expect the mobile network to go down in relation to like all communications on but we do though with the counties where the relator starts ah that 's out for the indications we had through the we show that they replace like scenario structures will protect it with asset protection designers and food bosses in any cases where that 's another barrier for instance exactly in the bottom five areas we sleep hey there 's this house will be down in that past the time protection area but we are in question the protection by laying a responsible protection however it also might city the banks of these telecommunication sites most generally seal the top of Richland payout items ooh all right so this possible if I may go down a date wrong so again not relying on technology and talking amongst ourselves having you back up plants transistor radios are operated by battery tawanda or old food business that insuring he got back up the Solis should the telecommunications a modern technology files and this place is on the width of the actual beta I would say the vicinity of upwards of fifteen to twenty plumbers widening past we are taking you see that fly in the axilla point so operations at the moment up around main road money soon Albatros road is to try the south side of the river and Danville pointed buyer that will actually bring that bar it 's more of a needle shape and hopefully combined with hopefully favorable weather conditions either boat and then they stomach nice and with all the ways I think we need all that far to the south all the riddles [Music] that will occur at any stage so again having that system in place not relying on that watch an act because yes people eat asleep we understand that we will look at us and we will change that we have a 7 operation and that can change the audience on I achieve so we can you stick those northwest we wish to continue right through the evening it was going to be a hot spell walk through that baby and his thoughts on the suddenly change comes through late on Tuesday that the directional change will get some abatement from the heat of that day so again he 's hopeful in other parts of the point unlikely to be the progress of the fire that I would love a little more westerly conditions there are so many variables that people still need to be aware and still want to conditions wherever possible we do have other options serum absolutely necessary mediation disuse which is the emergency warning system across rolling mass channels but they gave now a lot of people I can tell you buddies right guys are on the larger sizes they advanced Terry Bozzio I 'm just wondering how many aircraft begins to bring this okay Melissa high do Stannis 's previously mentioned we have been using you know you guys when we do the first hour of this event within the first half now we had outposts in Delhi but for all that far at the heart of the photo we 've had up to 25 a drop currently we have three of the six meatballs with wisely too small by seedlings and and lenka 's assisted by three other and icy wind and antagonists which made the land on the runway and get ready filled but probably uses a lot of games legs we 've have an 8x8 on during the five three of us plus the very large time we have to show you those resources with all the other events that are happening through detail files and it is determined on priority break the law and property I said how they disseminated I can show you that at this point is on given the father 's on the lands that we need Southwest easy possible to confine these laws people to Connor banks have we had to begin a Barney Barney because we need to make a profit is a tool we use it of in conjunction with my as well as other nations back when these I said to try and see these water in community rather than actually attacked the farm you will see over the next two days the fog line would roll from technical and back coding operation stupids a trip and I can eat rice spread and poverty they infected and they would roll back into the basic block for your instructions that are gonna come on Dicky back to the park as well as advising the community as much in advance as possible all the honey 's there [Music] [Music] anyways as only out outside support would we give it away and much appreciated to all the members of the light will bring us to provide that assistance of other areas within the district to competitors five it 's also going to be a sign of the people from other good guys from around the district to kind of pull her into the kangaroo valley areas from 62 us sugar wins already flexing this area we will look for all the penguin value of every appliance in the era we 've always maintained these guys and gals we have a response we need since in the area we 've also invited a mandatory requirement throughout the fog is any car approaches a bucket brigade area those resources will be returned to the behind area for Houston that area outside of the ionizer area here 's some insight about the question is the general way societal slices lay within your own residency baby feeding sheltering place there is many many forms of what you can do to your own residents and without actually having the details of every city presence is something any possible appointed you got us full of water the combustible materials removed from a radiant house they blazed out of the gutters sprinkler systems from underboss hit bottom of the brain as possible [Music] sorry relations back again itself protection of your on properties in preparation all the way see fellow minds and protecting yourself within the NASA so if you are going to be stuck there you do have the sugar in place I mean with blankets on the bubbles all the cracks and in the Ramseys we go to small vessel stuff as I said having a viable one and then saying well inside the house a house will generally provide you protection of a pod front coming through a fog right you will hear coming through it 'll be dirty it 'll be dyed will be hot if we noisy it 's disgusting but you will hear the fog probably fruit once that 's true it 's named finally you can go outside and do a bit of a pinch of salt protection put that in your skull bones around but I gave you a big things need to be ready for that however you get stock and children despite potential if we had that somebody went through it could be a matter of five or six hours before somebody was even around the facto step of the damn era and then moving up obscure the arrow again spoke waters connector they can take called a very very Rod 's Apocrypha bacon and a footballer further ahead of that it seemed possible for me to actually give you a soma generation of it and that 's what we 're happy tonight to pull all the old rival question obviously is I saw a risk of assault and obviously we know the terms of falsifying about the part of some blighted community now about this alleged sang the right net velocity which is right behind me is also a applauding imperative offenders and sewers and operators around the district everybody has a duty of care the people under the supervision of make their main characters as I say operator to make mostly regardless of how much money I 'll spend on one all day we 'd all to be evacuated more than that is likely to the bioscanner come through I think I 've answered my own question why understanding would be if I had a comparative Market area so I certainly feel that I need to go wash my fragrances very very carefully consider their options I 'm going to be the same in home and staying willeth really out of the error on this five tier I 've stopped showing where the possible wind direction is at that time when you 're showing it and maybe maybe to highlight the actual fire 20% that to me is identity it tells me that got burned out but a stop telling me where the actual flame is yes certainly so you know Isis from that beyond the boys email that is uploaded as soon as we possibly can as soon as we get the information at hand that information and hand comes in met many pools of when it comes from what we call a white skin which is submitted it 's an infrared picture to save you from an aircraft flying out of a space albatross of footage back into the control center we 've got members on here 7 who upload that information for not only our body opportunities but spirited Flyers he made so the outline of that trait of each one is the most up-to-date map that we completely put out to you at any time at times we don 't get those wineskins and there 's many many reasons for that the other boring city around the site but also both pretty plant power right applause thank you prevent those who just been sighted in which nicely they also have a lot of information get from the firefighters out on the ground that can take time to observe it and put on the plate but again as soon as we get them on a plank as soon as that soft leather needs analysis it 's also hopefully lady directly got we do have through the operation South Road the Maritime Services I want to be liaison offices within there also in Council they have they brought up the speed the possible impact of firing around the community and then be specifically requested have any place to protect that week I 'm also actively embarrassing to control over the fact that the breach is the Bible leads the area it 's the ever teach night jump and also as construction stands so where the muscle we will have the ability of having somebody down a cruise him explode that provide that invitation to sign up we also have a basis in place and walk through the ACP military show any of the bridges within the districts file will be fed through not just a hand we do have calculation see place where we need guys counsel we guide by the contractors eruptions and military to deploy by the bridges to get people 's access back to their areas supercycle relations traffic control again rise will be fought assassinated that will be descended from everybody from the place on the on the right right gauging the leg look friendly and then in fact actually on the right way at the time for just smoking back on the road through the point of impact on the road yes will the assist it possibly assist in some people may have seriously is that we actually issue shelter in place warning the people within Sussex England Sussex Elin was one in the park at the time that be posted there makes it food bank out of the princes highway who stopped by the fire they were asked the shibori places we didn 't want everybody congregating at that point in time he 's possible what you want sitting around the area because one might will buy the areas of the main exits way Ruby la disputa far impact or device of operations so then Lord I will play a show complexion video local community because of ever Asian and most I 'm not because a Barbie effective so motorcycle places and basic navigation we 've already pray on get boys grab the community more informational nice is available through our website and focus to the angry about the area with all other reason in the pot and we [Music] yes one of the other question where 's the site to return a subway around us consistently a and really flying it are the problem with up is we have to be specific in the license of what scrapes what right what everything because so again that information will come out fall upon us on the ground through the bars eBay in the updates as much as we can at the time and we will get people back to their bases as soon as possible [Music] Sunday questions in relation to the other fathers in the area chiusa late I hate individual colossi he plans to push false of all the planks your responsibility is played with yourselves no you 're a guy you saw people abandoned talking with your friends now you made one of them coastal areas for the rich like Bosnia who do you know that 's population centers Shelby said his big town said his big city centers a large site all I ceased to be considered and again you gotta leave a building while the party speed before you get affected there are buyers around the out Restless taking over we 've got the green bottle fly for North West 's he said about a concern he 's still going for it is this way but this morning time it offers no threat to this general area okay more than waiting to one-on-ones it may be that thank you very much mutation so far amid don 't people that gets my point bra deceiving labeling is the option he waited until the sheltering place is going by the shelter in place as much what we expected anybody around that area he 's gonna have that obviously wherever they slocked involved in around a puppy our freeze will continue to work and protect what I mean you probably because so since the Harper party in relation to you produce as well father was trying tonight will be around the area they will uh wherever far scam to meet back by will associate puppy thirsts of audibility right I will essentially puppy across such things as musical tank water of the life and I will use others need food one of those I had today he where this these support services and any person that ends up being affected by the spot where baby from water soaked through to your own company free to the many support services that are available to the ice will be permanently set up in the baking my questions this should be makes it but again we have had a but ability inside food we have me restate yes and support people here to talk to you should be murdered [Music] okay so the question is happy to assist likewise and lady nightwalk water is around a lot of artists have said I 'm trying to look around your coffee when I arrived on scene they little bit assistant they both look without suicide you can always show them around and advice of what you 've got a nice the city club on your promotion [Music] the bearer of bad news but seriously we need to be prepared now the boy _"

    "text": "hi I 'm Matt Amanda Finley and I 'm here with Vince di Pietro and he 's our recovery coordinator Vince the last six to eight weeks have been pretty intense and this organization has really chugged through some work what have you noticed while you 've been here and you 've never been on a council before I suppose they are the most immediate thing that I 've learned and noticed pride is that if properly focused and the priority is understood people just get on and roll their sleeves up and get on with the work being able to split ourselves into four recovery action teams to deal with social economic and tourism environment and and build has been a terrific burn insofar as that council business of a normal and routine nature has been able to keep going while the various agents inside council who are able to action specific challenges and tackled certain tasks can then get on and do that and then powered by the right right structure inside the recovery committee which I think we 've we 've got pretty well though pretty well tune it as we get further down the recovery path I think if we get those two things in balance which was pretty well where we are now we end up with the sort of list that I 'm preparing to present to Council tonight which is about 30 or 40 items of real positive recovery activities designed to make the aim of getting the show even back on its feet as soon as possible as recently as only three hours ago as you know we saw endeavour energy on the site here talking about the Shoalhaven council 's vision which is to look through the windscreen and basically emerge from this fire is better environment and the disaster in a better condition than we ended it so we 're already starting to talk about what other ways of generating and storing power can we use to make communities more resilient in the face of emergencies so there 's a whole bunch of stuff which is going on which which is actually I think really delivering some some positive and worthwhile and sustainable recovery so this disaster is here our from Bud Jong Acton Erica you know here in to to worry even was was affected with smoke all the down the coast so the actions that you 've focused in the pot in their actions for all the city aren 't they the one thing I keep firmly in mind is is that there 's four thousand six hundred and sixty square kilometers inside the City of Charlotte and eighty-two percent of its been burned most of it is in Bush land but a good deal of it is actually affecting directly people 's property and and of course we know that the hardest-hit sort of aggregation of property isn 't desires Atkin Jalla Park but boy I don 't underestimate what 's been going on just just north of here at Bud Jong and cut the upper kangaroo valley what 's been happening at the back of Milton at Yatta Yatta and some of the folks back experiences there and right down to the South what happened in the first instance at boiling point and then basically all points north of that along the coast has been has have been able to rally to the cause to help us with the recovery blazeit for example we 've got a detachment now up at Camarillo Valley and at Milton they 're helping just restore some of the 63 thousand kilometres offenses just have a look at what the 80s been doing in the last month they they did some extraordinary work for Shaun Haven water and and also clearing some seriously damaged roads and roadside environments which which were basically just plastered with with burned out trees or fallen trees all of that needed to be clear and moved into a safe condition so just seeing what 's been going on there has been terrific I you know and without putting too fine a point I don 't know the hugest frustration for many and myself probably not far from the top of that list is the is the business of clean up but even that has had to be considered in the light of what can we do collectively to make sure we get rid of the nearly 2 million tons worth of waste that has to be and not create another health or public safety emergency by not treating it properly and then of course inside the house inside the suburbs that have been hit you 've got houses which are asbestos and hazardous material contaminated and others which are not but you can 't clean line up without doing the other at about the same time we end up contaminating either or both again so there 's a huge bunch of considerations which I think have been very carefully and methodically work through the business of cleanup is about to start seriously where we 're working very closely with Lego Rock tomorrow morning at ten o 'clock I 've got a 90 minute Skype conversation with with the leader of Lego rocks effort in New South Wales all of that is focused on making sure we establish partnerships from the very first moments to get the work done in a logical and a methodical way and in a safe way and I know that that 's frustrating a lot of people and I have I sympathize with that and empathize with it because it 's frustrating get on with it but we 've got to do it in the right sequence so we 'll end up causing a bigger problem yeah so thinks I 'm really pleased with your the report that you 're bringing to Council tonight because I think we 've made a really solid start in the recovery effort that needs to happen and we know that it 's not going to take just months we know that it will take you know a couple of years and the actions that you have delivered to us already has been fantastic I really thank you on behalf of all of the council behalf of all of our community for taking on this mission and for really giving it your best really admired watching the way that you collaborate with other people and I think that people need to know that we 've got you on our side and that 's terrific please please don 't make too much of that all right I 'd really don 't underestimate how much effort people are putting in and there 's an awful lot of folks working lot done in the main three really important takeaway messages are there isn 't a habitable dwelling in the Shoalhaven which now does not have full power restoration all of its water and sewage services re reconnected and up and running and Telstra is working pretty hard to finally get under control the last patches of communication breaks on both the 28th of February which is a couple of days time and the 9th of March so the main the main bits to get us back on our feet for those that haven 't lost and being devastated by the loss of their homes as backup I 'm pretty confident that within the next month or two we 're going to see a significant level of cleaning going on I really hope that that happens smoothly and quickly for the sake of all those that are that I 'm really itching to get back on their feet and build and start again but having said that there 's also and I encourage as many people as possible if they are still very much hurting from this yeah don 't hold know it 's stretched but it 's there please go to the Recovery Center at Allen dollar or contact counsel directly through the yeah through the front desk and we 'll get you the support that we we know that many people are in need of and don 't hold back in asking for it but in the meantime the work that 's got to go is is underway and it 's it 's certainly not being treated lightly and I just assure everybody out there that 's a Shoalhaven rate payer like me we 're not you know it is not in our interests either as a rate payer or a council to see any part of this council area and not back on its feet every building that 's down is rates we 're not collecting is water we 're not billing is services we can 't provide that 's costing council money so for everything that 's that 's that 's broken and down it 's in our best and only interests to get it back up as soon as possible that might not be immediately obvious patient that 's exactly what 's motivating us yeah but the number one take-home today is that if you haven 't reached out yet to council or to services New South Wales pick up the phone council is here to help we 're all in this together it 's all of our rates that are in this together and we are the only ones who can make this work by doing it together in a collaborative and focused way thank you thanks thanks you _"

    "text": "[Music] it 's enjoyed this basement last night expensive piping here slowly opening up a big castle it 's actually feeling a bit so I 'm trying to keep there that 's it is that going okay thanks for now but thank you for coming out this afternoon we 've been through an extraordinary and extraordinary summer which my eye sees when this unprecedented it 's the word that 's being used to the extent of the devastation across the shaman is something that the any office has ever seen before but we 're at now is in the recovery funds office of this operation that we have a number of speakers here tonight to let you know where we were up to first we have right into the fire situation itself and we have the declaration of the emergency needs up there and then some other speakers talking about the recovery process and where to repeat once we finish those speakers we 've got some time at the end for some some questions so however tonight is to get as much information as we possibly can to you and can as well so just especially to kick it off if I go you know these the traditional custodians of the land away from you and recognize their continuing connection to lead one community I pay my respects to mailes past presidents present in emerging for those who don 't know who I am this media places in the shop nine eight months they also there 's a big market is not very well but those who don 't know the y-intercept even done shows my name of the council 's chief executive officer and recipe for very pleased to be here to in sequence evenings information session for you we are live streaming this session this afternoon with the camera we 've got rolling down the front so there is the opportunity to much of them on Facebook at home for those that choose to do should do so we also have Melinda here from our possibly an interpreter so she 's doing that right in front of the key on it so that we get the message out to as many people as we possibly can I don audience tonight any media may be coming in but if we do any if I could ask they respect that this is I consider this a safe space and people 's privacy is protected in these rooms if you are looking to do photographs any medium you couldn 't use we would ask that you take that out so I have this really to protect them to mark the privacy of those those that study and everything as I said we 'll hear from another number of speakers and we 'll invite questions and so about half of you have four questions even at the end of the session this afternoon and will endeavor to answer as many of us that we can we do have staff in the room that are taking notes describing and the rest of it so any questions that we can 't answer tonight we 'll take those questions on board and we 'll endeavor to get those answers out and response to those questions through whatever means that L usually channels Facebook the channels that we use when you are asking questions we will I suspect the common ones just one more that 's fine so when we are asking questions just it is about sharing information and as we said we 've got the live stream coming here so we would ask you to put your hand up if you want to ask a question and wait until the microphone gets to you so that that can be captured everyone hears including those that arrow watching and listening if I can also acknowledge this is this is the third of these meetings we have a meeting of Monday on the double we had another one last night at some Georgians base in the Country Club we 've got this meeting here this afternoon and there 's another one scheduled for Monday afternoon and evening up in kangaroo valley these these are community information sessions and in some respects given the status of the fire that hopefully we hear from my very shortly is believed that we 're about to be declared out but if remark information today so in some respects this is a bit of a handover from these community meetings from back to council and recovery agencies which are now focused on the recovery effort beginning that the show back to business getting people back into their homes and restoring as soon as possible some normality to people 's lives of Michelle Haven which have been so so terribly devastated but being the existed effort if it 's the first of a series of our community needs with their home handover back to the council and the recovery effort will be having other means as we go along type of meetings will be getting closer up into local areas into villages in different formats for those impose meetings to address more specifically issues affecting the individual community so this is a general information night tonight communities as you may understand have been affected differently some affected very much because others we 've seen packs with down to business due to the lack of tourism training over the summer period so different areas going to have different recovery needs so that the next round of these beings that we have will be more targeted and what 's the specific the specific locations is to restore the shall pay them back to you not just life is normal back brother to to put the shopping with your position that it 's going to be in a better position that it was before the before these tragic events devastating events affected all of us and also locally Bill each other agencies that are joined us here tonight remember of PL to start we 've got RFS represented we 've got legal aid here and some other agencies Red Cross we 'll hear from those language we go through the evening so the first thing else because I 'd like to invite to the microphone is is RFS incident controller superintendent we do so Abele lead the response from the Emergency Operations Road Ivy Tech the privilege to spend a lot of time in that operation center working alongside the police and their agencies by standing all at the efforts that the immediate response agencies 14 to protected life in property in the South Haven lost as devastating as it was without the efforts when I saw firsthand of these guys and what they make mark we didn 't if you 'd like to come forward and just give us an update on the fire situation clear up to with the emergency and the big corporation itself think you know and thanks very much for coming out tonight and also online just a little bit different on that microphone will be further away [Music] mm uh North a sort of significant deficit in the fuel moisture levels right across New South Wales severe drought conditions may not have a the longest route was certainly one of the most severe that we 've seen in recent history in nature with the lengthy goons of no rainfall at all combined with extreme high temperatures and low humidities members from the RFS Shoalhaven district started their season back early in September 2009 traveling to the northern states at places like a steno cleanliness I 'm and I 'll accepted to assist in their started their season up their 26th of November then when we saw the local cruisers to report a bushfire currently in Creek area Atlantic oil on the western side of the client River these original just to the south of the vicinity of the Milliken Township by the time the fire was first reported it had already taken hold and increased in size extremely quickly quickly so brigades were responded as well as aviation assistance will have them that is now all part of history an extreme fire event over the next 70 plus days the current fire we need to consume more than 80% of the Shoalhaven district it also trouble well outside the shallow crossing in technology as of winter carry southern table ends powering Queanbeyan and here of a dollar well up nearly 500,000 hectares the bush landed over the interface for impact on five occasions throughout the declarations severe fire weather days were experienced on at least two of these occasions five days are breaking to the catastrophic range these days so extreme fire behavior resulting in significant spread and substantial damage to property and infrastructure fire weather events such as poor accumulating impass clouds formed above the main fire this because its own dry lightning and worse downbursts if the cloud formation collapses these down bursts of we often see which can be felt up to 200 kilometers away as well as the immediate and ongoing focus responding to a controlling the fire an equally high level of priority was given to providing information to the public and the community in general in relation to the developing emergency many of them to see warnings appreciate countless radio and TV interviews were conducted and over 7,000 companies were visited and going on in addition warnings and requests for tourists to initially reconsider their troubles era and lately later specifically requested to lead the area where issue likewise members of the community likely to come under impact or also advised to consider their options in acts survival plans and encouraged to leave the area unless they were well prepared to stay and defend their properties social media Vedas and the thighs need may have were also being updated as often and as frequently as possible tragically throughout the event three members of the community lost their lives a lot offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of those loss likewise over 400 times with destroyed and about half of that countless numbers of wall block were also lost since statistics during the fire of it as I mentioned the car ran faster on 26th of November 2019 we also had a second fire in the content area just east from arrow and that started on the 17th of December the causes tomorrow the current fire was caused by lightning and the common fire is being treated there suspiciousness still currently under investigation as I said 72 days the section 24 declaration has been enacted at this point in time Karam fire itself within the show London district since of three hundred and fourteen thousand hectares but with its subsidiaries in those other local government areas is just under five hundred thousand now 2686 eight days the perimeter of the finest the car empires 1,200 kilometers now coming at 30 for fathers around as I mentioned for three civilians were tragically killed firefighter injuries we have two with severe burns as are enacting defending their property along i-5 with smoke inhalation and three other engines requiring hospitalization but all of those apparently at any one time on the fire ground on on the max thing New Year 's Eve we had 750 firefighters out on the photograph another interesting statistic is in our catering brigade down in Milton provided just under 20,000 sandwiches in between the November and the 1st of January and that 's just the lunchtime Bill 's not the morning and evening meals are also thanked goodbye we saw extreme fire being a year throughout the event with the max growth in one day of 12 kilometers the max spotting distance that we saw was also 12 kilometers we have those borrow cumulus cloud mixer for which we experienced at least 3 of those during the event we also have fire overruns of the number of fire crews out and around the area as a result we lost four of the firefighting appliances across the board as I mentioned three hundred and twelve ounces 26 facilities and 595 out buildings were destroyed 173 houses 20 facilities and 200 for our buildings were damaged however it is important to note that along that with the direct impact one of the fauna where travel nearly 1,900 structures were saved 150 efforts of all the fault line crews around the area in relation to the emergency alerts the biggest emergency alert was covering 90 percenter that the show later than that was I think easy and that saw us then the following day evacuate nearly 30,000 people and get them out of their harm 's way either around the coast we saw 28 emergency alerts issued for the car on fire and two for the common fire we had those impact days I mentioned on the fourth the six the 22nd then the 31st of December and again on the 4th of January those pre indeed or nerfs conducted by the SES and the police of over 7,000 properties right around the perimeter of the Shoalhaven in the urban populated areas social media saw over 800,000 hits on the Facebook page for the information of the being provided our statistics from the relation to aviation are also pretty awesome nearly 700,000 liters of retirement out of the Richmond air force base nearly three hundred sixty-two thousand litres of large air tanker loads out of the Albatross Air Force Base likewise our thousand litres a day for each of those aircraft now operators volunteers from Miller water became gonna stopped our large air tanker base an albatross committed over fifteen hundred fifty eight hours in refilling and refueling those aircraft community meetings during the event were conducted in a LaDonna George 's Basin pulmonary Kangaroo Valley Mariga and Mangala in recent weeks also want to receive some metal weather less fall weather as I mentioned before we have had some showers also which has abated the fire threat itself now when the fire fighting has continued up until today we have had our remote area firefighting teams around spotfires which occurred during the last runs of the fire and specifically around the fitzroy falls area and further around around the town around i 'm pleased to say however today those works of now ceased and we 're now with the expecting rain over the next coming days have marked the current rate of fire back to patrol stats during the last couple of days but over the last several weeks we have there also experienced re burning activities around the fire ground affected on the fire ground often waist-deep the spend caught alive by this skumps that ones that are still being being internally normally that wouldn 't be an issue but these given that it 's so thick we 've actually had to attend those to put it out so it doesn 't breach open tangle mines and send it on its way again as i mentioned we 've now marked the current fire back to trial status and it is my expectation that if we get the rainfall that is predicted over the coming days we should see that fire declared out early next week the combat environment as i mentioned before was also declared out this afternoon just to wrap up I 'd like to put a couple of offers of thanks true if I can firstly out of all the fire fighters on the program an extraordinary effort as I 'm sure you all agree from all the agencies involved not only the RFS the volunteers who will live locally by standing or every day but also all those agencies and all of those other areas all around out of the field it was a truly badge of approach it was a United team and the amount they 've got that field day in day out this is simply amazing signaling to my members of the incident management team many people have congratulated myself personally on the activities of the fire front maybe assure you is not a single person job and there 's no way I would have done any of this without the team behind me what an outstanding bunch of people again multi faceted multi-agency response and international response with many people after 12 of them coming out of from Canada in the United States to assist in specialty growth thirdly to the local emergency management committee members unfortunately raced ons the local events the operations control couldn 't be here this evening but to Ray and Dave Cockrum the two Blair cons nothing was too difficult for them anytime I needed something a simple walk across the hallway to ask for some assistance and they got the liaison officers from all the other services which included local Land Services Council Roads and Maritime shall other events these services were all there to assist 7 until we didn 't need them anymore and they 're only a phone call away if we did need them again fourthly I 've got to say huge thanks to all members of the community what an outstanding responsibly God from all of the effort that we put in ourselves and in to advising what was going on the fact that the general public out there listen to our warnings listen to our advice listen to our media forecasts analyze about and acted upon it was one of the primary reasons why the damage losses were as low as they learn as Stephen just mentioned before we doubt those efforts from the local community not only also protecting their own properties where they chose to do so do so those damage results and probably fatalities would be much much higher thanks for listening and acting on the vices are said from that the actions speak louder than the words but lastly I 'd like to say this is a recovery event we 're in the army trim we 've started we 'll swing so anything over the beats now is one of the easiest jobs that I 've had but really to every member of the community please continue that support of each other out there to see the support that we receive is emergency services across the court the donations of goods the donations of contributions have cash to the brigades and all and sundry the things that 's being given from the members of the public to be in HD services days seconds or not it 's also been hugely pleasing is seeing members of the community talking to each other members of their own Street talking to neighbors that they haven 't spoken to for five days five years or longer it was just simply amazing I 'd like to see that continue and it 's just a shame that it took an event like this to actually quit that out of people so please keep that going part of the recovery process and recovery processes cannot going to take days weeks or months it 's going to take years don 't needs to happen and that continue these events and early community events to make sure that we continue to talk about things and work through things as we go that 's all I 'll go thank you very much I really appreciate your assistance throughout the event and I think I 'm thinking that River Falls going just as long [Music] [Applause] [Music] mark mentioned that this this fire the corona fire started on the 26th of November there was a couple of other bits of flare-up days early December I think the 2nd the 4th and around the city I think you referred to not last night in response to that back in early December there are guidelines issued by the state government Department of Justice and the Office of Emergency Management that I should require in response to these disasters the establishment of a recovery committee the mark mentioned our local shall either disaster recovery committee and we actually established there back in November that is very well we 've established that back in mid-december we had the first recovery committee meeting back then and that was in response to the billion acts think at that stage the figures were about 16 buildings impacted but nevertheless there was devastation properiy can he keep thinking it very quickly in movie no recovery strategies as to how we would put things back together that 's nice too it was a joint recovery committee with Eurodollars shine council given the location of this impact further south you know actually in the northern part of the Eurodollar but it made sense at that stage that there was a drink committee so the first community meeting we had i think was the 15th of december was a joke to me between the two local government areas we resolved at that stage that we would but given given we wanted the recovery effort to be primary focus for the council and recovery efforts the last thing I wanted to do was to be leading that recovery team and chairing that committee whilst trying to run the organization that somebody 's shopping at City Council there are options under those guidelines that the general manager of the council takes on that role but there 's also the opportunity for or recovery coordinator I made this decision very quickly in concentration either there defend they were made that and the other agencies I was raised on as the leader calm as was mentioned before but we wanted to do the best possible take the best possible approach to this and give the recovery effort prime consideration absolute from the sinner so we said out of that stage to find a a recovery coordinator that could actually work as they will sign myself here to counsel than the other agencies so that this got primary consideration from the council as we work through what was not going to be a quick process it 's not going to take weeks you 're going to take months it 's going to take a long time but just putting perspective that was in response to a fire that we 're decide down south and destroyed six of their properties little did we know that when we came back for that first recovery community or the second recovery community in early January the extent of what we would be dealing with none of us imagined on was going to be so after that early committee meeting in December I was a funerary understudy we might want to define as a recovery coordinator one moment another nine inquiries led to another and being laid on the gentleman wonder if it 's deep ii-era Kiara my apologies it 's successful look at that world instinct Theatre a local show that will show a person giving the president North arrow and the shopping for 40 years but also highly distinguished career in the military including naval attache to Washington and commander of HMAS albatross and he talking to Vince I think it was about ten seconds into that conversation we got a call from the city I 'm shocked I can see counsel Alfredo that anybody choose for admission we may choose to accept the world certainly when I had that discussion of giving only dissent by the scale of the recovery effort is far less that was when Vince came back tonight second meeting that we had been officially decided to join us and be part of this to this recovery effort and what we do we are over so I 'm very grateful that Vince what he turned up agreed to take on that challenge and very quickly we 've kicked into gear and I think in terms of in terms of our recovery if it 's a spa with someone again undergoing a lot of hard work a lot of people but no released is use means as if it 's providing some very strong leadership to this process that one basic advice needs to come up the outside a few words to you and actually talking you through a diagram here which which is one of these scribbles start off as a scripts conversations through those conversations it 's developed into what we think is very very structure process and I continue to me if you would like to take the microphone introduce yourself before we go further I was really important to acknowledge that no greater love hath many general manager of a city councilman to spend his birthday in the company of his rank days it 's a very very kind words thank you but I just wanted to perhaps run past you you to acknowledge and understand that the council 's focus is to now look through the windscreen how to get through this and I can honestly say as a 40 year radio in this area I don 't think I 've ever had this great privilege of working with people so focus is looking through the lens of the sufferers and the victims of this dreadful activity you know most everything they do and how they think there are no there 's some issues that arise from time to time and I probably be talking about a couple in a few moments but if I can just ask you to accept that from my perspective I don 't think whatever they hear myself say I 'm just delighted to be a rate payer which I 'll have it man it 's been a three different three words I want to leave with tonight the first is coordination the second is registration and the third is information let 's just talk about coordination for minute the aim the vision of the council is for the Shoalhaven to emerge from this horrible in it and that 's how I mean we 're going to not only have to look at a whole bunch of things to get right but also a whole bunch of things are going to change the future to make sure we 're at least a little more resilient should happen again and it will happen again the item of the council at the moment and I think for the longevity of this whole process is to get the Shoalhaven people back on their feet as quickly as possible now that means a whole bunch of different sorts of people there are folks operated out in the far south coast folks in the main urban centers like now each of them has their own expectations and requirements and wishes for the future our intention through the aim of getting every other things to exceed people 's expectations but I 'm going to get it right all the time then we can if we will pull together and just walk through the coordination aspects of that happen it might work now another in the room today with a number of deputy man at one to three counselors please don 't keep an eye on those folks are a bit amount of your side tonight if you 've got questions ask them but what I want to do is just walk you through this model that Steve was referred to and you probably Nora back because you can 't see it but there 's only one part of the model that makes sense it is important to you and that 's the blue line down the side that blue line has two words of a community input and the way that the community can feed the recovery process is by its input people through its counselors in their respective wards through the Recovery Center at Alabama the front desk of the council or indeed by phone if that 's the other way communicate but without the community input we can 't inform the recovery process we know what needs to be done but there will be things that are asked from time to time throughout the community that can only be don 't think that there is something wrong so what about harnessing the collective energy of counsel because the reality of what we learn is that when all of the media present stops the political focus dilutes to other things as we get into the business of 2020 in other places the people left to do the work and to actually get people back on their feet and to get the place up and running again is the Shoalhaven City Council and so the philosophy behind that model is the sooner we take responsibility for that and ownership of all that it means the better off it 'll be because there won 't be a need to hand over to the council at some point down track and I can report to you with more confidence that the council has risen to that challenge absolutely magnificent at no stage during the fire to date has the council closed its doors for business and at those things during the fire tonight has there not been someone able written ready to respond to any requiring requirements of queries sometimes we rely on other 's backs and at a speed which which will challenge but if the council 's been asked to step up differently as waste management throughout the period hasn 't stopped in fact that 's being the mechanism how can actually to test my own experience is driving into West error on a Friday afternoon before I even take it on the job because I was driving out I said how much of the fellow said oh no it 's great waste we 're counting from that terrific terrific response and just thinking here but the really important part of that picture for little colored boxes the council has formed itself into what we call recovery Action Teams three of the leaders of those teams because the fourth way solving before doubt that I 've done we 're in this room tonight so Shannon could you please stand Shane could you please stand and Michael I know you 're hiding in there that data bank there is ok so then right standing before you were three of the recovery action team leads so we 've got social economic and tourism and Shannon and environment and Shane what 's that why to do what we have done not trying to do what we 've done because these folks are actually working a flat check right now Israel that make it a hierarchy of who 's in charge of this the boss what we need it was a way to exchange information quickly and get the council resources to respond quickly over and above business as usual and that 's what the recovery action teams are about and they ask themselves one simple question for every issue they get the first question is is this Google now and can I get it done if the answer to that is yes do it don 't ask we 're worried about detail later and on this diagram that 's very simply represented or anything that happens in the lower half directly to them if we can do this now let 's do it and we 'll worry about the detail later if something is too big or something is systemic or something affects the whole region it has to be referred through the recovery committee I chair each Tuesday and from there we feed Sydney what this is trying to do is to reduce the number of committees and subcommittees and all the working groups and stuff let 's just give a couple of teams actually up and running and let 's just keep knocking these things one thing at a time and I think it 's actually working beyond my wildest expectations thanks to the efforts of those three folks and work back with them you know whatever right now registration second point the only way we can actually get things to response for people and in people 's favor to the amount of things which are available is to be properly registered through the service New South Wales desk now you can do that people down at Olive dollar or you can have us do it for you through the Shoalhaven City Council and quarries counter the reason that 's important is because you 've got to have your name somewhere on a register which tells the state that someone 's been effective now is it a perfect system absolutely not it 's got some real knobs on it and we working to have gone what people have gone through to have to reach two three four five six seven or eight times in the one room to get in the attention of different government agencies the government started to recognize that and for those of you watching ABC news this morning you 'll have seen a very very good interview with someone who lost everything don 't go explaining the difficulty of registering embankments by now our own Center in our dollar to date has of last night has got just under 700 people in reached for a city the size of ours that 's pretty we 're sort of one way to do we 're comparing data from the building impact assessments that was done very early on in the piece because again like like other my other regions we actually sent about what I say we the folks in the in the lyrical shopping with makes people the eminent at the council people present ringing they 're building impact assessments together so we only needed to do that once that data is not a good database we can compare 'll find folks that are falling through the cracks then our job is to get on the phone or get a car and go and make sure you bump into them and saying okay take it but registration is very important third are very important what is information we 've got to get into the habit of using authoritative information sources and I hate to say I don 't call that face book in conversation lives which are generating all sorts of concern doubt criticism it 's not awful but there are a couple of terrific websites and in fact one Facebook page you should look at the website at the sole Haven city council is probably second to none anywhere in the state of New South Wales and when you go into the bushfire recovery page every single link of every bit of information that we get it gets pretty mmediately onto that page so if you want to know anything from legal aid through to indigenous issues through to who do I talk to about the AIDS from you know charities or from from government agencies that page need it can I just do it all of you to sit down at home tonight or the next night and just have a look at that Simon City Council website and find that page through a few of the links to their office it 's authoritative it 's run by a council Cape amico stand up okay okay to their team and the council put that thing absolutely right every single do everyday that they 're in the office thanks Pete so just just use authoritative information if you doubt what you 're seeing go to either the RFS website if it 's about a fire if it 's about something to do with your Council go to the council website if it 's something to do about with a social media you just want to see what 's really you know what 's the flavor of the day again the City Council Facebook pages a good place to go the news authority big data these things are bad enough as it is without misinformation speaking people and so with that one of the challenges well if I was giving real stuff I know that there 's an awful lot of you out there and goodness knows what that must feel hurt because I I was lucky like most is probably in this room I didn 't lose anything really other than been smoking the lungs and the bit of interest interest of curiosity and they have a spike in took like 3 o 'clock in the afternoon but the fundamental problem is that we can 't actually start the really important bit of this recovery which is cleaning up until we 've got some really special and clean let me give you an example nearly 40 years ago maybe put in experience and ships and I can assure you that it probably takes about 18 months to break down the ship once it 's decommissioned on that service now a ship of about two and a half or four thousand tons it takes 18 months to break down because in that ship there might be a link paint there might be tributyl tended with coatings on the hull there might be asbestos in the lagging around the pipes around the operations room that will certainly be hazardous substances like oils cleaners refrigerants solvents and you 're gonna get rid of all of that stuff before you can start gas accident now you just think of what we 've been through down south a year and if you think that a community has all of those things in some level or other and that the total tonnage estimate of the stuff we 've gotta move is about two million tons we can 't go through with a bulldozer just yet because we 've got to work out where to put it or in two years time we will have an environmental and a health disaster which will be every bit as bad as the fire but for a whole bunch of other reasons now that 's not to say that work hasn 't won a great deal datapath for that we know where we can put it we 're going to put all the non contaminated stuff as much as we can through arrest narrow and we 're going to put a whole bunch of the stuff which is Holzman of the road is now being endorsed to go over 15 tons and once again that 's water now we 're going to make sure that every house is ready to go and we know exactly when we going to start and how we 're going to do it and we 've got to do it in one heat now the whiskey of area is probably control to park it will be one of the first step first-person communities to be dealt with but if there 's taking longer than you 'd like to do they 're right the other drop water was enough to start but we can 't we can 't take this too quickly and too casually because we don 't want to generate more of a problem than they already got but once it starts it will be good and the first time one of those trucks ELISA you know the suits that are still in the area with a load full of rubbish to go somewhere else will be a fantastic step for all to the range recovery other problems I do know that been working closely with all sorts of agencies Telstra and the like NBN is off the minute to react service but we do have some significant infrastructure challenges of some of the equipment that was damaged and how we can even get to it to fix it that 's gonna take time not because of any lack of will or any people or any length of material there 's just so much of it if you think that we 're about 4,700 square kilometres of damage in this city alone they 'll multiply that up and down the coast and into Victoria 's it 's a big patch but the words that famous marine good we 're surrounded that simplifies our problem I 've obviously say that they can 't just leave you with three routes coordination information and registration and I had to be around long enough to to see this actually have time to take 10 or 15 people down to the coffee shop in the room thanks they very nice bits I think I understand now why I think we 're in very very good hands to really don 't think we could have found somebody better qualified and and more dedicated more committed leadership spill wants to help us through this journey so thank you very much again Vince we really appreciate you coming up English online through this intervention that we do have some counselors in the room and we should acknowledge councilman mark Kitchener 's here councilman in Adana Giulio and significant where Patricia live in councilman Joe caches with us and also of course Hermia I made the finding of so joining us this evening so I would actually like to invite the me right now to to say a few words about her experience through the disasters of the fire and so our experience now occurring and also now as we move into the to the recovery phase so she like to come forward event thank you very much welcome to all of you here this evening it 's great to see so many people out and coming to be informed and to get the latest information be part of the discussion about where to from here and ask any questions about there but a lot of you I just want to acknowledge the fact that a lot of us sitting where was Christmas and where was New Year and that you 've spent a lot of time in high levels of distress watching your fires near me phoning your friends packing your bags saying going and doing all of those things that have been happening all across our city during this crazy two months because it certainly has been a an experience that none of us will will let me forget a whiff that comes from a whole lot of pain and whether that pain is felt right now in the moment or whether that pain is felt in a few months down the track what we need to continue to do is to continue to look out for each other and to look out for our our own world well-being and Mark and Vince have touched on that already that one of the best ways that we can do that is to continue to do the amazing work that has already started to happen and that 's already been happening find in purpose with one another to support one another and to care for one another and whether that be through caring for wildlife and putting in watering stations and feeding stations because that makes people feel better about what 's happening and hopefully it provides some respite for our poor animals or whether that 's being volunteering for our you know organizations like the Red Cross or universe evening and thank you for being here this evening and also you know a Beaucaire our chaplains so many people have been involved in what has gone down forward they 're bigger than so the biggest event so far in shop havens history so for my part I just want to talk about what was happening at the evacuation center down the south because I 'm sure that many of you were here at commentary and enjoying the pleasure of the pulmonary the new y 'all_''_2786.42 tonight we would have thought they 'd have been sleeping on a mattress about at a club or hanging out in the lounge chair and making new friends because that 's exactly what I saw there was the people we 're leaning on each other to get that emotional support to get through those really dark days and that was really important so acknowledging to and then thanking the Red Cross angra care that apartment of justice and community our chaplains who turned up from near and far to support our people some of them work from here they were they traveled in from other places our residents who turned up with goods to deliver whether it from food to dog care items and cat care items to make sure that if you stayed in an evacuation center that your stay was as comfortable as it possibly could be I want to acknowledge to the hundreds of thousands of dollars worth and tons of actual donations that came into the shop even during that period and it was it was a very difficult thing to have so people please do not send any more semi-trailers of bottled water to the Shoalhaven we 've got enough to probably feel Sydney Harbour right now it was pretty incredible and I can remember spending part of one day get bottled water in off the street we have beefed up to the semi trailer now we were just like wow when is this ever gonna stop but what 's pretty amazing but it showed the incredible generosity of people all across Australia and all across Australia and internationally people have been donating cash into all sorts of funding sources and some of that has been coming here and buyer the me Relief Fund and that relief fund has done its first distribution to residents of the Shoalhaven who lost their homes and to salt ministries as a first tranche to deal with people that have been presenting meaning food and clothing meaning all of those immediate items to help try and get in life back I can 't_''_2921.069 say back to normal because this is our new normal it 's going to be it 's going to be a different shop open from the event that we have just been through like Stevens said I absolutely with all of our electric elected councillors your elected councillors are determined to get through this in a very best way that we see in the media you know there 's always going to be it 's you know it 's we 've realized business as usual is going on at the same time so you 'll hear all the political logic body that might go on on the sidelines but at the end of the day we 're coming together to do the best thing by all of you the people at the table Haman who have been impacted on I also want to absolutely encourage you to take up any offer of help that is available and if you 're sitting in front of me today and you think oh but I haven 't been impacted in this way my house wasn 't destroyed or this hasn 't happened to me if you 're feeling the need to reach out and take the ten sessions that the government are offering around mental health plans take that if you need thirteen weeks worth of settling the support because you are in your income has been interrupted because the business that you work for has not been able to make the money that thirteen weeks if you need to talk to the Red Cross and seek assistance from them then please do it and do it soon don 't leave it for six months ago oh I should have do it now while the offers are on table offers on the table to make life a little bit easier and it won 't change our lives remarkably but having that little bit of extra at this time of need is really important to make sure that you do that so just finally again I just want to reiterate you are councils best source of information if you see a job that needs done to be done contact counsel don 't go on Facebook and have a little news about it that might feel okay in the moment but it doesn 't get the job done and they should actually go and love it with someone who 's really listening and can help you okay make sure you tell council that this is important for the future so we know that there was a gap perhaps in what was happening in your cyber them were really bad and you think that you 've got a solution to that tell somebody what your solution is because without that sharing we cannot make things better for the future I hope that in 12 months time when you 're celebrating Christmas and New Year of 2020 2021 that you 'll be able to look back on the year that was the year that started deplorably to be able to celebrate some wins throughout the year and that my hope is that when we get to that point that the blocks will be cleared some new homes will be starting to be built people will be starting to put their lives back together and our business we 'll feel like they 're getting back on track and then our beautiful Bush man that many of us relocated to the Shah heading to enjoy and many of us who lived in the shell home for a really long time admire now is kind of the thing that we love is all coming back and that the shoots and rejuvenation of new growth will be there for us all so get through this over the next 90 if I can just extend my thanks to the all the counselors that have been a unanimous in their support for a number of recommendations that we 've already put up to the council I mean in relation to such concern even even forward with this destruction and also some immediate relief that we provide in terms of hardship provision as well for rates and a whole range of waiting and fees for out building applications and similar each other which the council wasn 't almost you know obviously and thank you very much for your ongoing support through this process next part of the the agenda is over to you so we 're going to get Sharon to stand up with the microphone there any by questions from the floor and if I can actually ask the recovery team leads if you might want to come at the front here might be easy in that to help answer some of those questions will be quickly responds with a microphone down here so very much wherever to to you what are your hands my name is Melissa I 'm from 70 South Wales in South now I wanted to come along and extend an invitation before all of you to coming to visit us so we can help you through as everyone 's mentioned here not just the next week not just the next six months for the next year and a half the next two years as you 're getting yourselves back on your feet as you 're building a new new houses as you 're rebuilding your community we 're here to listen to you to help you with the offers that are on the table and its immense it there is some great information that 's available on the council website what sort of a service New South Wales website and as has mentions please register we want to make sure that we capture everybody and that were able to help everybody that has been affected by this crisis for us so again the invitation placement overseas please visit our website if you need assistance with things such as scanning documents we do have scanners there we have to stand they just don 't have those facilities available to them sorry please come down and use our facilities maybe they 'll help you [Applause] all right it 's hard for me to feel raising what I see you know I knew you guys would like to do that but I hope for two years of drought and went through the course more drought and they lost my house through the fires my house is a double brick two-story house with tiles there 's no trees with the inclu be off man of children burn and unfortunately I was asleep eight hours after the fire as the past I felt safe and it didn 't happen the first input I had at the council was three days later add to compliance offices Turner there 's no compassion they said that they swore fibro we say that suspected asbestos this is now a demolition site we capture doing anything here you 're up for 100,000 fine that was the counselors compassion I don 't feel rose and when I see people get up and tell me how good the counselors I 've me that because we dug our dance out in the drought because our dancer empty the first time in the history of our property of going July he says because what on earth works over 600 millimeters that 's illegal and I 'll never see counter play out well we saw the campaigner eventually I said that it wasn 't legal because it 's to do with agriculture but again it was misinformation he tells me we 've got to use counsel with contractors so we got Smith Brothers to come out and have a look at the what 's left of it and the two-story brick house is burned to the ground it 's completely leveled Smith Brothers said well okay this is what we 've got to do we go dude this is a mess he went through the process so then I went to the counseling applied provider and took things after five days I didn 't hear anything I didn 't realize at the time that there was a disaster center set up we didn 't actively I don 't agree we didn 't have anything we went registered there then we register online with with the state with the lady that just spoke then we registered everyday for six days and every time I woke up I was told that they had no record of our registration about the services online I couldn 't believe every day for six days nobody could tell me whether I was registered when we finally get into the council we 're looking at trying to get rid of it we find out that the waiver of Cathie 's was green I got three kidnappers for a trailer I 've got a whole house like Sydney well that 's better than nothing okay right so we go to the next stage then I write next thing I got to fall off the compliance officer he tells me we told you you allowed to touch that house it 's a hundred thousand dollar fine I 've been told during the council looking for a way we did first I said I had I said if I get Smith Brothers the county with contractors if I get away with your fees and not what I was told that 's what happened again compassion wasn 't there I got under the government down at the same day I hear that state government 's going to give us they 're going to take the house away so I got on the website ideas to me I not only got to unregister that day I roam about relentlessly for the next week again I come here to go and give this information total Rock the state government started demolishing my place on Monday yes they landed there a week ago nearly a week and a half ago they I get the child and counsel that they wouldn 't let her have it at the kid they started demolishing my house in Monday today it 's the fourth day of it tomorrow will be the fifth day at it by Monday they should be the sixth day I should have it gone they 've got to take it to windy element kit from Barren Julia we built a return seven and a half

slab so I can put my carrying on I 'm sicker but warm that waking me up at 1 o 'clock 2 o 'clock 3 o 'clock before I 'm thinking I 'm in an earthquake I figure I 'm not getting any sleep II I don 't know whether it 's the fish jumping in the river or the one that shaken me but I 've gotta get some sleep their eyes so I am coming to the council I see them I get the same idea of the disaster recovery center she said I 've got to do a full flora and fauna report about sort of drink why I said I 'm in what do I have to do a four-on-four report oh because you do I 've got to do a super assessment I said but we 've got the same so who would used it for 30 years she still doesn 't make you go to a seriousness then she said me I 've got to do a bush for our sister another three grand

the council not to mention someone to draw the pants up this is the sort of stuff I 've got on with then next thing you know I get a call out of Al Adama a disaster but they did now at Rick 's they didn 't know it lost my house I said well I have appreciated this on New South Wales every day for six days I said I 've got a estimated they are about to take the house way really she said didn 't know anything about it so the down here there 's started I don 't know he 's going to go to the next but they 're started the recovery trying to get the new house through counsel that 's happening what 's that gonna take but the lady said look I she said don 't be a hurry said it 's going to take you months really well that 's gonna be awesome she said put it on if you like I said okay thanks beautiful so at the moment the council started to zero or train a the dumping I don 't usually like to complain I 'd like to be rosy oxy Brown he couldn 't know all the positives but as a person that 's lost a house I don 't have anything possible unfortunately when my house went down I didn 't have the fire brigade are all cast out become a healthy home own firefighter but unfortunately I 've got a news that saved an excellent Ava 's property and forgot to fill it up with water didn 't think I 'm nature after midnight before I 've gone I thought I 'd be able to save my property and of course you didn 't happen I still don 't even understand how a cool but finally oddly enough just for the stats you caught a lot of that six to eight hours after the fire past my caught a like two and a half days later two and a half days later they caught a light in the rain I mean I 'm sitting here at North now fish and chip shop but I get a call of my ships at home life was like man sheds it 's been a pretty tough time and I think the council would be a little bit more passionate and maybe stop all this means of misinformation you know I think it was Michael down with Al Abdullah rung me up from another dollar recovery so he said well I 'm with the council he said as far as I know you don 't have to do a floor Informer report he said me I don 't you don 't have to do pursue report if it 's been approved you don 't have to do that he said if you 're building like the life to me any he said he 'd fix it organize a meeting with the county no I mean that hasn 't happened but there seems to be a lot of misinformation in the council what you can do and what you can 't do and it 's been really really upsetting needless to say to go after defend myself it even out the farm things because we 're in drought first time they 've been a cure even got that they could be a volatile essence of misinformation and a lot better information but just the informative run my house is getting taken away it 's happening me out the probability got six six stacked layers we go out saying they 've got a straight ball the drug it 's not just taking the house away they 've got to take them together Mill the hygienist has to come back every clearance you get that 's a lot of dirt and there 's a lot that goes with it and I think they 've taken the best part of I 'd be guessing 250 to 300 come away so far and they 've probably still got about another hundred and fifty maybe I haven 't come to go and so that 's where I 'm at I just thought I 'd inform everyone later know that that 's what that 's my story respond to that briefly visit there 's a lot that you arranged a position for best wishes for your recovery is of efforts and we 're very sorry for what do you have experience in the or damaged or waste being removed mail already is news to us I can honestly say that there 's read comics and sending staff to queen bee and tomorrow I had I 'm most intrigued by that because this is this has been the hottest topic that we 've had at that 's the greatest area of confusion that councils not just shall Haven but the counselors that are dealing with all the council subjective about how quickly we can get this becoming process underway which is good news that the state government and the federal government sharing the funding of that sublime knowledge about recovery teams know each those logistics so what are you reading yeah well I mean Baron German the first thing I got was a phone call saying the fire brigade in a place again so I thought sure enough the fire brigade were there and there was about three state government cars Public Works cars and whatever some of them were EPA people I think there was a hygienist from Emory and there was the fire brigade had two cars that were spraying them with Works anyway so the engineer looked at it saw what had to be done agreed that the works had to be done and yeah I said in winds are going to be done he said I 'll have somebody within three days so within three days we had a estimated turn up it 's a queen in hazmat I think is their name or something queen man contractor he turned up at the estimated set there for three days while they argued about with the council your compliance side and the counts privileged from the email so I believe and found that they couldn 't take it five climbers up the rage of a local tip we 're going to do it we gentlemen I started Monday they 've been out of every day maybe you should get there about five o 'clock in the morning and finish about 00 30 afternoon a lot at the time they 're sitting around because I can 't do anything got a way for a truck so when the trucks come back late in the afternoon they fill them up and then they and then get back and out and they film up again so it was done through Public Works I haven 't got the engineers I have got each business kind that 's what I believe at the end of the session tonight I 'd be very much interested to hear some more about that thing this would be a compliance manager cold would change or I should get some further details and that we would like to we would like to follow that up to see how that is without because it 's not something that 's crossed the recovery tools it was just at this point the employment so thank you for that information Collins also need to hear to interest any concerns about the compliance thank you for that hello my name is Jane I 'm actually I 'm representing a couple of care organizations in the area namely lifeline you know in AdvoCare and the financial rights Legal Center I 've come here tonight just to inform people that we are actually having an information evening their support information evening about what care organizations have what support with insurance under insurance and this event is actually happening in other dalla on the 10th of March at the other Dallas Civic Center I have some details over there that you can take a little bit of a flyer to take home but this is just about you know pro bono support under insurance particularly is a big issue for a lot of people that they may be under underinsured and that the final write final financial rights and Legal Center is working with the financial the Insurance Council to actually rent make sure the people that have been under insured get the care and support they need so that is some details over there if anyone wanted to and I 'm really connecting with Mike at the the social era see everybody 's welcome particularly someone I think Amanda was mentioning about you know vicarious trauma and how we talk to children around these grits so we 're drink the night would be broken up into mental health and financial health and recovery for the medium and long term and the specific care organizations in the shop Haven hello yeah wouldn 't be the right distance for the work for an algebra liked this man here with his balance especially with the compliance officers and Amanda knows me yeah we had a thing there were there was a fence and it was polystyrene glue blown all across their property and where the fence was and whether it was some of our property and all this different stuff the compliance officers he was with a fine my wife was very very upset she was in tears four days after it 's down to court I try to get criminal action brought against us and we said what the fence can stay at 1,800 and they said now it 's got to be completely demolished and it cost us money to keep it there and I 'm in hundred big amounts on our property and then we wanted to order some choka balance on our fans and a rural block and the compliance officers and everything took us to court and said we didn 't have the right to use our influent from a dairy and some basic think we run as a counselor than this elections and try and sort some of these problems and get big sensi way and that 's what I 'm going to do and because my livelihood is a dairy farm that 's been destroyed by that couldn 't that house there and those people complaining and putting these new restrictions on us and the compliance offices as you aside I come and read the raw acted and then a main the simple it 's the law right 830 plenty of time for completely destroy all we 're not all of us but what I 'm saying is there 's questioning relations recovers yes it is yeah you have all your faces burn it down and you put them in a slight error that person you do a claim on and that 's what 's happened to us and in the last four months your crush on you corrected those areas and it 's just for trees and stuff so only boys have people to make sure that they 've got the boundary fences in the correct position and I don 't Vince actually through hell either that climbing in that way in and stuff and the council have not supported us so the question is why aren 't they acknowledge the actual proper title that was created for that McRae on plan instead of what they 've done is put it back to an older one of my devotee one and so I 've actually put that dick Saudi in easy an issue we are nowadays but if you 'll fix it in their own place and someone claims you later put you for a little stuff that we pay [Music] right well if you 're getting the same trouble as we 've had we all the Polish respect to recovery thank you sir okay I just wanted to make a point backs out my own audience in Punjab well we don 't believe in that job in the moment when we probably we 're being bunch of mystic strike guns we 've seen nobody we 've seen no Ferrari something actually expects a virus could be a little bit remote and it 's an area all about John has people living in itself so we have no water tanks that filter down the soul down but we understand because it 's one done and we find for about ten kilometers at this point as far as I will wait so what I 'm saying is there are lots of people in different places doing perceive that we are going to play some money to move those but the access roads so that we can get prepared baleen yeah we are insurance but the excess right at a surprise so no one wants to know anything about their excess righted so which I get a ridiculous and then we found in the truck driver vibrant because though it 's got two more underneath the the right surface so their responsibility to fix our own ourselves so all I 'm saying is that we 're insured recently but no one no one seems to have any answers but how we can be helped we don 't have all those answers at the moment however I can say to you is that the immediate disaster recovery office as we said has been set up in consider that that wasn 't sustained but there were a lot of people coming through there so we moved their interview administration 's in and in believe in error but the next step that we 're doing or working with the Office of Emergency Management is piece of outreach program so a mobile recovery office is what we 're working on right now that it 's a minibus that the Office of Emergency Management are providing we 're going to have counsel staff on that bus and we are going to get into these smaller areas in an hour for each program so we 'll be coming to you that hasn 't started just yet but we 'll be analyzing about this we 've got the emergency the other city management coming to the fourth of these community meetings as I mentioned earlier carry value on Monday night so how do you have Office of Emergency Management there that we would like to talk the closer to where you are in writing take out there that really want office and that outreach function will work so I understand I appreciate be everywhere maybe certainly on the agenda it 's very much on their radar to get up the steps under wait that happens as quickly as possible our property is down a little right no this big and it 's dangerous it requests us but everyone else is gone the general came down and my husband was baby on the day working at there about new workplace you know the right surface is treacherous because of Jays gone Bush is gone everything still under that 's a clip where we need this time medical service we could draw to you kilometers and I 've been talking the test refer as has been said the last few days well these are the kind of information I actually want to thank this office because in this duration when they are ranked and they 're very nice young so I thought it so much talent right we 've got a camera in the office sit in your office and two nights later I got a phone call from somebody in Tulsa who have had a message what my incase office and tomorrow somebody to show that he is so it 's only taken a month but that was wonderful because its first thing that 's happening to comment via Russian Celsius I know means get another number just today because so much of the other feel it 's office because they get inside oh yeah well maybe I can go has somebody come up to be ahead can I just say that the things I 'm going on in budge on are certainly not out of mind we have got three claims in to the Department of mangroves where our inspiration about top services for three emergency bridges they 're called they 're called emergency two hundred bridges into interesting about boy into the country by company here at Flinders Industrial Estate and there now with the Arab mess about putting the claims to have those installed at the various bridges that have broken down across the region three particular one is the schoolhouse bridge which is that the school will borrow we 're also in terms of Telstra I 'm actually today contacted pretty well by blowing top card Telstra regional regional got folks at near Edna vacation since the 22nd of December the other night in our meeting in Donna we her if you 're a fellow from release Lynn not identical neck of the woods but nonetheless I brought it to their attention say it 's a bloke view and any sort of communication since the middle of December so we 're not sleeping on it I don 't_''_4802.52 I wish I had really mean this I wish I could actually get in a car and actually go and find everybody out there that 's hurting and just saying can you just tell me what 's going on we do require that input into the system if we actually go attack these things at a systemic level and a complete knowledge if you have every right to say levers like your mind and I 'm only the first having one or uniform for forty is to defend free speech promise you are stable that listen to whatever anybody has to say to do what I can to no I can 't has specifically or your concern I can say that high on our priority list and we have actually as a council placed the claims on the state government to produce the emergency regional I have actually asked the Shoalhaven of the Telstra folks look can you at least send someone on Monday night to can really to be with us to help answer some of the questions which I just but if there is something needs to be fixed which we can watch or getting things done just ask a question like sister I go through another property for bed when I have one point I kilometres yes and that 's probably property said this culvert and I 've spoken of that we can do all the cross on the car that is know why the world is going to support our attract with building materials or anything but then over to replace that on the property hour later I can 't answer that I probably would have thought so but I can 't answer it all of the authority at the moment we 've employed a man Mitch door coming do a patch up job for us so 't kid myself on taiga life Oh when we are allowed to do that that after there we go again if I can say you know idea of the dimension of fencing the mix of European justice okay sorry it 's a bit why don 't you see the questions are really thank you if you are able to make it down the kangaroo dummy can provide further information and hopefully also somebody from questions of the day Thank You Stephen hi my name is Lee Hawkins on the solicitor at legal aid based in our office thank you for coming along tonight like everybody else only the share information about what we blame yourself to do to help people who have been affected by the fires my family or amazed to know about my family adhering Mara I 'm about a bricklayer Amidala and I am to say I 'm so proud of the community and how everyone supported each other I 'm also proud of later than what it 's doing to try and help people there 's two main things that legally had done and providing services disaster response legal service whether post me here I 'll just briefly hold up anyone took a view on that line one 800 801 five to nine through those on the Internet and for those that are here some pliers some post cards and wallet comes over on our table there please feel free to take it away with you we 've got it 's free legal advice it 's being nearby and proximately do be glorious so that 's the first thing that legal aid has done the second thing is we are also working for the three disaster recovery centers that have been set up and bigger bait was made and that 's been the way from where they 're with other services to assist people with legal advice and do some assistance so those services they were available make use of them please that 's about it for me I 'm not like most lawyers about like turkey my stop talking wait a minute please feel free accounts they need or talk to me one-on-one I like body and boys I think the questions about the disaster God will you get a round of applause congratulations look I 've noticed some people already leaving so don 't think some people want to get away tell me so we won 't take one more question there and then I can tell you that staff are happy to stay back as I let 's get away and we can answer your questions perhaps in the smaller dollars go away okay finally when you 're angry dragon or scenario and we were defective like the fires in any one way shape or form except for a lot of fear I guess I 'm totally and my voice is show you have told me and all over Ostrom with the amount of work that 's gone and the amount of work that music in an amazing job you were doing my question obviously is I live opposite the grotto the grotto was in suffer the area a walking area but at the moment there 's a lot of areas exceedingly dry I got in touch with council just with regards to what management risk management and a six-month he 's lucky who in fact going to lead to the RFS and I would think that the money from the geography says nearly enough only of treitz however I 'm just wondering future planning what is likely to happen between a system of management of the systems of risk areas and I think we might take that 196 that 's like I know there is work going on within Council there 's been a couple of notice of motion from the council with relation to visits and clearings and so on so one there 's still a lot of information going or work on the on in the background there that 's going to be workshop through with the counselors so having to talk to you at the end of this and get some details and we can keep in contact that we might we want to that 's okay thank you we want to take that one more question and then lady problem I think we 'd like to say a few words hi everyone from Department of Communities and justice from the part that deals with social housing and housing that people are aware that there 's a team that 's been set up to assist people move from there people who 've lost their homes or can return home to move out of any temporary combination or with living with family and friends if they 're looking for a more medium term option as they wait to rebuild there 's a whole lot of assistance that 's available we discounted rents or various other options with advance renter and so on and there 's also a team that can help do some of the legwork and also battle the bureaucracy from the inside it 's also very hard but I just wanted to make people aware I 'm gonna send it to Kate and get it put on the council website Thank You Maria [Music] thanks everyone I just wanted to bring your attention to the fact that angular care we have our main office in Nara and we cover right down the coast so we 're offering no cost counseling for anyone impacted by those clients and we have offices in our but we also have outreach offices like to take up that offer or anyone you know you don 't have to have lost property or of course but if you are impacted in any way or if you know others who are please direct them to our service so we 've got a brochure there with the one number to call to access counseling we 've also got a couple of guides as well that we 've put together so one that you 'll find on the table is got a whole list of all the financial and practical supports that we 've been able to identify across that are available for you so have a look at that and we 've also put together a short brochure about the psychological and emotional impacts of living through bushfire you guys know all about that you could teach us about that but if you want something to take away your perhaps to give to someone who may be suffering through and thinking that they should be getting on and being ok now then something like that might just be able to broaden their view about okay this support so thanks everyone [Applause] I think we wanted leave it at that fool this evening as I said stop gonna stay here we 're gonna team leaders he this one of us don 't you I 'm about the time no man so

    "text": "ladies and gents work on that one for you I do have a loud voice I usually get told to shut up rather than actually speak into a microphone so ladies and gents good afternoon and thank you for coming this afternoon my name 's Marc Williams and these are the controller for the current push for emergency within the Shoalhaven and Yerba dollar areas the SUP moves meeting is to advise the local community around here about the Korowai fire specifically but also that were the common and father and the other fireman sees that we have within the area since the 26th of September I 'm sorry November we 've been battling the the Korowai and fire and it 's growing to over two hundred and thirty six thousand hectares the reason for a lot of that growth is the a the location of where the fire has situated itself in through a wilderness country through in excess form National Park areas and has moved through those wilderness areas and giving us a lot of grief out along the coast over those times as we 've had the don 't remember the original fire was started by a lightning strike now that 's been confirmed from fire investigation and crews both local also around the state and interstate CFA Queensland Tasmania international New Zealand and also crews from specialists from America and Canada have been part of this firefighting contingent in the Shoalhaven as we 're all aware anybody who 's been watching the news over the last three months you South Wales is experiencing one of the worst droughts that we 've ever seen it may not be the longest drought that was seen but it is certainly one of them severe in the lack of rainfall that we 've been experienced in the last couple of years even in the last week myself I 've noticed a significant change in our vegetation in the formerly you can actually see that dieback occurring within that vegetation just showing how broad the nature is and obviously that makes it more and more fire prone combine that with the the hot summer that we 're having rainfall and some of the windy conditions makes firefighting extremely difficult to aid well as the line including the large air tanker and very large air tanker anybody in and around narrow would have seen the the action that 's been happening with those aircraft and again is continuing today and will continue into the future unfortunately we are in a situation that these fires are unable to be contained until we get significant rainfall or they run out of fuel to burn with that there 's still a significant portion of where the Shoalhaven with vegetation that will burn and this farm will continue we have seen this fire move up the coast through in a general northerly direction but when we get there north westerly winds that is where it gives us the grief and since figures of fire basically out to the coast impacting on those coastal communities coastal communities that we 've had impacted range from North Doris down the South right through in including tabari and Morley point koala at all points south end of the North Terrace area amazingly and thanks to the absolutely awesome work by the firefighting fraternity out there including those aviation assets our this point in time [Music] thanks I 'll pass that on to the firefighters out there who are doing the hard work with that of this runaround out the actual fire grounds that we have at present so to bring everybody up to speed with their location and what we 're up to so I 'll start firstly with the competent fire the Covenant fires burning in and around Forest Road common the fire on its first aid and into the second a cross forest road and into the outskirts of the South narrow industrial state and back ends of each narrow Warranty area that fire is burning whilst it 's predominantly flat land it is burning in very thick costal bushland there is a lot of fuel in the area there is a lot of disturbed ground where the access has been through the population base in and around that area but there 's also a large tract of paddock pasture and heathland with that includes peat and if anybody knows anything about firefighting once it gets into plate it makes it extremely difficult to extinguish so most of at other times often many many meters away from where it actually goes underground combine that with the fluky and dry winds that we 've been receiving even from the Northeast predominantly and of--they Sulli winds around here a coastal and coming off from the shore with some moisture and humidity involved even these winds are coming in dry off the off the water and drying out humidity levels are so low that the spot fire activity of this fire continues to create hassles for the fire ground as late as only half an hour ago we have had a breach at one of our containment lines on that fire crews and aviation assets are currently working on that and they are confident of again tonight getting a hard line with the use of the heavy Machinery around that tonight unfortunately coming as we can experience the day with the 30 32 degree temperatures that we have receiving today tomorrow and over the weekend we can experience 36 up to 38 degrees culminating in Tuesday women will have a strong slowly change coming through they were unknown exactly at what can remember a week ago now that is one of the worst fire condition days I 've experienced on the coast let alone around the South Wales but weather day saw that car around fire moved in a northerly direction of over 12 and a half kilometers it consumed what was the team genre fire at that point in time and was responsible for the loss of 12 buildings and outbuildings in the sassafras area as well as nearest homes and dwellings in the near occur area what we are seeing at the moment as I said with the building where the fires areas being so stressed is that the fire activity is warranted that bad and on conditions that date it is not safe for our firefighters to be in front of that fire stays like we are going to experience again coming up to over the weekend and into next week we 'll see our firefighters fall back into defensive fire fighting tactics advising the public of where the fire is making sure that the public is safe wherever possible and defending the homes with defensive firefighting we firefighters in front of the flames that expect them to pull this thing up as I said earlier at the president stage given the weather conditions that we were serving we are not in a position to get containment lines around these this fire given the experience of it before the onslaught of the next weather conditions so back on them finishing off the comment at 00 we 're hopeful that with patrolling over the weekend and heavy patrolling and aviation assistance we 'll keep that fire wrapped up and contained over the weekend but given the results of the last few days with that spot fire activity it is likely and possible that that fire will come alive over the weekend and we 'll be responding heavily to that as it threatens those coastal properties areas our concern around that far is obviously the areas of eastern our warranty as I just mentioned but also once we get the northerly winds on it it does open up the tract of land through bull mile and answer the coastline around Huskisson and then when the sub early change can push point and such so again but residents around those areas need to be acutely aware of that fire in their landscape what 's the fires near me application listen to the alerts as they come out from time to time under the car around fire crews are heavily engaged over the last two days in back burning off the princess following in an area known from little Forest Road in the south up to and including the back end of one day lien crews have then used turpentine road as a fallback option or a containment line back burn off that up to Maine Road 92 at this present time they 're still out in that area they have had numerous spot fires over the line but each of those have been able to be caught so far this afternoon I can 't stress enough how dangerous this work is for the crews and how tenuous it is for us to actually have those spot fires occurring behind the crews and it 's imperative that obviously we jump on the lows as soon as possible so it is a risky fire won 't continue to run unabated in the northerly direction and likely cross the princess hallway and impact on those coastal villages east of wand and in there was a significant spot fire in the east of Princess Highway three days ago around the Monday young area which is on the way up to Sussex Inlet I 'm happy to report that spot fire has been wrapped up and will be continued to be patrolled over the weekend as well so I 'm sure you can also understand that every time I say it 's going to be patrolled that 's another one all firefighting appliances that are having to be tasked to that area which then makes it less available for us to do other work so we do have a count a large number of appliances around we are getting additional assistance in this weekend for this hot weather but there will not and cannot be enough for a fire appliance for each and every residence it is not a feasible expectation and it never will be even if we were the only fire in the state are currently also back burning off main road 92 to the west and are hopeful that we can contain that fire to the general West and steer it down along the yellow wall area and along Berea Road that will then tie up our Tiberium and then we are hopeful to try and get favorable weather conditions and have the fire approach the Shoalhaven River in a cooler part of the evening or overnight that the sole Haven River may have a chance of pulling this far up experience over the last month has shown however that that is again a risky option and likely not a whole if it gets any pressure from the incoming suddenly that we 're expecting on Monday afternoon Tuesday what they will mean is that if the fire does breach the Shoalhaven River it gets to the north side it will then open up a whole area of added bushland right through and including Kangaroo Valley and potentially up to fitzroy falls and up to the back end of the Illawarra up to the plateau which schneider skates me off the top of my to advise everybody a likelihood of that occurring the possibility of that occurring and imploring on the public to ensure that you have your bushfire Survival plans in place know you have that conversation with your family and know what you are going to do should that eventuate the Rural Fire Service is pretty proud about our warning systems of being able to get them out now watching it up watch an ACK status up to the emergency alerts and being able to stick out those just people to start shelter-in-place and the light however I must please us do not rely on that occurring with the amount of fire that 's on the landscape not only in the shoulder Haven but around the state it is technology it can take some time to get up we will ensure that it doesn 't wherever possible but it should not be your only means of defense or being alert of what is going on we will continue to hold these meetings wherever we can in localities to advise locals exactly what to expect where we can but we 're also engaging in those areas that may be in the fire path up to speed to let you know that it is likely that if this buyer does jump the Shoalhaven River the north side of the river right through to those areas I just mentioned could and will be coming under impact at this far as it progresses that 's the downside the good side is that there as I said those additional crews that we have in here the plans that we have in place within the incident management team we are working on everything from the alert status the the systems that we upload for particular areas suburbs and the likes are all in place and being planned on a daily basis we also have numerous containment options available to us that we are going to try and employ before that gets to that point however most of those are through bushland and again over the experience of this summer those bushland fire trials the likes of that that have bush either side of a a break where we would normally hold a normal fire I 'm not holding to more known designated roadway systems that we know that we 've got a chance of holding the moment over to the south also a down to the south of the Karo and fire for information more for people up in this area we do have the sovereign division and that 's for the fire that 's jumped the Kings Highway and down into Maria there is a large finger of fire burning in the upper area around government Bend that has jumped the Kings Highway though is being fairly stagnant over the last week but we are expecting that to take a run Northwest Liesman are a forecast for the area and with that opens up their coastal villages from Batemans Bay Mogo and down to Maria at this point in time they 're also battling a new fire down there at araluen and we are hopeful we 'll get containment on that later on this evening but again that 's a step on resources that we 've had to do for the last three days over the west side um there may have seen that the mapping for because we have exercised a part of the powering local government area over to the control of the instrument management team which has been set up in Queen bian and that is now known as the charlie 's forest fire and that includes such areas as Mariga and mongol oh and obviously Charlie 's forest they are now managing that section of the fire and it is now known as the Charlie 's forest fire and it sits at around thirty six thousand hectares at this point in time I could advise they are still actively firefighting out them they 've had breaches of their containment lines out to the west today back up to the north again we are working along Braidwood Road main road dining soon to wrap that up and get that road open as soon as practically possible at the moment being that biggest issue that we have with roadways and keeping them open is this significant amount of tree fall we are getting the bush land is that stressed with the drought that any heat whatsoever being put into the ground is seeing like very this fire season and I 'm sure don 't need to remind everybody of the the tragedy that occurred only earlier this week which their firefighters being killed by a falling tree in the Buxton fire in Sydney we can 't afford to have a repeat of that especially for our emergency services but also especially for members of the public therefore we will not be opening roadways again until it is deemed safe we have specialists arborists trained it changed or careers going through and clearing those dangerous trees in regards to the Kings Highway that roadway system will be closed for over a month the reason being for that is not only the fire packed into that area but it 's also the significant area where it has burnt through involves a steep cutting the street cutting was also stabilized by the trees and the vegetation that was around and because that is burnt you 're seeing significant rock fall in the area and again too dangerous for the members of the public to traverse and it is going to take at least that month for them to I know it 's Christmas as much as a lot of our people didn 't get to spend it at home we are acutely aware the impact that this is having on the local community both in tourism and also friends and family coming to visit we are attempting to get this situation under control as soon as possible but it is unfortunately due to the circumstances we have the size of the incident and the weather systems that we have practically impossible to get those roads and this system under control in the foreseeable future with me today I 've got members out of my internal management team Tim Vincent controller from national parks Ian Smith I 'm on left also Brad Collins and Phil Patterson from your fire services our public liaison offices and also inspector race times who is the local Emergency Operations controller and also the officer in charge of Nara station for the New South Wales police right heads a team that assists me and my team in combating this incident I need to reassure everybody that we do have a full incident management team through to logistics and also obviously the operations but what we are also supported for all and with is rayon his team which has got everybody from local Land Services the local council health ambulance SES every agency in board and on board with that that facility and in that area and with that team to provide us with the support that we need at any one time I am absolutely proud of the team that we have in place both on race side and the incident management team that we have a badge off approach right through the board we have members from all those different agencies coming together in a united front to actually form together and put all their expertise on the table to assist the community and it 's working second to none we are being held in absolutely high regard at a state level and also national level where we 've had visitors from outside the area from different states coming over to see how we are managing this event so that 's a little bit of kudos to everybody and all the other agencies the fire ground as well and again it 's a bad job approach we have been assisted no end not only the volunteers of the RFS which we all know and love but also from our sister agencies such as fire rescue national parks state forests and all those other agencies that are coming from other areas of the Australia it has been an absolute godsend to us to actually have that increased number of active firefighters out on the ground we 've seen fire trucks from different agencies being manned by people from different agencies and that 's the first time I must say I 've seen that in my career of over 30 years so it is truly an international event and it is truly a mark of everybody who is involved here to assist the community and get us back to normally so to the firefighters and everybody up there I 'd also say a huge thanks [Applause] locally we 're also acutely aware and prepared for any new ignitions well we saw last Saturday with the weather condition that came through is what we call para through a destabilized atmosphere current and created its own dry lightning storm overhead that is possible to occur again on Tuesday and what that sees is a market increase in fire activity and wind directions on the fire ground can be very very erratic and that means we conditions coming from areas where we don 't expect it for making the firefighters jobs just that little bit harder it also means that the fire can make those huge runs as it did last Sunday so we 're also acutely aware of that we are also aware that other accidents occur there are other ignitions possible so we do always ensure that we have that backup capacity to respond to new incidents as required let 's hope they aren 't what I 'll do now I 'll just check and make sure I 've covered everything I 'm getting the thumbs up this so it 's good so what I 'll do now is I 'll open it up to a few questions please if you have an individual issue for your own particular property that you wish to address we you 've got any specific questions in relation to the fire warning if it 's so fun please let us know down the road is going to walk around with a couple of microphones and build you can take this one [Music] in your gutters when you 're cleaning them out the you know often on the bottom there 's like this pit type mosques all the base and we 've got those clothes other than over gutters do we need to is that gonna burn like you just suggest to pick will she 'll be get all that out before we fill our goes my recommendation would be yes whilst while Sarah is so dry it would be yes if you gathers are going to be full of water it wouldn 't be so much of an issue so it 's very difficult to get under that leisure but I 'd probably say you might be right as long as you keep those gathers for water thank you I 'm just married what is the possible impact on the now hilarion okay so the question was about the possible two things you 've got the common in fire going to the east and you 've also got the current raining fire coming past out on the west many of those breaches depending on the wind conditions at the time could impact on the narrow hill area and such we 've actually got those polygons loaded to try and advise as much as possible one thing I did forget to mention is crews will be continuing to undertake fire fighting back burning operations throughout this evening and throughout tomorrow before those weak conditions to come up we will be ceasing those operations as that we where the changes for safety measures and so we actually get some depth on those background operations to provide that sort of access so you can 't expect to see an increase he 's smoked in and around the main road bony to area which has been occurring today and also in a lesser area around the comet Empire yep certainly so as it burns through the valley in hastily pushed from that wind will see those areas such as camber whare bojong tappet alley onto that valley system through the Morton national park came and could become under impact so yes what do you recommend we do with full about the tear gas bottles and fuel cans aluminum is in relation to what to do with flammable objects such as gas Silver 's and that around your properties in general terms keep them away from your house get them out into the open area where they 're not gonna have any sort of impact around that that area a gas cylinder will give you a long time of exposed take before it files in general terms but if you 're unsure about it certainly moving away from your your building by about 10 days and it should be fine the question for the audience would Sloan was there any plans to do back booting north of the river at this point in time back burning isn 't planned for north of the river we won 't_''_1512.1 the other taking any back burning operations north of the river until that fire actually breaches the river we are doing a lot of perimetry earthworks in and obviously they are fanning out as the SFI priority wouldn 't need the other thing we 're also doing for everybody 's information is we 're also involving our neighboring districts areas such as yes through to and including the area such as Bumgarner tell them up through Banda moon we in July Penrose right through to Fitzroy polls are all engaged and they 're all starting to have these community meetings as well some of those starting off tomorrow I just wanted to it 's goes to kangaroo domine and up would it is there a chance that come up over berry mountain yeah yes he 's certainly possible where they need all three pushes the fire moves through the Kangaroo Valley again anywhere within urban interface with bushland and the continuous timber line from wherever the fire is moving could come under impact well we are hopeful for is obviously that fire comes through as a flanking fire I mean these saw it on approach but again any northwesterly push with a fire that 's gone past will see those areas to the east potentially come under a you are choosing to shelter in place and you 'll notice with some of our warnings that we go out we try and get the public as much notice as possible in any event we 'll try and tell people that if you are going to leave to leave early and leave now once it becomes too dangerous for that to occur we will ask people to shelter in place as the safest option one of the most dangerous parts about our industries and with meant dealing with the public is having members of the public on roadway systems as the fire front goes through if you 've never been involved in a fire overrun if you 've never been involved in a major bushfire event it turns day in tonight it is acutely distressing event and is something you must be acutely aware of and ready for if you are choosing to stay and defend with that a lot as I said having people on a roadway system making a last-minute dusk attempt to try and get out we have multitudes of people and a lot of evidence where roadways been blocked by trees and people have been trapped in their cars because of that so again the best advice is if you are going to leave get out well and truly early before that happens if you choose to stay and stay in the fend or shelter in place if that message comes out have your property prepared now is the time to prepare your property if you already have not get those gutter plugs in remove the flammable material away from your house mow the lawns have the sprinkler systems ready have wet blankets ready have the bar full of water all the standard ones that you should all well know to protect yourself in the event of a fire inside if you have to shelter in place in your house inside the house with the windows closed is the safest location after the fire moves through and you will hear the fire front blew through as you can open the door slowly once you can get out you can then go out and start putting out spot fires in the event that the house is the net another safer area but hopefully though not the case in this fire okay so in relation to that right through the statement from experience up in the Northern Tablelands I can say that rain forest normally only burned once in a hundred years this year is that year we have seen rain forest right through New South Wales and basically the entire length of the Great Dividing range burning where firefighting used to involve the use of rain forests is that part of our containment options we can 't rely on that at the current climate and the current vegetation dry dust the Vino Mountains of fire came over in 68 we came across the top it jumped over the top of us and went to the next ridge cause we 're down on the side we 're protected from the west we don 't get there 's always a six million dollar question so again build your networks up don 't rely on the RFS applications they will work and we will hold them up as it wherever possible but talk to neighbors talk to each other look alright stay abreast of the situation and in relation to when to set start your sprinklers I can 't give you that answer it 's something it 's an individual case-by-case basis it 'll be a decision you need to make at the time and obviously when it gets to that point having those sprinkles on will obviously provide you that extra bit of protection but it is still not a guarantee in the firestorm type event could you give us the frequencies of the best radio stations to listen to in the event that we rely on that as well as the fires near my application yes so whilst we try and keep all of our local radio stations up-to-date wherever possible with the fire 's progress one that we are promoting throughout New South Wales is used to the IBC so locally here ABC Illawarra further down the coast OBC burger have been the ones will be doing more regular broadcast and they actually cut into their regular programming to do the bushfire announcements can we access GPS for response Raj in other words if you 're making us if we knew the exact GPS location of the problem okay so the question was in relation to can we provide the exact GPS location of the fire front the mapping that you will see on them fires near Mia this is up-to-date as we can bring it up to so that does take some time for our mappers to digitalize while we get the Intel from the fire ground or from our aviation assets but as soon as we upload it into the system but not that you will see on fires Mimi is the 8th most accurate that we can provide everybody in relation to the breaking in at the IBC Laura I know it is happening it certainly happens once we break into what 's an AK status or emergency alert status and that is when they break into their local programming and some of you may have actually heard my raspy voice on there a few times already of the fact okay [Music] initially directions of that we 're going to copy here buddy quit but last year August last year you 're 22 burn the side coming in from capita be through the dairy and within education certainly so as I mentioned before any person living in or around urban interface with bushland is the risk of this fire moving through you only have to go onto Google Earth and have a look at those vegetation bands as they move through if you are joining any one of us but we also need to understand that this fire does also and any fire can spot now I mentioned that with the Commodore fire and what we have been seeing during this event is spot for activity occurring up to twelve kilometers in front of the actual fire front and that 's under extreme circumstances those extreme weather days but it is possible so even if your patch of Bush Leaney you isn 't right on the introvert just like lines on song but moving on thank you in relation to that even if your batch of bushland in or around your premises is not joined up to where the current fire front is you are still at risk of spot fire activity or new property prepared have your own personal plans prepared have that discussion with your loved ones and know what you are going to do [Applause] [Music] thank you once again the team will take that on board but I 'll certainly class [Music] in relation and then just come to me how did the weather system that we are going to be seen moving ahead is the chance of thunderstorms in the area we do have a band of lightning that 's gone through down around burger at the moment and whilst that 's not a concern to you people here particularly over the coming days additional lightning in around the area if it 's not and adjoining with rain can also be a source of new ignitions in the area it 's wondering if people with larger animals are safe they 're going to bury or plan ashoka okay so individual circumstances what we determined by those individual people without knowing your own animals and what you have it 's a decision you need to make yourself by all means those in those people in those circumstances if you need after the meeting and have a chat to us and we 'll try and point you in the right direction but in the event where we do have major fire impact into urban settlement areas we will have evacuation centers open for anybody displaced by the fire and included in that will be the availability for people to bring their pets including horses etc to know my patients one of those being our show ground and all we see though the other ones location you suggestion good boy again again those evacuation centers and messes it up are all obviously a location again your own personal plan should identify that have a think to yourself nowhere is gonna be a safe place no your friends and family that are around the area and any locations that may not be under such a large threat have your identified areas and know and had that conversation with the people that you 're actually going to go and visit larger built-up areas well and truly away from five fronts are obviously the key location as well as those lead back centers in a what we call neighborhoods safer places those neighborhood safer places you 'll also see the writing on that sign is a place of last resort that is when all else fails or you don 't have that plan in place and you need somewhere to go because you are compromised where you are you can go to that location and it will provide you with an area that could be and should be safe for you to survive now I must say it is the place of last resort for that reason it is probably going to be an open field somewhere it will not be a coffee truck to serve you doughnuts it will be horrific if the fire comes in and around that area and there 'll be very little support so it is a place of last resort should you need to go to and again part of your bushfire plan should be knowing where those are and they are all listed on the website I 'm just wondering behind the larger shops and going over the state and on the watch on our request started saying coming through there okay so again just mentioning that three kilometers is well within spotting distance so I squat far into that area is possible we are mindful of that we are patrolling that far and will continue to do some of that area the mall that we patrol those areas the longer than a fire stays cooler for the safer it becomes but given the fact that we 're still getting fire activity in around that area again implore on people to stay vigilant stay aware of your surroundings have that network and watch those warnings have been here do those warnings when we send them out trust me from someone who has to issue those warnings the process that I have to follow through is not an easy one and it 's not one that I 'll make likely and so when we do issue we really appreciate the fact that people hate the attention that we do how much assistance you 're getting from the AMF with there okay so the question was there how much assistance we 're getting from the military and relation this fire our local arrangements here in Nara a second to none of our military with HMAS albatross at our back door step the ability and the use and the the support that they provide us is second to none and that 's been even before this fire fire personally I 've had great relationships with the base command and update and the mat base management we have our air base set up on HMAS albatross we have now got that facility up and running when we 're actually reloading and refueling the lot very large air tankers so that 's a coup the area it makes their job a lot easier having those planes being able to turn I turn around and back over the fire ground in such a short timeframe but we 're also receiving our assistance from the base in the form of accommodation and also supporting our logistical arrangements so and they are a key part of the EOC as a member of their do seat and provide additional assistance as we need to higher priorities to my own population is that what you 're saying ok at the priority areas we obviously have all of our mapping data which is supplied through obviously state federal areas and also local government areas on that mapping shows us the threat and assets where population is and that 's from a single rural dwelling right through the urban population areas such as bond with varying the line on top of that we also ground throughout the area so we send crews out we send public liaison officers out community filled liaison offices out to patrol an area before a fire comes on the impact to ensure there 's not other areas that we haven 't had knocked on any mapping for what reason what we try and do is do the best we possibly can for everybody that 's out there it would be nice to say there is a fire truck for every property but there 's not so at times what we may see is actually having to consume an area where there may be only a couple of residents but we 'll provide a fire truck or support or at least advise into that community into they had a lot of that also determines where we get to larger rural properties where you have lots of pasture cattle grazing in the life of that a lot of those properties are well and truly cleared and basically self-reliant they have their own firefighting equipment on board so they can actually self help themselves so that will also be a determining factor on how we approach the firefighting but we are acutely aware of to population areas areas where we get into urban civilization people tend to be not as well prepared or not as expecting a fire occurring so we 'll pour additional resources into that area to protect that is require do you idea of how long we go to sit in their boat I got nervous are we looking at finding alternative I 've got horses we physically bought a house a week ago we moved out from Sydney I want to show them back if I can so I 'm looking at two weeks it 's really stored to three days so as I said earlier the the generation of this flyer will be it 'll be determined on the amount of fuel that there is to consume firefighting efforts at this point in time are not pulling this far up where if I will run in a day where it won 't run in the day is building two terminals so many variables it 's not funny everything from the vegetation talked at the topography to the angle whether a farm approaches in daylight all the cool of the morning I can 't give you an answer to that question it could be three days and it could be threaded fitzroy falls it could be three weeks or three months until we get rainfall also those items are determined there is no answer that question I 'm sorry I 've gotta say that that question was how people can assist the firefighters the biggest thing you can possibly do for any firefighter out there is to take the time to say thank you that 's all they want I can honestly say as a volunteer myself and coming up through the ranks and now into the position we 're on that a simple see them walking down the street boost their morale 15-fold and they will go again and again and again I have trouble telling my people to go home and that 's half of my biggest argument so they don 't get too tired they don 't need much they are very well funded across the board the different agencies we supply a nice foot and equipment right across the board we have emergency funding and provisions we are supported by local state and federal funding and we will continue to provide that funding there is nothing that we can 't provide them that they did essentially need so that 's simple thank you is what [Applause] [Music] Lopez wanted to do more one hand are more than happy as I said to hang around there are leaflets our hope people have happened and if you want to take on your own individual items with us our children right I 'm just wondering like how long do we wait like reciting my village with fire starts coming through this habit alley how close is too close like I just don 't_''_2783.65 wait another question on when if you 're asking yourself that question and you 're seeing far in the distance I would be saying you 've already answered your own question your personal circumstances where you 're not comfortable the best place to be is to leave and leave early okay last one okay so the question is relation to the use of what we call static water supplies if you have a pool whether it can be used or tank water all of our firefighters are trained that once they attend your premises that 'll be the first thing that they look for are usable water and B can we get access to it and then if possible basically we 'll use it if we absolutely have to but where possible we 'll try and engage with the property owner if you do have water supply available I 've seen everything this year from people growing on the side of they tanks ever to drawing on the gutter that there is a pool on the backyard but as I said that our firefighters will use that and we 'll can see it from the air so that makes it a little bit easier as well yeah we then specifically seen the type of equipment that you 're talking about that would be very difficult that was in relation to actually using boats on the water to extinguish the fires that approaches and the other thing is is what time and under what conditions that fire approaches the river whether it be safe to do so also so certainly we do have boats within the Shoalhaven we can call on other sea around the area should it be required but those monitors and those pumping systems are fairly complex that would require that but we do have access to things like marine rescue also to assist if need be ladies and gents thank you very much [Music] [Applause] [Music] really appreciate that everybody came out this often to get this attention that shows me that obviously people are treating this serious it is a serious consideration that you need to make please continue to stay abreast of the situation and we 'll be up here for the next half an hour so thank you [Applause] _"

the combination of the both strong drawing the whistling wings Manning the planks met with an old basically read over that area if we 've got certainly exacerbated the fog where the conditions of no experiences its Amin added to the level of destruction in that area we 're also acutely aware and every dollar all absolute all the families and loved ones of thought I made the discovery that also especially to notice of loss monster currently we are looking at about as another significant whether done for me at the moment we have what we we still experiencing and temperatures even at close to about 30 degrees give it a diesel 50 per single law and as I said before with the drug deal that we 've got and that area that falls still significantly burning in the landscape these are very scattered around there 's a lot of water and what we have got is a matter that they need from us where we have these speakers apartment ammonia that are still a large proportion of the bush length even around the general farm pop and as a result with the extreme conditions that are expected this satellite is going to give us a a what a great relationship way that be 50 42 plus the grace communities is very very luck and we expect that Bailey 's Northwest but my sister Dinah leather the night we will expect the game to say is subtly changed and again our previous experience with this particular fire that suddenly will come through and cause II normally the farm flank of the car as we call it to turn into the head of the barn and pushes 85 in a general Holden son kyliebruce visually we reach this hallway yesterday we managed to get in Princes Highway a light loss not for a short period of time before pulling hair again that I lost the outside before we managed to agree evident and reminded myself at night and early morning period and tonight unfortunately those fingers as far as I mentioned with both sides of the pot both sides of the highway and during the night today that my has moved up and crossed the pictures highway game forcing its closure again this afternoon crews are actively engaged along members of this nation conducting emergency back building operations to get that back Horseman highway aware to me about their request to the community especially those in the tourist area to lay here we have previously requested for a number of ways to play was seriously considered they have options about not coming down over this period talk about 37 farm it 's down there not to the bike though lately with the weather the way out are expecting on satellite we have nothing a sight situations at home extra people within the community that did not report me you will see possibly has the whole areas combined the ladies the juices this morning widely despite wine may be related on again Asti complaining from the Amidala community including now a teachers in the area to bike back the area well Nicole senator that makes it a it sounds easy to do but it 's very hard to do with the local roads were lost during the the place this course in similarly welcome communities where highest rated people cry many places 20 to 30 people at a time after the era and everything to get back to behind like they go to another cycle way class and we 'll get that over the Syrian country possible because we also receive the we 've done so by timing the Wechsler always like is having advice in the traffic box forever their attention itself facing the lab prepping my pretty as possible through the area we 're going out a little stuff to try and give it in London services back in order and that includes Palace restoration of which we introduced receipt this morning [Music] telecommunication it 's going back so what was one of the easy the area and also runs right over us mutilate sumo slammers want to stab sorry excitedly these knees we 're old acutely aware of how much tourism brings to the area and it is a I 'm hungry income and attraction to the area but it is not a safe place to be and unfortunately we can 't provide we would like to those people if they remain in the community what we are also asking for is anybody who is not prepared and do not have any properties compared to the state that they really the same reply slowly and that means now anytime from this point onwards in the lead-up to Sunday is the time for you if you are not gonna stay in this location to adapt to a bushfire plan which I although you have that in place yet as we 've been asked to get severely for the last month and a half please enact that plan if your attention is not to leading not sustained defend your house now 's the time to adapt that plan and move to a safer location we have so much more on the landscape on Saturday if the weeds that the expected weather comes through as it easily it 's very likely that fire can and will come through the area and can shoot what else to post one must be so uneasy you assistance we have through the last month and we will continue to receive assistance with another 25 artists coming in the stuff with normativity we also have additional assistance especially personnel on top of the ones we already have coming in from Canada and other stressors we also have size maintenance coming huge amount of label that way and any one time we could type out to 547 a but with the population of ice that we have and the area of fog that we have of Atlanta it is impossible for us to provide apart monster every structure in the area so again imploring on everybody to ahead of us which both plans in Christ to adhere to the boys to enact that plan now and even when you are deciding to leave cleanup and broad with the liner that is it as far as the breathing 's concerned as I said the the fog still continues to drive generally around the area the northern part of the barn we do have driving towards the shoreline at this point in time it relates to the south the shot landed river we did a one excursion or a spotted up under the drying conditions that was jumping off very quickly crews we are continually monitoring vessel situations and for those who need both of the rivet that may be here today we 're watching online we will be advising it evening when even when that containment line he 's a river eating supplies is very narrow and adapt under a strong southerly condition as we would expect to see on Saturday afternoon it does have the very high potential now there is pain all of the rhythm please say beach but also you 're not out of the woods yet please make sure we 've got the plans in place and be ready to enact Oh [Music] by the devil right it 's Hickman I saw this movie but they say his name for the last month notice that make you like I 'm sorry expect the rice dogs with these electrolytes the operations katralla just ask them to remind everybody as well just to say a point of interest because we are not doing it after that at least the topic in the news of the but about our military assistance I can assure everybody in the military is the city is that we as mentioned in previous brings hundred knights albatrosses the military in general hoping they buy stuff we have accommodations for our Parvati crews from outside the area former feedings as well I say that using out the advice itself and remarking on the area as far as refueling incoming guys that amount of assistance will continue to rise we do however the additional assistance coming in first up both crew transport and the logistical movements around the just wish the reason a lot of assistance authorities making your thought it was from outside agencies within a local emergency management team we have representatives from all agencies we have on our mess health wealth a council you name it every agency muscle agency like Atlanta services are all forming part of that committee and a right next door to the incident management team literally across the hallway and we are able to dial in and use them as soon as possible some of the other things that have happened with people that have been stranded by listening in those like counties out the coastline is being able to get them back to coal Valley as a city moving them back to adding to the traffic you got to get those roads and back out into the communities elements the Navajos communities have been trying to provide them with as much good nature and roadway and assistance as we can it is a stressful time we understand that and tell you most of us woman telecommunication systems go down that buzz happened it hasn 't happened what we 've seen in fact that 's why you can put the points out these 911 no no doubt so again it 's gotta be the plants please make sure we put its to make sure you belong on such as transistor recognize your vehicle radios and charming points to be be complicated also a lot of each other and look after each other one of the most concerning things we see is that people are getting upset and it 's understandable why they 're upset because it is a tragic event that we 're dealing through but with pricing now 36 hours and people are okay with it some of these senses to be able to look out for themselves to look after a job we 're asking everybody to be competitive with each other be patient with each other understand us back to normality and get the community better for normality as soon as we possibly can but all that life will free guides are also connected as you can also imagine how do the the questions that we only get asked is what 's going to happen at the local regards mr.

across the line and I 'm sure [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that 's all the time for the volunteer to come back and doing it tomorrow refresh I know and the last thing I 'll be signing want to write it up to a few questions is that there is a lot of sites and we need may have used a lot of the resources that we have as well as the archivist please leave it your level of attention that you give to individual clients on Facebook or whatever it happens to play whatever social maybe string at the highest expected impact into an area what is going on and around the area because there was a lot of false information happening and also please bear in mind that the on our face doesn 't actively engage in requested donations as an incident management team that 's behind responsibility of the show that we guys have everything they need to combat the fire we are trying to stay on top of these things we will try and tell the terrific where possible to correct any false statements that are out there but as you can imagine the social amenities like the copper dude so please ensure you relying on the appropriate level of social media check with each other and very inclined if there is a lot of false information going around its although good enough of a few questions if you have specific DC wish to study back after the meeting the team and I will stay back and answer any questions big possibly can and just before I 've done enough of the started like each other Lexie general girls voice when i shout of david 's on the local and with them semi original pasta there are several of us across the state we work out of evacuation centers with a special credential under the Emergency Management Act along way below our best SES or so on penetrating experience to support you we have incredibly resilient communities you know the strength which are employment support when the going gets tough it brings out the best of all of us thank you for me if I can service a particular to you so if you or you know somebody who needs some support not necessarily smoker but in this opponent season people often connect with their spiritual roots and what sustenance of nourishment there but if you just in listening ear hearing here chaplains are available evacuation centers and physical support people beyond connecting those supports look out the best lines those people who lives with safety temptations they have special legal support so look after keep up the great work and thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there 's no note if we decide to go from India as a morning I wouldn 't be able to reach down and safety or stopping long lines of traffic so obviously traffic is an issue that 's why today we 've had the police escorts you guys areas across the hallway has been open to make school play or three nights routes so I 'm not gonna lie to you obviously our now Marriott stop us from traffic the ramp at least on me here anyway there are still a number of tourists around here the business bosses of cities to plan you make sure you know these suckers about fuel to get out of the area to get the way today to go and and [Music] [Music] okay then on that particular area like that animation walks right out of American electricity holes in specifics however in general nature please be aware that it 's not just individual for Francis we had a leak we conditions thought we had I mean even as we can expect again spot bars are our main jet engines red as well as viewing vicious it 's not wise to blame anyway under those conditions between 4 and 12 plummets in front of the actual foie gras though stuff large could take call very very quickly and I spoke was that himself generate mana leader and climactic but they can spot out and stalk that themselves and that 's what we saw uneasy and a couple of other Tom 's Judas fish bar emergency and on condition such as we 're going to experience on Saturday a hobby like me again so again please don 't rely on the fact that the current map nation the Far East many kilometers away from you as we saw on these they the farm bootlegging one Russ the previous time before the suddenly conditions we saw the fog laid by the fifteen kilometers under the sovereignty condition so that 's giving you the type of distances that are fire included very quickly so please individual circumstances if you 're anywhere near again a 's using on the car it speaks like the now I 'm going to do everything possible it 's about you guys I just wanted to ask about the size of the fireman so being the curb on fire and the fact that it is so much one of the things that I found to people with it is whenever 's is an active watch that 's put in there it might actually be more burden to people being a Sarah than it is to the people in the north or you know in today 's to the west and I was wondering whether would be better if each our fires divided into agree so the VP Express you know emergency you want it in that area rather than another us that people or a live when I 've gone to right and reach her buttocks it doesn 't actually affect me I I see you on the state that the southern portion of the gutter waiting one just after the Kings Mike he 's down diversity captain Clark and that 's going to help with that of the segregation the fact that there are one of the races collect is because of that reporting structure it allows that expand management in to send out specific information for areas within that market like the government area similarly we 've also done the same pathways couple contouring area looking after the bull pay pulling the choppers correspond also beaches arrived at the cargo and on that request itself a particular issue what I do suggest is anybody by sea teaches in any time that watching that guys up or going to see low it 'll take two seconds to look into that it 'll take two seconds to realize what 's their duties actually under load things we taught them in a particular time and any you know to see loads that go out will be specifically addresses to the localities that they intended for we can 't break it down any further than that and he 's a practical one impossibility to geography dividing these up and infected will create more confusion so I 'll take both we have interest alone from central point wonderful question is the only suspect last century point itself it 's not going to take seven thousands of cars and seven thousand people heat I 'm stating to depend winning on the back of the waters of direct waterfront are we safe at the beginning to the middle of that water another whatever cycle I understand that but he said and it was one of the people down with you to give you an as far as an opinion water after for sure we have quite active community life jackets for water what was ready at the back is that enough people not ok so in general terms are over there is or or over be going to the cycling you will be pretty much so you going into a city area the stock ones in our the likes of that you 're going to be more aluminized area further away from that and it advice the further you go the safety will be there is no guarantee that I can given any particular facility or structure is safe investment land many kilometers away attached and buildings a lot of structures alike just from the around the others however Authority self the best option that you can group up a run companies he be choosing to stay they choke across remote the fuel so Matthew houses unplugging goddess buggy got us up building rapport up all those Center added benefit to you for the reputation you [Music] survey said anyway we need the area in the up now is now and anywhere on the bushel and a device can come up big in fact as I said spoke loss can happen twelve the llamas in front of a BA and the both whistling conditions if you put a lot on that I will say that the fog hangs spot directly to an around the jokes bite through the area may be so I guess you can something 's right back over there was also this recommend for the judges budgetary area from the fog going to the southwest company conditions so everywhere do we need these two areas in the detention area [Music] boy that was dying back the number of people have not come here was to us happens is there a chance that emergency centers is blocking that that will become a game of this moment on this is the identified electro I should step into the area we do you every capacity need lots of lots of paper that might be exactly good but we 're also expecting that not everybody will be evacuated all the time to be effective I should say now I have been a stone right here tonight maples push gloss of a plane and that they planning to Laban thinking to guide to the native accent and a

not align an ABEC sound a Mexican finally get it they opened up a bank you might require thinking to splice finance body I 'm just new to the area right popular late following what you 're saying I 'm not reading it but I know it has been but it might sound like a silly question but goodbye a guest over for the barbecue if they keep it combustibles away should it be surrounded by houses many live the easiest combustible materials are in the house I think I 'm cold that rock thought might move everything away from the h2o possibly house and when I was hiking possible material time to take that to the woodpile stack against the house be involved with whatever it happens to be all the keys consciousness officially I 'll just have the biggest platform assistant house cause when we sleep they get boring they follow the videos and the mixers they can catch you 's like the show Lexus repaid ranking conscious away from each other lap seven Suzuki buildings Thank You show about any combustibles whether to guests over to the punchline is really a white community ask is again another [Music] it 's ready go a lot of later time the vendor wife yes [Music] from police I 'd like to address this question to respect a restaurant inspector in the preparation for this unfortunate time of entry can you tell me whether any provisions have been made with the local medical centers from opening in the unfortunate circumstance that the road is closed in the Army healers parties that raided radar to get into an evacuation center to take new blood [Music] repent from this one just about a month ago the relation to what that can do therefore we need an evacuation center to a certain point [Music] further to that and it 's part of the bush boss of all the land we asked for people to they 're self-sufficient that they 've medications soon one of the big pushes we get awesome it 's a previous knocking would the section medication please economy broader preparation planning actually got enough of that medications are lodged probably awake hi Chloe several people come to me today saying that they don 't know people that can help them get out of town they 'd like to leave and head up to a little of them CB to try to find someone to stay are you aware of any think of the buses of trains that he 's functioning to get people who during debates Internet Explorer for instance I just spoke to one mom whose husband these duck down south down the highway and she can 't get so this very anything functioning and do you know if this will affect the train railway network with people are going to get the train from the dairy okay so in relation to public transport at this point in time the public transport system forward as mobile as long as the roadways are open the users of train facility obviously our line produces a commentary at this point in time moment there is one under impact if the fire does happen to move infrastructure necessitating explosion that gives us more effect that area but we will make other arrangements obviously as soon as possible to have buses the logically device certainly all of our bus companies that the tourism operators are certainly well clearly aware that the fires in and around the area and the doli doli to be used for everything from moving out firefighter severity between their accommodation and the various staging areas through diversity being on point by transport de subasta movement spirit medical centers [Music] he 's a sanctuary point practice just over two right over here I will be there and will be available to 2 basically the idea being that so very happy little if anyone likes [Music] so I 'll be there [Music] [Applause] [Music] that 's what Isis story obviously thank you very much that offer if I can get you to have the guys would write on at least we 'll get you they tell us a lot of advances thank you talk about every state consecutive quarter matrices brushed over there please to tell you the truth you might be point earlier about by song what that leaves for one of the plots of local residents it whispers in regards to give it the Parisian palace preparing looses the town and all that and then if we had taken the time to different wherever I we 'll be down tomorrow and if you do decide to plea roughly how long can we expect before when I could get back into this here is it okay so there 's that questions a couple of ways firstly if you don 't put their data mine you coming out at all as I said but the sophoclean always we won 't be able to stop and after you finish you just played the area as synthesized runways running through the distillation getting to that solution Oscar question actually do in relation to hang Committee to ask I think I 've already covered that tonight with the various main see to take yourself but in relation to how long it conveyed before you can return to you area that 's how long [Music] [Applause] estimate of the expected to rise of the warning systems that you can that question now you 're also hates me that 's a question if you are leave any doubt of your ability to distinct having to stay back and and debate your hymen the baby selfie young residents you 've already asked a question and bond parties get out but but I still get by the fire stopped on the basis of solid Pacific who we want to get help Polybius are okay so in relation to warnings we 've also those wanting to go after state the watch attacks to go up on the program we 've also heard the radio announcers to come out on the only thing the lux we will give you as much morning as we practically can with the Amana part that is of the lane scope do not rely on a warning your area it is specifically or practically impossible for us to keep you at a specific time frame before in fact it could be a spot by the names over the ad and closer to the community and we make up the other turn around and say you 've got time to the first message you get made or being shelter-in-place the first indication you get may not be is by coming towards you and you haven 't even received that morning we are using technology technology does have claws power systems go down although seems to can occur and do occur it 's a please don 't just rely on us to keep you that morning we serve it will do our very best we 've got a very good grip of the thing how to do that this year and we 're hopeful to continue that and it is not a guarantee you know just a quick question down here [Music] my counsel so this is what we didn 't Airy in the areas where our eyes are still open all day refuses obviously by Brittany 's area tip area gets infected by partha I have some impact block washed in water system sewer systems in the artifact they melt mate what we impact upon the polish of pumping stations all over that began affected or even the power guys the expertise areas we do have a very very humorous facilities should they get impacted but a game there is no definitive answer I can give you that particular thing the warning system as I said is this morning time everything from the uses the fires need where the watch attacked the effective would have ever seen worked out through the fire system through the mobile phone systems north of your landline system we can also break into if absolutely divergent and we get suspicious don 't negotiate to the seer system which will also come across TVs the monthly that they love a common technology like the fact that they would require all those telecommunication systems would be other honey so the other warning systems of the Keynesian we will use is the firefighters and emergency services on the ground and I also implore on anybody if you get instructed by police on the ground already on emergency service and he designed Erik Bosse they 've got the biltong information [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so that question on the legacies relations obviously here contain bibliography I get the broadcast is a warning straight and it 's a good point high school blankets and massage Albania stocks if you can creep full to allow that to occur but it 's a good point a little bit of an additional focus on that but it 's why we have a temperature of only two people so I 'll take one or two more but it gave them out for anybody who has a specification even kind of awkward right now so first attend any heat and I think happy to hang around and take the pushing okay so either legend suspected undocumented status by higher than the coming heat and that 's the evacuation step aside goodbye cookie be specific on bus and I will do the art of flowing leagues it up a barrier so uses my accent evacuation sicknesses as they open and actually come through drips the hex plates FK point is upon show that impacts would be on choice for what that best way to do that yes certainly all I could say is if you are cheesy to shoulder in place as I mentioned before you need to be mentally and physically able and willing to harrowing event it is quite horrific it means very very I 'm sure and touches on the conditions that we can expect and people need to be prepared for that but there 's a that leads not under having your company both sigh talked about tonight but also having yourself prepared such as the clothing you wear and having your systems available such as hoses and knowing what you 're going to do when you click on find to be house having windows shut door gaps locked our wet towels bottle of water all those sort of things and sheltering in place until the fog front moves through you will hear the forefront coming and you 'll hear at late the area people go a lot farther afterwards you through after weeks long if it 's safe to do so you can exit the building and maybe pull down small closes you 're ready to ask for the biggest recording device but again being mentally prepared is the utmost event and wallet the last thing we can afford to do that big on the road at the last minute we before were down at the deaf community in a century point there are a lot of these people in the community here and just like this natives not what happened we arrived here and then right we didn 't even have an interpreter that was bought and its place might roll and be aware that we need to have an interpreter and real-time during these babies misses people that we get the information [Music] [Applause] [Music] they might excited you 're like I like their time together the specific details are kind effectively answer that question in relation to a Huron I gave it to silk assistant questioning the site if you believe that you excite me Rob if that 's the concepts if that many excitement nor la concha will can closely mangle wish to get out of that area at all until sight oh my gosh [Music] [Applause] as I said before a couple of other ladies that this thing he could possibly do it 's given firefighter a pat on the back and he 's all that they made into his old things really like integration actor existence of it both with the state government federal funding and the lux we provide everything we possibly can to their bank made and he 's truly appreciative in the amount of generosity of the distinction that committee made it Laxmi Huntley crafted they their religious community and he 's absolutely at skating she 'll would be dedication and played into the community and disappear strong spirit we talked about this but again unfortunately a lot of time we can 't take food started with dining bro we need to know that that prepackaged ingredients in our sectors have very a lot of papers about services we may have dietary requirements so it 's nice as it is sometimes Oh at least I don 't waste your time even though he 's really will appreciate it things like bottled water will truly appreciate the firefighters are out on the ground but again we try and supply that wherever possible to everybody out there but again a simple thanks to everybody up there will certainly bring them back again any charges a big guy [Music] that helps with any potential at standard classical stuff we had the same different by counties these other engines are these like way like being at the front if you stack when you 're jogging but with that comes a little bit about safety because if you diversity missus Depot so we debit because they reached us neighbor have also heard about a local time a red ribbon around the letterbox they 've got a letterbox so the slightly different variables are honestly saying our firefighting crews with a rather than likely she 's going to help you defend or assist selection the first example those becoming on the door when you bring it with you anyway likewise that will be also walking around the premises to look with being such as vicious to the area register themselves which is yourself and also in the area okay in relation to communications with the fantasy services we don 't they usually use UHF CB channels some regards may use them independently between themselves on that particular truck but all just weekly communications between those individual firefighters our communications back to the control center on to the provisional those are encrypted radio for obvious reasons so we can ensure the so there isn 't one channel you can scan or is by all mates it 's the local community input strong string if you 've got a number of right heads decide amongst yourselves alright so thank you very very much [Applause] [Music] the entities credibly possible to take this as far as small as possible affected communities the place they paid and if you gotta back back down will be _"

    "text": "you you I think it was unexpected to a degree even the Bureau of Meteorology didn 't predict the amount of energy came into our area so it was a total surprise people people were caught unawares the creeks overflowed very very quickly the rivers actually some of them opened themselves look east coast lows typically associated with higher sea levels larger swells and significant rainfall so that 's what we expect when we are advised by the vom Bureau of Meteorology that that weather pattern is coming so in this instance we were also mindful that were likely to get significant rain and high seas the forecasted dignan train for was exceeded by that double so most of our areas receive 300 mils to 400 some over 400 48 hour period so about double what was predicted at the Tuesday the staff are getting increasingly concerned about the weather conditions and we held to incident team meetings really just to review what was happening including councils and council operations at that stage we had some road closures already happy we had quite a number of our sewage pumping stations number of staff from engineering from shoalhaven water from our flood engineers and media of course which was important to keep getting messages out to the media or what was happening so on the Tuesday quite errything it 's right through the area lettering the outside basically the EIC open late on Tuesday afternoon our director of assets and works and myself actually called the lia kahn late on the tuesday spoke to him what was happening and he advised us that he 'd been in touch with the SES most of the day and they just decided that things were deteriorating to such an extent that the USC had to open on the Tuesday evening we have adopted entrance management policies adopted by council and you need to appreciate that these policies are endorsed by the state government there they go through a process of consultation with community representatives they are based on flood studies and expert opinion from councils and flood engineers and they go on public exhibition in other words we have a plan we have a document which is endorsed through that process which includes triggers certain a certain course of action now with respect to late King Jolla on the Monday as indicated the rainfall forecast were the rainfall event was much heavier than forecast so on the we anticipated that on the Tuesday morning early on Tuesday morning around seven thirty the trigger level in the adopted policy which is for emergency openings in lacon jolla is 1.2 meters ahd at the entrance we anticipated that the the lake level would be reaching that at about seven thirty in the morning so we had staff on site prior to seven thirty we had machinery on standby and when we went there we observed that the the lake had actually naturally breached the Sandborn itself so we didn 't have to take mechanical intervention the process had work naturally as it approached that 1.2 meter trigger the lake opened and the water started to flow through a natural canal so when you look and think about the situation at lake in jolla you 've got a major catchment with a lot of water running into the lake you have a relatively small now that 's a counter force and essentially there 's more water coming in than going out and the flooding continues opening the entrance at lake and joel are indeed most waterways does not stop the flooding at best it reduces the impact in low level events but as the event creek increases i eat more rainfall more major flooding event it has minimal effect the dredging was never intended to have a significant impact on flood levels as I 've said it simply doesn 't eliminate the flooding that occurs the objectives of the dredging and local Jolla were primarily about creating a channel between Conger on point boat ramp in the lake for recreational navigational purposes as well as improving the efficiency and circulation of the entrance opening improving the title exchange enabling the entrance to stay open for a longer period that 's what it 's about as I said it was never intended to significantly impact on flooding it simply won 't do that well wednesday the flooding was really into the scale at that stage because the Shoalhaven river was rapidly rising it was impacting on a number and the staff were monitoring those road conditions three of the day making sure that the public were kept safe and out of levels the road closures are the really good prediction of motorists and we had a number of flood recipes there 's 46 in all across the shoalhaven in a number of tacos the emerge where we 're going out to grow and at the same time who would drive pastors so road closure signs for a big issue as I said those 45 post roads on Tuesday lunchtime by Wednesday we probably had got up to about 50 or 60 roads closed and we had at some certain locations in sussex inlet we have police men in these road closed areas though warning people they couldn 't drive around the signs and people intend to indeed drive into the water not only did they end up with their cars fly today all sanded up with a ticket on Tuesday we had no flood watch or flood warning from the bomb and in the afternoon we went we contacted them and we expressed our concern about the rising us updated author of the night and the next morning because we were concerned that the river would continue to rise at about eight-thirty at night they gave us the first flood warning for the shotover river but they did not indicate that the 2.5 meter ahd trigger and mara bridge would be exceeded it wasn 't until the early hours of Wednesday morning that we started to get that sort of information from them that in fact those trigger levels would be exceeded and we then would have to put in place the mechanical opening procedure but the morning of the Wednesday actually coincided with a high with the high tide and hi Suze at the same time and it was really doing this unsafe to put an operator in machine on the on the scenes we do an opening at that stage so during the morning as the tide was dropping the river level was still increasing on the shoalhaven here the side but mid-morning a decision was made that it was safe to get an operator in and that 's what happened a little after midday as when and how you do it if the sea level is too high if the swell is too great you can exacerbate the situation you can actually the counter force of the sea can actually push the river levels higher so you have to be very careful about the exact time that 's why it 's we have these predetermined level so we aware that we have sufficient volume of water in the river so that it 's likely to actually work when it 's breached but we do have to make this judgment of looking at the Seas about whether it 's a and whether it 's actually going to work at that particular time well the other main key consideration is that we have these adopted management plans entrance management plans and we have a set protocol that we need to follow the last thing we need is panicked decision-making in a time of crisis that can lead to devastating impacts so we have a process we have adopted plan and we need to follow that look I think council staff responded very professionally they 've done everything the gardens by the entrance management plan but councils previous experience we had people on call and actually monitoring the Bo inside through throughout the Tuesday night and they were really ready to do words on the Wednesday when required as with all of these events weather conditions really dictate when you can do an opening safely and the staff have to make those judgments and I back them and what they do yeah so throughout the Shoalhaven the damage build within three days was up over 700 s dollars so if you think around playgrounds or the softball and the playgrounds in wash their the amenities as a dozen amenities of the water was well over their roof so we had to go in and clean those out no silk from number area very much like the households that have been happening to go through a lot of cleanup so is canceled particular parks roads and drainage structures we 're working through those issues but will be 18 months from now still rebuilding roads and I have to compliment again cancer staff for getting out and about I know almost been fixed with all the pothole so congratulations they 're doing a great job as far as I 'm freeway steeping there was really a lot of feedback from the community and the mayor and council has really got on board so where can we help and we initially opened up all of our defense for an extended period of time and I 'll have free tipping we 're also supported by the state government to waive the waist level for any flood related waste and we 've had thousands of transactions and waste materials we always goodbye the flag damaged goods we were very smelly some of the people had a sewage in their backyards that had to be cleaned up as you can as you appreciate my stuff I got to a certain point surah chapter go somewhere so that was some of the cases and there 's still some water floating around but I think our staff did an extraordinary job the positives are that you always learn we are now going back to our natural resource and resource and floodplain committee we will be reviewing additional blood study on the lower Shoalhaven we will be collecting the data that we gained through the event we will be talking to the community we will be reviewing what we 've got in the plan and say can we do it better so you always learn something every flood is different and if we can improve the situation we will _"

    "text": "art and nature have always melded together in my work I don 't think there 's much separation I think I 've always had a passion for art there is old eight mill footage of me and I think I 'm about four years old of me painting and really enjoying painting my pathway to becoming a professional artist was I was a teacher for I think it was three or four years in Victoria secondary high school teaching art which I was okay but I really it wasn 't something that I wanted to do that was me trying to fulfill what my parents wanted me to do you know the security of a job but the day that I quit and I walked for the last time out of that school yard was like you know if I could have floated up into the clouds I think it was almost like a celestial moment because it was just the possibilities and since then I pretty much been a full-time artist for more than 30 years yeah I moved to the Shoalhaven in the mid-80s because it 's just here it 's trees forest escarpment Creek Wallabies wombats at night traveling across the lawn we 've built a house that 's very comfortable with a studio that I can easily work in and just look out and see what 's going on in the landscape and how the birds and animals are behaving that day it 's very distracting sometimes because it 's so amazing that I 'm always running out with my you know my camera and videoing things or running around with my sound recorder I work with whatever I need to convey the story that I 'm trying to tell the artwork in some ways creates itself so I get to stand back and and see how the materials have come together of their own volition in some ways I 'm kind of like a shepherd that pushes all that flock because I 've got some idea of what I 'd like but then you know the Sheep might run willy-nilly and then when I can see where everything 's ended up then I pull it all together into one cohesive yeah I like a challenge working that is very instinctive something jumps out that I 'm really interested in and like a detective I just follow that the idea for this exhibition happened a couple of years ago the initial inspiration was the tradition of copying so when the first European artists came to Australia they would create drawings and paintings which would then be shipped back to London and other places which would then be copied so I was interested in the idea of the artworks that I was looking at in these early European images of Australia being copies of copies and I thought it would be really nice to join that tradition and to copy some of the copies of the copies the working title at the beginning was provenance because I 'm interested in that history of work and where it 's come from and then also provenance also goes through the history of where it 's who 's owned it I started doing research reading lots of Diaries from colonial times and I found a lovely quote from John Hunter when he was on board the serious and this helped appear from the great similarity in some part or other of the different quadrupeds which we find here that there is a promiscuous intercourse between the different sexes of all those different animals I love the idea that in his thinking it was just sort of all these creatures kind of getting together and then you end up with you know the beak of a dark on a mammal and the it 's just you know because you 've come to a new world where anything is possible and could have happened yeah I just love it everyone should this promiscuous so it 's not in a sort of a kind of a sexual term in the title of the work it 's just promiscuous that it 's coming from anywhere and that gave me permission to then really go a little bit crazy and and play with the images and hybridize creatures promiscuous provenance division is very much about getting audiences to think about why these colonial works were so so strange in their capturing of Australian flora and fauna and landscapes and then taking a step to thinking arts landscape of Australia and how it is a European white-faced visual landscape for for so many years and what does that do to our understanding of our land and how does that influence how we connect to our landscape to our environment as Australians and that 's what we 're wanting people to start thinking about when they view this exhibition I suppose in this series that I 've created there that I feel that the lack or the omission of the reference to the indigenous people is a question in itself okay this is what the birds and this is what the animals and the landscape was like what else was happening at the time so I think that that 's a question that I am starting to get answered through my reading and through talks with with Aboriginal people and that it 's a question that maybe we all need to ask yourself yeah the elements that I 'm including I suppose directly reference colonial items so the floor cloth is direct reference to the way or the items that were created at the time the old then that would be painted and use floor cloths so I 'm actually doing it with a contemporary vinyl flooring this is old tradition of burning designs into timber but I 'm going to burn designed into the vinyl the design is to do with the extinct and threatened species and as the exhibition travels I 'm kind of hoping that that floor cloth will wear down because we 're walking over over those species and kind of obliterating them I suppose the dresses almost a copy of one of the dresses in the Powerhouse Museum that still exists from colonial times so the dresses are a reflection of the inappropriate wear for Australia they are made of silk on the three G 's sculptural kangaroo heads based on an image Lewin did so I 've been collecting sounds many bird sounds I 'm also doing a big photo montage there will be reference to the British landscape at the time they always talk about Australia as the land down under well no it depends where you 're viewing the planet from so I think I 'm going to turn bit that time that was done and the drawings and paintings using that technique of copying just follow in a long tradition there 's a technique of using watercolor where you 're meant to stretch the paper and keep everything smooth and perfect but I actually really like the physical reaction of the water and the ink with the paper so it kind of does buckle slightly and to me that sort of undulation is almost like a reflection of the landscape I like the fact that the paper has a mind of its own and I 'm not going to restrain it by taping it down I 'm going to let it let it be free I 've been collaborating with my husband Peter del Matt so because he 's a scientist and biologist and he 's great knowledge so when I 'm referencing these historical images and the birds and the plants and things Peter knows what they are which is really amazing there 's lots of people that have really helped out with this I 've always wanted my art to be accessible and have created different respond to it so that the audience is seduced into a new way of thinking or a new appreciation of something whether it be the art or the idea behind the art I 'd sort of like the exhibition to help the viewer see how amazing this country is what I was interested in was that first European vision seeing things startling surprising new things that hadn 't been seen before you know the animals and the plants and it 's just it 's kind of very unique and peculiar so I think in the long term I would like people to recognize that and just maybe by shining a light on some of these early images people might follow the trail that that I 've I 've led them to the the trail of appreciating what we have mmm the exhibition is visually sumptuous and intellectually engaging Anna 's works are just exquisite it 's a huge celebration of an artist of the Shoalhaven whose artwork is very much informed by the Shoalhaven landscape and whose cubes generously to the show Haven community in a range of ways as art she 's not just a water colorist she 's not just a digital artist she 's not just a painter she 's all of these things and she 's an artist who is constantly engaging with her landscape with her surroundings with the world and using that to inform the growth of her art practice so art is my life there isn 't much beyond it and I 'm not saying that I 'm rejecting other aspects of life but I 've managed to create a life where it 's pretty much revolves around making art and being inspired by just about everything I see around me _"

    "text": "the new south wales SES and the state government and all emergency services are currently running a campaign called get ready what that means is we 're asking risen to get ready for the storm the flood the fire pretty much any type of emergency it 's about understanding there is an actually taking ownership for the risks or wherever you are we might only be able to get to certain community basically it 's about knowing your risk identifying that early having a plan in place and if you need to implement that plan to get to safety before it occurs local communities knows their local geography and suppose be the best and generally they can identify when it 's going to flood and even if it 's going to flood a lot before you know emergency services can because still that local community effect has the best way of keeping community safe during appropriately gets in undated then generally you 'll be under what we call an evacuation warning or an evacuation order you 're going to lose power you lose your phone lines mobile phone networks are any water is going to be contaminated not running by sewage but you know the chemicals in keeping your shed so we don 't like to see people in their properties if it becomes inundated if you 're just going to be isolated for example the road into town gets cut and you 're high and dry well above the pms flood level and we encourage you you know well before an event occurs stock up on supplies so your self sufficient for how as many days event in a last four [Music] [Music] so we 've had a slogan recently called if it 's flooded forget it and the basic pretenses if you see floodwaters across the road forget driving to us because it is dangerous a lot of people don 't know that just as 30 centimeters of flowing water is enough to wash a vehicle off a road they can 't see what 's under the flood waters they don 't even notice the road under the flood waters and a lot of the recipes that we did conduct in the recent events were for people who been washed off and downstream most cars are designed and built to drive through flood waters and a lot of people do get stuck and it kept the organization very busy when we issue an evacuation order a lot of people think oh it 's not going to be that bad you know the SPSS overdoing it and overreacting and they tend to stay behind and what we find is they stay behind and you know for the first few hours I think this is not going to last that long but then it goes for 12 hours 24 hours in a couple of days and they 're stuck in their house everything so there 's a lead or two medals of water through their property they 've got no foods if the fridge doesn 't work in fact if we just probably flooded all the foods being contaminated you know the garden keep it lawn mower fuel is all through their property the sewage is backed up so the water is disgusting at dirty there 's debris a lot of the times when our own rescuers go into flood who knows what they 're covered in and a lot of people a lot of emergency responders get sick after being in floodwaters because of the contaminants that you know slow into their body so it 's not a nice place to be and you know it would be nice not only for their safety is it for our own safety it 's more of the community listened to particularly the evacuation orders and actually got out of the area before they needed rescuing because the Shoalhaven is such a large area and so separated from itself we essentially have to learn how to look after ourselves because the SES won 't be able to get to everybody so we can tell community is that your house is impacted and therefore that person that individual can plan themselves what they 're going to do in the time of thought they can have their flood plan ready even if your house isn 't inundated so are you prepared do you have your flood emergency kit available that has those supplies that has your torches the batteries medication food for your family individuals can do prior to a flood and be prepared so that if they do get isolated they don 't need to depend on anybody else they 'll be okay because it looked after themselves the early floods we have records of in the shoalhaven is in 1857 and it 's called stopped losses and crop losses and people had to evacuate that natsu catastrophic then in 1860s there were four floods in one year the first of those floods caused huge damage that number enter era the contemporary reports from the newspapers say that number was basically washed away in the whole town large parts of torero were washed away many people evacuated to an hour and then moved back after that event flooding is also often quite clustered we have wet periods we have drought periods during drought periods slug memory disappears people forget two places flood they lose back to focus leichter error because it 's a really nice of you living with flood is a reality we choose to occupy flood plains for good reasons the community can safely occupied many parts of most floodplains and allows people to identify and occupy safe areas of floodplain and release with flood the other thing we do in the floodplain risk management studies and documenting the plan we look at what options they 've got where they can evacuate to when they can evacuate and having a flood plan but they implements themselves this is an excellent opportunity to actually engage with people and build their flood resilient get them engaged in planning what they will do to respond so they don 't just rely on council will the state emergency service coming in rescuing [Music] [Music] _"

    "text": "so I 'm Ashley Sullivan I work at the Illawarra south coast region and initialized state emergency service I look after about seven hundred volunteers in 14 years and my primary role is operations planning for operations and also capably development within those units if we look back in the recent August 2015 floods we saw the rain develop within four hours till us that 's technically a flash flood the Shoalhaven is particularly at risk from floods because the nature of the geography what that creates is technically a very fast-moving flood that can catch up on communities as we saw recently because it 's so quick it 's hard for us to get accurate information out because it 's happening at the same time as the rainfall and the consequent and you know a lot of flash flooding can occur and does occur usually before the riverine flooding so a lot of roads a lot of houses are actually on very low lying areas that can be subject to overland flow along which then riverine flooding at a later time we can risk mitigate in terms of our and what those structures look like you can never eliminate the risk of flooding all together on a daily basis are typically be dealing with a lot of community members who might be putting in development applications and so I 'd be assessing those development to see whether their flood affected and if they are to make sure that they 're building it in an appropriate manner I also work with the office of environment and heritage which of the state government department preparing flood studies and floodplain management studies and plans and they 're the documents that identify areas in the shoalhaven that are flood affected or aren 't quite effective and the risks associated with that flooding so whether it 's a house being flooded and inundated or whether it 's the roads around that house being cut off and then we use that information to try and plan for a flood see what we need to do what the SES needs to do from that we now have in the shoalhaven 3 FES units one in Nara one another dollar and a very new ones in the volunteers that are here to help evacuate people in the event of a flood they also manage the evacuation centers distributing supplies livestock if people need help managing those but the SS are the people that are on-call helping us and they 're all local members of our communities are volunteering their time to help us in a time of emergency something that we have over a bushfire is that we can model where the flood goes and we can see what road is going to get cut week and see what houses are going to be inundated and because of that we can plan appropriately so we can tell communities that your house is impacted one of the things that I do on on a daily basis is help project manage the flood studies and risk management studies and plans so very briefly a flood study simply looks at if it rains where does that water go what is the flood extent what properties are flooded the risk study then looks at the risks associated with that so if roads are cut how many properties are being cut off are there any critical services that are being inundated say a hospital or vulnerable areas such as a child care center and then the risk plan looks at well what are we going to do about that so it 's the planning phase that is going to make the issue better in the future so things like looking at building levy banks perhaps to stop the water coming in over that river bank or the lake bank having different development control so we assess development applications and we require habitable rooms which is your bedrooms your kitchen your living areas all to be above the flood planning level through the hundred year flood posture half a meter so all of these things are done to try and make the community safer so to either stop the flood from getting to the flood affected area or certain make it have less of an impact or to allow the development to occur but in a safer way so building it from different materials building it high up the shoalhaven River floodplain is one of the oldest which is why the floodplain is in a long history of water flowing through it even we 've got open entrance it 's still flooded and that 's still something that we we deal with today that with a heavily sholde entrance or a closed entrance that that it is still going to sludge so even with it open and flowing out it 's not having that that reducing impact that 's not stopping that flood there are large areas of the state that we 're quite happy to let flood that their function their flood plains what we 're trying to do is manage the impacts of flooding on people flooding a verra cultural land isn 't too much of a problem provided the farmers can get their stock out of the way I occasionally lose crops but they 'll grow new crops towns placed in floodplains on the other hand can be a significant problem most towns in Australia have been built near rivers they were built near rivers because in the early days of the colony the primary transport mechanism was by ship what on assisting councils to do is to understand what done to manage that and what plan they should implement to manage the risks to people and their property incumbent on occupying floodplain people learned from these events in the past and so that 's why the majority of the development in the Shoalhaven is at an error and vomit area because they 're sitting up on hills as soon as you get downstream of the bridge error is a big wide open flat floodplain that the water can spread out across so then in the lower Shoalhaven area there are three floodplain risk management plans have been developed by council there 's one for the floodplain in general there 's one specifically for the riverview road area and there 's one specifically such terror and so development within the flood planning area is subject to flood development controls in council 's development control plan and local environment plan _"

    "text": "boys 70-odd years plus I 've seen a few funds we were taught the dangers of a flood not to go down to the river will flood season result in this peak period we always stayed away from there we didn 't even bother to set the Nets with me grandfather a big factor with the floods in this river in the Shoalhaven river is if char Levin edges are closed and title intense you get a lot of water back up the creeks in that there and yes the albatros load all those places are closed Queensland because of the pride factor once that tides on the run out that title flood plan will just released its often and the only only outlet for that was down to the crew game and heads once i see they water backin up on the Albatross road and up around bends walk that 'll give you a good indication of the flood that could be expected you 've got to be really on your on your guard up and when you 're in the river especially in flood time we sense danger to your people away and with such that the flood of bait it was flood also with us going back to the 50 60 s and the only source of influence Aboriginal people with seasonal work picking peas and beans and corn if we got a flood then that more or less decimated the Aboriginal people earning any money and that purposely we will not take it out and one one big thing too is floods it washes out the snake makes her in abundance when this floods about and you have to watch if he picked up anything there were sneaking calling so that 'd be very very careful especially with drums and that makes me begin today but now with the damming of the two rivers it 's not an army our sights along the river but I always respect the river in there because of sustenance it 's got food for you so the older people knew what was coming some of them add another sense where they can pick all that and my mum you saw showed up that 's the old clever black fella coming every plug came and you 'd see the cattle dead cattle going down and logs and if you lived here all your life I think he sort of knew when this was getting under water and that was underwater like the recent ones they had the really riverview road is quite prone well we knew the night it had we had 10 inches in the one night that that was going to have repercussion yeah because they 'd have had that up at ner eager as well it 's not as bad as it was in the eighteen hundreds i would think we had a paddock of pumpkins at one stage I remember flood came up from the pumpkins close it up the group good when we first picked up quick obviously if it goes through your house that is very traumatic and worse if you can 't get out of danger which would be terribly frightening you live didn 't our of a long while you had a pretty fair idea of where it was going to slide it 's like the farmers they know when they have to people don 't really think it 's ever going to happen so I would say the recent floods took a lot of people by surprise because we 've had a pretty good time and there 's been held in the last leave in 10 20 years people have just built where supposedly they were safe but you can never be real sure can you oh I think it can be enormously disruptive for particularly in the back in history as I 've studied because the people weren 't able to cope with it I 've looked extensively at the error which was the major town around here in the 1860s and up until eighteen seventy and they got regular floods and it it was just just changed their had their whole lifestyle so that the school was was cancelled and the shops got inundated and all the public buildings they were mostly underwater and but when they got the big floods lot like in 1860 and eighteen seventy lot of buildings washed into the river and and carried away and there was loss of life and it was a traumatic 's in the upper reaches of the Shoalhaven river and if if there 's a lot of rain up there will it 's going to cause lots of water to be coming downstream and naturally if there 's a couple of days of continuous rain well it 's going to build up everywhere a lot long the way and and later in the 70s whether they came to the conclusion that the levee Bank needed to be built near riverview road and council went ahead and did that and so there hasn 't been the same drama since the community impact to suck some people it was it was just the last straw and quite a lot of people left to rarer quite a few came to narrow and set up again here whereas others moved up to the north coast and far away it was just it was just being end of it all for them so they 're there were list of families who who left to rarer and never to return that looks Deborah quite called the flood that changed narrow which because of the impact it devastating it it 's always a lot of trauma and you know you 've really know that once you get through the flood there 's always a major consequences because a lot of the time of our farms covered in mud and you 've got to really replant everything canned you know your month hand feeding then there 's a major major dramas when the river starts to run it 's absolutely raging and they 've got to be very careful I 'm very aware of the param of the volume of water that 's going past as some quite horrific the recent flood I had to actually checked the weather site and elders weather site and looked at it and realized to tell or DMSO a hundred percent full and I knew straight away that we were going back to the old style flood where it could come up very quickly and that 's exactly what happened to caught a lot of people by surprise the the force of water is absolutely phenomenal like you know I 've had huge big corner posts washed clean out of the ground such a huge process just to clean up afterwards and even houses you know with mud all through them and one farmer particular he 'd been all day working with his cattle getting him to high ground and when he went home the water was all right through his house as well I don 't think there 's any real connection with climate change and because going right back to the 50s and 60s there 's always continual flooding and it 's just been a constant thing looking back with records you know every 10 years we 've had a fairly major flood and it just seems to be part of nature River which is concerned with the improving the health of the Shoalhaven river by working with landowners and farmers in various activities including back restoration work planting vegetation and also monitoring the health of the river with the oyster farmers as well the 1988 flood where I was living at long reach came up about probably about one to two meters higher than this flood this flood seemed of core is a lot more damage than with extreme 1988 was our first experience of slugs so we didn 't get any warning that Assad is going to happen and we 've got a little bit surprised at how quickly the water will come up there are telltale signs which would learn now or when you 're going to get a flood and that part of the river but we found that budget is quite horrific a lot of debris was dropped on the side of the river there was a lot of silt that was also deposited on the banks of the last flood had it impacts on parts of the banks that we didn 't have in the 1988 slide and they think that came as quite a surprise I think the biggest shock was the amount of debris coming down the river including dead cows on the other thing decals floating down a river before I believe the council 's role in hopes in the shell Haven head is pretty well-managed but I am currently that is being weird rest and have looked at six areas of better way is opening up that channel either earlier going on with with the Shoalhaven task force down there I think what we 've got available today is the real time monitoring of the river levels in the shoalhaven we never had that before it 's available now online so I think if you 've got access to a computer and get that data I think that would be very very helpful _"

    "text": "so he was senior floodplain engineer Elsa Schofield allesseh thanks for joining us I 'll see how long you been counseled for about eight years not a problem and what did you start when you first came to the organization 's so I 've been a natural resources team doing plans and management for natural areas ok and now what are you dated a sort of position involved now so now I 've moved more into the flooding side of things and the Natural Resources team so typically on a day-to-day basis I 'd be assessing development applications that are in flood-affected areas working with one of our many consultants we 're preparing flood studies and risk management studies and plans the Shoalhaven saw at the moment we 've got one going on for to bowery kangaroo valley narrow Browns Creek and all of that sort of feeds into our Emergency Management and land use planning really so you certainly have a very diverse role within the organization yeah definitely and what do you enjoy about your position I think I enjoy the diversity I I like having different things go very quickly your position would have been under fire last week with a bit of water in the area so what sort of I guess were your day-to-day position hold during a serious flood issue like that okay so typically every day I 'll come in and I 'll check the weather forecast so I did that did that last week and could see that rather than our normal small amounts of rain we have some painful coming and so that then pumps me to check all of our entrance areas that we do entrance management so that 's to bowery for real controller and the shoalhaven heads area for the shop aven river to see if they 're open and if they 're not we then watch those water levels in case we have to do an entrance opening which we did do an entrance opening at the Shoalhaven heads area last week so that was that was very busy very wet so these case low certainly brings a bit of added pressure for your role absolutely absolutely it certainly ramps things up thanks for everything no I area or outdoors and working with some fantastic waterways absolutely I think one of the things with the shoalhaven is that it 's such a large area and we have different river systems and lake systems so they 're all they 're all different and require different management and it keeps the drum exciting now where is also thanks for time _"

    "text": "Thank You Isabelle well the name of the presentation is is is up there it 's some the investigations that I 'll be talking about are principally what we call n state investigations of how can we help solve the problem not just that Collingwood but at all beaches over a planning time frame and also perhaps if we don 't go that far out how might we develop adaptive solutions that that reduce the risk but but perhaps are more achievable visible to advances lines okay I work for a company called royal has scanning we recently merged with another crowd called dhv that 's what we 're HD hv is scanning australia is is quite new in here we only been going for two and a half years our we based in the netherlands and the UK in sydney we 're a group of about 30 coastal and maritime engineers and we 've recently opened offices in newcastle and on the gold coast there is a experienced client group mainly ex Patterson Britain and partners X worleyparsons and sneak and I 'm sure you would have heard of engineer I have postgraduate qualifications in coastal and maritime and I 've been working in this area for about 30 years in a formal offer did some work for Bob and have been around Collingwood beach a little bit as well as other beaches in the shoalhaven just in terms of the chalk outline today i propose to run through those matters we 'll talk a little bit about history of coastal development a bit of a storm history I 'll touch on the coastal zone management plan investigations I don 't propose to to go into any detail there just recap on councils coastal development controls as they apply today then talk a little bit about more recent citywide investigations that council has been busy with and then i 'll be talking about what council does in storm situations and emergency situations what it might be able to do over the longer term to try and solve the problem once and for all you 'll see the fees are prohibitively expensive options and then is anything we might be able to do in the middle of those two that schemes really are quite broad concepts of this day to me it 's about just flagging those in the same wall is it worth actually exploring some of those a little bit further and that sort of covered often that lost in that last point and the those ferris bullet points will cover will have will have us at the top of the screen so I 'm Collingwood beach old photo 944 19 2001 you know have a broad look of that lightning it 's a not much has happened at Collingwood on the certainly on the coastline over the last 70 years but certainly a lot of development has happened some of the early shots from the community that have been passed on to ray I view looking north along Collingwood beach and just view of the leveling of the jinns and that was a subdivision sort of going in about 50 years ago the leveling of the Joneses I guess is of particular interest because the dunes really are part of the beach system as we all know and leveling June 's building on June 's if little to get back into those tombs dunes and it 's a storm activity some of the strong history a photograph that 's been reflected in a few I think of councils documents 1974 storms the insect photo was taken in 75 so that 's a 74 shot of the beach and 75 of the erosion probably in the central and southern areas of the beach and that was in an early smack draft another early shot Davies 1982 storm damage southern end of Collinwood Beach 1977 there were I guess decent storms and 74 and then 77 78 it 's fair to say since you know the mid-80s or so storms have been quite muted nonetheless in July 2013 there 's another shot of erosion on the beach a little bit about because as I mentioned plan investigations the main ones i 'll just refer to other smack the smack work done in the mid 2000s and then late in 2009 10 after the sea level rise benchmarks were brought in and then also withdrawn and then talk a little bit about unwell Coastal Zone Management Plan drive what 's the beach and I 'll just recap one the work that they did in quite simple terms so that we can try and just explain what was done and I 'll talk to these these sort of key points what a storm cut is and how that differs from long-term changes talk a little bit about inundation what that is and then the mapping of the hazard lines which is of interest so firstly storm code I really won 't be putting up a whole lot of science kind of type slides that a quick slide it 's of interest to see that there is information on a relationship between return interval or or frequency of occurrence if you like and wave height and this is data which is measured at the Waverider boy of Port Kembla and for example what it might say is 17 10 years we might have a storm which lasts an hour reducing sniffling wave heights of 7 meters okay once every 10 years we might have a wave heart that lasts for 24 hours of about 5.2 meters so if we 're looking at can actually get larger wave heights in that storm for given the parenthetical and it 's normally in the fifty to a hundred year recurring samples there are reaches to us in terms of defining hazard at a beach and also has a management options so we 're looking at offshore wave heights in the sort of seven to eight and a half meter range what thumb was done previously with some modeling myself looking at how waves some offshore penetrate into climbing with each and what we 've got written on the Arab see the wave transformation coefficients which is really just the ratio of the wave ensure versus the wave of sure so that area there the way parts would have been about seven percent of the wave heights that they 're all short one wherever there was evidence group so and that just shows down arrow Direction show direction of the wave the wave with orbital which is also of interest if we just have a look at say storm cut and what what happens in a song is the beach gets eroded if we take a one meter y 1 we were traveling along the length of the shoreline in that slice in a designer storm it 's predicted that a hundred and ten cubic meters of material would be in that slice now that that is developed from aerial photograph three and it 's also developed from a survey and and what it 's it 's it 's calibrated against photographs and also calibrated against some numerical modeling so the best information we have at this point is that a design storm 100-year storm could potentially Rover hanuman 10 cubic meters per meter from the beach what 's also of interest is the slope at the back of that cut because that effects and the stability of the ground immediately behind that and also that translates to the stability of the foundations further landed I 'll just run through a small animation here just to help us understand that this is a situation fetch before a storm happens we might then have a storm where the water level gets up high tide there 's wave penetration to the Cyprus that earlier slide that I showed we might gets on the rover at the beach when that are open that means actually a very sweet face at the back of the beach 30 cool or was sub very cold and it 's this area here that might be around about in between is per meter that had everything is actually measured above mean sea levels or wherever mean sea level is that 's a measure of that cut then the storm withdraws and the back Scott dries out and when the back Scott dries out flattens it 's not saving there if you go to the beach and you know the type washes up to dig a hole when the sands web and get a nice steep side to that hole soon as it dries out what it wants to flatten out and that 's that 's what that is referring to now you guys would have seen this weight fat failure plane model was developed by a colleague of mine legs Nielsen has found its way into some of the coastal has a definition work that 's been done for Council and it 's also of environment heritage and what it does is it just simply relates some of those things I was just explaining to you two areas for hire here they had different factors of safety and I 'll explain that in a minute firstly this sign up here which is designed which is slumped is called design of slope adjustment so that stone simply just falls into that wage down at the bottom this area over here is full design of reduced foundation capacity and I 'll explain that further in a minute nap there is called the stable foundation zone I mean ideally this is where we would like property to be very stable if we get into some of those other areas we 've got other issues that we need to concern ourselves with just having a look at some of these descriptors and what it might mean in terms of factors of safety more effective so four years is a ratio of the stabilizing force to the activating force so here clearly the stabilizing force is less than the activation activated force as this in one here it 's one and a half are stabilizing forces are more than fifty percent of a activating forces we 're in an area which is for engineers considered acceptable east able and that 's in this green zone so houses there we 'd prefer them to be houses over there we would prefer them not to be in the middle also not to be unless one can provides ether foundations into the sailor foundation zone then that is generally considered to be acceptable the lines have cancelled his map of our zone introduced foundation capacity lines you would have seen that on some of the mapping that simply is that point there on the model that 's called designer produced a version of SC it 's been defined as designer Federation festivai on the language of that zone now after the storm what happens is we get swell waves back to fair weather petition and some sand is brought back onto the beach and the beach builds up now the beach ball typically in a Collingwood to some extent doesn 't quite build up to where it was before there 's a 's called budget procession now in in a plain sense what budget possession actually means is that sand which was a road from the beach things to get lost from the component some of that sand might move into deeper water might be sucked out in a river and so lost effectively from the system some of the same might move around the head Lance its understand that might be blown on shore and some of the same might go into so minamino creek now straight to say that these losses are quite small at the bit Collingwood but just to give you a sense as to what that might mean and over time as these losses do occur the profile essentially moves landed to the point where the butler is reduced now under sea level rise in simplistic terms the buffer is reduced even further so that that there is the concept description of long-term recession due to budget losses and sea level rise if we talk a little bit about inundation in simple terms Christmas tides we all know they get up pretty high sea level rise and might lead to when we left storms possibly waves overtopping those storms and the water in and a inundated onto coastal property that is the the most current map of coastal hazard lines developed in about 2010 based on the 2006 work but incorporating the most up-to-date sea level rise information and what we have map here is we have 21 hundreds on a reduced our nation capacity that as per that definition saw a minute ago 2015 20 25 and also immediate and immediate I guess is of particular interest because all that means is that we are simply taken from that beach 110 cubic metres per meter slumping it at the back and and establishing where that zone of reduced foundation capacity is and that line is everyone that there is a 50-year example we might have 50 years of recession compartment us and sea level rise affect erosion from a design storm now the design storm is taken to be a Henry gear storm and Hannity rhetoric typical storm for all of those particular events so we take that down we 've got our map drawn and development controls vcp interim policy areas of coastal management currently applies and will do so until dr tcp 118 is reviewed and adopted by council in a nutshell what areas of coastal management tells us is that we have different risk zones which are defined between these zone of reduced foundation capacity lines the high-risk zone is a zone where ninety development of the minute that we have minor alterations and fit-outs can occur the moderate risk zone in that zone proposals to address standard criteria for coastal instability or are required so any proposal that submitted to council needs to consider those if if that particular proposal is landed at the 2050 line generally council doesn 't require any additional coastal engineering investigation nonetheless any buildings in that zone do need to have foundations that foundations that penetrate the 2100 zone of reduced foundation capacity line and and by that all I mean is that your foundations need to get into that green zone so just recent citywide investigations and work strategies that councils been busy with council has 10 exposed beaches where property is particular threat and they south Collingwood beach is but one of the ten it 's fair to say it 's it 's one of them all exposed and but it is but one of ten beaches that council is concerned with the the more recent investigations of council has been busy with on a citywide basis of those asset risk management work done by bmt wbm in 2012 some Sydney Uni work on beach vulnerability beat scraping advice and application dredging feasibility work sperwan associates recently produced the final document for counsel and counsel is busy at the moment with some sea level rise work on the south coast trying to understand any regional influences and that 's a joint project with yerba donor Shire Council I 'll talk each of about it to those in turn just that just number one this was a risk review iterated low medium and high level and extreme risks six extreme and high-level risk assets were identified at for Collingwood beach pump station Sir Isaac main soccerway Ilfracombe Avenue water supply those were assets i think which were in that high risk and extreme risk category about category the Sydney University work and this is a little bit more I guess difficult to to I guess to follow and understand it 's quite a satiric work it examined the relative vulnerability to sea level rise of of i think it was aight exposed beaches in the Shoalhaven previously we saw ten i think narrow alley and kilala bay were removed from that investigation by Sydney Uni and what vulnerability is a measure of how changes can harm a system so that 's what they were looking at what they found was that mollymook and Collingwood were the most vulnerable beaches of all of the beaches in the shoalhaven the just having a look at some of my notes here on this slide then we had second the what Colleen Collinwood actually was found to have a relatively high adaptive capacity and by that I think the the researchers were saying the the age demographic and the income a profile of that beach actually meant that residents at that beach were more adaptive and could adapt into a higher extent than perhaps residents at other beaches so yeah if you wanted to know more about that nonetheless Collingwood was one of the most vulnerable in inertial baby beat scraping advise that this what 's what beat scraping is a technique for accelerating beach recovery following erosion it 's basically doing what nature would do anyways taking sand which has been washed away from the back of the beach into the swash zone and pushing that sand back to the back of the beach what it does is it allows the energy of the sea to bring additional sand on shore quicker which sort of it just speeds up the rebuilding process nonetheless it 's a very short term benefit we see it as mainly an amenity benefit rather than a protective benefit the city this is an example of a breaking exercise at kilala Bay in 2003 here 's the work done in 2003 implemented there across around and fifty dollars a meter two years later words or washing away so you would say was that worth it and I 'll leave it up to you to decide I mean there was clearly an amenity benefit it was so it 's certainly not a panacea it 's not going to help protect your property even in a moderate storm but if you have a if you have a higher hiatus of storms and you don 't have any then clearly you 've got a you know you 've got a better amenity dredging feasibility study by spillway an associate 's what it did it looked at strategies to deal with demands for improved navigation that was the basis of that work and a target of clean deposits at s trees ste entrances and also at boat ramps what it found was that at boat ramps potentially there could be about five to ten thousand cubic meters of of sand which could be cleared from those boat ramps and that sound might be available to perhaps do something on beaches to protect beaches in a larger sense say such as for example of like the Jolly very large it shall eventually so 50 to 70,000 cubic meters of San might be available there at currently in creeks we might be looking at something in between those numbers but I website if you wanted more info the fifth and last study that cancer still busy with is a south coast regional sea level rise planning and policy response framework that 's what it 's called the jargon it 's a joint shoalhaven eurobodalla project and it 's to inform coastal planning within these two lgas all i 've done here is taken a one of the figures from the draft report which shows the measured water level at Fort Denison from 1892 20 2015 do kind of thing and what we can see here as you can see it 's been a little bit all over the place if we see a general trend of increasing water level and I think what 's I guess particularly concerning to scientists is the increasing rate of it the rate of increase in recent times the what I should also add is that in about nineteen things about 1930 or thereabout there was a datum shift at UM at Fort Denison and there 's a little bit of uncertainty as to how you compare numbers on this side of marking the but nonetheless otherwise 24 13 years so 20 years without 1990 at Fort Denison water levels have been rising at about four millimeters a year and when we do our coastal hazard assessments now have to take that four millimeters per year into account and when we interpret long-term recession so that 's just data that 's hard facts what 's being measured the predictions are interest at this point we 're back there those there are the benchmarks which were issued in 2009 i think it was by the state government they were then withdrawn on the basis of advice from the the chief scientist council 's unfortunately yet we 're left with you know with with the baby and they had to make their own decisions and all the advice of counsel has been getting to this point is you really can 't_''_1547.289 be moving away so that 's kind of councils bond at the moment nothing this particular investigation is going through that very thing trying to understand for count council wants to understand what is actually happening in a regional sense on the coast kid so some of what council does after a small storm right we 're talking about here about storms that might be up to two or three-year average recurrence interval storms council hasn 't placed some emergency provisions and plans it 's got a coastal emergency sub plan for all of its key features including Collingwood and they also have an asset management plan for coastal and ste assets which is a separate internal document that council has and these plans allow counsel to implement these sorts of provisions to complete closed damaged access ways to reshape the beach and essential access ways and what council i think is wanting to do at a number of its features and wants to rationalize the number of access ways that exist particularly private access was you 've got private access web gets damaged in a storm okay it 's not a heart priority access local council to go back and reshape it will go to the public access place before girls the projects SP but that i think is it is quite a maintenance bind for council which which they might want to talk to afterwards emergency sense ok it 's monitoring things and its implementing beach scraping as necessary at Collinwood which is making 2011 identifies nearly all beachfront property at the beach has exposed the coastal inundation during the dive design storm now a design storm we 're talking about a hundred year storm the the last time we had a hundred years storm was in in 1974 now you 'd say was that a media storm who knows maybe it was a 50-year storm anyway because a very big storm when we see these red areas versus the green here is what does that mean what that means is that these red areas here are predicted to experience overtopping which is water coming over the Jew possible and washing languid these green areas here one until after the design erosion hasn 't happened because what when the designer erosion occurs what the June crest gets lost to that erosion so you actually left with a lower crest and any design waves that might still be around at the end of that storm event have the potential of Washington for those green areas so the reader is nonetheless they both were showing the emergency response actions in the sub plan and 30 is in narrative scrapings prior to storms to enhance tuned volumes in to resume Chris Leavitt now I guess we would say you know Bri scraping okay maybe that could be done but we wouldn 't say that it 's a it 's appropriate to be to be describing nourishment as an activity which really does it make safe make good activity for any nourishment to take place they really there really are extensive investigations that are required to underpin any nourishment work so it 's not clear to us how nourishment really could be a magsafe make good provision nonetheless we 'll talk about nourishment a little bit more as to how it could be applauded right NC State work so what this is this is all about what can we do as engineers to protect Collingwood beach based on the hazard descriptions which have been developed by a smack and presented in the coasters I mention plane so that really is our brief and we tackled that as best we protection act what that means is a recognized hotspot it 's one of how many beaches maybe 20 or so features may be a few days I 'm not sure which are designated as hotspot beaches up and down the coast emergency provisions under the stage one reforms of the coastal protection act apply at these hot spot features as far as we 're concerned and I think perhaps as far as council is concerned these emergency provisions are essentially unworkable what they say you can do is they say you can go there fill some geotextile containers relatively small geotextile container san you don 't think them in too far you don 't build the crests up too high you get an engineer to sign off on on whatever 's proposed and then you can leave them there for a year while you go and get a DA for a proper wall for a fully designed wall but then after a year you 've got to pull it out otherwise you you might be exposed to you know some recourse from the council if private property owners implementing their and that was refused by the new south wales coast of panama i can talk to you about that afterwards if you like but there are all sorts of issues in trying to develop a wall for your property or perhaps for yours and your neighbors and your neighbors because of the end of the edge effects you really need to deal with these things on beach wide basis were at least on on substantial compartment basis otherwise there really are unworkable we investigated these end state effects in state works in 2013 and as I said an in-state work is designed to deliver protection from coastal hazards over that over 50 to 100 year life over a property design of whatever we might want to select for that bit of that design when we initiated our work one thing you wanted as we wanted to have a look and see if we could find any resistant material to erosion on the beach we didn 't have a enormous budget we had to go to three beaches at Collinwood we pick a couple of locations along the beach we 're sand and each of the locations that we 've drive them into the sandwich was hearing here we didn 't pull up on anything that we would call the erosion resistant material the this is this year as a measure of level in HD versus the number of blows that you that you remember anilos if you drop onto the top of that rod and the number of blows to get your other movies penetration is probably necessary so when we get e to the same as that rod actually penetrates the sand you can see a place greater number of blows it now is that around about 40 blood is considered to be refusal and we won 't get here so we were getting four meters of penetration from a sparkle tomorrow we just above the world the water line on the day without any real sense of of of resistance and what that means is that we really need to be treating this whole profile as potentially in a writable profile based on this limited scope of work I mean you might want to go here go over over the beach if we want to firm up on these things what we did with our workers we divided the beach into three precincts and these were just based on rent of exposure relative risk picking key strengths to help us with this Helfrich I avenue north of our main street was was deserving of its own precinct this area here was relatively protected and this area here was relatively exposed it has it someone from snake I 've been through some of these things already and then think you 'll agree is per meter the sermon budget processions are small on the beach up 2.13 of a meter per year so that is that 's the leakage effect that I was talking about earlier I think there is down here where it 's 0 and here is up there where it 's also 0 so that those areas of the camel manifest in the middle it 'll be the sea level rise recession effects of based on the best technologies that we have at this point which is called the bruin rule and they also based on the having another look at some of the microwave run-up levels five to five point five meters above Australian height datum that 's pretty close to what you have on top of the GMA now the three precincts at risk we had Kenny properties cycleways sewage water mains roadways 54 residents residences at immediate zone of reduced foundation capacity risk and that 's simply going back to the the air photo showing those lines more than 100 properties at risk by 2050 and that 's at risk from reduced by version better not at risk from actually having on the sand washed from underneath you but from being reduced contestants own more than a hundred residents at risk from innovation 100 years store maturing today so what can we do try and mitigate these risks we looked at privett once beach nourishment handle some you short break autism what your Beckman saw is they short parallel structures physically interact the live action and what they have me effective doing is they have the effect of moving a hazard line they see to the crest of their event so that 's a a typical order event in part look like top of the gym I 'm back here as if I wanted back here close to the houses if that Redmond is constructed in effect you move the hassle on from there to there as long as that 's in place and functioning we separately looked at those for each precinct develop that design both breaking Wi-Fi 10.3 meters which we got from the 2006 work concept design involves one two ton rock over another layer often you see a bit of a toilet in front of these structures because the beach is ready for he predicted that 's a relatively small breaking wave height we believe that that might not be needed at this side first level 45 to build that two thousand dollars per linear meter beach nourishment put it that 's putting new sand on the beach to feed the ongoing erosion we characterized how much sand might be lost in a storm how much sand might be lost if you need long-term recession if you keep putting sand on the beach to feed the recession and feed the position that sort of each nourishment is you can imagine that for 50 years of protection that amounts to a lot of sand and all and I 'll talk a little bit more about what quantities are involved three miles from scenarios we looked at look at what we call massive nourishment notices with the groin near Susan Street which allows us to compartmentalize an area of nourishment and not focus on areas which are relatively detected and then a manatee nourishment which is basically protecting the beach more southern protecting property but i 'll talk about them as well so going to mass of nourishment massive nourishment does the job of a full length through vetement it needs an initial placement of sand + ongoing maintenance placements and you 'll see that we 're talking about very large quantities of sand and it 's not just about putting sand on the beach because if you put Sam on the Beast that sound very rapidly gets washed into the swash side and beyond we need to actually get that sand to up to a depth which is called the depth the depth of closure at conga Beach is around about minus 7 7 meters below mean sea level so what you will find is in a very large storm that 's still no actually moving sediment around young in bed here in one community sediment around over here so that if you like is the compartment within which sediment might move so in effect the most but the best way that you can noticeably which is not just to put it over there to put it over the whole profile now what you will see is there sixty percent of the same that you need from nourishment is actually dancing it 's it 's underneath the water this is the pc and at Collinwood a massive nourishment project we would say requires attended a widening of the gym that and sand bass all the way up to minus seven and there are techniques for doing this and you need 250 thousand cubic meters of sin now that 's a lot of sand so inside this room we might have where we got like ten Bob eight that 's a tivo meters so we 're talking about 1,000 times the amount of sin that 's in in this room so it 's a lot of sand that would be the initial placement and then every five years because Santa 's been lost from this compartment due to long-term effects you need to come back and place in you would you would place that Sam as regularly as it 's feasible to place I mean ideally you place it every year but you don 't do that because these projects take you know quite difficult to mobilize and practically you come back every five years or so and place additional sin so seven and a half million dollars to for your initial placement Magnus nourishment over a 50-year for a mess of nourishment project clearly big numbers if we were to consider a growing at Susan street now that in itself is a substantial structure that 's a 200 meter long structure it needs to be that long because if it 's shorter the same that we 'd like to compartmentalize over here starts to leak and not work for you over where you 're minimizing the loss of sand from the end of the groin it does the job of a Rebecca where there 's an immediate threat to BNC so that 's what this team does it 's the same as massive nourishment but it 's limited to one point two kilometers of beach north of susan street with a you know quite a substantial growing what you can see here is you bringing down your numbers but they still substantial numbers and that 's not allowing for the construction of the groin awkward that groin would require 20,000 tons of rock we talked about substantial structures bringing in that amount of rock which you have to do for your events it doesn 't matter what what rock structure you talking about their substantial quantities of material groins on you don 't see too many of them around there 's some trial groans up on on the Sunshine Coast can 't think of the top of my head where where else we might have one in New South Wales inside some entries we have them there is they 're awesome 'm anything nourishment is really an adjunct fura Beckman so what this is about it 's about preserving humanity beechwood 's if you build a reverberant at any point on the bench eventually that is going to be lost with sea level rise so to maintain a beach in front of that war you would need to place and in that now at the moment we 've got about 25 meters of width between your reg line and your green water line on the beach preserving 25 meters this might be luxury if we said okay we better accept the lesser amount and if we prepare to accept a lesser amount remark need own commence our manatee nourishment in 20-30 for after the beaches proceeded to that point and that would then require us to be placing fifty thousand cubic meters of sand every five years up to the end of the planning period which is taken to be 50 years from last year side to 2063 4.4 million dollars soham anything no it doesn 't provide full protection to property and assets that simply gives a suitably wide Beach sand come from where can we get the same for these sorts of projects are three possible sources their commercial local histories or offshore commercial sand cost you about fifty dollars a ton now if you find the supplies from shoalhaven and elsewhere 75 a cubic meter for that amount of sand from a subsea 40 to 60 million dollars for an in-state scheme clearly not viable local ester is the Spurl a report talks about potentially 50 to 70,000 cubic meters being released he 'd Manian in these large entrance show Larry 's more in congela then then then khurram be over 50 years still mean ten times that amount field a viable nourishment project at Collingwood so from throughout the Shoalhaven what can be released at Bertram 's you know bjork bjork your st entrance bars is going to be king you need ten times that amount to feed some of your nourishment projects so again not viable offshore as a source I mean the vast quantities of sand on the inner shelf go five kilometers offshore 20 to 70 meters these have been investigated on a number and place them for about thirty dollars per cubic meter still very expensive we start having these numbers Harvey knows not his best foot we still talking about a lot lots and lots of money another hitch is offshore extraction factors creative new south wales under the offshore minerals at 1999 there 's so much pressure though for saying for these sorts of projects and also for building that it 's likely the state government 's going to be reviewing that in our view sometime soon possibly you know related to this page to reforms who knows so concluding remarks on dredging feasibility of nourishment to provide n state protection is limited by viability of sound sources and costing compartment scheme with growing as Susan Street also associated large womens of sin plus risks you know we 're less certain about growing performance major approvals issues in the Marine Corps anything nourishment is a valid scheme to the compliment n state works but we still need large quantities of sand are three to five times what the S Therese can give us an ashole Haven however a partial scene so a partial scheme of similarities to a manatee nourishment could possibly achieve a reduction and coastal risk with some tangible benefits don 't talk a little bit about that ma 'am well in a second so this was the last of our end state and works that we considered near shore break waters near shore break waters are a legitimate form of coastal protection they have been discussed as you might not before up at all bar I 've bet they 've been applied on the Gold Coast but those two applications involve a structure the crest which is below the waterline senator you have a crest below the waterline these sorts of structures don 't work particularly well they really need to be emergent they detach a short parallel the sand must be available for them to function I mean if there 's no sand available the system that unless you work because you need sand to accumulate there and that sounds really come from something each structure we have a look at a very at a possible scheme for collingwood each structure would need to be 200 metres we 've located about 200 to 500 meters from the shore there are some sort of rules of thumb for these types of structures clearly would need to be investigated if it was to be pursued five of those structures might be required for precincts B&C precinct debut you 'd be able to delay that the application because of its relative protection another two might be required down the track the later 2015 uncertain performance of the sea level rise I mean these uncertainties are really big problems when it comes to these sorts of structures because government doesn 't want to commit to very large expenditures if it 's uncertain how these things are going to perform and there is it 's fair to say there 's a fit a lot of uncertainty with these structures particularly if the crests of instructors of a lot of all run their brother wore long they 're all sorts of other issues there are many issues major approvals issues Jervis Bay Marine Park with that sort of structure I would suggest still 28 million dollars for the scheme so I think we Brazilian Christ and South American because this is actually kind of Eve Ball series of emergent nature right words that 's fun the an estate works report that we prepared look at all of these options I said okay what what would we suggest as a as a priority set of projects to deal with the the coastal risk at Calima beach and we developed five projects we weren 't particularly mindful of dollars here what would we do and what we seek review is first we relocate the sewage pump station in the mains along the southern end of Elizabeth drive and I think here we 're talking about I 'm stations down here and away from the shoreline would relocate the mains along the road head to Susan Montague in very streets pull those back or veteran to protect your foot come Avenue is our third priority project here we 've got a row we 've got a water main and writers particularly threatened that road services four and a half million dollars to construct them then we 're talking about a rivetting to protect also from properties structure would be our fourth project 7.9 million and find nirav Edmond to protect shorefront product properties between hold the street and Caesars thing which would I need you inquire so present value cost of that structure is actually 3.7 million dollars finally if we build revetments what we should also be doing is putting sand on the beach to protect the beach 4.4 million dollars so clearly lots of money for those schemes what other ideas might we have in this this is this was really the challenge governments in a barn now make good make safe schemes are in place they deal with emergencies and minus thorns but they do not manage largest storms a recession and state schemes have been conceptually described and at this time we would probably say that they 're not feasible and or they aren 't affordable transitional steams attempt to bring these two bookends if you like just in general terms what my transitional schemes embrace they would want to be adaptive structures so conceptually you might build for short-term loads and modify predicted long-term loads eventuate rapidly careful obviously because if our mother of all storms and we lose our structure then we 're back to square one so we have to be very careful how eps of those sorts of structures might might be and i put a few ideas Oh monitoring we have to monitor we don 't know when to adapt something if we don 't want them seeing triggers to implement adaptive adaptive works that has to be part of the of the project staging of projects I mean we might develop say Oh a big scheme but we can only we should be developed we should be developing those these schemes and stages starting off with property which is at most risk demonstration projects and trials are people this is take a good idea with sorts of structures that were there might be some concern for example offshore break boards for example groins they might be ways of building offshore structures building drawings perhaps not out of rock will say certainly not out of rock initially episode of geotextile containers or tubes seeing if they work if they work and we satisfy ourselves that they no but you know we are talking about our beaches our environment we don 't to get it wrong demonstration projects and cause I think or a good idea just transitional arrangements for abetment works i 'll look at a partial revet meant later placement and a party or event in section placements are they two different ideas that we could use at this is a layer placement idea which is actually recently has been constructed at while at cabbage tree harbor no Nora head perhaps you know the site isn 't really properties here that so is this be stabilized principally by waves binding you to the bottom of that blush and what this is M to do is to protect the world on the block now regretting structures are conventionally built with two layers of rock as a minimum this particular structure is broken one layer of armor and one layer of under low it has a design life of 15 years it 's designed to postpone the expenditure of an in-state structure at a multi-layer structure nonetheless it 's still cost ten thousand dollars a meter and the they had some quite difficult access constraints to get that rock onto the beach in fact if you go through the sums here this rock is placed for around about five hundred dollars a ton now five hundred dollars a ton is quite and very hard placement costs for her abatement and think it was mainly related to to the access but I just put this up as a as a as a concept for a transitional scheme we 've designed to have a short life and you it 's designed to delay an expenditure of an end state scheme we would be a little bit concerned about the scheme because of the uncertainty that resides with a single data structure mean if that 's hit by a design storm potential you could lose that whole structure so I 'm not sure we would be suggesting that one other idea which might be worth looking at is this is a conventional type of Rebecca nonetheless what we 've shown for climbing would one have the toe of the concept is is valid the best structure wasn 't there and we say that point which if you like what is a hazard on that you 're zona reduced from that s he has a bar might be there but yours onus of adjustment hazard line line through there so it 's effective effectively it has a time if if we built as part of its structure and we satisfied ourselves at that quadrant structure won 't get the way so that but that 's obviously important as a stage one to a full project what we might what we can actually show theoretically is that just like only man that has aligned can actually be room for anyway so there 's potentially a stage implementation of a wall which might take it has a blind away from harm 's way from some buildings if in the future we find that sea levels start to rise and that as it is increasing and we need to respond within might finish at all so that is an idea nonetheless just to go out there to build that would still cost the substantial amount of time you still have to go out there you meters or one and a half meters below mean sea level is dewatering to deal with it is an extensive part of the structure to prove that up you would have to physically model it you would have to demonstrate that by building that you 've got that benefit and by building that exposing into severe storms when washing out the back of that head structure so that those are ideas to deal with Rebecca instructors back past nourishment is is an idea that i 'll just bring to you because they 're bears potentially an application i think at collingwood what back past now is you use it 's about taking sand that operates are routed from your beach goes to a certain point bringing it back to your beach so simply taking it from its destination and bringing it back to the beach now this is done at a few features called a narrow beam Jimmy speech and Newson I 'll quickly go through those epson culinarian what they do is they remove sand from the interest on American about once every three to five years or so and thats and then works its way i 'm actually back to the entrance and refills letters they relocated about 15 to 20 thousand cubic meters of sand hippie meters of sand on average and the cost to do that is about 22,000 cubic meter now the they 've been doing that for about 30 years or so these quantities here are not going to help you they 're not going to protect you in a storm they 're going to assist they 're going to reduce your exposure but they 're not going to fully protect you so that 's the thing to bear in mind that 's that 's the case of Korra a narrow beam that 's placing at the right head so you can imagine something like that perhaps been going from some of your road at Jimmy 's beach what we have it in you see if you 've got about 500 meters or so of shoreline which is very exposed there is a road between the beach and the property but will come Avenue what council does there is it takes sand from yakubov in the rope on region does that the air box so we are heroes they set up a sustainable loop the difference between this site and cholera narrow beam and also musa which i 'll show you is that this scheme here actually provides interstate protection for Jimmy speech the quantities of sand that are that are replacement in a speech actually feeds erosion in a design storm and it feeds recession so it 's a full it 's an estate scheme for Jimmy 's beach Jimmy speech they 've installed a permanent pipeline and they use a cutter suction dredge at the DIA khabar and Barbarossa on noosa heads some of you might have been there that 's a thing suit the entrance to the neuse river and i 'll see what was still here in my 60s a ride is constructed their 1982 this is a very high value than for shore line and that is required for a lot of those businesses to survive what they set up at noosa is they set up a a backfire scheme at no sir which took sand this is nice a slowly system the scheme there intakes below the sand in the swash zone there that sucks and in and that sends pump along the shoreline to an outfit that outfit program to the beach the same violence way let you back to those impacts but the benefit for noosa has demonstrated in a in fact in a trial they trialed that for I think about four years or so before they build their permanent skin so again and I guess an adaptive idea a lot of sand Sun on the beach when that was would net was implemented before implementation not very much just a quick one of the of the pump station at that end and what the outlet like what the f it looks like you can see you don 't see too much but quite an expensive scheme anyway transitional schemes for collingwood a recommended category one project is to protect your for come at me with the reverberant examine a transitional scheme a burrito perhaps for that if the coastal thread increases what could we maybe do we could look at a backpass scheme at to be investigated to make sure that was sustainable but it 's possible that if we had to say a transitional reconceive operating at overcome and we have some sort of that forest in woodland from unamuno in combination they might assist you either from album with that feasibility depends on the quantity of sand that can be sustainably removed from the creek entrance and clearly the ecological assessments and Jervis Bay Marine Park approvals that would need to be I mean just having a look at two of the early photos closer look at say that entrance this is the position in the breach yeah seems that there 's quite a lot more Santa 's here is in 1944 but really we haven 't_''_3891.75 investigated that I 've just pulled up to 22 photos then compared them so where to from here for Collingwood beach we 've done our DCP work we didn 't find any resistant material nonetheless bedrock investigations I think are warranted at all of these beaches just because of the implications of these lines here we 're talking about actually grilling hulls perhaps at your that we 're not we don 't find anything along the beach we can investigate the sustainability of sand recycling safe from Luna Luna is there enough sand to reduce coastal erosion risk can 't_''_3931.65 be borrowed ecological implications approvals performance partial placement over a veteran physical modeling would be a certain requirement a risk based assessment of coastal hazard lines this is an idea which is only now I guess been considered a coronary been--it 's been done it 's also been done it at all bow it 's fair to say it 's not a panacea it 's what it 's about it 's about looking at the likelihood of actually getting erosion two points and considering the consequences of that and assessing that likely wouldn 't consequence in a risk a risk context and its borrowing a methodology that geotechnical engineers have developed for landslide risk it 's being developed at coral I narrabeen there are a lot of hair storm on the scheme and really is a work in progress but that 's something that that meant that I believe the state government is thinking about plan and a review of emergency sub plan also things but we know that we need to do it calling me thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you for coming tonight everyone it 's a good Tony thanks for coming yelling if those they 're not going to be fun talk about like when will I play some of you I think there 's some communications you would have seen a similar presentation that i gave up the amazing committee meeting for councils and play the rush through that one here so we 've got people time to North long I 'll be able to draw on page bit more so the run you can see it I see em I hear me properly you will know where we are there just a refresher where you know south of the shoalhaven near Lake Borgne baller and he shall have been cooked over river north of John spade and in more detail the light there on the eastern coast and the red line is the catchment area for lake water like one below so lake level is one of several similar lakes up and down the south coast in New South Wales but it 's got some key distinguishing factors that make it quite unique that will of those key distinguishing factors is the size of the lake compared to its catchments it 's very large lake with a relatively small area that that contributes to it then that creates a bunch of unique kind of characteristics and ecological characteristics for awake and we 've got the town of our beach where we are now on the northern shore but mostly national park in the lake catchment we 're talking today that the flood study and I 'll go through a range of topics of the things that the study 's trying to achieve to kind of data that we have available the data that we got from the community is part of a newsletter and questionnaire process that we 're here and then I 'll talk to about the types of models that we developed to estimate the flood risk we 've got a range of different models that we developed for this study for different aspects of the study and then I 'll talk about the flood behavior and things that are coming out of these models it 's a various things like climate change victory user plan as max that have indicated this is the early stage of the floodplain management process this is this is a process recording the floodplain development manual by the New South Wales state government and councils are sort of required to go through this process and part of their floodplain risk management obligations and we 're in that early stage the data collection and flood study stage were really about quantifying what the existing flood behavior and flood risk is in the latest stages that flowed by management study in plan when we start to look at potential mitigation measures will quickly mitigate reduce flood risk whether that 's physical works or planning type development control things that won 't be done so so for the flood study this early stage these are the main goals that we 're looking at and thats collecting historical flood data collecting information for people who have been affected by flooding in collecting other the other data like rainfall data in this case this weight level data we 've got quite a good record of lake levels and prepare these models to as I mentioned we 've got some different models that we 've developed and that 's because there are different flood mechanisms that can affect this catchment so there 's a lake itself large long rainfall events that fill up the lake and the lake level rises and can confirm the flooding but also local catchment intense rainfall that falls and it collects and runs down the hills and can affect people and who can cause damage just as significant as as the more well understood fighting that people are more aware of which is writing main stream so we 'll talk about both of those things or kind of talk about that local catchment flooding as storm water flooding and the other thing is like and as part of this study we 're also doing a bit of an assessment to water quality runoff that can be expected from development and the impacts of development on water quality and away so a lot of you might be aware of this kind of background information but I thought I 'd just go through is there a herd of an I it 's an awkward since for an awkward term called haven 't immediately closed and open lake or the goon and essentially label ball is one of these is lots of them up in the other new south wales coast and it 's a it 's a history whether the ocean is trying to close that history with a by pushing stand up into the entrance and the runoff from it from the ipod catchment is pushing fresh water out that insurance okay breaking in and and one of the key characteristics about these like holes is catchment area the lake area ratio I talked about that earlier and lake little blurry is sort of right up the extreme end of the lakes that we have in terms of catchment area size to Lake area ratio so the lake itself takes up about twenty percent of the entire catchment example of another typical like I 'll brew late in the coastal furthers it 's 22 the size of the catchment times their answers and what that means is that essentially there isn 't a lot of rainfall runoff that gets it has a lot of capacity to store run off when it does occur and that means that the way is typically wanting to be closed in its natural state that 's that 's what 's going to happen that the ocean is pushing stand up the beach paper tomorrow it takes a lot of water in the lake to rise up and get over that feature firm and pushed idea because we have a small catchment that doesn 't happen nearly as often as it does with other icons and we 've got a very good historical data set in this lake this is this is unusual we don 't have this for all of the lights around the place we 've got about twenty three years now I 've continued its water level data and you can see that that 's essentially what we 're looking at is a lake level going up and down over 23 years from Monday 91 through to today you can see some peeps there 's five of them in a month with dates those are those are the where the lake has there 's a switch drop off and it goes down we 're like little goes right down we need to see little and you can see there from 1998 until two thousand six a breakout in 1998 in a big storm that occurred all across New South Wales and really thrashed the Wollongong region and after that the lake closed up again sand pushed into the entrance and stayed close to other eight years so it wasn 't enough rainfall in that eight-year period ruin a drought across most of the state to fill up the lake and you know evaporation took it out faster that it could go in and the last couple of years we have had a couple of breakouts took them in a bit more detail 2011-2013 nothing there 's even another one more easily be with child in any the average level there is a red red line there about 1.2 meters above average sea level to give you an idea of where the the beach berm wants to be this and some scientific studies that have been done by the state government essentially the about two point eight meters that 's so you can expect that and you can see that most of those break out some occurred around the 2.5 and above market so it does get to that high please so that 's the level we 're talking about for the the natural state of the burgers about two and a half meters above the mean sea level so as I said we 've we 've got history of natural and artificial openings we think there 's been 21 openings since 1969 now and five of those have occurred naturally paint we know of being manual instigated and the other way we 're not sure yet and there is a management strategy that essentially management of the entrance is under the responsibility of National Parks and Wildlife Service that 's a little bit unusual as well often Baikal entrances are managed by council under a license from the state government and they have an entrance management policy National Parks and Wildlife Service and that says that if the lake level exceeds 2.75 and they 're still having been a break here and down the other opening it up but any other openings and the recent ones that have been many ways to get it have been not done by national parks are illegal and and they 've been generally below that level so said it 's carried out by National Parks and Wildlife Services and and this permite does have an effect directly affect on Providence in the rackets it 's really one of the key controls because unlike most with a lot of icons it might be ocean levels that might be the key think the flooding as opposed to river flows or rain falling but really because lake will buller wants to be closed most of the time it 's that height that really affects how i love this market and so it 's an obvious thing to talk about it 's half over however because because this control scheme international parts of Allah so this is not really something that 's feasible changing this management strategy for the purposes of flood mitigation protective or whatever other purpose of not having labeling below Kabara beach and after the purposes of that there will be a timely intervention this isn 't a kind of emergency response management strategy that 's in place you know we 're there I 've got a command and control center and they 're going to jump out here as soon as the lake it stupid superfly you know it takes time and things organized a week before I don 't really sort out so it doesn 't necessarily mean that took on 75 is the limiting factor on whether then we get to the lake level again sir so I think that probably services the region 2.75 is selected as identified in the management strategy as being possessive sewer inspection pizza can overflow above that was up there we stuck it in sewage sewage floating around and there 's a quite added major strategy which is exactly what their pulse years which is when there 's a real threat of flooding floor level of houses or lake levels are in post-effective pious or inspection points and the forecast is for continued rain so with that forecast to continue around 38 about this sort of kind of 's something they want to talk about the end so we 'll come back to that I 'll move on to the other kinds of data that we 've done before the study this is the rainfall data that we have that diagram might be a bit hard to understand at the red line there it 's the popular catchment the lakes in here Kabara beach is up here and the red dots there are daily rainfall gauges so they 're things that record 24 hours worth of rain in one go and the blue dots all the way out further the Australian Navy Air Station and turpentine their continuous rainfall reports we have data out of them every six minutes so they give us a lot more information about short duration storms one and two our top storm but for daily type stuff we 've got quite the data around the country we request information from the community I 'm sure a lot of you reply to this newsletter and thank you for that we 've got a very good response and the summary of 143 responses totaled a was that associated with a break out of the lake but also a very intense storm event in town that caused a lot of storm water issues for a lot of people particularly east-west present and bring back row for places that were identified there the succumbing supplied a feedback process that particular in relation to the flooding on west cruiser and greenback Grove the cheek brush creek was a contributing factor of that perception it was holding stormwater you know in the area and some comments as well generally from from people who 've been around the community for a long time just general observations about the lake ecosystem and deploying they 've seen over the last 15 a bit of some of the responses there that 's really just showing you where the responses were and how severely people were affected and so move on now to the modeling that we do in the study in the types of analysis that we 've done them we 've got three essentially models that we 've built to deal with three different types of three different areas of the catchment horrible there 's a model thought the levels in creeks kuna my grievance or other tributaries that come in from the west where there really isn 't any development or anything at all and then a model for the storm water flows within town in the village area it 's probably bit out of place this is some more about the rainfall data march two thousand eleven was identified as as a big event can this has been arranged for analysis and pretty complicated but the one thing to take out of this is that dotted line is basically what we think how intense that rainfall was in comparison to sort of how often it might occur and essentially what that saying is over about a two-hour period if it comes out at about a five year or a ten year storm on average so you can expect that level to be included on average about every five or ten years and that doesn 't mean there 's five years between drinks you might have a couple of the right way a good example of that is Kim seen on sat on record in 1949 and 1950 and we think they 're both about what we call a hundred year flood but just because that doesn 't mean that they 're set for 200 years I just threw a bad rolling the dice a couple years so so that gives you some idea I guess where we think march two thousand eleven fifteen it 's a little bit complicated because we don 't have that continuous rainfall data right where the storm occurred we 've got to kind of figure out what happened from the daily rainfall data in town thus the stuff that tells us how much filling a short period further west so we use that rainfall data and we built our model of town that the model that we build sort of takes aerial survey data of the town on it we create a two meter by two meter elevation models of 10 we put that rainfall data into the into the model and we can put the pipe network in the storm water drainage Network and we can put a model the effects of where they we use the march two thousand eleven event where we had some some information given to us to to try and see if we could match using the rainfall data that we have got that kind of behavior this is a map which I 'm not sure how clear it 's going to be on the screen the blue areas are areas where the modeling is showing deeper levels of inundation we 're sort of talking between 150ml vs 15 centimetres top foot up to say two foot worth of depth in in the dark colors and then the very darkest color greater than our meetup and that really only applies to within the lake itself and you can see that that using that rainfall and gives us a fairly good match to to the weird issues were reported we 've got some green dots therefore we 're leaving the Victorian issues largely around this area the top of sheep wash Creek and along these present some a lot of a lot of shallow flooding behind the road and east present there 's a lot of the lightest blue color 's a lot around there 's a lot of that around the place it 's it 's hard to know exactly from the descriptions sometimes how bad in issues some someone might see this much water by the road is a really big flood issue and someone wants a half a meter in their backyard is nothing to worry so that 's that 's one aspect of the modeling the other the other thing that we other model week we developed is one to figure out how much rainfall the tools in the lake catchment ends up in the lake itself and contributes to the lake level bloody we 've got lake levels so we can we know what happened historically there we 've got was rainfall information so we consider the same thing again we use the jun 2013 event because if we had good rainfall information at cobb our own greenville point we know fairly good handle on what happened over three days there and answer the lake itself that 's what rather than talk about one or two our events which will be about these two three a lot of rain a lot of inflow into the lake and then the wake of rice fast the lake grows quite about a metre over those three days and then was broken out a level of 2.4 eighth-graders a model gives a pretty good match to that it 's it gets the level change very good but the timings a bit off enough because as i said we don 't have that timing of rainfall information necessarily we have a good understanding of the amount of rainfall feel not exactly when phil and i will go into detail of this of essentially looking at some different options that we run in the modeling what we 're trying to determine is how much of that rain ends up in the lake and how much of it is lost to infiltration staging the catchment is vibrated by the vegetation or stacey little storage areas throughout the catchment and that 's a key important to us than figuring out how often we think the lake will get to certain levels how are we think the two-year 5800 so the big thing that that briefly refer to that as range for losses what are the losses of the rainfall that hits the ground or falls from the sky how much is lost so that brings me to the last aspect of our modeling which is the actual lake level itself and this this is an unusual relatively unusual technique that we 're able to apply to you we were able to plug because we have a less detailed lake level essentially we want and one of the key things about lake or a baller is because it 's closed 100-year lake level isn 't necessarily because of 100 year rainfall like it is on most catchments you know if you 're on a big river or a urban area 100-year rain for the rainfall is the big thing of course is that hundred year SWAT flood but in label and pull up if you 've got a very low starting level in the lake and get 100-year angel and not even notice it conversely if you had a wet season you can get a relatively standard mindful just going over a few days these factors we need to run a slightly different probably probability type model we essentially run 10,000 years worth of invented data we use a starting lake level based on the lake data that we have what probability it might be at any given point we use some design rifle data whether we get a hundred year n fall or a 2d landfill in that you we roll the dice on that we 're putting some other impacts about the lake shape and look like the berm might be whether a breakout and so this is the big output of that process this is those that the blue line there is essentially 10000 dots you can see that kind of scatter out and from right to left we 're talking about highly probable to the left and and more and more improbable as we move to the right so and the dotted lines here are a sort of hundred year ten year to like markets the red dots are the historical information we have so the red dots are the highest level in any given year and that 's what out what 's the highest level we 're going to have in any given year then we can figure out what the hundred you or 50 years going to be and we get a very good match the historical data that 's quite a good result the key things to take out here probably you know the ten-year level which is this dotted line here so ten percent chance of happening in any giving you is about 2.5 meters above average sea level 100 year or the one percent chance of having a pumping in a given year but possibly twice in two years if you can see is up here at about two point eight five meters so that 's a bit above you know what we think is the maximum and as you can see as we move added to really explain things that might happen because of that maximum them like that sort of puts a cap on how fly how bad things can actually be it starts to flatten out now this end of the thing went west more looking about fifty percent so any given a toss of the coin a level of about 1.1 meters so that 's that sort of the process we 've gone through all the move on to results me able to study and there 's a few slides here and might not dwell on these too much in you can survive ask me questions about interesting as I said one person ap lake level 2.3 and I think actually that 's been slightly revised and so do these slides it 's more like to connect for differences one of the things you councils interested in is what 's the serviceability of all the roads can people still get around the queen of my Road bridge is very high we think that 's above the one percent flood level from the tributary my Creek so that 's good to know and the road culverts on the way into town here on the big sweeping bend a couple of big near culverts there they 're quite large and the catchment area to them it 's quite small so there 's a chance of that road staying open a pretty good this for the one percent paying p with a hundred at 100 year storm just a big blue blob where the lake is if we zoom into town which people might be more interested in we 've also got a leveling the cook Haven we got from from previous studies that have been done there and we 've done this storm water you know assessment in town where we 'd apply the hundred-year rainfall and that 's what we 're looking at here the Green Line is the cook Haven 100-year flood level so anyone on this side the Green Line is affected by 100 here okay we 've got the purple line is the same for local of bullets that 's that 2.8 three or five meter lines we were talking about anyone from the left side of that purple line is affected by that level and that you know there is some ground levels sort of in this area that liberals work and then the other depths that are on there are the 100-year rainfall falling on town and because the catchment isn 't really that big in town extremely urban flood problems in heavenly urbanized areas with large attachments but we know there 's this issue in between East and West resin or Ian Bremmer growth as well there are some areas where stormwater does collect just through attachments in particular this step there 's a big um sway left to the beach here there are some various areas where the catchment good Corsa mode Wayne flow problems would be so council one of councils responsibilities is to determine where development controls might be applicable to prevent people from building things in places where they 're getting it for them regularly we call it the flood planning area so that helps them identify whether you might have might not be subject to development controllers improperly New South Wales white for mainstream flooding and women between that Lake Borgne below or call cable results what we mean by mainstream there 's a persistent it 's a common practice to apply half a metre freeboard to the 100-year level and if you 're within that area going to show your hand you need to consider flooding when you look at a half of me right into that 2.83 level I was talking about and then there is also tagging for Overland properties that might be affected by overland flow this is less consistent area it 's it 's more depending on the needs of the council and the nature of the flood problem in the catchment but very different methods of being affordable it cancels and it 's like necessary council to take storm water or overland flow effective companies so it 's a fun playing area from the lake with a big version of that dough from the wall there this is it for town the blue label properties of properties that have some part of their ground level ground that Lake envelope will cook Haven River flood planning level and the green properties are ones where there might be a bit of a storm water issue and they 're just get it around the place that this is not a finalized thing is but it 's generally finalized at risk management study staged and explains the process and depends on cancers call CSD how that information is interpreted is potential for sea level rise whether or not you think it 's going to happen I guess we 'll talk about if it does happen what 's going to happen um the way our coursework they 're largely dependent on what sea levels are with the ocean the way run up the wind or everything is coming in from the ocean is pushing the sand up into the firm if ocean levels go up why not her bye-bye half a meter that berm height goes up where and similarly pretty much the whole system it also gets pushed back a bit that 's really an issue and similarly you know when it breaks out and won 't break out the steep the average sea level has gone up so sediment will accumulate and sort of fill up the lake the whole Lake system basically goes up while the same amount that see the world and that means if flood levels at the top of that so there 's no magic mask behind bc civil rights goes up by half a meter flood levels go up by half a medal which is projection for 2100 you got why point nine meters fearful of rivers and one of the key I guess ways to bring that home how have you make that might be we 're talking over here about a 100-year level of good point a if we find under the 2100 900 mill fire sea level rise scenario we 're getting that little over here and that 's more around you fifty percent chance every year so that goes from being a hundred year got event to it being to you so that that is I seen any risk particular to an existing development it 's below say three and a half minutes Barbie that 's the stuff I 've just talked about writers not so much every year there that 's the kinetic you know the Debbie variation but you 're talking much more frequently and four meters HD that 's maybe a bit little bit definitely below three and a half three point seven saluting me more footage the last thing I 'm gonna talk about is hazard mapping this is to do with the rest of one of the standard type things that we look at under the state government program and its associated with the depth of flooding the velocity of it whether it 's like a washer car off the road try and drive fluid and we 've done that process for cara beach looking the lake the red is high hazard the blue is low hazard not too much to be conservatively mostly the red hazard area to comply to the waterway systems so thanks again for coming out tonight if there 's any way the draft report is basically completed the next stage is to go to a public exhibition of that draft study but we 've come to do this workshop before we do that to get any feedback out of this and see if there 's any revisions that might be required before we go to that stage we go thank you again _"

    "text": "okay well thank you very much ladies and gentlemen for being here this afternoon I 'm Joe gash meriden city and I 'd like to introduce some people to you we have counsel Ellen Baptist 's assistant deputy mayor who 's at the back there we have councillor tribe and we have counsel Patricia white and I 'll introduce the guests in a moment but I just want to say thank you for one welcome you to the Collingwood beach June vegetation too long word is no management public forum and the independent expert panel and I 'd like to introduce them to you it 's Gary druid where are you Gary Gary as the he has the overview of the whole situation over the last 40 years of development and June works at Collingwood beach we have professor Colin Woodruff from the University of Wollongong coastal processes I and we have Gabriel petrini from the offices of environment environment and heritage and outline of the state government legislation related to coastal and Jude vegetation management that 's what you 're doing we are great and we have council staff hasn 't got a tie on we have we have Kelly low environmental services where are you Kelly and we have penny lump from the coast and s2 his assistant where are you penny she 's right at the back that 's all right women are excused now lays the gentleman we 're here to listen to information from the expert panels but most of all we 're going to listen to and document your opinions and ideas about vegetation management at Collingwood beach we 're going to take the first steps to establish a reference group who will use the issues raised today as the starting point we are looking for six people who represent various interest groups to be on the reference group council was undecided about including a summary of the banner survey as it 's not consistent with the main purpose of today 's forum I emphasized that that is not the purpose of today 's forum however we have our cinnamon and I 'll introduce her in a moment to provide a brief overview results and the full report will be available on councils website debate the issues or attempt to resolve anything the panel 's presentations will be videoed and placed on councils website I 'd now like to introduce to you the facilitator is cinnamon dunsford where I a cinnamon now cinnamon is from local consulting which is a niche consulting firm that serves as local government clients cinnamon dunsford is a principal planner and she has been based on the south coast for over 10 years cinnamon is a strategic planner with a strong background in community engagement ranging from charing of public meetings and large workshop facilitations down to coordinating specific focus groups and one on one local government legal mediation cinnamon is trained in facilitation and has been commissioned by council to chair today 's public meeting welcome to you cinnamon you can take it over thank you thank you imagine gosh and once again I know that we 've already had a welcome but I welcome you all here today too I 've conducted a lot of public meetings chaired a lot of public meetings and I still think it 's great to see so many community members here that you could all be doing and I appreciate why you 're all here today so without further ado we 'll get this afternoon underway a couple of them I suppose caretaking matters can everybody hear me because it 's fairly important that everyone can hear what we all have to say today and that will all be able to hear you as well you know just just briefly I 'm not expecting you to remember all these times that 's actually my job will be here for two and a half hours and we 've had a welcome in an intro obvious outline the agenda and parameters and purpose of today then we 'll get onto our expert panel presentations I 'll just add that when our expert panel members undertake their presentations at the end of each presentation there 'll be a little time five or so minutes for some question and answers because i know that in these situations if you hear three different people speak and you 're holding your questions it can get a little bit laborious i suppose and you know you have to end of each presentation we 'll take two or three questions for each of our presenters today and if anyone would like pencils or paper or anything to write something down throughout the day when someone else is speaking penny of the back here has got pencils and paper so if anyone would like some now penny is quite happy to hand it around otherwise you know where it is if you need it as the mayor said I 'll also give a very brief summary of the collingwood Beach survey findings and then we 'll move into the open forum which is all about everybody here making comments suggestions opinions ideas putting them all forward i 'll be documenting every single thing that you say and as the mayor also mentioned this is that start point to putting down all those issues so that the reference group can start looking at those issues once that reference group is formed we 'll have a review and then we 're aiming to close at four thirty before we go too much further I find this to be a really important slide chair or facilitate I just ask that everyone have a look at the four points up here because these are my parameters I ask that everybody abides by these we can 't see okay is it only the two of you that can 't Sarah there are other people that can 't see the screen okay then can we make it any higher is that helping okay then that 's all right and can everybody still hear me okay very important that you can see what see although I will run through what I 'm saying it 's still nice to be able to see the screen as well okay so number one I ask that we allow each person to speak without interruption everybody will be given an opportunity if somebody is I suppose running over time then I will potentially ask that if you have covered your point that we do move on to the next person but I do ask that we allow each other to speak without interruption I ask that we keep our discussion to the matter at hand and for us to be future-focused 's something I do quite regularly myself but it is my role today to try and keep people on the matter at hand I also ask that we keep to the time frame so each person has an opportunity to input to the discussion and I ask most importantly that we 're constructive and respect each other so does everybody feel comfortable abiding by these parameters today maybe it 's best if I ask if anybody doesn 't feel comfortable abiding by the parameters because if at some stage throughout the day I do have to come back to these I will and now that everyone 's agreed to these parameters I will let you know that I 'll keep my speaking to a minimum I will treat each person equally and I will report to Council transparently on any of the issues that are raised today now I 'll just run through these very briefly because I know that the mayor has already been over these as well it 's the first step today in a process of establishing the reference group to develop recommendations which will guide the it 's the first step we 're not looking for the answers today but we 're looking to start a very important process we will receive information from our three-person expert panel we will receive the outcomes of the Collingwood beach survey and we will hold an open forum to identify those key issues that the reference group will investigate today is all-inclusive it 's about listening and it 's about taking down all the ideas at the end of the forum everyone is nominated or is is invited to nominate themselves to be a member of the reference group you can complete a form today which penny has at the back of the room you can take a form with you because it is two-sided and you may like to fill it out in your own at your own leisure or you can complete the form online council 's website but all the forms need to be back to council by Friday the eighth of august councils also asked me to mention that there is a related community engagement project council will be consulting with the community in the including coastal erosion so separate to what we 're here to talk about today in relation to Collingwood beach this forms part of councils coastal zone management planning studies and it 's all part of an ongoing extensive console consultation program which is due to be rolled out in spring 2014 so in the near future hence why I 've been asked to mention it today Kelly low I 'll just hand over to Kelly now so that she can provide you with just a little bit more information on this thank you I just want to let you all know that councils will be dropping come in contact with you again as part of our coastal zone management plan we 've got a newsletter that we 've produced that will send out to you because we 're hoping to get you involved again with other processes that we 've got coming up towards the end of the year and it got to coastal erosion and it 's all part of our draft coastal zone management plan so they get that website hopefully through your rates notice that musée de council 's website that will be in touch with you can and a new feature about some of the other processes that you hear from our expert speakers thanks Kelly so moving on with the agenda are now like to introduce Gary drew it he 's an environmental consultant focusing on design and implementation of natural resource management projects here 's over 40 years experience in soil conservation and the design and implementation of all sorts of natural resource management today Gary will discuss the story of Collingwood beach from the first sign of June erosion through habilitation programs and the future management he 's been involved in the past in a total restoration program with staff and management of the soil conservation service of New South Wales and with shoalhaven City Council and so it 's over to you going to soil arosen in rural areas or catchment area it 's all everything is based on vegetation vegetation growth and protection that 's much easier to control soil erosion on rural land with grasses and different types of vegetation on what it is on sin because sin erodes very very delicate even though it 's strong within its own pattern and each species of vegetation in the June system a protective of each other the low growing grass is on the frontal june 's they are there to trap the sand when it blows up onto the beach the midsection is lower growing shrubs which lifts windblown see or win elevates the wind so thats and can drop out on the frontal june and the hind june area is for larger growth again lifting wind higher and higher above development everything behind it dropping sand on the beach so it 's that what i 'm going to do before i go into a lot of stuff about Collingwood beach is just do a diagram on the board here so that you understand the vegetation patterns of sand you and what we call the sand cycle okay so Collingwood beach has been a part of of that sort of thing the vegetation was destroyed for development development took place no vegetation followed we 've got sand drift inland on the roads development houses so forth and I 'll go through we 've done on Collingwood beach today okay coastline water bottle and we can 't_''_784.86 be seen in cydia June secondary June universe while a large and back off in developing house scene magazine Roz 's VFX creepers flawless rough life down small acacia rosemary courier those sorts of things thank you Sarah here and in Wales you have panties she acts and here we 've done over back 50 years mahogany and account what we have that 's basically said the send you info file which is demonstrated here as well on this on this board and where the positions of the the vegetation route now on this or that shows and that outlines are different vegetation okay what we have then is the same side so we 've won this this this is a failure neural system ok this one and we have same five wishes which basically cuts off their that we 've got the more insane incipient soon and pack up your this this is this area here is the most important part of our sent you a puppy the more sand runs scoring there the scene here will keep accumulating just have that one step I 've worked all the way up on coastline from I with a colleague of mine I 'll kiss you we 're going on coastal eastern coastline from Queensland South Australia and we 've been involved in just about every Arabian fish along that section we don 't know we don 't advise the look pretty much we 're getting vitamins with the eroding month so we said a nasty month generally all sand drift out of s trees rivers any sand is available on the coastline drifts north ok so there 's a chance in hits north and that 's how we get places like crazy over to the table payments and on all the arms around Barrier Reef of all the sand on a sand from new south wales and victoria transport nothing what happens in Jervis Bay we get a little bit of sand offended deserves by as positive and then other features that are on the lead what website from that gets in as well that 's seen it accumulates in these in Sydney a new be building as long as we 've got this vegetation behind it to lift the winds up and drop it down in the front what will happen install of it this is so important we have a storm event we have used waves coming and they 'll bite on to become a nap take it back out into the ocean and create an offshore bar depending on the duration and intensity of the storm event is it turned on how how long is the raison phase of paper and how much sand will take before this option bar when they all sort of us all these waves that are crashing here are broken up in that office or barley and then floating across the and come up here in this bubble on Prop you wouldn 't see that happen when there storm event disappears or the thorn will get that settled several conditions again this week this same as in the cocktail bar gradually come back on shore and the side of humilated on the front of joomla again spinifex prepay about grafton enthalpy drumming kept building and building and to protect it if you haven 't_''_1055.03 got that all they 're saying is that speed drifting slated me and you know it will damage development houses roads what is inside infrastructure so it 's most important that had a vegetative system that here and it 's not it 's a system where you just can 't go glasses because grasses phone call but I 've seen billowing spinifex for instance will only grow or height of about two or three hundred milliliters once that sports and courting saying the same thing 15 straight over ago though this is so important this looks a bit messy do you understand what I 'm talking about ok so this same cycle is just it is so important to our coastline that we keep that all air seen in that area there for some of its form an optional lot and they were my best hotter than a proportion what happened in the 60s not only on Collingwood beach but hundreds of beaches along least in coastline there was not a lot of legislation to do with coastal management was unknown area and local fishing villages and they just had small development development in behind jeans that didn 't get any games they went to too much of a problem when development started like a DD in collingwood beach any man and two other beaches too it 's not just calling the police the the scene started to drift so what happened this is down about Susan street on the downpour incentive this vegetation started to be cleared for development ok development of kollywood there 's a bulldozer in the 60s Susan street goes back through there we 've still got powers in the trees up there but still we 're now this is calling one touch ok it was a safe vegetative seen you once the vegetation went off thats and you we got drifts and going on to the road into houses on the borns people complaining that sandra if they even got up under their ribs on to the ceilings and ceiling started to practice calling and so forth so at that time there were so many so much of this source start happening along the coastline residents and councils system called coastal hazards program established which allowed balance to councils and community groups to do work on this and use to stop this erosion this is a part of hollywood beach after the part of the system started after our revegetation system started so you can see what i 'm talking about this and being walk in that front of generic from time to time it has in the 80s and 90s that and you would have seen it that the beach has taken all that this wack taken for me I shall love spinifex is re-established again the journal system comes back and it 's in it 's in good shape the moment even though I lost a bit of vegetation in places Collingwood Beach attracting heaps and heaps of people so what we 've got up here this is the old photos I book back in the 70s this is where the the developers started in the background ray is covered sand drifting inland escarpment right in front of the houses this was initially stabilized with marram grass which is not a native to Australia and these thing when it 's not a native plant so but in those times if there 's hourly things we use as a primary stabilizer to stop Sandra 's going and when but work wonderful because you could plant shrubs in behind the pump some air and grass and they generate Monroe that 's it back then that 's it now so if you 've still got that spinifex I 've got vegetation behind that 's it again today and I took these photos just the other day of pulling the bridge what so the castle has a passage program like a budget of money for office to get going calling all the beach even though it wasn 't palvin a june care group was one of the first junior groups established in New South Wales so the residents of Ridley 's houses that was getting swamp ass and they form their own black players group and lend a hand to prefecture questions there 's probably still some around four of us would there were some other people that helped the students organized they work their butts off and they 'll after this initial works and everything that was for me there 's brushes and booklets printed on the colleague Hollywood bleach was one of them I suppose what you call a highlighter russ generation area all the South character so it 's one of them the nastiest ones that happened even though we had some bad ones we didn 't get a lot of their sandwich as bad as he is going into houses the North case lost few houses in putting that in 60s and 70s due to generation following all this was a few by saying pamphlets and booklets put out from colleagues I work with which was subpoenaed a heated milk SP one 's called the Coral Beach story which is basically what I 'm talking about now and the other one is calling would be CH 10 years on so it sort of talked about the ten years our through the through the 80s and how how its established help us going I 'll show you a graph a survey draft shortly before it closed up and here today we have a stable system in good even though jervis bay is pretty well protected from lots of coastal storms and once it 's direct into the southeastern switch we get through the winter so they 're the ones that really foggy okay so are the Nor 'easters we 're getting some were not so bad unless you have got a northern facing fix like a coral the other one that talks a lot of the immature did enough in New South Wales Northern facing is done lost it it 's up north case best but it 's um its northern facing the same as carillon victory two all of the summer erosion we nearly always get winter age and so today we 've got a stable system and what we knew what we hope to do in the future on calling the beach this group that you 've established is what we 've done here we reshape this speech speech system here had a conference the same as what we 're doing here revegetate at that area the groups of commandant kids and everybody else and planted the system out this this speech here is actually nursery that I managed to provide packages for coastal restoration so what we do here was some we get orders from loading beaches of coastline and we package them up and send in that particular beach and they carry out their project so June care groups councils national parks deliver i 'll just show you a graph me demonstrate how does it work might be if you have a safer but a lot of people back this is when we serve the work on Collingwood breach in the seventies is one here the Sun 74 so that 's the best offense the picket fence along the back a survey of the Dalton we 've got that 's partly tomato on that to point this line there two mins and this is the erosion Scott when we got all that arose so I went out about five words drops straight off weather storms here and there were 20 minutes in a war profile nothing in a whole stand protecting our agent happens all the time sand drift i dice up the survey in the booklet 10 years on it showed the 's got a nice log seen a few right there a smile and animal incipient in here with specific students no spinifex to you and then down to the water which is for teammates out okay so we 've gone from from basically 10 meters when he moves in the water 40 meters in the world let 's just be survey just last week okay so we go africa same amount of saying you here we go out get food Sibiya to further out a guy so we 've got build up there right up here with a huge false and ring for exporting and because like a vegetation back here we 're going to fit that sand and Sun and that 's a what we have actually done since the storm events and erosion in 72 the mid-seventies to 2014 we 're through sand that consumed with 55 men so this that rat proves the vegetation we put in there is one of them he 's definitely looking into around yeah people do to save another back so whatever I 've done what I would take away from this on be passion about rose and fixing road but what I would take away from here is making Collingwood fetch a strong visual system a nice place to live without roads okay and that may it 's a beauty for mming this group that you 're talking about we can even if if it 's a group of us to get real enthusiastic they can develop plans that they choose to put in the doodle doodle system so we can talk about all the other council of them chairman of their group can talk about that and select plans that will be suitable for that for that system and will work so there 's no thing there 's no sense just saying we 're going to clear it off if that won 't work you 're just going to go back to this so it 's got to be managing the proper way okay so that 's what I 'd go away you 're saying I 'm going to think about managing qualicum are right way and still have an attractive thank you Gary very much I 'd now like professor Colin wardrobe he 's a coastal geomorphologist earth and environmental sciences at the Union he has a PhD in nscd from the University of Cambridge and he has written and co-authored lots of books on our coastline besides that colin has studied the development of coast in Australia and New Zealand as well as overseas including the West Indies and the Indian and Pacific Oceans so I 'll now leave Colin to talk to you about the germ or folly geomorphology of the Jovus pea thank you thanks very much cinnamon my user job is educating the next generation of coastal managers academics environmental consultants and so on to try and explain the sort of things that Gary 's had years and years of experience to usually elektra theatre there 's not as not as full as this so thank you for coming here I 'd like to start by reinforcing some of the points that gary said there first of all to indicate that each beach and June along our coast is it slightly different for the next one there are various types there 's for instance in series of form of beach ridges sequence of bridges is quite an extensive coastal plain there 's some were wearing barrier right down here which is an enormous June we call it a transgressive June but it 's a journey that 's 20 25 30 metres high it 's a very big journal system there are systems that are just a single June and there are systems that are a single June like he recalled burrow which seem to be receding which seemed to be eroding so and we also need to understand what we call coastal compartments that you can identify and this is very nicely shown by Collingwood Beach a beach between a couple of headlands and some beaches are moving sand northwards with with longshore drift particularly those in northern New South Wales others are quite small pocket beaches and some are direct aligned with the incoming swell like Barry Barry am so we can think of these systems here and see that this that each of these systems is slightly different seven mile beach I mentioned which is this broad plain with several ridges the Shoalhaven has been so that that has has contributed sand to the coast jervis bay by contrast has no significant rivers bringing sand into the system so it 's got a fine i 'd imagine sand in it this is a diagram that again Gary will be familiar with it sits in the June barrier there but I want to get difference between an erosion and erosional event and what the system is doing in the longer term so if we look through this line in the middle here you 've got a beach we get one of those big storms that Gary talked about we get a storm cut that sand gets rolled it off moved into a nearshore bar and over the subsequent weeks months apps years San moves back onto the system and if the system is totally balanced it 'll be a stable system but many systems are losing sand in that case they 're going through what we call shoreline recession so the system again the storm cuts brings some sand back we don 't get the before June reconstructed in the same point there 's over the centuries in some systems where there 's a supply of sand the opposite can happen you get the storm cut but in this case over time there 's more sand added and eventually another rich might be formed in some of those systems so each system fits somewhere into these sort of different patterns of how it might behave then of course it 's wave energy which is so important for the erosional storm cut events and this is just a diagram of student put together from the other day indicating that there is wave energy that penetrates into Jervis Bay it 's a relative sheltered location but nevertheless when you get those big events as we 've we know from what Gary said we do get erosion tickly over here on this western side and the western side of Collingwood Beach sits on the front of one of those barrier systems it 's covered by houses now but suspect there are series of subtle ridges through before you get into munaruna creek in the moment creek system and so gary is very competently covered of course the but in 1974 I wasn 't here some of you were but cut back here 's an example of what happened in kilala where it cut six or nine meters into some of the designated plots there collingwood beecher so i read that half a public reserve but 30 meters wide was eroded away garrison cook covered some of the recovery since then and particularly the the community efforts to replant and i thought a particularly telling little little quote came from that paper by peter davies about Collingwood beach in 1978 there was another fairly major storm and it cut back and at that stage and gary was probably evolved in it there have been revegetation of part of the system with marram grass interestingly and following that here 's a quote from what peter Davey said Deborah left by wave action indicated the waves have penetrated about 10 meters into the shaped and planted area that 's the managed area damage to this area was negligible however the untreated section of beach suffered further erosion to a significant extent so a very practical example just recording back there that had been some work to put that vegetation the marram grass planting in particular was already that area suffered negligible erosion compared with the area that hadn 't that was still loose sand and eroded much further so like to now in the case of New South Wales we have a nificent data set from down near Moruya where there 's a beach that has been studied systematically over 40 years now and so it 's the system underneath the marula airstrip actually this is a lidar image airborne lidar that can give us a really good picture of the topography and it shows but there 's a sequence of ridges beat ridges that have built up at that system there this is that 's the beach this is various surveys like very talked about over the years and this is the history of what 's happened and if you can see this I 'm sorry something made up quite a bit this is 9 and 74 the two big storms cut back they cut about 200 cubic meters for every meter of beach face so they cut the then here 's that 1978 storm a game that cut back so this scarf but you can see now or it 's vegetated but there 's the remnants of that where that beach cut back to in 1978 and since then it 's taken well nearly 10 years to build back to its same position and since then its fluctuated there have been some storms that have cut it back with nothing as big as those 1974 storms so this is our one of our greatest insights into the wave of beaches particularly more open ocean beaches behavioral on that coast so what do we need to try and understand what 's going to happen on a beach like Collingwood well we would ideally try and estimate the sediment budget where is the sand and where is any additional sound coming from or going to so the sound can well it could be eroded from cliffs or it could be delivered by rivers that isn 't happening in Jervis Bay so we 're either interested in the exchange that 's coming out of the bay itself onto the system or you misfortune has been built on so that we 've lost that source during storms of of sanli can come back into the system we could get some institute production but she 'll isn 't particularly a major part of this beach sand it 's we 're dealing with that finite amount of of beach sand we don 't have a river bringing sand in moon a moon a creek won 't be bringing any sand in it might actually be a sink for some sound so I might actually get moved into the notes of this end but it might get moved in to that system and so I have seen some questions about is there a source of sand if you wanted to put more sand on the beach essentially we don 't know but there 's not many opportunities for more sand to come into the system in that system I thought I 'd just show you some results or research students involved within kilala beach not far away of course again there 's a subtle system of reach ridges that that makes up kilala beach sarah have been sampling that here 's a survey across that that shows very subtly in fact you can see that when you 're in there you can 't actually see these ridges but there are these subtle ridges and this is an example of ground penetrating radar so we 've gone across that the here 's the bay here in coming over that little first for june region and this we can pick up some of the indications of the former shape of beaches no suspect with no way of really confirming this major feature is that scarf cut in 1974 so in koala it 's probably built this amount of sand up since then so we 're in a system where we should emphasize that we can expect again to see a storm at least as big as 1974 perhaps bigger we can also anticipate that the sea is going to rise I 'm sure you want some real figures on on that right and here 's a somewhat controversial pattern that was produced a few years ago indicating the sea was rising but a sort of curve through you can see that the trend this is the Sydney and this is for Newcastle has been going up still more recent evidence for chem low tide gauge just down the road from me indicating a pattern of sea level rise which is pretty consistent with what we think the global rate of sea level rise is has been is the moment so C appears to be rising pretty much a rate of three millimeters per year that 's going to exacerbate all of the coastal hazard problems that we have already here are the IPCC projections or how to see will the best projection we can get for how it might respond in the future it depends on particularly how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere but you may probably aware that council is going through with Europe adalah an exercise of revisiting what would be the most realistic projections the sea level rise in this region it seems very unlikely it 's going to differ from what the state government told us a few years ago so we must anticipate that there will be a gradual rise of the century and that of course it 's just going to exacerbate the problems that are there so if i can make five points i guess in summary of what i 've said first of all beaches are dynamic you may think that in Jervis Bay were a bit more sheltered but they 're still experienced significant erosion it 's all back in the 70s those large storms that occurred in the 70s we will get that we don 't know what the recurrence interval of that is of this is one in a hundred year storm one in a 30 year storm on a 50-year storm but a storm of that size will occur again it a bigger store will occur at some stage so we need to appeal be aware of that there 's already infrastructure of course on these June 's and behind them that 's already at risk I think we have to say within the terms of the hazards that we can envisage recurring sea level rise will exacerbate those hazards and June vegetation is one I think underestimated strategy in terms of adaptation hazards that are along this coast see you all there another I saw some report that was produced that word estimated the cost to put a Seewald along Collinwood beach but i must say that i 'm sure there 's many people in the room here that would rather see a natural beach than one with solid protection so that 's my contribution thank you very much if anybody has any further questions of colin there will be opportunity later on to speak to colin and the other two members of the expert panel so i will just move on now to introducing our third and final presenter here today and that 's Gabriel Katrina Gabrielle 's the acting manager of the Illawarra region of the office of environment and hearing heritage when she 's not acting in that regional manager role Gabriella 's senior team leader of water flood plains and coast so she is responsible for the local delivery of the New South Wales Government school management program and her team works closely with councils to implement sustainable management responses to coastal issues Gabrielle has been involved in nearly 15 years and she also spent two happy years living in a house song Collingwood beach some years ago so I welcome Gabrielle thank you yes hello I 'm a bit shorter than the others thank you so I 'm not quite an expert in the scale of Gary or Colin that I can talk to you about the legislation and how it relates to how we manage Collingwood beach so I 'm aware that it 's a bit of a try topics I 'll try and keep it as briefly brief as I can so I 'll talk about the coastal zone management framework that we have and a little bit about how the new south wales government supports councils to implement management of the coastline within that framework and then talk about a couple of issues related to how the frameworks changing at the moment and that 's referred to as the stage one and two coastal reforms so in relation to legislation there 's a whole list of legislation that determines you know the framework in which council can make decisions when they 're responding to act which was brought out in 1979 in response to all of those events that gary was talking about with the erosion up and down the coast the local government act affects how council can manage the land also the environmental planning and assessment act and the crown land to act and coincidentally all of this legislation is being reviewed by the New South Wales Government at the moment so we 're in a bit of a space at the moment where there 's a lot of consultation happening with councils about you know how that frameworks working for them and seeking input as the New South Wales Government reviews the framework that 's there underneath the the range of axes are there there 's a whole lot of regulations and the most relevant one being the coastal protection regulations and then once you 've got that overriding framework you 've got a range of policies including the New South Wales coastal policy state environmental planning policies relating to coastal protection and infrastructure a whole host of guidelines that various state government departments department of planning and environment and office government act there 's a section 7 33 which provides indemnity for local government if they operate in accordance with some of those guidelines that the state government has identified so so there 's really quite a close relationship between the New South Wales Government and councils in managing these things so rather than go through the whole list of you know acts and regulations and policies and all of that I thought I 'd just focus on the objectives of the coastal protection act because it really clarifies the whole range of issues that need to be considered when you 're making management decisions because all of the other bits of coastal protection legislation really hinge off that that act so the objects of the coastal protection act are to provide for the protection of the coastal environment of the state for the benefit of both present and future generations so I 've just highlighted the important points i think there so we have to protect the coastal environment and we have to bear in mind it 's for the whole population and the population now and into the list of things you know in more detail so we need to protect enhance maintain and restore the environment of the coastal region and so that relates to ecosystems ecological processes Biological Diversity and water quality so up front we 've got to consider all those environmental values then we also need to encourage promote and secure the orderly and balanced utilization and conservation of the coastal region and natural resources while having regard to the principles of ecologically sustainable development so there 's an acknowledgement that the coast is there to be used so we 're looking at the orderly and balanced utilization of the coast as well as the conservation of the resources that are on the coastline and ecological ecologically sustainable development is a term that 's commonly used in legislation to to you know give awareness that you know you need to consider the whole range of issues of environmental issues alongside social impacts and economic issues as well so the next one is to recognize and foster the significant social and economic benefits to the state that result from a sustainable coastal environment so that you know Shoalhaven has such a massive tourism industry that really hinges on the natural environments that you 've got including the coastline so I think it 's an acknowledgement of the economic value of having a sustainable coastline for also other industries that you have as well but also the social side of it and that includes cultural issues about you know the cultural connection people have with the coastline as well we also need to promote public pedestrian access to the coastal region and recognize recognize the public 's right to access so this is a really important one that comes in to play in places where erosions an issue because we have property boundaries that are fixed lines and then we have a coastline that that 's movable and we have this legislative framework that says we need to preserve the public 's right to access the coastline so we actually have an obligation to try and maintain an area in front of private properties that is accessible to the public so that everyone can benefit from the coast and to recognize the role of the community the protection of the coastal environment so that 's a big push for the New South Wales Government now and has been for quite a long time is really you know focusing on on empowering local communities to input to the decision making and where possible to make the decisions themselves so forums such as this and then to encourage them from promote plans and strategies for adaptation in response to coastal climate change impacts including projected sea level rise so within the new south wales government legislation councils required to consider the potential impacts of sea level rise any of their management decisions that they make and then to promote promote beach amenity so acknowledging that you know people want to be able to recreate on beaches so to implement this legislation and to work within it the New South Wales Government through the office of environment and heritage provider a whole range of support to councils we have the coastal management program which involves funding as well as technical assistance to councils and that 's the program under which some of the coastal and estuary natural resource and with that shoalhaven council runs that they 're partly you know operating within the framework that we 've set up to implement coastal management funding we have usually in the order of you know around four million dollars a year to assist councils to do coastal management along the coast and councils contribute dollar for dollar for those for that funding we also collect a whole range of data that can be that 's applied information that councils needs so oh eh has a science division that collects data about a whole range of environmental issues but there 's a dedicated coastal section of that and there they operate under a knowledge strategy that we input to by saying you know these are the questions that councils are facing and this is the information they need to underpin their decisions so we 're actively trying to make sure that there 's a science evidence basis for for the work that we do on the coast and MHL is the mainly hydraulics laboratory which operates a whole suite of data collection programs including you know things that measure water Heights and management as well so we 've got the guidelines for preparing coastal zone management plans and the coop Shoalhaven coastal zone management plans being referred to a couple of times already today that 's in draft form at the moment so the guidelines identify you know some minimum requirements for what the coastal zone management plans should address and then it sort of just ensures it provides a frame it provides a sort of a skeleton of what we need to consider if you 're going to do coastal zone management and then councils can build on that according to their local needs and in criteria there we 've also got the New South Wales Government coastal June management manual which so the the guidelines for the coastal zone management plan that applies to like sort of Shia wide coastal zone management plans and the coastal June management manual is really a how-to guide once you get down to the level of something like Collingwood beach if you want to put fences in you want to put in vegetation and that sort of thing it 's sort of a best following all of the work that Gary and others did through the 70s and 80s and 90s and it drew on all the lessons learned from that work and Gary contributed to it and it really was to encapsulate the best practice for doing January vegetation and rehabilitation and protection and councils are still using that today because it 's it 's really it 's still the best practice guide for that type of work so I mentioned earlier that we have the current legislation but all of the legislation 's under review at the moment so the stage one coastal reforms happened a couple of years ago the key elements involved amendments to the act relating to temporary coastal protection works which relate to you know if there 's a storm event and that sort of thing to protect your properties from that it included new guidelines that it 's be prepared by the Department of Planning environment to clarify notations on section 149 certificates so about sea level rise potentially affecting properties and they 're in they 've been and draft form and been out for consultation it so it 's been mentioned earlier as well the state government previously had a sea level rose policy statement that identified projected sea level rises for by 2050 and 2100 but there was a range of issues around how it was being applied that was proving problematic but after the New South Wales chief scientist and engineer did an assessment of the science behind the sea level rise planning benchmarks which is what they were called she found that the way that the science had been used to determine the benchmarks was adequate given the current level of knowledge so if the benchmarks were removed not because it wasn 't based on sound science but just because of practical implementation issues that were that were happening at the time so some other issues in relation to stage one coastal reforms we undertook to develop a coastal hazard mapping god which we 're working on at the moment we carried out a business case for independent coastal advice centre and the investigative whether that was a better option than providing their oah technical advice we deferred certification of coastal zone management so the the New South Wales Environment Minister can certify coastal zone management plans to give them to give councils that indemnity under Section 733 that I mentioned earlier but we 're looking at that decision we 're reviewing whether we might start certification again and we undertook to provide some fact sheets on the role of SES and councils during Eurasian events and state emergency service is doing that and we establish the coastal ministerial task force and coastal expert panel to contribute to the stage to coaster reforms so the stage to costa reforms are currently being worked on the main aim with the stage to costa reforms is in to integrate coastal natural resource and hazard management with the local government crown land and planning reviews that are underway so the list of legislation that i had up at the at the start that is all being reviewed at such an opportunity for us to make sure that it all works in well together and a lot of the management issues that you have on the coastline you you could avoid by having effective planning up front to review it in accordance with the planning stuff planning legislation we 're looking at refining how coastal hazards are notated on section 149 certificates to make sure it 's relevant and accurate we 're looking to provide improved support to implement and fund fund coastal zone management plans so we 're investigating a whole range we talked earlier about the potential sea wall along Collingwood beach and other places and how expensive it is so we 're looking at a lot of coastal zone management plans have a range of management options identified that are quite expensive and currently there isn 't a way a mechanism to fund them to either the construction or the ongoing maintenance so it 's it 's looking at a range of different funding options that might make these things a feasible management option and the stage to Costa reforms will be developed in consultation with the coastal expert panel that I mentioned earlier so that 's probably enough about legislation _"

    "text": "but thank you for coming on tonight appreciates come out today but it 's really important to us to kind of get your feedback on whether studies progressing we run through what 's going to be coming up but a part of its going to be looking at some really Geisha not in to assess so kind of gain your feedback on how propria you think they are is any others you 'd like us to look how us and really important feedback that we really appreciate so I 'll run through a quick summary of the project couple of new basis just to get a background on what study is why we 're doing it in either players are the key things we 're running through tonight other results of the mail app survey that missing will we ask your input a number of factors in studying so we 'll be running through typical responses and kind of what we 'd be able to learn from your feedback we receive and the other main thing is the blood management option was of which there 's a poster of the bit of a variable in one day to what they are and the effect that they have on the body then we 'll just quickly touch on what 's comedians and then we 'll have a live a Christian national discussion system figure if it 's anything java density council commissioned this study and they 've engaged Carter employed through partner to your undertake the flooding assessments the office of environment and heritage assistance council providing funding but also through a peer review what we provide the council to make sure that everything 's up to speed and died appropriately I never meant to say father is the community and other agencies involved in the area and this workshop is a way for us to get feedback from you on what we 're looking at any other things you 'd like us to assess as part of the process the floodplain risk management process moves through a number of places and this particular study in point at the end of this one which is the preparation but by risk management studying plan so prior to study in a bit of which defines the existing funny behavior of the lake to Valley region the primary focus this study is to look at flood mitigation options to reduce the flood damages of playing risks the potential experiences and from that will develop the risk management plan which will provide the capsule which will allow them to prioritize playing works it can be implemented in the catchment quick snapshot of the study area we have to look that the entire catchment area but the study is really focusing on the township it 's where the greatest flood risk garbage where the people are is also where the infrastructure is that we experience directly through the planning event so the focus is really leading from the princess highway bridge and then down through now she granted the carrier part number to the entrance and then it also moved up some of the DreamTrips that feed into it 's very free but also result in flooding on access roads or properties this is the second community workshop about the first was back in October that workshop was focused on introduction to the study plants that had a bit of a discussion around the existing funny and I got those slides into this presentation just so you 're aware if you wanted to run through any about game and then bit of a discussion around the mitigation options that were available so and look there any of the options yet there was this kind of brainstorming what would be possible and they 're very flattering at the end there about what the community 's concerns work what kind of playing issues that they had experience that they would like us to take a look at sea we can really get there 's two broad stages of the community consultation stage weighing clinical quality consultations throughout the study and then stage 2 will be a the third workshop which will be held we will fall during the public exhibition of the documents that we prepared the first stage of the community consultation was the mail out which was a brochure in a survey that we sent to all the residents or property owners within the township to ask for their feedback line started funded with witnessed what put in place to help you to get future play so this survey was sent out to about 420 property owners and 200 of those were in the payment for the probable maximum flight extent so these are the properties that if the worst possible flag further don 't experience some kind of the surveys we 've got 144 back which was a regenerative thirty-four percent which is very large we typically get returns for these type of surveys in the order of ten percent so it 's three and a half times larger than what we normally see which which was fantastic horribly hearing hard to a large portion of long-term owns food experience what in Worcester V mia has an into offering like Stevie 's put in place nearly seventy percent of people have been 10 years at 35 more than 20 which is a requirement we asked people to key questions as various the favors one of them was what they 're freely to experience a budding loss and then what they perceived their future risk of planes being and as you might expect the expectation is previous play and that creates a bit of a risk in the fashion be close there hasn 't been a large flood event within the system for quite some time so what we 're looking at here blue shows what people expect they 're flooding to be and the registers what would be or what Fame they would experience in a large flood event so often the two percent of people expected to have a little fun close to twenty percent of those people would experience a flood over the floor of evans and again say much larger portion didn 't expect to be affected by plugging when in fact their properties or their house and it is kinda important for us to know in planning some of the emergency response measures and suggests that people more community engagement or some information transfer from Castle to the community would be abused to make sure that people appreciate blood we also asked people what kind of mitigation strategies they would like to see in place for the magic by far the most popular was imagining the entrance by place key of interested in hard engineering structural things like whether banks or license or web some bits applies much more popular with a management channel improvements which might be clearing out debris through any basics pieces and planting natives so the most channels are better able you 'll see when we have a look at your computer says we have focused on the very banks in Patito in the hundred plus there 's only so much we can do to mitigate flooding it 's really imagine in the entrance in addressing the light just a flag for them so the options we assessed using the flat long will be developed podcasting the options are assessed through a triple bottom line approach looking at the economic environmental and social benefits to make sure that all of these factors are taken into account when assessing our physical or health activities options are broadly speaking there are three categories of options that we look at first is structural options there 's also probably my professional name responsibility patient options these structural options options that change the physical behavior of the flood they might be up the way the floodwaters behave as they move through it sounds you the pictures at the bottom were just to demonstrate their all of levy banks the levees don 't need to be very mean that I need to be very visible but I think I this randomized mr. B go property modification options are options that look at what changes can be made to property to make it more resistant to flame so it could be building them from drug resistant materials so that if the flood comes and the property gets wet it 's not very experienced significant damage it also includes planning controls that catch it as in places to ride and limit development to reduce the plug these those properties and also pass rating extremely open at the bottom voluntary purchase or other options around how we can change the properties to make them more resilient to deployment the final set of options we looked at our emergency response modifications more options and these are options that look at how the community responds during a flood better so if we 're talking before about the difference a good example of this mergency response is educating people want my biscuits from there in a better position to respond appropriately to you also includes flight warning systems transfer of information in the data that we developed to the SES to help them plan their response to your fun events when is the answer we 're going to run through structural options that we 've assessed using a pro model there 's a range of one 's available so that is Road raising some vegetation management view of the previous dredging in a couple of different locations as well as entrance management you 'll notice as we go through you 'll see that the options to implement don 't really have a very wide impact on the whitefly behavior and it 's largely due to the fact that the works that we 're putting in place are on the fringes of the flood so it 's not really but uh effects the main flood there 's not really a large main flow on let 's leave that one an upstream or downstream impacts so immune from in a levee of the floodplain this they 're very localized changes this is all this is just a quick snapshot of what the difference flood levels are within the township very expense you mean that from the twenty percent annual exceedence probability which is a twenty percent chance of a flood of this magnitude occurring in any one year up to a one-percent analytical abilities are one percent chance at that point very there is not a great deal of difference so the levee banks that we 've looked at are in the order of a five percent to a two percent level having but this room so we 're going to take another look at them as to what the impacts might be relieved at the mouth to provide additional protection you 'll also see that the options that we implement are going to remove all of the flood risk so the probable maximum player is substantially higher than the others so being aware the funny business is still going to be important because we aren 't going to be able to remove all the fun reasons for the tension the rear of the properties many of the downstream of the breach silo when you put the levee at the twenty percent level one of the lower levels mainly because in the best larger than this there is flow over the pacific highway into this properties there 's a risk of dental filling up can we put a levee around the wood that was to your life I still a substantial items 1.2 meters but it does remove all the flooding within that area in smaller events the whole scale is the greens recruit in the Blues are adverse impacts does i say there 's no despite the blackboard is moving this way we 're not seeing any backing out any but literally picked up strength of a very large live recordings it 's being constructed at bridges majority without very similar let me along the creek side orbit way we 're instructors lining to a higher event the one percent annual exams probability doesn 't have to be as high the terrain is already a bit higher in size of the order of a half a meter which could be the road in the end prevent any wedding of those properties all the rows June events of play significant the caravan park is an area that we recognize as high risk partly because the first thing to be innovative in a flood is the roadway so they lose their access before they 're aware that their situs money and secondly because those chances are the large number of people who are familiar with the catchment being in there who aren 't going to know what flood arrests are or how to respond appropriately so one of the options that we looked at was raising the level of the access road so the overtopping depths were 20 centimetres in the one percent of it this is a limit for the safe travel of vehicles so up to that flood that allows people to drive Adam caravan park and not be trapped didn 't have any impact on the fighting behavior I gained put us at a flat Ridge but it is a good option for using the funny risk similarly we looked at raising the level of the how to prevent highway properties gasps drink and also provides access during a flood of it should we know that it 's still limited access that allow you to move along this ridge of road but during a flood is highly likely that road access for the north end for the South they 're going to be tight so places to evacuate to astoria it resulted in some increases upstream of the road racing because it was preventing as much water washing over that water is now building up behind the res roadway it 's not a particularly been challenged 3 centimeters and where does impact on properties there might be options that we could look at a local levee to predict those properties from any of those places we look at a series of levy scenarios for Lemon treatment to protect the properties in that area that experience budding when quick burst its banks the area is quite low it 's quite flat so when the creek s2r it washes out but a large area we have looked at lives up to around the two percent level but ever so there 's pipes or something the wagon up look that is if we could get away with potentially moving in a bit higher and to provide additional protection for this scenario is that a point eight amino rides and you can see in this case there are some upstream impacts as a result of the flow being retained action with 11 which is the light blue in your a couple of centimeters and it 's not impacting any development so that might be attention in the same area I 'm just protecting a different block of projects so it 's a levee along along the creek as well as some local road racing to prevent any that overland flow coming across through the houses and through the properties again some asteroid impacts and these ones do impact properties to the west as you can see which might mean if this is an option that we look at implementing it 's going to need to include the previous levy scenario to provide protection to those properties on the west and again this is primary of an arrow out left with two cribs me the river houses along the creeks edge to prevent any flows coming in from the cream as well as some local road raising to eventually flows back watering around from further upstream the road raising music 20 to 60 centimeters but the levee fighters have been more substantial and again it has some impact on the flow and upstream along to Barry Barry but again they 're relatively minor just as the middle to a lot of things that we could look at to mitigate those impacts vegetation management is a broad term in a kind of covers a range of options that improve the ability of a creek to convey flow so I could be removing any fallen trees or large pieces of debris there 's any buildup of rubbish your foreign invasive species on the banks we could look at however it is not having a great benefit it 's not reducing any of the upstream levels but the ease of water trailer down the creek now results in increase it downstream so from a reduction of flood damages or flood risk point of view is not really benefit from dredging the saltwater crate do you resolve in flood illiberal reductions upstream but they 're not benefiting any properties assist in open space by the time actually reaches where residential development is occurred there 's no change in the big puddles there and similarly by land water to flow more for the guy a professor minor impacts downstream so again if knocking that 's not really going to realize any benefit in terms of my challenges we looked at dredging in a couple of locations one of them was immediately upstream of the entrance let me have a look at the information that we had there was a substantial layer of sediment immediately upstream of the entrance and the port drop down to the correct level a second location was up towards the bridge gasps from of the lake again there is quite a lot of sediment in that region and that means some suggestions are taking it out might help to improve flooding conditions from our assessment we didn 't see any change in the flooding there was a slight change to the way the entrance opened a little bit wider a little bit deeper as a result of removing that material made of the upstream good but it didn 't translate into any reduction in b-flat levels so again from a flood damages point of view from a brisket point of view the dredging it 's very brief is really going to realize anybody else we also had a look at an open entrance scenario so permanently opening the late entrance see what happened dude briefing session of the first workshop around the different funding mechanisms and internship experiences we 've won mean from attachment clothes the flow from the Gulf Stream cashman three degrees in the second being an ocean driven flood event with a flood tons in from the ocean and back surgeries so you do the opening the entrance is yellow line these are benefit for those attachment driven events so when the ocean is low the entrance is open those catchment events were allowed to watch out to see much more effectively but he doesn 't have any impact on those ocean through the defense the wound is still just Compton is reduction in the flooding risks doesn 't really give you very much benefit I 'm still going to be at risk from those ocean driven flow events yeah this is what we found it 's also worth knowing that the levy options will also provide some resistance to the low level assistant flooding where their levels just creep up and up and up and up when the entrance is closed they might also give you some flexibility and looking at alternative trigger levels for when the entrance might be able to the by putting the letters in place you might allow the creek to build up higher before you officially open the entrance and it 's also worth knowing that what has jumped the next slide combat something else that we 're having to look at are the impacts that are resulting from climate change so the levees will help a little bit as the sea levels rise but you see the sea 2050 and 2100 scenarios a substantially different to the base case which I suppose makes things have been tricky in terms of implementing these options but if fighting now in 20 or 30 years you may just have to do it again because the system is just for isn 't that much fire so as well as looking at lifting some of those options to hire existing levels will also have a look at what would happen it related to say 2050 level which we then provide flooding Protection Act at that time for us just back to the previous you can soon the show you that the central lock this one here is the 22 cents while roketa y5y urban unrest occasions for 2015 which is the live load the new place and new 15 year band and then is very similar to what your current one which suggests your climate change when you get 2015 you wanted five so in that features put in place options that are robust enough to remain in place under changing cockroaches from those options that we looked at we undertake a benefit-cost analysis which allows us to a look at how effective these options are reducing the damages that the township experience so our benefits are the reduction in option in place and we look at this for a range of fun events from the small frequent ones that the larger rarer ones in we weigh that against the costs which are the initial construction costs as well as an ongoing maintenance cost and benefit costs way these out and what we want to see in the benefit cost ratio column is something greater than 1 this says that the benefits we realize from that option a greater the costs of implementing the option and from the structural options that we looked at the only one would be that was at last Libby option which protected that ring of properties in the confluence of lemon tree frequency iron the princes highway very rapidly made a couple of the other ones because they were delivering benefits in frequent flooding events over the long term they are more expensive to build and they were what more expensive to build than these savings that they delivered in terms of like angels the economics is not the only thing that we look at we also looked at the social and the environmental benefits a multi-criteria assessment where each of these options is of water to score for their economic effectiveness their social effectiveness and their environmental effectiveness and all of those laws are added up to give an overall ranking as to how efficient and how effective that option is so a good example of why wouldn 't a business estimate is the raising of the caravan park road it 's not going to prevent flood damage is occurring outside but it does reduce the flooding risk of the site by allowing people to safely evacuate you in a fight and it 's those kind of things that this assessment example so we 're in the process of undertaking this at the moment it will be in the final report and something that will discuss in the final workshop so the next steps are completing this assessment of the mitigation options having a look at raising some of those levees having to look at how it can make these options more resilient to future commissioners then taking that multi-criteria assessment having a look at how these options may improve things socially or environmentally and provide them to counter with a review and at that time we 'll have a third workshop we will protect the final findings and discussion around the methodologies that we 've used in the multi criteria assessment to make sure that we 're giving each of those things the weight that you think it support so thank you for listening quietly to all of that now I said yeah pass it back to any questions you might poke you _"

the roads are vital because neither main transport links throughout the vineyard proceed the existing Road out here was on quite a narrow and didn 't have any amenity for pedestrians or cyclists wine country roads have been behind the eight ball for many years if you think of the success of the hunter expressway and racing years which was nearly a two billion dollar project we got the funds they 've got a bill to ventually and it 's made such a difference here in broke Road it 's going to make such an important difference not just for the locals who obviously will benefit for them Mia normal tourists that come to the region every year and we as originated showcase a region we need to have the right road system to underpin and support that growth it 's just such a good thing for white come from territory once the project is scope that once you process survey geotech flora and fauna and once we have that information we then go through a design process the process of preparing a set of plans to allow the construction to happen to manage the project council formed a project control group an RMS were an important team member in that project control group this is a very large twin roundabout construction the existing intersection here was an offset tiered had a very small construction footprint compared to the new roundabout treatment when we 've done the environmental assessment we 've identified habitat trees and important arm flora and fauna we 've had to maintain in the design process we 've actually adjusted the designer we maximize the amount of native vegetation so you drive along the roads here and they got the canopy of trees we want to really maintain that for this project we had on some really key criteria wanted to address and they were making sure we delivered a really high quality product we also want the project to have a real improvement in road user safety and and the intersections that we 've upgraded and into the future and also through peak events to physically fit these two roundabouts here we 've had to relocate a significant amount of services we relocated power gas optic barber Telstra and also water so it 's been a significant exercise just to get those services relocated and clear of our construction zone without instructions it 's a big undertaking from a council point of view being if the quantity of concrete and mounted concrete the majority of the vineyard rates projects been completed by council in house construction crews i 'm using council cruz has given us a lot of flexibility and undertake the construction we 've been out of work around service relocations work around the events that happen in the area of lifestyle month i 've been team leader on this project for the last two years it 's been a great experience for good asset to the council that we could tackle the projects again and prove to the rms that we are capable of doing this proper work the biggest achievement we 've had on this project is construction of the concrete roundabouts exercise on these roundabouts to determine the best roundabout treatment not just based on price we consider other criteria such as safety community perception and how the vehicles will work around the round of it we 've upgraded the road Lane width to three knife meters which is the standard for this kind of volume in this point of speed environment we 've also provided our on-road cycleway in certain sections to ensure that pedestrians and cyclists can use the road at the roundabout here we 've actually got off road south away and pedestrian access so that people can move through the intersection I 'm really safely it 's also something that 's going to reduce our maintenance costs in the long run because we 've designed and built something it 's color we 've undertaken the construction using RMS quality assurance specifications and that 's ensured a really hard for ya I 'm really proud of that there was opportunity it delivers for the community safety and turns it in through travel both the visitor and the locals will see a vast improvement I think the community are feedback we 've received we 've seen a noticeable decline in complaints coming to council about the condition of the road so that 's been really the team that was created internally works really well and teamwork played an important part in being able to achieve and deliver on time on budget into a very very high quality the team have managed to do that keeping communication open letting the community know what 's happening when it 's happening so we 've been able to dovetail into the events to the hell here in the vineyards and working with businesses and property owners to ensure that disruptions are minimized as the council we 're so proud of our team that 's been on this project the spirit of the team has been really strong and this has been a key contributor to success I think we 're all very proud of the work that the staff we 've done and the men here on site have just been exemplary they 've just shown incredible dedication to getting the job done and producing a high quality result in our mayor would to see a good result from when you can get funds in to build important infrastructure that our region so much needs I 'd also like to think that it 's a stepping stone that this is a step in the right direction we know it 's tough for local councils to fund that so we encourage state and federal government to understand that this is a good project and what do you know when you get good right infrastructure it 's safer it reduces congestion and we 'll get many more people to come and visit one country region you _"
